process that is suitable for simple modeling, in which basic physical
principles can be profitably employed. This study connects two different
domains: the fast motion of macroscopic bodies in resistant media and the
interaction of charged subatomic particles with matter at high energies, which
furnish the two limit cases of the problem of penetrating projectiles of
different sizes. These limit cases actually have overlapping applications; for
example, in space physics and technology. The intermediate or mesoscopic domain
finds application in atom cluster implantation technology. Here it is shown
that the penetration of fast nano-projectiles is ruled by a slightly modified
Newton's inertial quadratic force, namely, $F \sim v^{2-\beta}$, where $\beta$
vanishes as the inverse of projectile diameter. Factors essential to
penetration depth are ratio of projectile to medium density and projectile
shape.

parity nonconservation. The dominating contribution to the weak quadrupole is
given by the quadrupole moment of the neutron distribution, therefore,

asymmetries and effective radii are distributed identically to those of massive
galaxies at $z\sim2$. We conclude that our sample is not preferentially
associated with mergers, though a significant merger fraction is still
plausible. Instead, we propose that our sample are examples of the massive
galaxy population at $z\sim2$ that harbor a briefly luminous, ""flickering"" AGN,

AGN, and/or the earliest formation stages of a bulge in an inside-out manner.
Furthermore, we find that the mass assembly of the central black holes in our

that our sample represent a small fraction of the immediate antecedents of

Maxwell's equations. When the frequencies of light waves, Langmuir waves, and
single-particle cyclotron motion are scaled to be asymptotically large, the
two-fluid Maxwell system becomes a fast-slow dynamical system. This fast-slow
system admits a formally-exact single-fluid closure that may be computed
systematically with any desired order of accuracy through the use of a
functional partial differential equation. In the leading order approximation,
the closure reproduces magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Higher order truncations of
the closure give an infinite hierarchy of extended MHD models that allow for
arbitrary mass ratio, as well as perturbative deviations from charge
neutrality. The closure is interpreted geometrically as an invariant slow
manifold in the infinite-dimensional two-fluid phase space, on which two-fluid
motions are free of high-frequency oscillations. This perspective shows that
the full closure inherits a Hamiltonian structure from two-fluid theory. By
employing infinite-dimensional Lie transforms, the Poisson bracket for the
all-orders closure may be obtained in closed form. Thus, conservative
truncations of the single-fluid closure may be obtained by simply truncating
the single-fluid Hamiltonian. Moreover, the closed-form expression for the
all-orders bracket gives explicit expressions for a number of the full
closure's conservation laws. Notably, the full closure, as well as any of its
Hamiltonian truncations, admits a pair of independent circulation invariants.

particular task, which often makes them large and expensive to run---especially
with respect to the easier examples, which might require much less computation.
For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all""
approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples,
while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single,
fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller
which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over
predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more
economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free
reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the
optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each
iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models,
action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful
for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel
with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were
trained with ""interaction networks"" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models,
our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under
complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of
computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to
choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and
individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to
achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more
traditional fixed policy approaches. These results demonstrate that our
approach is a powerful framework for using rich forward models for efficient
model-based reinforcement learning.

much resources have become a desired feature in the area of workload management

scheduling a workload which part could be unreliable. This unreliability could
be caused by various types of failures or attacks. Our framework for robust
workload scheduling efficiently combines classic fault-tolerant and security
tools, such as packet/job scanning, with workload scheduling, and it does not
use any heavy resource-consuming tools, e.g., cryptography or non-linear
optimization. More specifically, the framework uses a novel objective function
to allocate jobs to servers and constantly decides which job to scan based on a
formula associated with the objective function. We show how to set up the
objective function and the corresponding scanning procedure to make the system
provably stable, provided it satisfies a specific stability condition. As a
result, we show that our framework assures cloud stability even if naive
scanning-all and scanning-none strategies are not stable. We extend the
framework to decentralized scheduling and evaluate it under several popular
routing procedures.

similar to those in the local part of our Galaxy defined by Jenkins (2009). The
elements Mg and Ti deplete less rapidly in the SMC than in the Milky Way, and
Mn depletes more rapidly. We speculate that these differences might be
explained by the different chemical affinities to different existing grain
substrates. For instance, there is evidence that the mass fractions of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the SMC are significantly lower than
those in the Milky Way. We propose that the depletion sequences that we

driven using a recently-demonstrated lattice-modulation technique to perform
Doppler-free spectroscopy. The circular-state transition frequency yields
$R_{\infty}$. Laser wavelengths and beam geometries are selected such that the
lattice-induced transition shift is minimized. The selected transitions have no
first-order Zeeman and Stark corrections, leaving only manageable second-order
Zeeman and Stark shifts. For Rb, the projected relative uncertainty of
$R_{\infty}$ in a measurement under the presence of the Earth's gravity is
$10^{-11}$, with the main contribution coming from the residual lattice shift.
This could be reduced in a future micro-gravity implementation. The
next-important systematic arises from the Rb$^+$ polarizability

Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) are essential tools to understand
the earliest epoch of the Milky Way, since they are among the oldest objects in
the Universe and can be used to trace its formation and evolution. Current
studies using high resolution spectroscopy for many stars in each of a large
sample of GCs allow us to develop a detailed observational picture about their
formation and their relation with the Galaxy. However, it is necessary to
complete this picture by including GCs that belong to all major Galactic
components, including the Bulge. Aims. Our aim is to perform a detailed
chemical analyses of the bulge GC NGC 6440 in order to determine if this object
has Multiple Populations (MPs) and investigate its relation with the Bulge of
the Milky Way and with the other Galactic GCs, especially those associated with
the Bulge, which are largely poorly studied. Methods. We determined the stellar
parameters and the chemical abundances of light elements (Na, Al), iron-peak
elements (Fe, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni), $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and heavy
elements (Ba, Eu) in seven red giant members of NGC 6440 using high resolution
spectroscopy from FLAMES@UVES. Results. We found a mean iron content of
[Fe/H]=-0.50$\pm$0.03 dex in agreement with other studies. We found no internal
iron spread. On the other hand, Na and Al show a significant intrinsic spread,
but the cluster has no significant O-Na anticorrelation nor exhibits a Mg-Al
anticorrelation. The $\alpha$-elements show good agreement with the Bulge field
star trend, although they are at the high alpha end and are also higher than
those of other GCs of comparable metallicity. The heavy elements are dominated
by the r-process, indicating a strong contribution by SNeII. The chemical
analysis suggests an origin similar to that of the Bulge field stars.

two-dimensional image-fitting package, and with a new technique to estimate
effective radii from the concentration index (CI) of observed clusters. The
distribution of effective radii from both techniques spans $\sim$0.5-10 pc and
peaks at 2-3 pc for both galaxies. We find slight positive correlations between
effective radius and cluster age in both galaxies, but no significant
relationship between effective radius and galactocentric distance. Clusters in
NGC 1313 display a mild increase in effective radius with cluster mass, but the
trend disappears when the sample is divided into age bins. We show that the
vast majority of the clusters in both galaxies are much older than their

that about half of the clusters in NGC 628 are underfilling their Roche lobes,

some circles as information centrality. This is an important notion of
centrality for undirected networks, with many applications, e.g., for random
walks, electrical resistor networks, epidemic spreading, etc. In this paper, we
first reinterpret this measure in terms of modulus (energy) of families of
walks on the network. This modulus centrality measure coincides with the
effective conductance measure on simple undirected networks, and extends it to
much more general situations, e.g., directed networks as well. Secondly, we
study a variation of this modulus approach in the egocentric network paradigm.
Egonetworks are networks formed around a focal node (ego) with a specific order
of neighborhoods. We propose efficient analytical and approximate methods for
computing these measures on both undirected and directed networks. Finally, we
describe a simple method inspired by the modulus point-of-view, called shell
degree, which proved to be a useful tool for network science.

highest known mass-loss rate. Its dense wind encounters the faster wind
expelled by the companion, dissipating mechanical energy in the shock,
accelerating particles up to relativistic energies and producing high-energy
(HE) {\gamma}-rays. We used the first 7-year data of the Fermi LAT which span
two passages of {\eta} Carinae at periastron. We extracted low and HE light
curves and spectra in different orbital phase bins using the new PASS8
pipeline. We used particle acceleration in hydrodynamic simulations of the
system in a multi-cell geometry and compared the prediction with the
observations. The {\gamma}-ray emission location is compatible with {\eta}
Carinae. Two emission components are distinguished. The low-energy (LE) one
cuts off below 10 GeV and its flux, modulated by the orbital motion, varies by
a factor < 2. Short-term variability occurs at periastron. The HE component
flux varies by a factor 3-4 but differently during the two periastrons. The
variabilities observed at LE and HE during the first half of the observations,
match the prediction of the simulation, assuming a surface magnetic field of
500 G. The HE component and the thermal X-ray emission were weaker than
expected around the second periastron suggesting a modification of the wind
density in the inner wind collision region (WCR). Diffuse shock acceleration in
the WCR provides a convincing match to the observations and new diagnostic
tools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system. Further observations
are required to explain the periastron-to-periastron HE variability and to
associate it firmly with hadronic origin. {\eta} Carinae is a pevatron at
periastron. Its $\nu$ flux can be detected by IceCube after many years of
observations. Orbital modulations of the HE component can be distinguished from
those of photo absorption by CTA.

significant area, power and delay overhead. In this paper, we propose
camouflaging of interconnects using multiplexers (muxes) to protect the IP. A
transistor threshold voltage-defined pass transistor mux is proposed to prevent
its reverse engineering since transistor threshold voltage is opaque to the
adversary. The proposed mux with more than one input, hides the original
connectivity of the net. The camouflaged design operates at nominal voltage and
obeys conventional reliability limits. A small fraction of nets can be
camouflaged to increase the RE effort extremely high while keeping the overhead
low. We propose controllability, observability and random net selection
strategy for camouflaging. Simulation results indicate 15-33% area, 25-44%
delay and 14-29% power overhead when 5-15% nets are camouflaged using the
proposed 2:1 mux. By increasing the mux size to 4:1, 8:1, and 16:1, the RE
effort can be further improved with small area, delay, and power penalty.

spectroscopic studies have confirmed 160 LMSs in the 25 Orionis stellar group
(25 Ori), which is the most prominent overdensity of Orion OB1a. Nonetheless,
the current census of the 25 Ori members is estimated to be less than 50%
complete, leaving a large number of members to be still confirmed. We retrieved
172 low-resolution stellar spectra in Orion OB1a observed as ancillary science
in the SDSS-III/BOSS survey, for which we classified their spectral types and
determined physical parameters. To determine memberships, we analyzed the
H$_\alpha$ emission, LiI$\lambda$6708 absorption, and NaI$\lambda\lambda$8183,
8195 absorption as youth indicators in stars classified as M-type. We report 50
new LMSs spread across the 25 Orionis, ASCC 18, and ASCC 20 stellar groups with
spectral types from M0 to M6, corresponding to a mass range of 0.10$\le
m/\textrm{M}_\odot \le$0.58. This represents an increase of 50% in the number
of known LMSs in the area and a net increase of 20% in the number of 25 Ori
members in this mass range. Using parallax values from the Gaia DR1 catalog, we
estimated the distances to these three stellar groups and found that they are
all co-distant, at 338$\pm$66 pc. We analyzed the spectral energy distributions
of these LMSs and classified their disks by evolutionary classes. Using H-R
diagrams, we found a suggestion that 25 Ori could be slightly older that the
other two observed groups in Orion OB1a.

in assisting wireless communication due to their high maneuverability, flexible
deployment, and low cost. This paper considers a multi-UAV enabled wireless
communication system, where multiple UAV-mounted aerial base stations (BSs) are
employed to serve a group of users on the ground. To achieve fair performance
among users, we maximize the minimum throughput over all ground users in the
downlink communication by optimizing the multiuser communication scheduling and
association jointly with the UAVs' trajectory and power control. The formulated
problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem that is challenging
to solve. As such, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for solving it
by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization
techniques. Specifically, the user scheduling and association, UAV trajectory,
and transmit power are alternately optimized in each iteration. In particular,
for the non-convex UAV trajectory and transmit power optimization problems, two
approximate convex optimization problems are solved, respectively. We further
show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to at least a
locally optimal solution. To speed up the algorithm convergence and achieve
good throughput, a low-complexity and systematic initialization scheme is also
proposed for the UAV trajectory design based on the simple circular trajectory
and the circle packing scheme. Extensive simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the proposed design as compared
to other benchmark schemes.

defined in topological insulators. We calculate the MR of a three-dimensional
topological insulator, by using the semiclassical equations of motion, in which
the Berry curvature explicitly induces an anomalous velocity and orbital

the Fermi energy approaches the band edge. The orbital moment and g factors
also play important roles in the negative MR. Our results give a reasonable

in understanding the anomalous quantum transport in topological states of

its ability to leverage the parallelism inherent to heterogeneous computing
platforms. OpenCL allows programs running on a host computer to launch
accelerator kernels which can be compiled at run-time for a specific
architecture, thus enabling portability. However, the prohibitive compilation
times (specifically the FPGA place and route times) are a major stumbling block
when using OpenCL tools from FPGA vendors. The long compilation times mean that
the tools cannot effectively use just-in-time (JIT) compilation or runtime
performance scaling. Coarse-grained overlays represent a possible solution by
virtue of their coarse granularity and fast compilation. In this paper, we
present a methodology for run-time compilation of OpenCL kernels to a DSP block
based coarse-grained overlay, rather than directly to the fine-grained FPGA
fabric. The proposed methodology allows JIT compilation and on-demand
resource-aware kernel replication to better utilize available overlay
resources, raising the abstraction level while reducing compile times
significantly. We further demonstrate that this approach can even be used for
run-time compilation of OpenCL kernels on the ARM processor of the embedded
heterogeneous Zynq device.

that the western region of the X-ray PWN has a source extent of $15' \times
10'$ with the major axis oriented to that of the TeV emission. The PWN-west
spectrum was closely fitted by a power-law for absorption at $N({\rm H}) =
(8.2^{+1.3}_{-1.1}) \times 10^{21}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ and a photon index of $\Gamma
= 2.05\pm0.12$, with no obvious change in the index within the X-ray PWN. The
measured X-ray absorption indicates that the distance to the source is much
less than $10~{\rm kpc}$ inferred by radio data. Aside from the PWN, no
extended emission was observed around PSR J2021+3651 even by Suzaku. Archival
data from the XMM-Newton were also analyzed to complement the Suzaku
observations, indicating that the eastern region of the X-ray PWN has a similar
spectrum ($N(\rm H)=(7.5 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{21}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ and
$\Gamma=2.03 \pm 0.10$) and source extent up to at least $12'$ along the major

in X-ray are used to constrain the advection velocity or the diffusion
coefficient for accelerated X-ray-producing electrons. A mean magnetic field of
${\sim}3~\mu{\rm G}$ is required to account for the measured X-ray spectrum and
reported TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum. A model calculation of synchrotron
radiation and inverse Compton scattering was able to explain ${\sim}80\%$ of
the reported TeV flux, indicating that the X-ray PWN is a major contributor of

low cost and complexity transceiver design. Currently, polarization domain
resource has been introduced to the single-RF MIMO system to reduce the size of
the transmit antenna array and provide 1 bit per channel use (bpcu)
multiplexing gain. Nevertheless, the polarization domain resource still has the
potential to provide a higher multiplexing gain in the polarized single-RF MIMO
system. In this paper, we propose a generalized polarization shift keying
(PolarSK) modulation scheme for a SIMO system that uses the polarization states
in the dual-polarized transmit antenna as an information-bearing unit to
increase the overall spectral efficiency. At the receive end, the maximum
likelihood (ML) detector is employed to demodulate the received signal. A
closed form union upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of
PolarSK system with the optimum maximum likelihood (ML) receiver is deduced

a linear successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection algorithm and a

energy scales $V^{1/4} \sim 10^{6 \sim 8} \mathrm{GeV}$. If the usual
primordial inflation is followed by thermal inflation, the primordial power
spectrum is only modestly redshifted on large scales, but strongly suppressed
on scales smaller than the horizon size at the beginning of thermal inflation,
$k > k_{\rm b} = a_{\rm b} H_{\rm b}$. We calculate the spectral distortion of
the cosmic microwave background generated by the dissipation of acoustic waves
in this context. For $k_{\rm b} \ll 10^3 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, thermal inflation
results in a large suppression of the $\mu$-distortion amplitude, predicting
that it falls well below the standard value of $\mu \simeq 2\times 10^{-8}$.
Thus, future spectral distortion experiments, similar to PIXIE, can place new
limits on the thermal inflation scenario, constraining $k_{\rm b} \gtrsim 10^3
\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ if $\mu \simeq 2\times 10^{-8}$ were found.

by heterogeneous physical storage media and computing infrastructure that are
managed by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP). To balance the tradeoff between
service performance and cost, CSPs often employ different storage tiers, for
instance, cold storage and hot storage. Storing data in hot storage incurs high
storage cost yet delivers low access latency, whereas cold storage is able to
inexpensively store massive amounts of data and thus provides lower cost with
higher latency. In this paper, we address a major challenge confronting the
CSPs utilizing such tiered storage architecture - how to maximize their overall
profit over a variety of storage tiers that offer distinct characteristics, as
well as file placement and access request scheduling policies. To this end, we
propose a scheme where the CSP offers a two-stage auction process for (a)
requesting storage capacity, and (b) requesting accesses with latency
requirements. Our two-stage bidding scheme provides a hybrid storage and access
optimization framework with the objective of maximizing the CSP's total net
profit over four dimensions: file acceptance decision, placement of accepted
files, file access decision and access request scheduling policy. The proposed
optimization is a mixed-integer nonlinear program that is hard to solve. We
propose an efficient heuristic to relax the integer optimization and to solve
the resulting nonlinear stochastic programs. The algorithm is evaluated under
different scenarios and with different storage system parameters, and
insightful numerical results are reported by comparing the proposed approach
with other profit-maximization models. We see a profit increase of over 60% of
our proposed method compared to other schemes in certain simulation scenarios.

ensemble that provide a flexible and effective predictor for predicting

speaking, the integral-turnpike property means that the time average of the
distance from any optimal trajectory to the turnpike set con- verges to zero,
as the time horizon tends to infinity. Then, we establish the measure-turnpike
property for strictly dissipative optimal control systems, with state and
control constraints. The measure-turnpike property, which is slightly stronger
than the integral-turnpike property, means that any optimal (state and control)
solution remains essentially, along the time frame, close to an optimal
solution of an associated static optimal control problem, except along a subset
of times that is of small relative Lebesgue measure as the time horizon is
large. Next, we prove that strict strong duality, which is a classical notion

we conclude the paper with several comments and open problems.

measurements. As characteristic for weakly hybridized Ce and Yb systems, the PE
spectra reveal a 4f-derived Fermi level peak, which reflects contributions from
the Kondo resonance and its crystal electric field (CEF) satellites. In YbNiSn
this peak has an unusual temperature dependence: With decreasing temperature a
steady linear increase of intensity is observed which extends over a large
interval ranging from 100 K down to 1 K without showing any peculiarities in
the region of T_K ~ TC= 5.6 K. In the light of the single-impurity Anderson
model (SIAM) this intensity variation reflects a linear increase of 4f
occupancy with decreasing temperature, indicating an onset of Kondo screening
at temperatures above 100 K. Within the PAM this phenomenon could be described
by a non-Fermi liquid like T- linear damping of the self-energy which accounts
phenomenologically for the feedback from the closely spaced CEF-states.

case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, a common point between all these schemes is

interpolation method developped by Guerra and Toninelli in the context of spin
glasses, with an interpolation path that is adaptive. In order to illustrate
our method we show how to prove the replica formula for three non-trivial
inference problems. The first one is symmetric rank-one matrix estimation (or
factorisation), which is the simplest problem considered here and the one for
which the method is presented in full details. Then we generalize to symmetric
tensor estimation and random linear estimation. We believe that the present
method has a much wider range of applicability and also sheds new insights on

existing in real communication channels will reduce or even totally destroy

failure of quantum communication. Here, we present the experimental
demonstrations on the disentanglement and the entanglement revival of
tripartite entangled optical beams used in a quantum network. We discover that
symmetric tripartite entangled optical beams are robust in pure lossy but
noiseless channels. While in a noisy channel the excess noise will lead to the
disentanglement and the destroyed entanglement can be revived by the use of a
correlated noisy channel (non-Markovian environment). The presented results

are a key component of probabilistic weather forecasting. They represent the
uncertainty in the initial conditions by an ensemble which incorporates
information coming from the physical model with the latest observations.
High-resolution numerical weather prediction models ran at operational centers
are able to resolve non-linear and non-Gaussian physical phenomena such as
convection. There is therefore a growing need to develop ensemble assimilation
algorithms able to deal with non-Gaussianity while staying computationally
feasible. In the present paper we address some of these needs by proposing a
new hybrid algorithm based on the Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter. It is fully
formulated in ensemble space and uses a deterministic scheme such that it has
the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) instead of the stochastic EnKF as a
limiting case. A new criterion for choosing the proportion of particle filter
and ETKF update is also proposed. The new algorithm is implemented in the COSMO
framework and numerical experiments in a quasi-operational convective-scale
setup are conducted. The results show the feasibility of the new algorithm in
practice and indicate a strong potential for such local hybrid methods, in
particular for forecasting non-Gaussian variables such as wind and hourly
precipitation.

plasma of lower density. Such magnetic tubes model, in particular, a segment of
a coronal loop or a polar plume. The wavelength is taken comparable to the tube
radius. We perform numerical simulation of the wave propagation using ideal
magnetohydrodynamics. We find that a torsional wave nonlinearly induces three
kinds of compressive flows: the parallel flow at the Alfv\'en speed, that
constitutes a bulk plasma motion along the magnetic field, the tube wave, and
also transverse flows in the radial direction, associated with sausage fast
magnetoacoustic modes. In addition, nonlinear torsional wave steepens and its
propagation speed increases. The latter effect leads to the progressive
distortion of torsional wave front, i.e. nonlinear phase mixing. Because of the
intrinsic non-uniformity of the torsional wave amplitude across the tube
radius, the nonlinear effects are more pronounced in regions with higher wave
amplitude. They are always absent at the axes of the flux tube. In the case of
a linear radial profile of the wave amplitude, the nonlinear effects are
localised in an annulus region near the tube boundary. Thus, the parallel
compressive flows driven by torsional Alfv\'en waves in the solar and stellar
coronae, are essentially non-uniform in the perpendicular direction. The
presence of additional sinks for the wave energy reduces the efficiency of the
nonlinear parallel cascade in torsional Alfv\'en waves.

4$^{\circ}$ above the Galactic Plane in the first Galactic quadrant, leaving it
unsampled by most Galactic plane surveys. Here we observe HII region candidates
spatially coincident with the OSC using the Very Large Array to image radio
continuum emission from 65 targets and the Green Bank Telescope to search for
ammonia and water maser emission from 75 targets. This sample, drawn from the
WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, represents every HII region candidate

characteristic mid-infrared morphologies, detection of radio continuum emission
strongly suggests that a target is a bona fide HII region. Detections of
associated ammonia or water maser emission allow us to derive a kinematic
distance and determine if the velocity of the region is consistent with that of
the OSC. Nearly 60% of the observed sources were detected in radio continuum,

non-negligible source of excited-state contamination in lattice simulations at
the physical point. It is shown that baryon chiral perturbation theory can be
employed to calculate the contamination due to two-particle nucleon-pion states
in various nucleon observables. Leading order results are presented for the
nucleon axial, tensor and scalar charge and three Mellin moments of parton
distribution functions (quark momentum fraction, helicity and transversity
moment). Taking into account phenomenological results for the charges and
moments the impact of the nucleon-pion-states on lattice estimates for these
observables can be estimated. The nucleon-pion-state contribution results in an
overestimation of all charges and moments obtained with the plateau method. The
overestimation is at the 5-10% level for source-sink separations of about 2 fm.
The source-sink separations accessible in contemporary lattice simulations are
found to be too small for chiral perturbation theory to be directly applicable.

this is the status quo, and in turn, most efficient concurrent data-structures
heavily rely on compare-and-swap (e.g. for swinging pointers and in general,
conflict resolution).
  We show that this need not be the case, by designing and implementing a
concurrent linearizable Log data-structure (also known as a History object),
supporting two operations: append(item), which appends the item to the log, and
get-log(), which returns the appended items so far, in order. Readers are
wait-free and writers are lock-free, and this data-structure can be used in a
lock-free universal construction to implement any concurrent object with a
given sequential specification. Our implementation uses atomic read, xor,
decrement, and fetch-and-increment instructions supported on X86 architectures,
and provides similar performance to a compare-and-swap-based solution on
today's hardware. This raises a fundamental question about minimal set of
synchronization instructions that the architectures have to support.

high spatial resolution of ALMA, resulting in a synthesised beam with a size
slightly smaller than the derived parent scale length, we are able to
tentatively identify CS as a daughter species, i.e., a species produced in the
coma and/or sublimated from icy grains, rather than a parent species. In
addition we report the detection of several CH3OH transitions and confirm the
previously reported detections of HCN, HNC and H2CO as well as dust in the coma

production rates relative to water of 0.2% for CS, 0.06-0.1% for HCN,

available from distributed small-scale resources, their flexibility must be
quantified and aggregated.
  This paper introduces a generic and scalable approach for flexible energy
systems to quantitatively describe and price their flexibility based on
zonotopic sets. The description proposed allows aggregators to efficiently pool
the flexibility of large numbers of systems and to make control and market

distributes aggregate-level control decisions among the individual systems of
the pool in an economically fair and computationally efficient way. Finally, it
is shown how the zonotopic description of flexibility enables an efficient

recently improved upon their results for arbitrary tuple sizes, for example
showing that a triple sieve can solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) in

locality-sensitive hashing for finding nearest neighbors.
  In this work, we generalize the spherical locality-sensitive filters of
Becker-Ducas-Gama-Laarhoven [SODA 2016] to obtain space-time tradeoffs for near

triple sieve heuristically solves SVP in time $2^{0.3588d + o(d)}$. For
practical sieves based on Micciancio-Voulgaris' GaussSieve [SODA 2010], this

shows that the amplitude, velocity and shape of the bright soliton are altered
by the time-dependent scattering length. We also analyse the non-trivial energy
sharing collision of Manakov solitons in the presence of Rabi coupling and
aforementioned nonlinearities. We find that breathers arise in two-soliton

(i.e., $\tau_5 \ge 1$) has important implications for our present understanding
of sunspots and their penumbrae: their brightness and energy transport, mode
conversion of magneto-acoustic waves, sunspot seismology, and so forth. $Aims$.
We aim at determining the thermal stratification in the layers immediately
beneath the visible surface of the penumbra: $\tau_5 \in [1,3]$ ($\approx
70-80$ km below the visible continuum-forming layer). $Methods$. We analyzed
spectropolarimetric data (i.e., Stokes profiles) in three Fe \textsc{i} lines
located at 1565 nm observed with the GRIS instrument attached to the 1.5-meter
solar telescope GREGOR. The data are corrected for the smearing effects of
wide-angle scattered light and then subjected to an inversion code for the
radiative transfer equation in order to retrieve, among others, the temperature
as a function of optical depth $T(\tau_5)$. $Results$. We find that the
temperature gradient below the visible surface of the penumbra is smaller than
in the quiet Sun. This implies that in the region $\tau_5 \ge 1$ the penumbral
temperature diverges from that of the quiet Sun. The same result is obtained
when focusing only on the thermal structure below the surface of bright
penumbral filaments. We interpret these results as evidence of a thick
penumbra, whereby the magnetopause is not located near its visible surface. In
addition, we find that the temperature gradient in bright penumbral filaments
is lower than in granules. This can be explained in terms of the limited
expansion of a hot upflow inside a penumbral filament relative to a granular
upflow, as magnetic pressure and tension forces from the surrounding penumbral
magnetic field hinder an expansion like this.

termed a robust regression problem. To tackle it, a quite general
optimization-based framework is proposed and analyzed. When only the sparse
noise is present, a sufficient bound is derived on the number of nonzero
elements in the sparse noise sequence that can be accommodated by the estimator
while still returning the true parameter matrix. While almost all the
restricted isometry-based bounds from the literature are not verifiable, our
bound can be easily computed through solving a convex optimization problem.
Moreover, empirical evidence tends to suggest that it is generally tight. If in
addition to the sparse noise sequence, the training data are affected by a

stable shear flows, we performed direct numerical simulations of homogeneous
shear turbulence for different aspect ratios of the flow domain and analyzed
the dynamical processes in Fourier space. There are no exponentially growing
modes in such flows and the turbulence is energetically supported only by the
linear growth of perturbation harmonics due to the shear flow non-normality.
This non-normality-induced, or nonmodal growth is anisotropic in spectral
space, which, in turn, leads to anisotropy of nonlinear processes in this
space. As a result, a transverse (angular) redistribution of harmonics in
Fourier space appears to be the main nonlinear process in these flows, rather
than direct or inverse cascades. We refer to this type of nonlinear
redistribution as the nonlinear transverse cascade. It is demonstrated that the
turbulence is sustained by a subtle interplay between the linear nonmodal
growth and the nonlinear transverse cascade that exemplifies a well-known
bypass scenario of subcritical turbulence. These two basic processes mainly
operate at large length scales, comparable to the domain size. Therefore, this
central, small wave number area of Fourier space is crucial in the
self-sustenance; we defined its size and labeled it as the vital area of
turbulence. Outside the vital area, the nonmodal growth and the transverse
cascade are of secondary importance. Although the cascades and the
self-sustaining process of turbulence are qualitatively the same at different
aspect ratios, the number of harmonics actively participating in this process
varies, but always remains quite large. This implies that the self-sustenance
of subcritical turbulence cannot be described by low-order models.

revealing a resistance anisotropy that can be induced at a temperature far
below the structural and magnetic zero-field transition temperatures. The
observed resistance anisotropy strongly depends on the field orientation with
respect to the crystallographic axes, as well as on the field-cooling history.
Our results imply a correlation between the observed features and the
low-temperature magnetic order. Hysteresis in the angle-dependence indicates a
strong pinning of the magnetic order within a temperature range that varies
with the Cu content. The resistance anisotropy vanishes at different
temperatures depending on whether an external magnetic field or a remnant field
is present: the closing temperature is higher in the presence of an external
field. For $x_{EDX} = 0.06$ the resistance anisotropy closes above the
structural transition, at the same temperature at which the zero-field
short-range magnetic order disappears and the sample becomes paramagnetic. Thus
we suggest that under an external magnetic field the resistance anisotropy
mirrors the magnetic order parameter. We discuss similarities to nematic order

structures: the ability of processes to access the data in parallel and the
cost of synchronization. It has been observed that for a large class of
""concurrency-unfriendly"" data structures, fine-grained parallelization does not
pay off: an implementation based on a single global lock outperforms
fine-grained solutions. The flat combining paradigm exploits this by ensuring
that a thread holding the global lock sequentially combines requests and then
executes the combined requests on behalf of concurrent threads.
  In this paper, we propose a synchronization technique that unites flat
combining and parallel bulk updates borrowed from parallel algorithms designed
for the PRAM model. The idea is that the combiner thread assigns waiting
threads to perform concurrent requests in parallel.
  We foresee the technique to help in implementing efficient
""concurrency-ambivalent"" data structures, which can benefit from both
parallelism and serialization, depending on the operational context. To
validate the idea, we considered heap-based implementations of a priority
queue. These data structures exhibit two important features: concurrent remove
operations are likely to conflict and thus may benefit from combining, while
concurrent insert operations can often be at least partly applied in parallel
thus may benefit from parallel batching. We show that the resulting flat
parallelization algorithm performs well compared to state-of-the-art priority

dynamical systems and spectral operator-theoretic notions such as eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions. The sublevel sets of the dominant eigenfunction form a
family of nested forward-invariant sets and the basin of attraction is the
largest of these sets. The boundaries of these sets, called isostables, allow
studying temporal properties of the system. Our first observation is that the
dominant eigenfunction is increasing in every variable in the case of monotone
systems. This is a strong geometric property which simplifies the computation
of isostables. We also show how variations in basins of attraction can be
bounded under parametric uncertainty in the vector field of monotone systems.
Finally, we study the properties of the parameter set for which a monotone

notable decrease in the dielectric constant with the application of magnetic

heat-capacity, complex permittivity, and pyrocurrent measurements on an oxide,
Li3NiRuO5, hitherto not paid much attention in the literature, except for a
previous report on its promising electrochemical performance. We emphasize on
the following findings: (i) Observation of re-entrant spin-glass behavior; that
is, this oxide undergoes ferrilmagnetic ordering below 8- K, entering
spin-glass regime around 12 K. (ii) There is no prominent feature in the
complex dielectric permittivity (in particular, at the magnetic transitions) in
the absence of external magnetic field, indicative of the absence of
ferroelectricity. However, there is a distinct evidence for magneto-dielectric
(MDE) coupling. The sign of MDE coupling also changes as the sample is cooled
from ferrimagnetic state to spin-glass regime. (iii) There are pyroelectric
anomalies in the vicinity of 30-70 K, presumably from thermally stimulated
depolarization current.

Specifically, we consider the partition of the mosaic into intervals of the

in a hemisphere, the Delaunay mosaic is isomorphic to the boundary complex of
the convex hull in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, so we also get the expected number of

essentially the same as for the Poisson-Delaunay mosaic in $n$-dimensional

of the $n$-sphere is isometric to the standard $n$-simplex equipped with the

stochastic properties as the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. Our results are
therefore relevant in information geometry and in population genetics.

Discrete-event network simulation is essential for end-to-end, cross-layer

developed full-stack mmWave module integrated into the widely used open-source

highly customizable, making it easy to integrate algorithms or compare
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) numerologies, for example.
The module is interfaced with the core network of the ns--3 Long Term Evolution

advanced architectural features, such as dual-connectivity, are also available.
To facilitate the understanding of the module, and verify its correct

from single images. Recent approaches learn deep neural networks to regress 3D
pose directly from images. One major challenge for such methods, however, is
the collection of training data. Specifically, collecting large amounts of
training data containing unconstrained images annotated with accurate 3D poses
is infeasible. We therefore propose to use two independent training sources.
The first source consists of accurate 3D motion capture data, and the second
source consists of unconstrained images with annotated 2D poses. To integrate
both sources, we propose a dual-source approach that combines 2D pose
estimation with efficient 3D pose retrieval. To this end, we first convert the
motion capture data into a normalized 2D pose space, and separately learn a 2D
pose estimation model from the image data. During inference, we estimate the 2D
pose and efficiently retrieve the nearest 3D poses. We then jointly estimate a
mapping from the 3D pose space to the image and reconstruct the 3D pose. We
provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method and experimentally
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, even when the skeleton
structures of the two sources differ substantially.

  Points","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1611.03947",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Concurrent data structures or CDS such as concurrent stacks, queues, sets
etc. have become very popular in the past few years partly due to the rise of
multi-core systems. But one of the greatest challenges with CDSs has been
developing correct structures and then proving the correctness of these
structures. We believe that techniques that help prove the correctness of these
CDSs can also guide in developing new CDSs. An intuitive technique to prove the
correctness of CDSs is using Linearization Points or LPs. An LP is an atomic
event in the execution interval of each method such that the execution of the
entire method seems to have taken place in the instant of that event. One of
the main challenges with the LP based approach is to identify the correct LPs
of a CDS. Identifying the correct LPs can be deceptively wrong in many cases.
In fact, in many cases, the LP identified or even worse the CDS itself could be
wrong. To address these issues, several automatic tools for verifying
linearizability have been developed. But we believe that these tools don't
provide insight to a programmer to develop the correct concurrent programs or
identify the LPs. Considering the complexity of developing a CDS and verifying
its correctness, we address the most basic problem of this domain in this
paper: given the set of LPs of a CDS, how to show its correctness? We assume
that we are given a CDS and its LPs. We have developed a hand-crafted technique
of proving the correctness of the CDS by validating its LPs. As observed
earlier, identifying the correct LPs is very tricky and erroneous. But since
our technique is hand-crafted, we believe that the process of proving
correctness might provide insight to identify the correct LPs, if the currently
chosen LP is incorrect. We also believe that this technique might also offer
the programmer some insight to develop more efficient variants of the CDS.

activity in the brain. The abnor- mal electrical activity manifests as waves,
propagating across the brain. Accurate prediction of the propagation velocity
and direction of these waves could enable real- time responsive brain
stimulation to suppress or prevent the seizures entirely. However, this problem
is very chal- lenging because the algorithm must be able to predict the neural
signals in a sufficiently long time horizon to allow enough time for medical
intervention. We consider how to accomplish long term prediction using a LSTM
network. To alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, we propose two
encoder-decoder-predictor structures, both using multi-resolution
representation. The novel LSTM structure with multi-resolution layers could
significantly outperform the single-resolution benchmark with similar number of
parameters. To overcome the blurring effect associated with video prediction in
the pixel domain using standard mean square error (MSE) loss, we use energy-
based adversarial training to improve the long-term pre- diction. We
demonstrate and analyze how a discriminative model with an encoder-decoder
structure using 3D CNN model improves long term prediction.

(ROSINA) was designed to measure the composition of the gas in the coma of
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the target of the European Space Agency's
Rosetta mission. In addition to the volatiles, ROSINA measured refractories
sputtered off the comet by the interaction of solar wind protons with the
surface of the comet.
  Aims. The origin of different solar system materials is still heavily
debated. Isotopic ratios can be used to distinguish between different
reservoirs and investigate processes occurring during the formation of the
solar system.
  Methods. ROSINA consisted of two mass spectrometers and a pressure sensor. In
the ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS), the neutral gas of
cometary origin was ionized and then deflected in an electric and a magnetic
field that separated the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The DFMS had
a high mass resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity that allowed detection
of rare species and the known major volatiles.
  Results. We measured the relative abundance of all three stable silicon
isotopes with the ROSINA instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft.
Furthermore, we measured $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C in C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_5$, and CO.
The DFMS in situ measurements indicate that the average silicon isotopic
composition shows depletion in the heavy isotopes $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si with
respect to $^{28}$Si and solar abundances, while $^{13}$C to $^{12}$C is
analytically indistinguishable from bulk planetary and meteorite compositions.
Although the origin of the deficiency of the heavy silicon isotopes cannot be
explained unambiguously, we discuss mechanisms that could have contributed to
the measured depletion of the isotopes $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si.

disregarding the role of dc conductivity. A comparison with the well known
results for the configuration of two parallel plates is made. Finally, we
compute the Casimir free energy of silica, sapphire and Ge films deposited on
high-resistivity Si plates of different thicknesses and demonstrate that it can

under harsh environmental conditions. The asymptotic consensus problem requires
a set of agents to repeatedly set their outputs such that the outputs converge
to a common value within the convex hull of initial values. This problem, and
the related approximate consensus problem, are fundamental building blocks in
distributed systems where exact consensus among agents is not required or
possible, e.g., man-made distributed control systems, and have applications in
the analysis of natural distributed systems, such as flocking and opinion
dynamics. We prove tight lower bounds on the contraction rates of asymptotic
consensus algorithms in dynamic networks, from which we deduce bounds on the
time complexity of approximate consensus algorithms. In particular, the
obtained bounds show optimality of asymptotic and approximate consensus
algorithms presented in [Charron-Bost et al., ICALP'16] for certain dynamic
networks, including the weakest dynamic network model in which asymptotic and
approximate consensus are solvable. As a corollary we also obtain
asymptotically tight bounds for asymptotic consensus in the classical
asynchronous model with crashes.
  Central to our lower bound proofs is an extended notion of valency, the set
of reachable limits of an asymptotic consensus algorithm starting from a given
configuration. We further relate topological properties of valencies to the
solvability of exact consensus, shedding some light on the relation of these
three fundamental problems in dynamic networks.

to adversarially generated instances, which look seemingly normal to human
observers, but completely confuse DNNs. These adversarial samples are crafted
by adding small perturbations to normal, benign images. Such perturbations,
while imperceptible to the human eye, are picked up by DNNs and cause them to
misclassify the manipulated instances with high confidence. In this work, we
explore and demonstrate how systematic JPEG compression can work as an
effective pre-processing step in the classification pipeline to counter
adversarial attacks and dramatically reduce their effects (e.g., Fast Gradient
Sign Method, DeepFool). An important component of JPEG compression is its
ability to remove high frequency signal components, inside square blocks of an
image. Such an operation is equivalent to selective blurring of the image,
helping remove additive perturbations. Further, we propose an ensemble-based
technique that can be constructed quickly from a given well-performing DNN, and
empirically show how such an ensemble that leverages JPEG compression can
protect a model from multiple types of adversarial attacks, without requiring

to the space plasma conditions, we demonstrate that in the magnetosheath
plasma, coherent nonlinear magnetic depression may be created associated with

isolated or as the train of weakly correlated structures (the cnoidal wave). In
the Solar wind and in the Earths magnetopause, characterized with anisotropic

coherent magnetic holes of the same form that are attributed to the two

neutron-rich isotopes is continuously pursued at accelerator laboratories all
over the world. To explore the currently-unknown territories in the nuclear
chart far away from the stability, reliable theoretical predictions are
inevitable.
  Purpose: To provide a reliable prediction of production cross sections taking
into account secondary deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and
fission, a new method called TDHF+GEMINI is proposed, which combines the
microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a sophisticated
statistical compound-nucleus deexcitation model, GEMINI++.
  Results: The method is applied for multinucleon transfer processes in
low-energy heavy ion reactions. It is shown that the inclusion of secondary
deexcitation processes, which are dominated by neutron evaporation in the
present systems, substantially improves agreement with the experimental data.
The magnitude of the evaporation effects is very similar to the one observed in
GRAZING calculations. TDHF+GEMINI provides better description of the absolute
value of the cross sections for channels involving transfer of more than one
protons, compared with the GRAZING results. However, there remain discrepancies
between the measurements and the calculated cross sections, indicating a limit
of the theoretical framework that works with a single mean-field potential.
Possible causes of the discrepancies are discussed.
  Conclusions: In order to perfectly reproduce experimental cross sections for
multinucleon transfer processes, one should go beyond the standard
self-consistent mean-field description. Nevertheless, the proposed method will
provide valuable information to optimize production mechanisms of new
neutron-rich nuclei through its microscopic, non-empirical predictions.

Parkes radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time
with a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6$\pm$0.8 pc cm^{-3}, a pulse duration
of 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5} ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming the burst
was at beam center of 0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic
longitude and latitude of 24.66^{\circ}, 5.28^{\circ}, 25 degrees away from the
Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43$\pm$5% linearly polarized with a
rotation measure (RM) in the range -9 < RM < 12 rad m^{-2} (95% confidence
level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed-up with 11 telescopes to
search for radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino emission. Neither
transient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and
no repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 hours of observing. The sightline
to the burst is close to the Galactic plane and the observed physical
properties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence of sight lines of
anomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic RM
foreground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the
line of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or
some combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might
explain why this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude
have had lower detection rates than those out of the plane.

magnetic vortices in high-beta plasmas with anisotropic temperature, possessing
compressible density and magnetic field, whose typical size ranges from fluid
to ion scales. At magneto-fluid scales we find novel non-propagating
field-aligned cylindrical monopoles and inclined propagating dipoles. Their
transverse magnetic and velocity fluctuations are aligned, but not identical,
{and they exhibit density and compressible magnetic field fluctuations $\delta
n$ and $\delta B_\Vert$ localized inside the vortex core. In the presence of
thermal anisotropy and acoustic effects, they may be correlated or
anti-correlated $\delta n/\delta B_\Vert={\rm constant}\gtrless 0$;
fluctuations whose velocity along the magnetic field is below the ion thermal
speed are always correlated.} At ion or kinetic scales (with the smallest radii
$\sim c/\omega_{pi}, \rho_{L i}$) {and in the absence of acoustic
perturbations}, only dipolar Alfv\'en vortices survive with similar properties
as those at fluid scales, except for their $\delta n/n_0$ that reaches the
level of $\delta B_\Vert/B_0$. At kinetic scales we find also pressure balanced
dipolar structures, possessing finite parallel electric field $E_\Vert$ and
purely compressional magnetic field perturbation.

spectra computed on one-dimensional atmosphere models (1D models)
representative of various solar surface features to reconstruct SI changes
measured on timescales greater than a day. Various recent studies have,
however, pointed out that the spectra synthesized on 1D models do not reflect
the radiative emission of the inhomogenous atmosphere revealed by
high-resolution solar observations. We aimed to derive observational-based
atmospheres from such observations and test their accuracy for SI estimates. We
analysed spectro-polarimetric data of the Fe I 630 nm line pair on photospheric
regions representative of the granular, quiet Sun pattern (QS) and of small-
and large-scale magnetic features, both bright and dark with respect to the QS.
The data were taken on 2011 August 6, with the CRISP at the Swedish Solar
Telescope, under excellent seeing conditions. We derived atmosphere models of
the observed regions from data inversion with the SIR code. We studied the
sensitivity of results to spatial resolution and temporal evolution, and
discussed the obtained atmospheres with respect to several 1D models. The
atmospheres derived from our study agree well with most of the compared 1D
models, both qualitatively and quantitatively (differences are within 10%), but
for pore regions. Spectral synthesis computations on the atmosphere obtained
from the QS observations return SI between 400 nm and 2400 nm that agrees, on
average, within 2.2% with standard reference measurements, and within -0.14%
with the SI computed on the quiet Sun atmosphere employed by the most advanced
semi-empirical model of SI variations.

elementary particle will be derived in this work which reflects the old idea of
de Broglie's particle-wave duality. This model contains, on the one hand, a
possible explanation of the work-energy exchange between the two separated
motions, thereby providing an energy quantisation as originally postulated by
Max Planck. On the other hand, the system perfectly obeys the Bohmian-type law
of motion in full accordance with quantum mechanics.
  For the calculation of elementary particles' trajectories a ballistic
diffusion equation will be derived which is a special case of a diffusion
equation with a time-dependent diffusivity. Therewith the simulation of
spreading of an elementary Gaussian is made easy as will be shown herein.
  With these tools one also accounts for Born's rule for multi-slit systems and
develops a set of current rules that directly leads to a new formulation of the
guiding equation equivalent to the original one of the de Broglie-Bohm theory.
As will be shown in this thesis, this tool reproduces Talbot patterns and
Talbot distance for an arbitrary multi-slit system.
  Moreover, the sweeper effect is shown to arise when the intensity relation of
two beams of a double-slit experiment exhibit a big difference. Then, the
low-intensity beam is pushed aside in a sense that its initial propagation
straight out of the slit is bent towards the side. A sideways screen as an
alternative measurement method is proposed.

theory for magnetic degrees of freedom. The influence of confined geometry and
atomic scale non-magnetic defects on the skyrmion lifetime is estimated. It is
shown that a skyrmion on a track has lower activation energy for annihilation
and higher energy for nucleation if the size of the skyrmion is comparable with
the width of the track. Two mechanisms of skyrmion annihilation are considered:
inside the track and escape through the boundary. For both mechanisms, the
dependence of activation energy on the track width is calculated. Non-magnetic
defects are found to localize skyrmions in their neighborhood and strongly
decrease the activation energy for creation and annihilation. This is in
agreement with experimental measurements that have found nucleation of
skyrmions in presence of spin-polarized current preferably occurring near
structural defects.

multi-nucleon effect and its uncertainty to QE reactions from the GENIE
neutrino event generator. The analysis of MINERvA neutrino data in Rodrigues et
al. PRL 116 071802 (2016) paper makes clear the need for an RPA suppression,
especially at very low momentum and energy transfer. That published analysis
does not constrain the magnitude of the effect; it only tests models with and
without the effect against the data. Other MINERvA analyses need an expression
of the model uncertainty in the RPA effect. A well-described uncertainty can be
used for systematics for unfolding, for model errors in the analysis of non-QE
samples, and as input for fitting exercises for model testing or constraining
backgrounds. This prescription takes uncertainties on the parameters in the
Valencia RPA model and adds a (not-as-tight) constraint from muon capture data.
For MINERvA we apply it as a 2D ($q_0$,$q_3$) weight to GENIE events, in lieu
of generating a full beyond-Fermi-gas quasielastic events. Because it is a
weight, it can be applied to the generated and fully Geant4 simulated events
used in analysis without a special GENIE sample. For some limited uses, it
could be cast as a 1D $Q^2$ weight without much trouble. This procedure is a
suitable starting point for NOvA and DUNE where the energy dependence is
modest, but probably not adequate for T2K or MicroBooNE.

with numerous technical applications ranging from press forming to

applied in any of the three possible directions (normal to the contact plane,
in the direction of motion and in-plane transverse). In this work, we consider
the multi-mode active control of sliding friction, where phase-shifted
oscillations in two or more directions act at the same time. Our analysis is
based on a macroscopic contact-mechanical model that was recently shown to be
well-suited for describing dynamic frictional processes. For simplicity, we
limit our analysis to a constant, load-independent normal and tangential
stiffness and two superimposed phase-shifted harmonic oscillations, one of them
being normal to the plane and the other in the direction of motion. As in
previous works utilizing the present model, we assume a constant local
coefficient of friction, with reduction of the observed force of friction
arising entirely from the macroscopic dynamics of the system. Our numerical
simulations show that the resulting law of friction is determined by just three
dimensionless parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, three
qualitatively different types of behavior are observed: (a) symmetric
velocity-dependence of the coefficient of friction (same for positive and
negative velocities), (b) asymmetric dependence with respect to the sign of the
velocity, but with zero force at zero velocity, and (c) asymmetric dependence
with non-zero force at zero velocity. The latter two cases can be interpreted
as a ""dynamic ratchet"" (b) and an actuator (c).

social animals. This learning process appears in settings in which each
individual in a group is trying to decide over time, in a distributed manner,
which option to select among a shared set of options. Specifically, we consider
a stochastic dynamics in a group in which every individual selects an option in
the following two-step process: (1) select a random individual and observe the
option that individual chose in the previous time step, and (2) adopt that
option if its stochastic quality was good at that time step. Various
instantiations of such distributed learning appear in nature, and have also
been studied in the social science literature. From the perspective of an
individual, an attractive feature of this learning process is that it is a
simple heuristic that requires extremely limited computational capacities. But
what does it mean for the group -- could such a simple, distributed and
essentially memoryless process lead the group as a whole to perform optimally?
We show that the answer to this question is yes -- this distributed learning is
highly effective at identifying the best option and is close to optimal for the
group overall. Our analysis also gives quantitative bounds that show fast
convergence of these stochastic dynamics. Prior to our work the only
theoretical work related to such learning dynamics has been either in
deterministic special cases or in the asymptotic setting. Finally, we observe
that our infinite population dynamics is a stochastic variant of the classic
multiplicative weights update (MWU) method. Consequently, we arrive at the
following interesting converse: the learning dynamics on a finite population
considered here can be viewed as a novel distributed and low-memory
implementation of the classic MWU method.

three decades of its multi-stage development. While on the whole, none of the
alternatives to the hot Big Bang scenario is persuasive today, we discuss the
epistemic ramifications of establishing orthodoxy and eliminating alternatives
in science, an issue recently discussed by philosophers and historians of
science for other areas of physics. Finally, we single out some plausible and
possibly fruitful ideas offered by the alternatives.

junctions confirm the role played by quantum effects in the electronic
conductance properties of molecular systems. We show here that the destructive
interference can be turned ON or OFF within the same molecular system by
mechanically controlling its conformation. Using a combination of ab-initio
calculations and single-molecule conductance measurements, we demonstrate the
existence of a quasi-periodic destructive quantum interference pattern along
the breaking traces of {\pi}-{\pi} stacked molecular dimers. The detection of
these interferences, which are due to opposite signs of the intermolecular
electronic couplings, was only made possible by a combination of wavelet
transform and higher-order statistical analysis of single-breaking traces. The
results demonstrate that it is possible to control the molecular conductance
over a few orders of magnitudes and with a sub-angstrom resolution by
exploiting the subtle structure-property relationship of {\pi}-{\pi} stack
dimers. These large conductance changes may be beneficial for the design of
single-molecule electronic components that exploit the intrinsic quantum
effects occurring at the molecular scale.

is strictly regulated by airworthiness authorities. It splits the phase plane
of such systems into three piecewise linear subdomains. Depending on the
location of the freeplay, limit cycle oscillations can result that span either
two or three of these subdomains. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate
the existence of two-domain cycles both theoretically and experimentally. A
simple aeroelastic system with pitch, plunge and control deflection degrees of
freedom is investigated in the presence of freeplay in pitch. It is shown that
two-domain and three-domain cycles can result from a grazing bifurcation and
propagate in the decreasing airspeed direction. Close to the bifurcation, the
two limit cycle branches interact with each other and aperiodic oscillations
ensue. Equivalent linearization is used to derive the conditions of existence
of each type of limit cycle and to predict their amplitudes and frequencies.
Comparisons with measurements from wind tunnel experiments demonstrate that the
theory describes these phenomena with accuracy.

leading to high data transfer rate and increased resilience to noise as the
lateral size of the oscillator device is allowed to remain larger than the bit
width. We perform micromagnetic simulations of an example system and find that
the magnetization response has a clear unimodal character, which enables for
detection of two bit values at the same time. We analyze the frequency of the
device under the influence of two different external fields and conduct a
simulation of a successful dynamic readout. We estimate the signal linewidth
and signal-to-noise ratios of the setup and show that it may be potentially
beneficial for magnetic readout applications.

investigated by finite element simulations. The behavior of the gas mixture
inside the arc tube is governed by differential equations describing mass,
energy and charge conservation as well as the Helmholtz equation for the
acoustic pressure and the Navier-Stokes equation for the flow driven by the
buoyancy and the acoustic streaming force. The model is highly nonlinear and
requires a recursion procedure to account for the impact of acoustic streaming
on the temperature and other fields. The investigations reveal the presence of
a hysteresis and the corresponding jump phenomenon, quite similar to a Duffing
oscillator. The similarities and, in particular, the differences of the
nonlinear behavior of the high-intensity discharge lamp to that of a Duffing
oscillator are discussed. For large amplitudes the high-intensity discharge
lamp exhibits a stiffening effect in contrast to the Duffing oscillator.

one-dimensional(1D) periodic systems. Concepts such as Zak phase are considered
as topological invariants that characterize the bulk bands. The bulk 1D systems
are classified to topologically nontrivial and trivial phases according to the
value of the so-called topological invariant. The existence of edge states or
interface states is viewed as a hallmark of the topological nontriviality of
the 1D systems. In this work we demonstrate the so-called topological
properties in 1D systems are not topological by showing they are
description-dependent: the same system can be both topological and trivial
depending on how we describe the system. We demonstrate that Zak phase and
other related concepts are not topological invariants by showing they depend on
the choice of gauge, especially on the choice of unit cell. We show, for the
same bulk system, edge states or interface states can be both present and
absent depending the choices of boundaries. So the existence of localized
states in 1D system is only a boundary property.
