two-to-two scattering at fixed impact parameter in the dual AdS spacetime. We
describe its properties for a generic CFT and then focus on large $N$ CFTs with
classical bulk duals. We compute the bulk phase shift for vector operators
using Regge theory. We use causality and unitarity to put bounds on the bulk
phase shift. The resulting constraints bound three-point functions of two
vector operators and the stress tensor in terms of the gap of the theory.
Similar bounds should hold for any spinning operator in a CFT. Holographically
this implies that in a classical gravitational theory any non-minimal coupling
to the graviton, as well as any other particle with spin greater than or equal
to two, is suppressed by the mass of higher spin particles.

eddy-current flowmetering methods for liquid metals. This type of flowmeter
operates by tracking eddy-current markers excited by the magnetic field pulses
in the flow of a conducting liquid. Using a simple mathematical model, where
the fluid flow is replaced by a translating cylinder, a number possible
alternative measurement schemes are considered. The velocity of the medium can
be measured by tracking zero crossing points and spatial or temporal extrema of
the electromotive force (emf) induced by transient eddy currents in the
surrounding space. Zero crossing points and spatial extrema of the emf travel
synchronously with the medium whereas temporal extrema experience an initial
time delay which depends on the conductivity and velocity of the medium.
Performance of transient eddy-current flowmetering depends crucially on the
symmetry of system. Eddy current asymmetry of a few per cent makes the
detection point drift with a velocity corresponding to a magnetic Reynolds
number $Rm\sim 0.1.$ With this level of asymmetry transient eddy-current
flowmetering can be reliably applicable only to flows with $Rm\gtrsim 0.1.$ A
more accurate symmetry adjustment or calibration of flowmeters may be necessary
at lower velocities.

by combining data from different fidelities for design optimization and
uncertainty quantification as reviewed by Fern\'andez-Godino et al. and
Peherstorfer et al.. Among all frameworks, the Bayesian framework based on
Gaussian processes has the potential of highest accuracy. However, the Bayesian
framework requires optimization for estimating hyper-parameters, and there is a
risk of estimating inappropriate hyper-parameters as Kriging surrogate often
does, especially in the presence of noisy data. We propose an easy and yet
powerful framework for practical design and applications. In this technical
note, we revised a heuristic framework which minimizes the prediction errors at
high-fidelity samples using optimization. The system behavior (high-fidelity
behavior) is approximated by a linear combination of the low-fidelity
predictions and a polynomial-based discrepancy function. The key idea is to
consider the low-fidelity model as a basis function in the multi-fidelity model
with the scale factor as a regression coefficient. The design matrix for
least-square estimation consists of both the low-fidelity model and discrepancy
function. Then the scale factor and coefficients of the basis functions are
obtained simultaneously using linear regression, which guarantees the
uniqueness of fitting process. Besides enabling efficient estimation of the
parameters, the proposed least-squares multi-fidelity surrogate (LS-MFS) can be
applicable to other regression models by simply replacing the design matrix.
Therefore, the LS-MFS is expected to be easily applied to various applications
such as prediction variance, D-optimal designs, uncertainty propagation and
design optimization.

utility function for a non-cooperative game such that all of its pure Nash
equilibria have close to optimal global performance. This will make the
algorithm close to optimal while requiring no communication between users. We
propose a novel technique to analyze the Nash equilibria of a random
interference game, determined by the random channel gains. Our analysis is
asymptotic in the number of users. First we present a natural non-cooperative
game where the utility of each user is his achievable rate. It is shown that,
asymptotically in the number of users and for strong enough interference, this
game exhibits many bad equilibria. Then we propose a novel non-cooperative M
Frequency-Selective Interference Channel Game (M-FSIG), as a slight
modification of the former, where the utility of each user is artificially
limited. We prove that even its worst equilibrium has asymptotically optimal
weighted sum-rate for any interference regime and even for correlated channels.

tropical latitudes at sea level during the Earth's past. Whether these extreme
ice ages were snowball Earth events, with the entire surface covered in ice, or
whether ocean water remained ice free in regions about the equator, continues
to be controversial. For the latter situation to occur, the effect of positive
ice albedo feedback would have to be damped to stabilize an advancing ice sheet
shy of the equator. In this paper we analyze a conceptual model comprised of a
zonally averaged surface temperature equation coupled to a dynamic ice line

these great glacial episodes through an appropriately chosen albedo function.
Using the spectral method, the analysis leads to a nonsmooth singular

the persistence of an invariant manifold, thereby providing insight into model

novel device functionalities, TMOs must be doped. However, the nature of
carriers in doped oxides and their conduction mechanism at the atomic scale
remain unclear. Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)
investigations provided new insight into these questions, revealing that the
carriers of prototypical metal oxides undergo a transition from a polaronic
liquid to a Fermi liquid regime with increasing doping. Here, by performing
\textit{ab initio} many-body calculations of the ARPES spectra of TiO$_2$, we
show that this transition originates from non-adiabatic polar electron-phonon
coupling, and occurs when the frequency of plasma oscillations exceeds that of
longitudinal-optical phonons. This finding suggests that a universal mechanism
may underlie polaron formation in TMOs, and provides a new paradigm for
engineering emergent properties in quantum matter.

stochastic optimization with a heavy-tailed distribution (with finite 2nd
moment). The objective is the sum of a smooth convex function with a convex

on its variance (OUBV). Differently, we assume an oracle with
\emph{multiplicative noise}. This rarely addressed setup is more aggressive but
realistic, where the variance may not be bounded. Our methods achieve optimal
iteration complexity and (near) optimal oracle complexity. For the smooth
convex class, we use an accelerated SA method a la FISTA which achieves, given
tolerance $\epsilon>0$, the optimal iteration complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ with a near-optimal oracle complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})[\ln(\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})]^2$. This improves
upon Ghadimi and Lan [\emph{Math. Program.}, 156:59-99, 2016] where it is
assumed an OUBV. For the strongly convex class, our method achieves optimal
iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\ln(\epsilon^{-1}))$ and optimal oracle
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$. This improves upon Byrd et al.
[\emph{Math. Program.}, 134:127-155, 2012] where it is assumed an OUBV. In
terms of variance, our bounds are local: they depend on variances
$\sigma(x^*)^2$ at solutions $x^*$ and the per unit distance multiplicative
variance $\sigma^2_L$. For the smooth convex class, there exist policies such
that our bounds resemble those obtained if it was assumed an OUBV with
$\sigma^2:=\sigma(x^*)^2$. For the strongly convex class such property is
obtained exactly if the condition number is estimated or in the limit for
better conditioned problems or for larger initial batch sizes. In any case, if
it is assumed an OUBV, our bounds are thus much sharper since typically
$\max\{\sigma(x^*)^2,\sigma_L^2\}\ll\sigma^2$.

which is designed to investigate variations in the initial mass function (IMF)
of star clusters. By comparing observed cluster photometry to large libraries
of clusters simulated with a continuously varying IMF, our formalism yields the
posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the cluster mass, age, and
extinction, jointly with the parameters describing the IMF. We apply this
formalism to a sample of star clusters from the nearby galaxy NGC 628, for
which broad-band photometry in five filters is available as part of the Legacy
ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). After allowing the upper-end slope of the IMF
($\alpha_3$) to vary, we recover PDFs for the mass, age, and extinction that
are broadly consistent with what is found when assuming an invariant Kroupa
IMF. However, the posterior PDF for $\alpha_3$ is very broad due to a strong

of priors, particularly on the cluster mass. We find only a modest improvement
in the constraining power of $\alpha_3$ when adding H$\alpha$ photometry from
the companion H$\alpha$-LEGUS survey. Conversely, H$\alpha$ photometry
significantly improves the age determination, reducing the frequency of
multi-modal PDFs. With the aid of mock clusters we quantify the degeneracy
between physical parameters, showing how constraints on the cluster mass that
are independent of photometry can be used to pin down the IMF properties of
star clusters.

owners (individuals), data buyers and market maker. Data owners who provide
personal data are compensated according to their privacy loss. Data buyers can
submit a query and pay for the result according to their desired accuracy.
Market maker coordinates between data owner and buyer. This framework has been
previously studied based on differential privacy. However, the previous study
assumes data owners can accept any level of privacy loss and data buyers can
conduct the transaction without regard to the financial budget. In this paper,
we propose a practical personal data trading framework that is able to strike a
balance between money and privacy. In order to gain insights on user
preferences, we first conducted an online survey on human attitude to- ward
privacy and interest in personal data trading. Second, we identify the 5 key
principles of personal data market, which is important for designing a
reasonable trading frame- work and pricing mechanism. Third, we propose a
reason- able trading framework for personal data which provides an overview of
how the data is traded. Fourth, we propose a balanced pricing mechanism which
computes the query price for data buyers and compensation for data owners
(whose data are utilized) as a function of their privacy loss. The main goal is
to ensure a fair trading for both parties. Finally, we will conduct an
experiment to evaluate the output of our proposed pricing mechanism in
comparison with other previously proposed mechanism.

of the ground state quantum phase transitions (QPTs) and many of their
properties have been studied in detail. However, in these systems the study of
the so called excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have not
received so much attention.
  Purpose: A quantum analysis of the ESQPTs in the two-fluid Lipkin model is
presented in this work. The study is performed through the Hamiltonian
diagonalization for selected values of the control parameters in order to cover
the most interesting regions of the system phase diagram. [Method:] A
Hamiltonian that resembles the consistent-Q Hamiltonian of the interacting
boson model (IBM) is diagonalized for selected values of the parameters and
properties such as the density of states, the Peres lattices, the
nearest-neighbor spacing distribution, and the participation ratio are
analyzed.
  Results: An overview of the spectrum of the two-fluid Lipkin model for
selected positions in the phase diagram has been obtained. The location of the
excited-state quantum phase transition can be easily singled out with the Peres
lattice, with the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution, with Poincar\'e
sections or with the participation ratio.
  Conclusions: This study completes the analysis of QPTs for the two-fluid
Lipkin model, extending the previous study to excited states. The ESQPT
signatures in composed systems behave in the same way as in single ones,
although the evidences of their presence can be sometimes blurred. The Peres
lattice turns out to be a convenient tool to look into the position of the
ESQPT and to define the concept of phase in the excited states realm.

archetypes are non-negative and sufficiently sparse (or the weights are
sufficiently sparse), a regime that is captured by the separability condition
and its generalizations.
  In this paper, we study an approach to NMF that can be traced back to the
work of Cutler and Breiman (1994) and does not require the data to be
separable, while providing a generally unique decomposition. We optimize the
trade-off between two objectives: we minimize the distance of the data points
from the convex envelope of the archetypes (which can be interpreted as an
empirical risk), while minimizing the distance of the archetypes from the
convex envelope of the data (which can be interpreted as a data-dependent
regularization). The archetypal analysis method of (Cutler, Breiman, 1994) is
recovered as the limiting case in which the last term is given infinite weight.
  We introduce a `uniqueness condition' on the data which is necessary for
exactly recovering the archetypes from noiseless data. We prove that, under
uniqueness (plus additional regularity conditions on the geometry of the
archetypes), our estimator is robust. While our approach requires solving a
non-convex optimization problem, we find that standard optimization methods
succeed in finding good solutions both for real and synthetic data.

interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible
as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames.
Instead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video
camera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence
and a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field
video at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed
into two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The
flow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field
sequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The
appearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final
pixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural
networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms
current video interpolation methods, enabling consumer light field videography,

light on the nature of these mysterious bursts and the physical mechanisms that
power them. Increasing the sample of FRBs with robust host galaxy associations
is the key impetus behind on-going and upcoming searches and facilities. Here,
we quantify the robustness of FRB-host galaxy associations as a function of
localization area and galaxy apparent magnitude. We also explore the use of FRB
dispersion measures to constrain the source redshift, thereby reducing the
number of candidate hosts. We further use these results to demonstrate that
even in the absence of a robust unique association, a constraint can be placed
on the maximum luminosity of a host galaxy as a function of localization area
and DM. We examine these results in the context of existing and future FRB
facilities. We find that localizations of $\lesssim 0.5''$ are required for a
chance coincidence probability of $\lesssim 1\%$ for dwarf galaxies at
$z\gtrsim 0.1$; if some hosts have luminosities of $\sim L^*$, then
localizations of up to $\approx 3''$ may suffice at $z\sim 0.1$ (but $\lesssim
1''$ at $z\approx 1$). Constraints on the redshift from the DM only marginally
improve the association probability, unless the DM is low, $\lesssim 400$ pc

galaxy redshifts, which is challenging at $z\gtrsim 0.5$ if the hosts are
generally dwarf galaxies. Finally, interesting limits on the maximum host
luminosity (for example, sufficient to demonstrate that the hosts are generally

colors based on the input image and current user inputs. The colorization is
performed in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time use. Even with
randomly simulated user inputs, we show that the proposed system helps novice
users quickly create realistic colorizations, and offers large improvements in
colorization quality with just a minute of use. In addition, we demonstrate
that the framework can incorporate other user ""hints"" to the desired

bimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies,

distributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals.
Using both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue
that this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from
a theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole
population can be well fit by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions.
This family of distributions has 3 parameters that determine the average SFR of
the galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence,
and the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed
distributions naturally account for (i) the discrete nature of star formation,
(ii) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs, and (iii) asymmetric
scatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal
with a peak at the star forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs.
However, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the
appearance of a bimodal distribution.

dissipative action admits an instanton solution, the so-called Korshunov

that besides the known regime where the logarithm of the tunneling rate scales

fields of the local Universe are essential to study the local Large Scale
Structure. In this paper, the Wiener Filter reconstruction technique is applied
to galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogs to understand how the Hubble
constant (H0) value and the grouping scheme affect the reconstructions. While
H0 is used to derive radial peculiar velocities from galaxy distance
measurements and total velocities, the grouping scheme serves the purpose of
removing non linear motions. Two different grouping schemes (based on the
literature and a systematic algorithm) as well as five H0 values ranging from
72 to 76 km/s/Mpc are selected. The Wiener Filter is applied to the resulting
catalogs. Whatever grouping scheme is used, the larger H0 is, the larger the
infall onto the local Volume is. However, this conclusion has to be strongly
mitigated: a bias minimization scheme applied to the catalogs after grouping
suppresses this effect. At fixed H0, reconstructions obtained with catalogs
grouped with the different schemes exhibit structures at the proper location in
both cases but the latter are more contrasted in the less aggressive scheme
case: having more constraints permits an infall from both sides onto the
structures to reinforce their overdensity. Such findings highlight the
importance of a balance between grouping to suppress non linear motions and
preserving constraints to produce an infall onto structures expected to be
large overdensities. Such an observation is promising to perform constrained
simulations of the local Universe including its massive clusters.

galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed
of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened
sheets and vast low density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused
primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the
environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety
of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web -- depending
on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other.
In this paper we bring twelve of these methods together and apply them to the
same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general these cosmic
web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind,
and to study different questions. Therefore one would not {\it a priori} expect
agreement between different techniques however, many of these methods do
converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper we study the
agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method
finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that
voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find
substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification
scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example,
we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e.
$M_{\rm halo}\sim10^{13.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) as being in filaments. Lastly, so
that any future cosmic web classification scheme can be compared to the 12
methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.

nonlinear sigma model, and biadjoint scalar theory. Transmutation also relates
amplitudes in string theory and its variants. As a corollary, celebrated
aspects of gluon and graviton scattering like color-kinematics duality, the KLT

nanoscale remains an important scientific challenge. In particular, CT
processes in single molecules at surfaces needs to be investigated to be
properly controlled in various devices. To address this issue, the dynamics of
switching molecules can be exploited. Here, a Nickel-tetraphenylporphyrin
adsorbed on the Si(100) surface is used to study the CT process ruling the
reversible activation of two chiral molecular conformations. Via the electrons
of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), a statistical study of the molecular
switching reveals two specific locations of the molecule for which their
efficiency is optimized. The CT mechanism is shown to propagate from two
lateral aryls groups towards the porphyrin macrocycle inducing an
intramolecular movement of two symmetric pyrroles. The measured switching
efficiencies can thus be related with a Markus-Jordner model to estimate
relevant parameters that describe the dynamics of the CT process. Numerical
simulations provide a precise description of the molecular conformations and
unveil the molecular energy levels that are involved in the CT process. This
quantitative method opens a completely original approach to study CT at the

services directly between people. In such platforms, those providing a service
(hosts in AirBnB) are faced with various choices. For example in AirBnB,
although some amenities in a property (attributes of the property) are fixed,
others are relatively flexible and can be provided without significant effort.
Providing an amenity is usually associated with a cost. Naturally different
sets of amenities may have a different ""gains"" for a host. Consequently, given
a limited budget, deciding which amenities (attributes) to offer is
challenging.
  In this paper, we formally introduce and define the problem of Gain
Maximization over Flexible Attributes (GMFA). We first prove that the problem
is NP-hard and show that identifying an approximate algorithm with a constant
approximate ratio is unlikely. We then provide a practically efficient exact
algorithm to the GMFA problem for the general class of monotonic gain
functions, which quantify the benefit of sets of attributes. As the next part
of our contribution, we focus on the design of a practical gain function for
GMFA. We introduce the notion of frequent-item based count (FBC), which
utilizes the existing tuples in the database to define the notion of gain, and
propose an efficient algorithm for computing it. We present the results of a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques on real
dataset from AirBnB and demonstrate the practical relevance and utility of our
proposal.

iterative approach to the extraction of cluster candidates from the map
produced by the filter. In particular, we provide a definition of membership
probability for the galaxies close to any cluster candidate, which allows us to
remove its imprint from the map, allowing the detection of smaller structures.
As demonstrated in our tests, this method allows the deblending of close-by and
aligned structures in more than $50\%$ of the cases for objects at radial
distance equal to $0.5 \times R_{200}$ or redshift distance equal to $2 \times

Running AMICO on mocks derived from N-body simulations and semi-analytical

progenitor of the North-western stellar stream (NWS) in the halo of the
Andromeda galaxy (M31). The progenitor is assumed to be an accreting dwarf
galaxy with globular clusters (GCs). It is, in general, difficult to determine
the progenitor's orbit precisely because of many necessary parameters.
Recently, Veljanoski et al. 2014 reported five GCs whose positions and radial
velocities suggest an association with the stream. We use this data to
constrain the orbital motions of the progenitor using test-particle
simulations. Our simulations split the orbit solutions into two branches
according to whether the stream ends up in the foreground or in the background
of M31. Upcoming observations that will determine the distance to the NWS will
be able to reject one of the two branches. In either case, the solutions
require that the pericentric radius of any possible orbit be over 2 kpc. We
estimate the efficiency of the tidal disruption and confirm the consistency
with the assumption for the progenitor being a dwarf galaxy. The progenitor
requires the mass $\ga 2\times10^6 M_{\sun}$ and half-light radius $\ga 30$ pc.
In addition, $N$-body simulations successfully reproduce the basic observed
features of the NWS and the GCs' line-of-sight velocities.

star parameters are chosen to mimic those of the Kepler-16, -34 and -35
systems; the aim of this study is to examine the role of disc mass in
determining the stopping locations of migrating planets at the edge of the
cavity created by the central binary. Disc self-gravity can cause significant
shrinkage of the cavity for disc masses in excess of 5--10 $\times$ the minimum
mass solar nebula model. Planets forming early in the disc lifetime can migrate
through the disc and stall at locations closer to the central star than is
normally the case for lower mass discs, resulting in closer agreement between
simulated and observed orbital architecture. The presence of a planet orbiting
in the cavity of a massive disc can prevent the cavity size from expanding to
the size of a lower mass disc. As the disc mass reduces over long time scales,
this indicates that circumbinary planet systems retain memory of their initial
conditions. Our simulations produce planetary orbits in good agreement with
Kepler-16b without the need for self-gravity; Kepler-34 analogue systems
produce wide and highly eccentric cavities, and self-gravity improves the
agreement between simulations and data. Kepler-35b is more difficult to explain
in detail due to it's relatively low mass, which results in the simulated
stopping location being at a larger radius than that observed.

localized subregions, each containing a rapidly evolving (positive)
minority-polarity magnetic-flux patch bathed in a (majority) negative-polarity
magnetic-flux background. At least several of the jets begin with eruptions of
what appear to be thin (thickness <~2"") miniature-filament (minifilament)
""strands"" from a magnetic neutral line where magnetic flux cancelation is
ongoing, consistent with the magnetic configuration presented for coronal-hole
jets in Sterling et al. (2015). Some jets strands are difficult/impossible to
detect, perhaps due to, e.g. their thinness, obscuration by surrounding bright
or dark features, or the absence of erupting cool-material minifilaments in
those jets. Tracing in detail the flux evolution in one of the subregions, we
find bursts of strong jetting occurring only during times of strong flux
cancelation. Averaged over seven jetting episodes, the cancelation rate was
~1.5x10^19 Mx/hr. An average flux of ~5x10^18 Mx canceled prior to each
episode, arguably building up ~10^28 - 10^29 ergs of free magnetic energy per
jet. From these and previous observations, we infer that flux cancelation is
the fundamental process responsible for the pre-eruption buildup and triggering
of at least many jets in active regions, quiet regions, and coronal holes.

find a gauge invariant operator whose expectation value provides the leading

classical state. These results can be unified through a generic statement about
the nature of Schmidt decompositions and decoherence in large-N theories. In
the reverse direction, we extend de Finetti theorems in various ways and

G/D) depends on (surface) density. The variations of the G/D provide
constraints on the timescales for the different processes involved in the
lifecycle of metals in galaxies. Recent G/D measurements based on Herschel data
suggest a factor 5---10 decrease in the dust abundance between the dense and
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Magellanic Clouds. However, the
relative nature of the Herschel measurements precludes definitive conclusions
on the magnitude of those variations. We investigate the variations of the dust
abundance in the LMC and SMC using all-sky far-infrared surveys, which do not
suffer from the limitations of Herschel on their zero-point calibration. We
stack the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) at 100, 350, 550, and 850
microns from IRAS and Planck in intervals of gas surface density, model the
stacked SEDs to derive the dust surface density, and constrain the relation
between G/D and gas surface density in the range 10---100 \Msu pc$^{-2}$ on
$\sim$ 80 pc scales. We find that G/D decreases by factors of 3 (from 1500 to
500) in the LMC and 7 (from 1.5$\times 10^4$ to 2000) in the SMC between the
diffuse and dense ISM. The surface density dependence of G/D is consistent with
elemental depletions and with simple modeling of the accretion of gas-phase
metals onto dust grains. This result has important implications for the
sub-grid modeling of galaxy evolution, and for the calibration of dust-based
gas mass estimates, both locally and at high-redshift.

exposed to sunlight. Traditional methods of service life prediction involve the
use of outdoor exposure in harsh UV environments (e.g., Florida and Arizona).
Such tests, however, require too much time (generally many years) to do an
evaluation. Non-scientific attempts to simply ""speed up the clock"" result in
incorrect predictions. This paper describes the statistical methods that were
developed for a scientifically-based approach to using laboratory accelerated
tests to produce timely predictions of outdoor service life. The approach
involves careful experimentation and identifying a physics/chemistry-motivated
model that will adequately describe photodegradation paths of polymeric
materials. The model incorporates the effects of explanatory variables UV
spectrum, UV intensity, temperature, and humidity. We use a nonlinear
mixed-effects model to describe the sample paths. The methods are illustrated
with accelerated laboratory test data for a model epoxy coating. The validity
of the methodology is checked by extending our model to allow for dynamic
covariates and comparing predictions with specimens that were exposed in an
outdoor environment where the explanatory variables are uncontrolled but
recorded.

whether the effect of feedback is positive (enhanced star formation) or
negative (quenched star formation), and to what extent. We performed a series
of 12 hydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies, 10 barred and 2 unbarred,
with various initial gas fractions and AGN feedback prescriptions. In barred
galaxies, gas is driven toward the centre of the galaxy and causes a starburst,
followed by a slow decay, while in unbarred galaxies the SFR increases slowly
and steadily. AGN feedback suppresses star formation near the central black
hole. Gas is pushed away from the black hole, and collides head-on with
inflowing gas, forming a dense ring at a finite radius where star formation is
enhanced. We conclude that both negative and positive feedback are present, and
these effects mostly cancel out. There is no net quenching or enhancement in
star formation, but rather a displacement of the star formation sites to larger
radii. In unbarred galaxies, where the density of the central gas is lower,
quenching of star formation near the black hole is more efficient, and
enhancement of star formation at larger radii is less efficient. As a result,
negative feedback dominates. Lowering the gas fraction reduces the star
formation rate at all radii, whether or not there is a bar or an AGN.

Anti-de Sitter (AdS) within spherical symmetry, but little is known about this
nonlinear instability in the purely gravitational sector, where spherical
symmetry is necessarily broken. In \cite{Bizon:2011gg} the onset of such
nonlinear instability was associated with the existence of irremovable secular
resonances at third order in perturbation theory. Furthermore, it was also
conjectured in \cite{Bizon:2011gg} that certain very fine tuned initial data
would not collapse. Such solutions, upon linearisation, correspond to
individual normal modes of AdS, which can be consistently backreacted to all
orders in perturbation theory. However, the analysis of \cite{Bizon:2011gg} was
restricted to spherical symmetry. The perturbative arguments of
\cite{Bizon:2011gg} were then generalised to gravitational perturbations in
\cite{Dias:2011ss}, and in particular certain time-periodic solutions were also
conjectured to exist - these were coined geons. However, in \cite{Dias:2011ss},
only a certain class of perturbations was considered, for which the
perturbative analysis considerably simplifies. In this manuscript we present
details of the systematic computational formalism and an exhaustive and
complementary analysis of physical properties of the geons and gravitational
AdS instability that were absent in our companion Letter \cite{Dias:2016ewl}.
In particular, we find that, unlike in spherical symmetry, a (single)
gravitational normal mode of AdS can be backreacted to generate a nonlinear
solution only in very exceptional circumstances. We also show that weak
turbulent perturbative theory predicts the existence of direct and inverse
cascades, and give evidence suggesting that the former dominates the latter for
equal energy two-mode seeds.

holes and calculating ringdown gravitational waves after the collision of two
black holes. Most previous calculations were carried out at the level of the
field equations instead of the action. In this work, we compute the
Einstein-Hilbert action to quadratic order in linear metric perturbations about
a spherically symmetric vacuum background in Regge-Wheeler gauge. Using a 2+2
splitting of spacetime, we expand the metric perturbations into a sum over
scalar, vector, and tensor spherical harmonics, and dimensionally reduce the
action to two dimensions by integrating over the two sphere. We find that the
axial perturbation degree of freedom is described by a two dimensional massive
vector action, and that the polar perturbation degree of freedom is described
by a two dimensional dilaton massive gravity action. Varying the dimensionally
reduced actions, we rederive covariant and gauge-invariant master equations for
the axial and polar degrees of freedom. Thus, the two dimensional massive
vector and massive gravity actions we derive by dimensionally reducing the
perturbed Einstein-Hilbert action describe the dynamics of a well studied
physical system: the metric perturbations of a static black hole. The $2+2$
formalism we present can be generalized to $m+n$ dimensional spacetime
splittings, which may be useful in more generic situations, such as expanding
metric perturbations in higher dimensional gravity. We provide a self-contained
presentation of $m+n$ formalism for vacuum spacetime splittings.

the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric

a solution for these two challenges by suggesting the use of fog computing for
AEMoD systems, and developing an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching
scheme for its vehicles. A queuing model representing the proposed multi-class
charging and dispatching scheme is first introduced. The stability conditions
of this model and the number of classes that fit the charging capabilities of
any given city zone are then derived. Decisions on the proportions of each
class vehicles to partially/fully charge, or directly serve customers are then
optimized using a stochastic linear program that minimizes the maximum response
time of the system. Results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized
decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal split schemes.

spectroscopy we study how the cold gas content relates to the star formation
rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate. CO(1-0) is detected in 8 of 14
targets and CO(2-1) is detected in 7 out of 11 cases. The majority of
disc-dominated QSOs reveal gas fractions and depletion times well matching
normal star forming systems. Two gas-rich major mergers show clear starburst
signatures with higher than average gas fractions and shorter depletion times.
Bulge-dominated QSO hosts are mainly undetected in CO(1-0) which corresponds,
on average, to lower gas fractions than in disc-dominated counterparts. Their
SFRs however imply shorter than average depletion times and higher star
formation efficiencies. Negative QSO feedback through removal of cold gas seems
to play a negligible role in our sample. We find a trend between black hole
accretion rate and total molecular gas content for disc-dominated QSOs when
combined with literature samples. We interpret this as an upper envelope for
nuclear activity which is well represented by a scaling relation between the
total and circum-nuclear gas reservoir accessible for accretion.
Bulge-dominated QSOs significantly differ from that scaling relation and appear
uncorrelated with the total molecular gas content. This could be explained
either by a more compact gas reservoir, blow out of the gas envelope through
outflows, or a different ISM phase composition.

outstanding issues in stellar modelling. The precise asteroseismic measurements

studies of the near-core structure of such stars, which had not been possible
before. Here we provide stringent tests of various core-mixing scenarios
against the largely unbiased population of red-clump stars belonging to the old
open clusters monitored by Kepler, and by coupling the updated precise
inference on $\Delta\Pi_1$ in thousands field stars with spectroscopic
constraints. We find that models with moderate overshooting successfully
reproduce the range observed of $\Delta\Pi_1$ in clusters. In particular we
show that there is no evidence for the need to extend the size of the
adiabatically stratified core, at least at the beginning of the HeCB phase.
This conclusion is based primarily on ensemble studies of $\Delta\Pi_1$ as a
function of mass and metallicity. While $\Delta\Pi_1$ shows no appreciable
dependence on the mass, we have found a clear dependence of $\Delta\Pi_1$ on
metallicity, which is also supported by predictions from models.

single-degenerate binary system. The recently discovered Balmer-dominated
shocks mark the impact of the forward shock with low density, partially neutral
CSM gas, and form a partial shell encircling clumps of material exhibiting
radiative shocks. The WiFeS spectra of N103B cover the range 3500 - 7000

that in addition to from the usual broad and narrow emission components, a
third component of intermediate width exists in the Balmer-dominated shocks,
ranging from around 125 km/s up to 225 km/s in width. Recent Balmer-dominated
shock models have predicted such an intermediate-width component will be

introduce a framework of periodograms, called ""Agatha"", to disentangle periodic
signals from correlated noise and to solve the 2-dimensional model selection
problem: signal dimension and noise model dimension. These periodograms are
calculated by applying likelihood maximization and marginalization and combined
in a self-consistent way. We compare Agatha with other periodograms for the
detection of Keplerian signals in synthetic radial velocity data produced for
the Radial Velocity Challenge as well as in radial velocity datasets of several
Sun-like stars. In our tests we find Agatha is able to recover signals to the
adopted detection limit of the radial velocity challenge. Applied to real
radial velocity, we use Agatha to confirm previous analysis of CoRoT-7 and to
find two new planet candidates with minimum masses of 15.1 $M_\oplus$ and 7.08
$M_\oplus$ orbiting HD177565 and HD41248, with periods of 44.5 d and 13.4 d,
respectively. We find that Agatha outperforms other periodograms in terms of
removing correlated noise and assessing the significances of signals with more
robust metrics. Moreover, it can be used to select the optimal noise model and
to test the consistency of signals in time. Agatha is intended to be flexible
enough to be applied to time series analyses in other astronomical and
scientific disciplines. Agatha is available at http://www.agatha.herts.ac.uk.

Motivated by the porous nature of the cardiac tissue, in this study we also
propose a nonlinear Fickian flux formulated by Taylor expanding the voltage
dependent diffusion coefficient up to quadratic terms. A fine tuning of the
diffusive parameters is performed a priori to match the conduction velocity of
the equivalent cable model. The resulting combined effects are then studied by
numerically simulating different stimulation protocols on a one-dimensional
cable. Model features are compared in terms of action potential morphology,
restitution curves, frequency spectra and spatio-temporal phase differences.
Two-dimensional long-run simulations are finally performed to characterize
spiral breakup during sustained fibrillation at different thermal states.
Temperature and nonlinear diffusion effects are found to impact the
repolarization phase of the action potential wave with non-monotone patterns

methods for 3d human pose estimation have focused on deep end-to-end systems

performance, it is often not easy to understand whether their remaining error
stems from a limited 2d pose (visual) understanding, or from a failure to map
2d poses into 3-dimensional positions. With the goal of understanding these
sources of error, we set out to build a system that given 2d joint locations
predicts 3d positions. Much to our surprise, we have found that, with current
technology, ""lifting"" ground truth 2d joint locations to 3d space is a task
that can be solved with a remarkably low error rate: a relatively simple deep
feed-forward network outperforms the best reported result by about 30\% on

bounds can be evaluated prior to sensor deployment and provide insights into

""operating systems"" of modern big data architectures and supercomputing
systems. Job schedulers allocate computing resources and control the execution
of processes on those resources. Historically, job schedulers were the domain
of supercomputers, and job schedulers were designed to run massive,
long-running computations over days and weeks. More recently, big data
workloads have created a need for a new class of computations consisting of
many short computations taking seconds or minutes that process enormous
quantities of data. For both supercomputers and big data systems, the
efficiency of the job scheduler represents a fundamental limit on the
efficiency of the system. Detailed measurement and modeling of the performance
of schedulers are critical for maximizing the performance of a large-scale
computing system. This paper presents a detailed feature analysis of 15
supercomputing and big data schedulers. For big data workloads, the scheduler
latency is the most important performance characteristic of the scheduler. A
theoretical model of the latency of these schedulers is developed and used to
design experiments targeted at measuring scheduler latency. Detailed
benchmarking of four of the most popular schedulers (Slurm, Son of Grid Engine,
Mesos, and Hadoop YARN) are conducted. The theoretical model is compared with
data and demonstrates that scheduler performance can be characterized by two
key parameters: the marginal latency of the scheduler $t_s$ and a nonlinear
exponent $\alpha_s$. For all four schedulers, the utilization of the computing
system decreases to < 10\% for computations lasting only a few seconds.
Multilevel schedulers that transparently aggregate short computations can
improve utilization for these short computations to > 90\% for all four of the
schedulers that were tested.

three-point standard quadrature rules, we construct directly a single two-point

instances of big 3D objects from multiple, unorganized and unstructured point
clouds, in presence of dynamic clutter and occlusions. In contrast to
conventional scanning, where the background is assumed to be rather static, we
aim at handling dynamic clutter where background drastically changes during the
object scanning. Currently, it is tedious to solve this with available methods
unless the object of interest is first segmented out from the rest of the
scene. We address the problem by assuming the availability of a prior CAD
model, roughly resembling the object to be reconstructed. This assumption
almost always holds in applications such as industrial inspection or reverse
engineering. With aid of this prior acting as a proxy, we propose a fully
enhanced pipeline, capable of automatically detecting and segmenting the object
of interest from scenes and creating a pose graph, online, with linear
complexity. This allows initial scan alignment to the CAD model space, which is
then refined without the CAD constraint to fully recover a high fidelity 3D
reconstruction, accurate up to the sensor noise level. We also contribute a
novel object detection method, local implicit shape models (LISM) and give a
fast verification scheme. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets,
demonstrating the ability to accurately reconstruct objects from small sizes up
to $125m^3$.

Parallel computing has the potential to significantly reduce the time taken to

performance for its design. We then go on to introduce new theory for
developing more efficient parallel algorithms. The theory utilises elements of
the symmetric group to apply a permutation to the objective functions to assign
different workloads, and applies to algorithms that order the objective
functions lexicographically. As a result, information and updated bounds can be
shared in real time, creating a synergy between threads. We design and
implement two algorithms that take advantage of such theory. To properly
analyse the running time of our three algorithms, we compare them against two
existing algorithms from the literature, and against using multiple threads

output patterns. Although such networks are omnipresent in neural systems,
their structures are typically unknown or poorly characterized. It is therefore
valuable to use a supervised approach for resolving how a network encodes
distinct inputs of interest, and the superposition of those inputs from sampled
multiple node time series. In this paper we show that accomplishing such a task
involves finding a low-dimensional state space from supervised recordings. We
demonstrate that standard methods for dimension reduction are unable to provide
the desired functionality of optimal separation of the fixed points and
transient trajectories to them. However, the combination of dimension reduction
with selection and optimization can successfully provide such functionality.
Specifically, we propose two methods: Exclusive Threshold Reduction (ETR) and
Optimal Exclusive Threshold Reduction (OETR) for finding a basis for the
classification state space. We show that the classification space constructed
upon combination of dimension reduction optimal separation can directly
facilitate recognition of stimuli, and classify complex inputs (mixtures) into
similarity classes. We test our methodology and compare it to standard
state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset - an experimental neuronal
network (the olfactory system) that we recorded from to test these methods. We
show that our methods are capable of providing a basis for the classification

sufficiently smooth to meet the tolerances described in Trott & Wayth (2016) to

applying a separable denoiser at each iteration, the performance of AMP (for
example, the mean squared error of its estimates) can be accurately tracked by
a simple, scalar iteration referred to as state evolution. Although separable
denoisers are sufficient if the unknown signal has independent and identically
distributed entries, in many real-world applications, like image or audio
signal reconstruction, the unknown signal contains dependencies between
entries. In these cases, a coordinate-wise independence structure is not a good
approximation to the true prior of the unknown signal. In this paper we assume

their structure, stability and even function. It is well know, for instance,
that proteins require a minimum amount of water to be functionally active.
Since the biological functions of proteins involve changes of conformation, and
sometimes chemical reactions, it is natural to expect a connection of these
functions with dynamical properties of the coupled system of proteins and their
hydration water. However, despite many years of intensive research, the
detailed nature of protein - hydration water interactions, and their effect on
the biochemical activity of proteins through peculiar dynamical effects, is
still partly unknown. In particular, models proposed so far, fail to explain
the full set of experimental data. The well-accepted 'protein dynamical
transition' scenario is based on perfect coupling between the dynamics of
proteins and of their hydration water, which has never been confuted
experimentally. We present high-energy resolution elastic neutron scattering
measurements of the atomistic dynamics of the model protein, lysozyme, in water
that were carried out on the IN16B spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin

proteins and of their hydration water are actually de-coupled. This important
result militates against the well-accepted scenario, and requires a new model
to link protein dynamics to the dynamics of its hydration water, and, in turn,
to biochemical function.

modulation at the stage of inflation, where the primordial power spectrum is
spatially varying. If the universe in the stage of inflation is Finslerian, and
if the Finsler spacetime is non-reversible under parity flip, $x\rightarrow-x$,
then a three dimensional spectrum which is the function of wave vector and
direction is valid. In this paper, a three dimensional primordial power
spectrum with preferred direction is derived in the framework of Finsler
spacetime. It is found that the amplitude of dipolar modulation is related to
the Finslerian parameter, which in turn is a function of wave vector. The

developed for Boston Airbnb reviews submitted in the English language and

to reduce the number of parameters and identify variables that are not

of the cycle joining and cross-join pairing methods to construct binary de

proof-of-concept.
  The cycles, in the cycle joining method, are typically generated by a linear
feedback shift register. We prove a crucial characterization that determining
Zech's logarithms is equivalent to identifying conjugate pairs shared by any
two distinct cycles. This speeds up the task of building a connected adjacency
subgraph that contains all vertices of the complete adjacency graph. Distinct
spanning trees in either graph correspond to cyclically inequivalent de Bruijn
sequences. As the cycles are being joined, guided by the conjugate pairs, we
track the changes in the feedback function. Certificates of star or almost-star
spanning trees conveniently handle large order cases.
  The characterization of conjugate pairs via Zech's logarithms, as positional
markings, is then adapted to identify cross-join pairs. A modified $m$-sequence
is initially used, for ease of generation. The process can be repeated on each
of the resulting de Bruijn sequences. We show how to integrate an analytic
tool, attributed to Fryers, in the process.
  Most prior constructions in the literature measure the complexity of the
corresponding bit-by-bit algorithms. Our approach is different. We aim first to
build a connected adjacency subgraph that is certified to contain all of the
cycles as vertices. The ingredients are computed just once and concisely
stored. Simple strategies are offered to keep the complexities low as the order
grows.

systems with a great success. We present a phone-aware neural LID architecture,
which is a deep LSTM-RNN LID system but accepts output from an RNN-based ASR
system. By utilizing the phonetic knowledge, the LID performance can be
significantly improved. Interestingly, even if the test language is not
involved in the ASR training, the phonetic knowledge still presents a large
contribution. Our experiments conducted on four languages within the Babel

Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for solving singular linear systems. It is
known that GMRES determines a least squares solution without breakdown if the
coefficient matrix is range-symmetric (EP), or if its range and nullspace are
disjoint (GP) and the system is consistent. We show that the accuracy of GMRES
iterates may deteriorate in practice due to three distinct factors: (i) the
inconsistency of the linear system; (ii) the distance of the initial residual
to the nullspace of the coefficient matrix; (iii) the extremal principal angles
between the ranges of the coefficient matrix and its transpose. These factors
lead to poor conditioning of the extended Hessenberg matrix in the Arnoldi
decomposition and affect the accuracy of the computed least squares solution.
We also compare GMRES with the range restricted GMRES (RR-GMRES) method.
Numerical experiments show typical behaviors of GMRES for small problems with
EP and GP matrices.

original Hamiltonian to cancel out diabatic transitions. The counter-diabatic
Hamiltonian is constructed by using the eigenstates of the original

counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems. Even if the
counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems is obtained, it is
generally non-local and even diverges at critical points. We construct an
approximated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for the infinite-range Ising model by
making use of the mean-field approximation. An advantage of this method is that
the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is constructed by only local
operators. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through
quantum annealing processes going the vicinity of the critical point. It is
also confirmed that the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is still
well-defined in the limit to the critical point. The present method can take
higher order contributions into account and is consistent with the variational

central to news, emergency events, and people's daily lives. Automatic
identification of locations associated with or mentioned in documents has been
explored for decades. As one of the most popular online social network
platforms, Twitter has attracted a large number of users who send millions of
tweets on daily basis. Due to the world-wide coverage of its users and
real-time freshness of tweets, location prediction on Twitter has gained
significant attention in recent years. Research efforts are spent on dealing
with new challenges and opportunities brought by the noisy, short, and
context-rich nature of tweets. In this survey, we aim at offering an overall
picture of location prediction on Twitter. Specifically, we concentrate on the
prediction of user home locations, tweet locations, and mentioned locations. We
first define the three tasks and review the evaluation metrics. By summarizing
Twitter network, tweet content, and tweet context as potential inputs, we then
structurally highlight how the problems depend on these inputs. Each dependency
is illustrated by a comprehensive review of the corresponding strategies
adopted in state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we also briefly review two
related problems, i.e., semantic location prediction and point-of-interest
recommendation. Finally, we list future research directions.

which, in turn, relies on factors internal and external to the galaxies. In
order to provide a simple model for how star formation is regulated by various
physical processes in galaxies, we analyse data at redshift $z=0$ from a
hydrodynamical cosmological simulation that includes prescriptions for star
formation and stellar evolution, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and their
associated feedback processes. This model can determine the star formation rate
(SFR) as a function of galaxy stellar mass, gas mass, black hole mass, and
environment. We find that gas mass is the most important quantity controlling
star formation in low-mass galaxies, and star-forming galaxies in dense
environments have higher SFR than their counterparts in the field. In high-mass
galaxies, we find that black holes more massive than $\sim10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$
can be triggered to quench star formation in their host; this mass scale is
emergent in our simulations. Furthermore, this black hole mass corresponds to a
galaxy bulge mass $\sim2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, consistent with the mass at
which galaxies start to become dominated by early types ($\sim3\times10^{10}$
M$_\odot$, as previously shown in observations by Kauffmann et al.). Finally,
we demonstrate that our model can reproduce well the SFR measured from
observations of galaxies in the GAMA and ALFALFA surveys.

of predicting long-term scientific impact (LTSI) usually measured by the number
of citations accumulated by a paper in the long-term. It is well known that
early citations (within 1-2 years after publication) acquired by a paper
positively affects its LTSI. However, there is no work that investigates if the
set of authors who bring in these early citations to a paper also affect its
LTSI. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time, the impact of these
authors whom we call early citers (EC) on the LTSI of a paper. Note that this
study of the complex dynamics of EC introduces a brand new paradigm in citation
behavior analysis. Using a massive computer science bibliographic dataset we
identify two distinct categories of EC - we call those authors who have high
overall publication/citation count in the dataset as influential and the rest
of the authors as non-influential. We investigate three characteristic
properties of EC and present an extensive analysis of how each category
correlates with LTSI in terms of these properties. In contrast to popular
perception, we find that influential EC negatively affects LTSI possibly owing
to attention stealing. To motivate this, we present several representative
examples from the dataset. A closer inspection of the collaboration network
reveals that this stealing effect is more profound if an EC is nearer to the
authors of the paper being investigated. As an intuitive use case, we show that
incorporating EC properties in the state-of-the-art supervised citation
prediction models leads to high performance margins. At the closing, we present
an online portal to visualize EC statistics along with the prediction results

asymptotic normality also holds for discontinuous functions under mild

mixed partial gradients satisfy a H\""older condition. As a by-product, we find
lower bounds for the variance of the HSFC-based estimate. Particularly, for
nontrivial functions in $C^1([0,1]^d)$, the low bound is of order $n^{-1-2/d}$,
which matches the rate of the upper bound established in He and Owen (2016).

the inertia subgroup at $p$ of an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We first discuss
the result when $G$ is an abelian group. Then in the case that $G$ is of odd

we give an explicit presentation of the Galois group of the maximal pro-odd

single unicast index coding problems (SNC-SUICP) with number of messages equal

index coding problems, an optimal index code construction by using Vandermonde
matrices was proposed. This construction requires all the side-information at
the receivers to decode their wanted messages and also requires large field
size. In an earlier work, we constructed binary matrices of size $m \times n
(m\geq n)$ such that any $n$ adjacent rows of the matrix are linearly
independent over every field. Calling these matrices as Adjacent Independent
Row (AIR) matrices using which we gave an optimal scalar linear index code for
the one-sided SNC-SUICP for any given number of messages and one-sided
side-information. By using Vandermonde matrices or AIR matrices, every receiver
needs to solve $K-D$ equations with $K-D$ unknowns to obtain its wanted
message, where $K$ is the number of messages and $D$ is the size of the
side-information. In this paper, we analyze some of the combinatorial
properties of the AIR matrices. By using these properties, we present a
low-complexity decoding which helps to identify a reduced set of
side-information for each users with which the decoding can be carried out. By
this method every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by
simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols). We explicitly give
both the reduced set of side-information and the broadcast messages to be used
by each receiver to decode its wanted message. For a given pair or receivers
our decoding identifies which one will perform better than the other when the
broadcast channel is noisy.

which initially share an entangled state, and some open problems, which emerge
during quantum steering that Alice remotely steers Bob, are investigated. Our
analytical results indicate that all entangled pure states and maximally
entangled evolution states (EESs) are steerable, and not every entangled
evolution state is steerable and some steerable states are only locally
correlated. Besides, quantum steering from Alice to Bob experiences a ""sudden
death"" with increasing decoherence strength. However, shortly after that,
quantum steering experiences a recovery with the increase of decoherence
strength in bit flip (BF) and phase flip (PF) channels. Interestingly, while
they initially share an entangled pure state, all EESs are steerable and obey
Bell nonlocality in PF and phase damping channels. In BF channels, all
steerable states can violate Bell-CHSH inequality, but some EESs are unable to
be employed to realize steering. However, when they initially share an
entangled mixed state, the outcome is different from that of the pure state.
Furthermore, the steerability of entangled mixed states is weaker than that of
entangled pure states. Thereby, decoherence can induce the degradation of
quantum steering, and the steerability of state is associated with the
interaction between quantum systems and reservoirs.

between entities, have been widely utilized in various knowledge-driven
applications. Since the overall human knowledge is innumerable that still grows
explosively and changes frequently, knowledge construction and update
inevitably involve automatic mechanisms with less human supervision, which
usually bring in plenty of noises and conflicts to KGs. However, most
conventional knowledge representation learning methods assume that all triple
facts in existing KGs share the same significance without any noises. To
address this problem, we propose a novel confidence-aware knowledge
representation learning framework (CKRL), which detects possible noises in KGs
while learning knowledge representations with confidence simultaneously.
Specifically, we introduce the triple confidence to conventional
translation-based methods for knowledge representation learning. To make triple
confidence more flexible and universal, we only utilize the internal structural
information in KGs, and propose three kinds of triple confidences considering
both local and global structural information. In experiments, We evaluate our
models on knowledge graph noise detection, knowledge graph completion and
triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our
confidence-aware models achieve significant and consistent improvements on all
tasks, which confirms the capability of CKRL modeling confidence with
structural information in both KG noise detection and knowledge representation
learning.

surfaces by tuning the chemistry potential, which naturally gives rise to
finite-momentum Cooper pairings. The phase transition is accompanied by changed
Chern numbers, in which, different from the conventional picture, the band gap
does not close. By beyond-mean-field calculations, we find the finite-momentum
pairing is more robust, yielding the system promising for maintaining the FF

(SfM) solution for oblique unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. First, an
algorithm, considering spatial relationship constrains between image
footprints, is designed for match pair selection with assistant of UAV flight
control data and oblique camera mounting angles. Second, a topological
connection network (TCN), represented by an undirected weighted graph, is
constructed from initial match pairs, which encodes overlap area and
intersection angle into edge weights. Then, an algorithm, termed MST-Expansion,
is proposed to extract the match graph from the TCN where the TCN is firstly
simplified by a maximum spanning tree (MST). By further analysis of local
structure in the MST, expansion operations are performed on the nodes of the
MST for match graph enhancement, which is achieved by introducing critical
connections in two expansion directions. Finally, guided by the match graph, an
efficient SfM solution is proposed, and its validation is verified through
comprehensive analysis and comparison using three UAV datasets captured with
different oblique multi-camera systems. Experiment results demonstrate that the
efficiency of image matching is improved with a speedup ratio ranging from 19
to 35, and competitive orientation accuracy is achieved from both relative
bundle adjustment (BA) without GCPs (Ground Control Points) and absolute BA
with GCPs. At the same time, images in the three datasets are successfully
oriented. For orientation of oblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a
more efficient solution.

with the ancillas of $\mathcal R$. Here, we present a general formulation of
memoryless {\it composite} CMs, where $\mathcal S$ is partitioned into the very
open system under study $S$ coupled to one or more auxiliary systems $\{S_i\}$.
Their composite dynamics occurs through internal $S$-$\{S_i\}$ collisions
interspersed with external ones involving $\{S_i\}$ and the reservoir $\mathcal
R$. We show that important known instances of quantum {\it non-Markovian}
dynamics of $S$ -- such as the emission of an atom into a reservoir featuring a
Lorentzian, or multi-Lorentzian, spectral density or a qubit subject to random
telegraph noise -- can be mapped on to such {\it memoryless} composite CMs.

motions for a vehicle is addressed. Let us point out that a ""good"" modeling is
often quite difficult or even impossible to obtain. It is due for example to
parametric uncertainties, for the vehicle mass, inertia or for the interaction
forces between the wheels and the road pavement. To overcome this type of
difficulties, we consider a model-free control approach leading to
""intelligent"" controllers. The longitudinal and the lateral motions, on one
hand, and the driving/braking torques and the steering wheel angle, on the
other hand, are respectively the output and the input variables. An important
part of this work is dedicated to present simulation results with actual data.
Actual data, used in Matlab as reference trajectories, have been previously
recorded with an instrumented Peugeot 406 experimental car. The simulation
results show the efficiency of our approach. Some comparisons with a nonlinear
flatness-based control in one hand, and with a classical PID control in another
hand confirm this analysis. Other virtual data have been generated through the
interconnected platform SiVIC/RTMaps, which is a virtual simulation platform
for prototyping and validation of advanced driving assistance systems.

obtained at high SNR and its performance approaches the exact threshold. We
derive expressions for the average bit error probability in the presence and
absence of the threshold estimation error showing that a small number of pilot

two different structures, one consisting of bulk high-resistivity Si and the

free charge carriers in metallic and dielectric materials interacting with

described by either the Drude or the plasma model, whereas the free charge
carriers in dielectric materials at room temperature are either taken into

forces, computed in the micrometer separation range using these four
approaches, are widely distinct from each other and can be easily discriminated

estimates concerning the harmonic measures for the walk in a grid domain which
estimates are useful for showing the convergence of a LERW (loop-erased random
walk) to an SLE (stochastic Loewner evolution). We assume that the walk started
at a fixed vertex of the graph satisfies the invariance principle as in Yadin
and Yehudayoff [16] in which the convergence of LERW to a radial SLE is
established in this setting. Our main concern is chordal case, where a random
walk is started at a boundary vertex of a simply connected grid domain and
conditioned to exit it through another boundary vertex specified in advance.
The primary contribution of the present paper is an estimate, which states that
the excursion of the conditioned walk leaves an intrinsic neighborhood of its
initial point not 'along' the boundary but through an intrinsic interior of the
domain with high probability. Based on this result we give a proof for the
convergence to the chordal SLE, a result that has recently been proved by
Suzuki [12] under an analyticity assumption on the boundary of the domain
arising in the limit.

(e.g., by laser tweezers), while epigenetic enzymes (writers) and
chromatin-binding proteins (readers) are flooded into the system. We show that,
by tuning the stretching force and the binding affinity of the readers for
chromatin, the fibre undergoes a sharp transition between a stretched,
epigenetically disordered, state and a crumpled, epigenetically coherent, one.
We further investigate the case in which a knot is tied along the chromatin
fibre, and find that the knotted segment enhances local epigenetic order,
giving rise to ""epigenetic solitons"" which travel and diffuse along chromatin.
Our results point to an intriguing coupling between 3D chromatin topology and

a novel theoretical analysis of this global model, providing guarantees that

we show that for PAM$^2$ type constellations over the AWGN channel, the
performance loss caused by using a hard decoded stage for all modulation bits

of two stage decoders to more challenging Rician channels, showing that in this

and increases to a maximum of three bits per dimension for the Rayleigh
channel. Finally, we apply the ADBP algorithm to further reduce the detection

tasks on multi-cores, where each heavy task exclusively executes on a number of
dedicated processors, while light tasks are treated as sequential sporadic
tasks and share the remaining processors. However, federated scheduling suffers
resource waste since a heavy task with processing capacity requirement $x +
\epsilon$ (where $x$ is an integer and $0 < \epsilon < 1$) needs $x + 1$
dedicated processors. In the extreme case, almost half of the processing
capacity is wasted. In this paper we propose the semi-federate scheduling
approach, which only grants $x$ dedicated processors to a heavy task with
processing capacity requirement $x + \epsilon$, and schedules the remaining
$\epsilon$ part together with light tasks on shared processors. Experiments
with randomly generated task sets show the semi-federated scheduling approach
significantly outperforms not only federated scheduling, but also all existing
approaches for scheduling parallel real-time tasks on multi-cores.

osmotic flows through a semi-permeable interface. To depict the
out-of-equilibrium transfer, the interface is represented by an energy barrier
that colloids have to overcome to be transmitted to the other side of the
membrane. This energy barrier thus represents the selectivity of the membrane.
Furthermore, this energy barrier induces additional force terms in the momentum
and the mass balances on the fluid and the colloids phases. Based on a two-
fluid model, these forces can reproduce the physics of the osmotic flow without
the use of the semi-empirical laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It is
shown that a decrease in local pressure near the interface initiates osmosis.
When these balance equations are solved in a transient mode, the dynamic of the
osmotic flow can be described. The paper illustrates these potentialities by
showing the dynamic of an osmosis process occurring in the absence of
transmembrane pressure and both the dynamic of the reverse osmosis with a
constant flow through the membrane. A simulation reproducing the dynamic of the
Abb\'e Nollet experiment is presented. The role played by the colloid-membrane
interactions on the osmotic flow mechanism and on the counter osmotic pressure
is analyzed and discussed in great details.

demand for systems to be 'forensic ready'- to maximise the potential use of
evidence whilst minimising the costs of an investigation. Researchers have
supported organisational forensic readiness efforts by proposing the use of
policies and processes, aligning systems with forensics objectives and training
employees. However, recent work has also proposed an alternative strategy for
implementing forensic readiness called forensic-by-design. This is an approach
that involves integrating requirements for forensics into relevant phases of
the systems development lifecycle with the aim of engineering forensic-ready
systems. While this alternative forensic readiness strategy has been discussed
in the literature, no previous research has examined the extent to which
organisations actually use this approach for implementing forensic readiness.
Hence, we investigate the extent to which organisations consider requirements
for forensics during systems development. We first assessed existing research
to identify the various perspectives of implementing forensic readiness, and
then undertook an online survey to investigate the consideration of
requirements for forensics during systems development lifecycles. Our findings
provide an initial assessment of the extent to which requirements for forensics
are considered within organisations. We then use our findings, coupled with the
literature, to identify a number of research challenges regarding the
engineering of forensic-ready systems.

temperature with respect to bulk Al, already observed in the past, this spatial

  optimal exit time problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the control problem with \textit{exit time}. Unlike the Bolza and
Mayer problems, in this problem the terminal time of the trajectories is not
fixed, but it is the first time at which they reach a given closed subset -
\textit{the target}. The most studied example is the \textit{optimal time
problem}, where we want to steer a point to the target in minimal time. In this
section, we first introduce the exit time problem, then we recall the existence
of optimal controls, and some regularity results for the value function. We
then use a suitable form of the \textit{Pontryagin maximum principle} to study
some optimality conditions and sensitivity relations for the exit time problem.
The strongest regularity property for the value function that one can expect,
in fairly general cases, is \textit{semiconcavity}. In this case, the value
function is twice differentiable almost everywhere. Furthermore, in general, it
fails to be differentiable at points where there are multiple optimal
trajectories and its differentiability at a point does not guarantee continuous
differentiability around this point. In the subsection \ref{S3} we shown that,
under suitable assumptions, the nonemptiness of proximal subdifferential of the
value function at a point implies its continuous differentiability on a
neighborhood of this point.

evaluated by deploying Area Under the Curve (AUC) - an application of receiver
operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of
Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. A
zero-truncated negative binomial model is implemented to measure the extent to
which different bibliometric and altmetric factors contribute to citation
counts. Blog count appears to be the most important factor increasing the
number of citations by 38.6% in the field of Health Professions and Nursing,
followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field
of Physics and Astronomy. Interestingly, both Blog count and Twitter count
always show positive increase in the number of citations across all fields.
While there was a positive weak correlation between bibliometric and altmetric
indices, the results show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to
discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC= 0.725
between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings
suggest that altmetrics could better distinguish highly cited publications.

things, journals are considered as units of analysis for bibliographic
databases such as the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. In addition to
disciplinary classifications of journals, journal citation patterns span
networks across boundaries to variable extents. Using betweenness centrality
(BC) and diversity, we elaborate on the question of how to distinguish and rank
journals in terms of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, however, is
difficult to operationalize in the absence of an operational definition of
disciplines, the diversity of a unit of analysis is sample-dependent. BC can be
considered as a measure of multi-disciplinarity. Diversity of co-citation in a
citing document has been considered as an indicator of knowledge integration,
but an author can also generate trans-disciplinary--that is,
non-disciplined--variation by citing sources from other disciplines. Diversity
in the bibliographic coupling among citing documents can analogously be
considered as diffusion of knowledge across disciplines. Because the citation
networks in the cited direction reflect both structure and variation, diversity
in this direction is perhaps the best available measure of interdisciplinarity
at the journal level. Furthermore, diversity is based on a summation and can
therefore be decomposed, differences among (sub)sets can be tested for
statistical significance. In an appendix, a general-purpose routine for
measuring diversity in networks is provided.

transitions of a truncated Lennard-Jones fluid at a flat structureless wall.
Binding potential calculations predict that the nature of these transitions
depends on whether the wall-fluid attraction has a long ranged (LR) power law
decay, or is instead truncated, rendering it short ranged (SR). Using grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulation and classical density functional theory we
examine both cases in detail. We find that for the LR case wetting is first
order, while drying is continuous (critical) and occurs exactly at zero
attractive wall strength, ie. in the limit of a hard wall. In the SR case,
drying is also critical but the order of the wetting transition depends on the
truncation range of the wall-fluid potential. We characterize the approach to
critical drying and wetting in terms of the density and local compressibility
profiles and via the finite-size scaling properties of the probability
distribution of the overall density. For the LR case, where the drying point is
known exactly, this analysis allows us to estimate the exponent $\nu_\parallel$
which controls the parallel correlation length, i.e. the extent of vapor
bubbles at the wall. Surprisingly, the value we obtain is over twice that
predicted by mean field and renormalization group calculations, despite the
fact that our three dimensional system is at the upper critical dimension where
mean field theory for critical exponents is expected to hold. We suggest
reasons for this discrepancy.

nature of a black hole. A high value of greybody factor indicates a high
probability that Hawking radiation can reach infinity. Although general
relativity is correct and has been successful in describing many phenomena,
there are some questions that general relativity cannot answer. Therefore,
general relativity is often modified to attain answers. One of the
modifications is the `massive gravity'. The viable model of the massive gravity
theory belongs to de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT). In this paper, we
calculate the gravitational potential for the de Sitter black hole and for the
dRGT black hole. We also derive the rigorous bound on the greybody factor for
the de Sitter black hole and the dRGT black hole. It is found that the
structure of potentials determines how much the rigorous bound on the greybody
factor should be. That is, the higher the potential, the lesser the bound on
the greybody factor will be. Moreover, we compare the greybody factor derived
from the rigorous bound with the greybody factor derived from the matching
technique. The result shows that the rigorous bound is a true lower bound
because it is less than the greybody factor obtained from the matching
technique.

recovered from much fewer measurements than those suggested by the Shannon
sampling theorem. Nevertheless, recoverability does not only depend on the
signal, but also on the measurement scheme. The measurement matrix should
behave as close as possible to an isometry for the signals of interest.
Therefore the search for optimal CS measurement matrices of size $m\times n$
translates into the search for a set of $n$ $m$-dimensional vectors with
minimal coherence. Best Complex Antipodal Spherical Codes (BCASCs) are known to
be optimal in terms of coherence. An iterative algorithm for BCASC generation
has been recently proposed that tightly approaches the theoretical lower bound
on coherence. Unfortunately, the complexity of each iteration depends
quadratically on $m$ and $n$. In this work we propose a modification of the
algorithm that allows reducing the quadratic complexity to linear on both $m$
and $n$. Numerical evaluation showed that the proposed approach does not worsen
the coherence of the resulting BCASCs. On the contrary, an improvement was
observed for large $n$. The reduction of the computational complexity paves the
way for using the BCASCs as CS measurement matrices in problems with large $n$.
We evaluate the CS performance of the BCASCs for recovering sparse signals. The
BCASCs are shown to outperform both complex random matrices and Fourier
ensembles as CS measurement matrices, both in terms of coherence and sparse
recovery performance, especially for low $m/n$, which is the case of interest
in CS.

i.e, we impose $s_1 \ll G m_1^2/c$ and $m_1 \ll m_2$, where $m_2$ is the mass
parameter of the background Kerr spacetime. We encapsulate the correction to
the spin precession in $\psi$, the ratio of the accumulated spin-precession

  In this work, we use various more traditional complexity-theoretic tools to

  -- Nondeterminism and beyond: We introduce the nondeterministic congested

the constant-round decision hierarchy (analogous to the polynomial hierarchy).

bounds for the congested clique. In particular, we prove a time hierarchy
theorem for the congested clique, showing that there are decision problems of
essentially all complexities, both in the deterministic and nondeterministic

the detect signals of known structure and amplitude smaller than the level of
the contaminating noise. Under the assumption of stationary Gaussian noise, MF
maximizes the probability of detection subject to a constant probability of
false detection or false alarm (PFA). This property relies upon a priori
knowledge of the position of the searched signals, which is usually not
available. Recently, it has been shown that when applied in its standard form,
MF may severely underestimate the PFA. As a consequence the statistical
significance of features that belong to noise is overestimated and the
resulting detections are actually spurious. For this reason, an alternative
method of computing the PFA has been proposed that is based on the probability
density function (PDF) of the peaks of an isotropic Gaussian random field. In
this paper we further develop this method. In particular, we discuss the
statistical meaning of the PFA and show that, although useful as a preliminary
step in a detection procedure, it is not able to quantify the actual
reliability of a specific detection. For this reason, a new quantity is
introduced called the specific probability of false alarm (SPFA), which is able
to carry out this computation. We show how this method works in targeted

this paper, we investigate numerically the properties of a gas of underdamped
self-propelled dumbbells subject to Brownian noise of increasing intensity, in
order to understand how the notion of pressure is recovered as noise
progressively masks the effects of self-propulsion and the system approaches
thermodynamic equilibrium. The simulations performed for a mobile asymmetric
wall separating two chambers containing an equal number of active dumbbells
highlight some subtle and unexpected properties of the system. First, Brownian
noise of moderate intensity is sufficient to let mean forces equilibrate for
small values of the damping coefficient, while much stronger noise is required
for larger values of the damping coefficient. Moreover, the displacement of the
mean position of the wall upon increase of the intensity of the noise is not
necessarily monotonous and may instead display changes of direction. Both facts
actually reflect the existence of several mechanisms leading to the rupture of
force balance, which tend to displace the mean position of the wall towards
different directions and display different robustness against an increase of
the intensity of Brownian noise. This work therefore provides a clear
illustration of the fact that driving an autonomous system towards (or away
from) thermodynamic equilibrium may not be a straightforward process, but may
instead proceed through the variations of the relative weights of several
conflicting mechanisms.

explore the Fourth Moment Theorem and universality properties for homogeneous
sums, while the last part approaches the classical theory of orthogonal
polynomials via the invariant theory of binary forms. Specifically, Part I
deals with the Lindberg method of influence functions in free probability
spaces. By providing a general multidimensional invariance principle for
homogeneous sums in freely independent variables, a class of universal laws for
semicircular and free Poisson approximations will be derived that satisfies
also the so-called Fourth Moment phenomenon. It is known that the fourth moment
phenomenon for homogeneous sums applies, for instance, when X is Gaussian,
Poisson, semicircular or free Poisson distributed. Is there a characterizing
property enabling this phenomenon, or does it occur accidentally? The goal of
Part II is the characterization of random variables X such that homogeneous
sums based on i.i.d. copies of X verify the Fourth Moment Theorem, both for
classical and free probability spaces. The main results will be the
determination of a condition on the fourth cumulant of X that is sufficient for
the Fourth Moment Theorem to hold. The optimality of such condition is also
discussed. Part III has a purely algebraic flavour, and aims at recasting
orthogonality of polynomials within the invariant theory of binary forms
through the symbolic methods introduced by Kung and Rota. Then, by focusing on
apolarity. a unifying representation for (generalized) sequences of orthogonal
polynomials (in any number of variables) is achieved and explicit formulae for
the moments of the random discriminants are derived. In this specific case of
cumulants, a focus is presented within the combinatorial approach to stochastic
integration in terms of diagonal measures.

that the Laplacian on the links of this Cayley graph has a spectral gap $>
\frac{1}{2}$, then the group has property (T), or equivalently, every affine
isometric action of the group on a Hilbert space has a fixed point. We prove
that the same holds for affine isometric actions of the group on a uniformly
curved Banach space (for example an $L^p$-space with $1 < p < \infty$ or an
interpolation space between a Hilbert space and an arbitrary Banach space) as
soon as the Laplacian on the links has a two-sided spectral gap
$>1-\varepsilon$.
  This criterion applies to random groups in the triangular density model for
densities $> \frac{1}{3}$. In this way, we are able to generalize recent
results of Dru\c{t}u and Mackay to affine isometric actions of random groups on
uniformly curved Banach spaces. Also, in the setting of actions on
$L^p$-spaces, our results are quantitatively stronger, even in the case $p=2$.
This naturally leads to new estimates on the conformal dimension of the
boundary of random groups in the triangular model.
  Additionally, we obtain results on the eigenvalues of the $p$-Laplacian on
graphs, and on the spectrum and degree distribution of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi

where they form. Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant
planets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such
enrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the
disc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the
planets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This
arises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and
CO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal
poor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be
achieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are
considered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may
simultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.
This happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they
migrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles
sublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where
it formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,
it may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and
planetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect
that Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon
abundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of
Jupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from
carbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids.

type theory which combines two different type theories. We refer to them as the
inner and the outer type theory. In our case of interest, the inner theory is
homotopy type theory (HoTT) which may include univalent universes and higher
inductive types. The outer theory is a traditional form of type theory
validating uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP). One point of view on it is as
internalised meta-theory of the inner type theory.
  There are two motivations for 2LTT. Firstly, there are certain results about
HoTT which are of meta-theoretic nature, such as the statement that
semisimplicial types up to level $n$ can be constructed in HoTT for any
externally fixed natural number $n$. Such results cannot be expressed in HoTT
itself, but they can be formalised and proved in 2LTT, where $n$ will be a
variable in the outer theory. This point of view is inspired by observations
about conservativity of presheaf models.
  Secondly, 2LTT is a framework which is suitable for formulating additional
axioms that one might want to add to HoTT. This idea is heavily inspired by
Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), which constitutes one specific instance
of a 2LTT. HTS has an axiom ensuring that the type of natural numbers behaves
like the external natural numbers, which allows the construction of a universe
of semisimplicial types. In 2LTT, this axiom can be stated simply be asking the
inner and outer natural numbers to be isomorphic.
  After defining 2LTT, we set up a collection of tools with the goal of making
2LTT a convenient language for future developments. As a first such
application, we develop the theory of Reedy fibrant diagrams in the style of
Shulman. Continuing this line of thought, we suggest a definition of
(infinity,1)-category and give some examples.

universal structure phenomenon that occurs over the entire chart of nuclides.
Studies of the shape coexistence are important for understanding the
microscopic origin of collectivity and modifications of shell structure in
exotic nuclei far from stability. The aim of this work is to provide a
systematic analysis of characteristic signatures of coexisting nuclear shapes
in different mass regions, using a global self-consistent theoretical method
based on universal energy density functionals and the quadrupole collective
model. The low-energy excitation spectrum and quadrupole shape invariants of
the two lowest $0^{+}$ states of even-even nuclei are obtained as solutions of
a five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) model, with parameters
determined by constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the
relativistic energy density functional PC-PK1, and a finite-range pairing
interaction. The theoretical excitation energies of the states: $2^+_1$,
$4^+_1$, $0^+_2$, $2^+_2$, $2^+_3$, as well as the $B(E2; 0^+_1\to 2^+_1)$
values, are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental values
for 621 even-even nuclei. Quadrupole shape invariants have been implemented to
investigate shape coexistence, and the distribution of possible
shape-coexisting nuclei is consistent with results obtained in recent
theoretical studies and available data. The present analysis has shown that,
when based on a universal and consistent microscopic framework of nuclear
density functionals, shape invariants provide distinct indicators and reliable
predictions for the occurrence of low-energy coexisting shapes. This method is
particularly useful for studies of shape coexistence in regions far from
stability where few data are available.

false positive nonbilocal quantum correlations can be observed even though the

demonstrate a new scheme for the violation of bilocality that does not require

cycles is determined by the stellar rotation rate. It is observed that the
cycle period increases with rotation period along the so-called active and

between the two sequences. Our goal is to measure cyclic variations of the
stellar light curve amplitude and the rotation period using four years of
Kepler data. Periodic changes of the light curve amplitude or the stellar
rotation period are associated with an underlying activity cycle. Using the
McQuillan et al. 2014 sample we compute the rotation period and the variability
amplitude for each Kepler quarter and search for periodic variations of both
time series. To test for periodicity in each stellar time series we consider
Lomb-Scargle periodograms and use a selection based on a False Alarm
Probability (FAP). We detect amplitude periodicities in 3203 stars between
0.5-6 years covering rotation periods between 1-40 days. Given our sample size
of 23,601 stars and our selection criteria that the FAP is less than 5%, this
number is almost three times higher than that expected from pure noise. We do
not detect periodicities in the rotation period beyond those expected from
noise. Our measurements reveal that the cycle period shows a weak dependence on
rotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation period. We further show
that the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent
with observations of the solar cycle. Our measurements do not support the
existence of distinct sequences in the P_rot-P_cyc plane, although there is
some evidence for the inactive sequence for rotation periods between 5-25 days.
Unfortunately, the total observing time is too short to draw sound conclusions
on activity cycles with similar length as the solar cycle.

paper, we prove that if $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_m$ satisfies $R_A(n)\le 5$ for
all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_m$, then $|\{g:g\in \mathbb{Z}_m, R_A(g)=0\}|\ge
\frac{1}{4}m-\sqrt{5m}$. This improves a recent result of Li and Chen. We also
give upper bounds of $|\{g:g\in \mathbb{Z}_m, R_A(g)=i\}|$ for $i=2,4$.

associating the spreading matrix with the adjacency matrix of a large
semiregular bipartite graph. For a simple repetition-based sparse spreading
scheme, the result directly follows from a rigorous analysis of spectral
measures of infinite graphs. Turning to random (sparse) binary spreading, we
harness the cavity method from statistical physics, and show that the limiting
spectral density coincides in both cases. Next, we use this density to compute
the normalized input-output mutual information of the underlying vector channel
in the large-system limit. The latter may be interpreted as the achievable
total throughput per dimension with optimum processing in a corresponding
multiple-access channel setting or, alternatively, in a fully-symmetric
broadcast channel setting with full decoding capabilities at each receiver.
Surprisingly, the total throughput of regular LDCD-NOMA is found to be not only
superior to that achieved with irregular user-resource allocation, but also to
the total throughput of dense randomly-spread NOMA, for which optimum
processing is computationally intractable. In contrast, the superior
performance of regular LDCD-NOMA can be potentially achieved with a feasible

perspectives for observations of helium energetic neutral atoms (He ENAs). We
calculated the expected intensities of He ENAs created by the neutralization of
helium ions in the inner heliosheath and through the secondary ENA mechanism in
the outer heliosheath. We found that the dominant source region for He ENAs is
the inner heliosheath. The obtained magnitudes of intensity spectra suggest
that He ENAs can be observed with future ENA detectors, as those planned on
Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. Observing He ENAs is most likely
for energies from a few to a few tens of keV/nuc. Estimates of the expected
count rates show that the ratio of helium to hydrogen atoms registered in the
detectors can be as low as 1:10^4. Consequently, the detectors need to be
equipped with an appropriate mass spectrometer capability, allowing for
recognition of chemical elements. Due to the long mean free paths of helium
ions in the inner heliosheath, He ENAs are produced also in the distant
heliospheric tail. This implies that observations of He ENAs can resolve its
structure, which seems challenging from observations of hydrogen ENAs since
energetic protons are neutralized before they progress deeper in the
heliospheric tail.

we take advantage of advances in bioimaging to directly assess collagen fibers
and wall architecture during loading. A custom biaxial mechanical testing
system compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to directly
measure the layer dependent collagen fiber recruitment in bladder tissue from 9
male Fischer rats (4 adult and 5 aged). As for other soft tissues, the bladder
loading curve was exponential in shape and could be divided into toe,
transition and high stress regimes. The relationship between collagen
recruitment and loading curves were evaluated in the context of the inner
bladder wall (lamina propria) and outer detrusor smooth muscle layer. The large
extensibility of the bladder was found to be possible due to folds in the wall
(rugae) that provide a mechanism for low resistance flattening without any
discernible recruitment of collagen fibers throughout the toe regime. For
elastic bladders, as the loading extended into the transition regime, a gradual
coordinated recruitment of collagen fibers between the lamina propria and
detrusor smooth muscle layers was found. A second important finding is that
wall extensibility could be lost by premature recruitment of collagen in the
outer wall that cut short the toe region. This work provides, for the first
time, a mechanistic understanding of the role of collagen recruitment in
determining bladder capacitance.

Moreover, their performance is limited since they ignore the fact that

not require image pairs or triplets for training while the inter-class

resources to be solved accurately at high frequencies. Asymptotic methods can
make this cost potentially frequency independent by explicitly extracting the
oscillatory properties of the solution. However, the high-frequency wave
pattern becomes very complicated in the presence of multiple scattering
obstacles. We consider a boundary integral equation formulation of the
Helmholtz equation in two dimensions involving several obstacles, for which ray
tracing schemes have been previously proposed. The existing analysis of ray
tracing schemes focuses on periodic orbits between a subset of the obstacles.
One observes that the densities on each of the obstacles converge to an
equilibrium after a few iterations. In this paper we present an asymptotic
approximation of the phases of those densities in equilibrium, in the form of a
Taylor series. The densities represent a full cycle of reflections in a
periodic orbit. We initially exploit symmetry in the case of two circular
scatterers, but also provide an explicit algorithm for an arbitrary number of
general 2D obstacles. The coefficients, as well as the time to compute them,
are independent of the wavenumber and of the incident wave. The results may be
used to accelerate ray tracing schemes after a small number of initial
iterations.

increasingly prominent, and manifested in many different forms on social media.
However, there is little work analyzing the characteristics of abusive users
and what distinguishes them from typical social media users. In this paper, we
start addressing this gap by analyzing tweets containing a great large amount
of abusiveness. We focus on a Twitter dataset revolving around the Gamergate
controversy, which led to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression
on various gaming and social media platforms. We study the properties of the
users tweeting about Gamergate, the content they post, and the differences in
their behavior compared to typical Twitter users.
  We find that while their tweets are often seemingly about aggressive and
hateful subjects, ""Gamergaters"" do not exhibit common expressions of online
anger, and in fact primarily differ from typical users in that their tweets are
less joyful. They are also more engaged than typical Twitter users, which is an
indication as to how and why this controversy is still ongoing. Surprisingly,
we find that Gamergaters are less likely to be suspended by Twitter, thus we
analyze their properties to identify differences from typical users and what
may have led to their suspension. We perform an unsupervised machine learning
analysis to detect clusters of users who, though currently active, could be
considered for suspension since they exhibit similar behaviors with suspended
users. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of our analyzed features by emulating
the Twitter suspension mechanism with a supervised learning method, achieving
very good precision and recall.

theories contributes a bare mass term in the effective action which is
proportional to the bare coupling constant. This mass term renders the
perturbative expansion infrared-finite and allows to study it directly in the
large-N and infinite-volume limits using the Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo approach.
On the exactly solvable example of a large-N O(N) sigma model in D=2 dimensions
we show that this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion contains, in addition
to powers of bare coupling, also powers of its logarithm, reminiscent of
re-summed perturbation theory in thermal field theory and resurgent
trans-series without exponential terms. We numerically demonstrate the
convergence of these double series to the manifestly non-perturbative dynamical
mass gap. We then develop a Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling
planar diagrams in the large-N matrix field theory, and apply it to study this
infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion for large-N U(N)xU(N) nonlinear sigma
model (principal chiral model) in D=2. We sample up to 12 leading orders of the
weak-coupling expansion, which is the practical limit set by the increasingly
strong sign problem at high orders. Comparing Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo with
conventional Monte-Carlo simulations extrapolated to infinite N, we find a good

propose a generic Hamiltonian with three terms to model the triadic energies.
One term is connected with a three-body interaction that captures balance
theory. The other terms take into account the impact of heterogeneity and of
negative edges in the triads. The validity of our model is tested on four
datasets including the time series of triadic relationships for the standings
between two classes of alliances in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG).
We also analyze real-world data for the relationships between the ""agents""
involved in the Syrian civil war, and in the relations between countries during
the Cold War era. We find emerging properties in the triadic relationships in a
political network, for example reflecting itself in a persistent hierarchy
between the four triadic energies, and in the consistency of the extracted
parameters from comparing the model Hamiltonian to the data.

optical study into the cluster populations of a sample of 22 Luminous Infrared
Galaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey. Through integrated
broadband photometry we have derived ages and masses for a total of 484 star
clusters contained within these systems. This allows us to examine the
properties of star clusters found in the extreme environments of LIRGs relative
to lower luminosity star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. We find that
by adopting a Bruzual \& Charlot simple stellar population (SSP) model and
Salpeter initial mass function, the age distribution of clusters declines as
$dN/d\tau = \tau^{-0.9 +/- 0.3}$, consistent with the age distribution derived
for the Antennae Galaxies, and interpreted as evidence for rapid cluster
disruption occuring in the strong tidal fields of merging galaxies. The large
number of $10^{6} M_{\odot}$ young clusters identified in the sample also
suggests that LIRGs are capable of producing more high-mass clusters than what
is observed to date in any lower luminosity star-forming galaxy in the local
Universe. The observed cluster mass distribution of $dN/dM = M^{-1.95 +/-
0.11}$ is consistent with the canonical -2 power law used to describe the
underlying initial cluster mass function (ICMF) for a wide range of galactic
environments. We interpret this as evidence against mass-dependent cluster
disruption, which would flatten the observed CMF relative to the underlying
ICMF distribution.

widely-accepted version of the ""emerging-flux"" model, that reconnection occurs
at a current sheet between the open field and emerging closed field and also
makes a compact hot brightening that is usually observed at the edge of the
jet's base (1,3). Here we report on high-resolution X-ray and EUV observations
of 20 randomly-selected X-ray jets in polar coronal holes. In each jet,
contrary to the emerging-flux model, a miniature version of the filament
eruptions that initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (4-7) drives the
jet-producing reconnection, and the compact hot brightening is made by internal
reconnection of the legs of the minifilament-carrying erupting closed field,
analogous to solar flares of larger-scale eruptions. Previous observations have
found that some jets are driven by base-field eruptions (8-10,12), but only one
such study, of only one jet, provisionally questioned the emerging-flux model
(13). Our observations support the view that solar filament eruptions are made
by a fundamental explosive magnetic process that occurs on a vast range of
scales, from the biggest CME/flare eruptions down to X-ray jets, and perhaps
down to even smaller jets that are candidates for powering coronal heating
(10,14,15). A picture similar to that suggested by our observations was drawn
before, inferred from different observations and based on a different origin of

  failure using nonlinear laser interferometry",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A better understanding and anticipation of natural processes such as
landsliding or seismic fault activity requires detailed theoretical and
experimental analysis of rock mechanics and geomaterial dynamics. These last
decades, considerable progress has been made towards understanding deformation
and fracture process in laboratory experiment on granular rock materials, as
the well-known shear banding experiment. One of the reasons for this progress
is the continuous improvement in the instrumental techniques of observation.
But the lack of real time methods does not allow the detection of indicators of
the upcoming fracture process and thus to anticipate the phenomenon. Here, we
have performed uniaxial compression experiments to analyse the response of a
granular rock material sample to different shocks. We use a novel
interferometric laser sensor based on the nonlinear self-mixing interferometry
technique to observe in real time the deformations of the sample and assess its
usefulness as a diagnostic tool for the analysis of geomaterial dynamics. Due
to the high spatial and temporal resolution of this approach, we observe both
vibrations processes in response to a dynamic loading and the onset of failure.
The latter is preceded by a continuous variation of vibration period of the
material. After several shocks, the material response is no longer reversible
and we detect a progressive accumulation of irreversible deformation leading to
the fracture process. We demonstrate that material failure is anticipated by
the critical slowing down of the surface vibrational motion, which may
therefore be envisioned as an early warning signal or predictor to the
macroscopic failure of the sample. The nonlinear self-mixing interferometry
technique is readily extensible to fault propagation measurements. As such, it
opens a new window of observation for the study of geomaterial deformation and
failure.

spectrum during its prompt phase, and on its interpretation in the framework of
prompt emission models. We characterize the high-energy extra component of GRB
090926A using Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), which
offer a greater sensitivity than any data set used in previous studies of this
burst, particularly in the 30-100 MeV energy band. Then, we combine the LAT
data with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in joint spectral fits in
order to characterize the time evolution of the broad-band spectrum from keV to
GeV energies. Careful attention is paid to the LAT systematic effects. Finally,
we perform a temporal analysis of the light curves and we compute the
variability time scales during and after the bright spike at ~10 s
post-trigger. Our analysis confirms and better constrains the spectral break in
the high-energy extra component, which has been previously reported during the
bright spike. Furthermore, it reveals that the spectral attenuation persists at
later times, with an increase of the break characteristic energy up to the GeV
domain until the end of the prompt phase. We interpret the high-energy spectral
break as caused by photon opacity to pair creation. Requiring that all
emissions are produced above the photosphere of GRB 090926A, we compute the
bulk Lorentz factor of the outflow, $\Gamma$. The latter decreases from 230
during the spike to 100 at the end of the prompt emission. Assuming, instead,
that the spectral break reflects the natural curvature of the inverse Compton
spectrum, lower limits corresponding to larger values of $\Gamma$ are also
derived. Combined with the extreme temporal variability of GRB 090926A, these

on a new non-trivial combinatorial property of the suffix tree $\mathcal{T}$ of

an explicit node of $\mathcal{T}$ is no more than $3n-4$. We further show that
the presented algorithm is time-optimal by proving that $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is a
tight upper bound for the number of overabundant words. Finally, we present
experimental results, using both synthetic and real data, which justify the

processes in development and disease. The recent advances in automation of
microscopes and development of methods and markers for live cell imaging has
led to rapid growth in the amount of image data being captured. To efficiently
and reliably extract useful insights from these captured sequences, automated
cell tracking is essential. This is a challenging problem due to large
variation in the appearance and shapes of cells depending on many factors
including imaging methodology, biological characteristics of cells, cell matrix
composition, labeling methodology, etc. Often cell tracking methods require a
sequence-specific segmentation method and manual tuning of many tracking
parameters, which limits their applicability to sequences other than those they
are designed for. In this paper, we propose 1) a deep learning based cell
proposal method, which proposes candidates for cells along with their scores,
and 2) a cell tracking method, which links proposals in adjacent frames in a
graphical model using edges representing different cellular events and poses
joint cell detection and tracking as the selection of a subset of cell and edge
proposals. Our method is completely automated and given enough training data
can be applied to a wide variety of microscopy sequences. We evaluate our
method on multiple fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy sequences
containing cells of various shapes and appearances from ISBI cell tracking
challenge, and show that our method outperforms existing cell tracking methods.

be enhanced in cold, dense prestellar cores and to decrease after protostellar
birth. Previous studies have shown that the deuterated forms of species such as
N2H+ (formed in the gas phase) and CH3OH (formed on grain surfaces) can be used
as evolutionary indicators and to constrain their dominant formation processes
and time-scales. Formaldehyde (H2CO) and its deuterated forms can be produced
both in the gas phase and on grain surfaces. However, the relative importance
of these two chemical pathways is unclear. Comparison of the deuteration
fraction of H2CO with respect to that of N2H+, NH3 and CH3OH can help us to
understand its formation processes and time-scales. With the new SEPIA Band 5
receiver on APEX, we have observed the J=3-2 rotational lines of HDCO and D2CO
at 193 GHz and 175 GHz toward three massive star forming regions hosting
objects at different evolutionary stages: two High-mass Starless Cores (HMSC),
two High-mass Protostellar Objects (HMPOs), and one Ultracompact HII region
(UCHII). By using previously obtained H2CO J=3-2 data, the deuteration
fractions HDCO/H2CO and D2CO/HDCO are estimated. Our observations show that
singly-deuterated H2CO is detected toward all sources and that the deuteration
fraction of H2CO increases from the HMSC to the HMPO phase and then sharply
decreases in the latest evolutionary stage (UCHII). The doubly-deuterated form
of H2CO is detected only in the earlier evolutionary stages with D2CO/H2CO
showing a pattern that is qualitatively consistent with that of HDCO/H2CO,
within current uncertainties. Our initial results show that H2CO may display a
similar D$_{frac}$ pattern as that of CH3OH in massive young stellar objects.
This finding suggests that solid state reactions dominate its formation.

considering it as an experiment whereby one uses electrons to study the set-up
rather than an experiment whereby we use a set-up to study the behaviour of
electrons. We also show how the concept of undecidability can be used in an
intuitive way to make sense of the double-slit experiment and the quantum rules
for calculating coherent and incoherent probabilities. We meet here a situation
where the electrons always behave in a fully deterministic way (following
Einstein's conception of reality), while the detailed design of the set-up may
render the question about the way they move through the set-up experimentally
undecidable (which follows more Bohr's conception of reality). We show that the
expression $\psi_{1} + \psi_{2}$ for the wave function of the double-slit
experiment is numerically correct, but logically flawed. It has to be replaced
in the interference region by the logically correct expression $\psi'_{1} +
\psi'_{2}$, which has the same numerical value as $\psi_{1} + \psi_{2}$, such
that $\psi'_{1} + \psi'_{2} = \psi_{1} + \psi_{2}$, but with $\psi'_{1} =
{\psi_{1} +\psi_{2}\over{\sqrt{2}}} \,e^{\imath {\pi\over{4}}} \neq \psi_{1}$
and $\psi'_{2} = {\psi_{1} +\psi_{2}\over{\sqrt{2}}}\,e^{-\imath
{\pi\over{4}}}\neq \psi_{2}$. Here $\psi'_{1}$ and $\psi'_{2}$ are the correct
contributions from the slits to the total wave function $\psi'_{1} +
\psi'_{2}$. We have then $p = |\psi'_{1} + \psi'_{2}|^{2} = |\psi'_{1}|^{2} +
|\psi'_{2}|^{2} = p_{1}+p_{2} $ such that the paradox that quantum mechanics
(QM) would not follow the traditional rules of probability calculus disappears.

parameter -- the Hubble constant $H_0$. This tension arises when fitting the
Lambda-cold-dark-matter model ($\Lambda$CDM) to the high-precision
temperature-temperature (TT) power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) and to local cosmological observations. We propose a resolution of this
problem by postulating that the thermal photon gas of the CMB obeys an SU(2)
rather than U(1) gauge principle, suggesting a high-$z$ cosmological model
which is void of dark matter. Observationally, we rely on precise low-frequency
intensity measurements in the CMB spectrum and on a recent model independent
(low-$z$) extraction of the relation between the comoving sound horizon $r_s$
at the end of the baryon drag epoch and $H_0$ ($r_s H_0 = \text{const}$). We
point out that the commonly employed condition for baryon-velocity freeze-out
is imprecise, judged by a careful inspection of the formal solution to the
associated Euler equation. As a consequence, the above mentioned 3$\sigma$
tension actually transforms into a 5$\sigma$ discrepancy. To make contact with
successful low-$z$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology we propose an interpolation based on
percolated/depercolated vortices of a Planck-scale axion condensate. For a
first consistency test of such an all-$z$ model we compute the angular scale of
the sound horizon at photon decoupling.

treatment, healthcare and fitness sectors. In many situations, mobile methods,
which allow users to undertake every day activities, are required. However,
current monitoring systems can be obtrusive, requiring users to wear
respiration belts or nasal probes. Recent advances in thermographic systems
have shrunk their size, weight and cost, to the point where it is possible to
create smart-phone based respiration rate monitoring devices that are not
affected by lighting conditions. However, mobile thermal imaging is challenged
in scenes with high thermal dynamic ranges. This challenge is further amplified
by general problems such as motion artifacts and low spatial resolution,
leading to unreliable breathing signals. In this paper, we propose a novel and
robust approach for respiration tracking which compensates for the negative
effects of variations in the ambient temperature and motion artifacts and can
accurately extract breathing rates in highly dynamic thermal scenes. It has
three main contributions. The first is a novel Optimal Quantization technique
which adaptively constructs a color mapping of absolute temperature to improve
segmentation, classification and tracking. The second is the Thermal Gradient
Flow method that computes thermal gradient magnitude maps to enhance accuracy
of the nostril region tracking. Finally, we introduce the Thermal Voxel method
to increase the reliability of the captured respiration signals compared to the
traditional averaging method. We demonstrate the extreme robustness of our
system to track the nostril-region and measure the respiratory rate in high
dynamic range scenes.

radiation environment during extreme and elevated conditions. In the long term,
it is mainly Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) modulated by solar activity that
contributes to the radiation on the surface of Mars, but intense solar
energetic particle (SEP) events may induce acute health effects. Such events
may enhance the radiation level significantly and should be detected as
immediately as possible to prevent severe damage to humans and equipment.
However, the energetic particle environment on the Martian surface is
significantly different from that in deep space due to the influence of the
Martian atmosphere. Depending on the intensity and shape of the original solar
particle spectra as well as particle types, the surface spectra may induce
entirely different radiation effects. In order to give immediate and accurate
alerts while avoiding unnecessary ones, it is important to model and well
understand the atmospheric effect on the incoming SEPs including both protons
and helium ions. In this paper, we have developed a generalized approach to
quickly model the surface response of any given incoming proton/helium ion
spectra and have applied it to a set of historical large solar events thus
providing insights into the possible variety of surface radiation environments
that may be induced during SEP events. Based on the statistical study of more
than 30 significant solar events, we have obtained an empirical model for
estimating the surface dose rate directly from the intensities of a power-law
SEP spectra.

is represented by a Smoluchowski-like equation for a single particle under two
different harmonic potentials. The coupling between these two potentials are
assumed to be a Dirac Delta function in our model. We evaluate two rate
constants, the long term and the average rate constant. We have also
incorporated the effect of all other chemical reactions involving at least one
end of the open chain polymer molecule - on rate of end-to-end loop formation.

breaking of any bond - the effect of this reaction on the rate of end-to-end
