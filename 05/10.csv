galaxies from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) to quantify how the
galaxies' light distribution deviate from symmetric smooth profiles. We
visually inspect the galaxies' images to identify the likely causes for such
deviations. We find that the residual flux fraction ($RFF$), which measures the
fractional contribution to the galaxy light of the residuals left after
subtracting a symmetric and smooth model, is very sensitive to the degree of
structural disturbance but not the causes of such disturbance. On the other
hand, the asymmetry of these residuals ($A_{\rm res}$) is more sensitive to the
causes of the disturbance, with merging galaxies having the highest values of
$A_{\rm res}$. Using these quantitative parameters we find that, at a fixed
morphology, cluster and field galaxies show statistically similar degrees of
disturbance. However, there is a higher fraction of symmetric and passive
spirals in the cluster than in the field. These galaxies have smoother light
distributions than their star-forming counterparts. We also find that while
almost all field and cluster S0s appear undisturbed, there is a relatively
small population of star-forming S0s in clusters but not in the field. These
findings are consistent with relatively gentle environmental processes acting
on galaxies infalling onto clusters.

expression to be measured in individual cells instead of being
population-averaged. Despite this considerable precision improvement, inferring
regulatory networks remains challenging because stochasticity now proves to
play a fundamental role in gene expression. In particular, mRNA synthesis is
now acknowledged to occur in a highly bursty manner. We propose to view the
inference problem as a fitting procedure for a mechanistic gene network model
that is inherently stochastic and takes not only protein, but also mRNA levels
into account. We first explain how to build and simulate this network model
based upon the coupling of genes that are described as piecewise-deterministic
Markov processes. Our model is modular and can be used to implement various
biochemical hypotheses including causal interactions between genes. However, a
naive fitting procedure would be intractable. By performing a relevant
approximation of the stationary distribution, we derive a tractable procedure
that corresponds to a statistical hidden Markov model with interpretable
parameters. This approximation turns out to be extremely close to the
theoretical distribution in the case of a simple toggle-switch, and we show
that it can indeed fit real single-cell data. As a first step toward inference,
our approach was applied to a number of simple two-gene networks simulated in
silico from the mechanistic model and satisfactorily recovered the original
networks. Our results demonstrate that functional interactions between genes
can be inferred from the distribution of a mechanistic, dynamical stochastic
model that is able to describe gene expression in individual cells. This
approach seems promising in relation to the current explosion of single-cell

followed by degenerate Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature.
Light-induced loss at high atomic density is substantially reduced by using far
red detuned optical pumping light. Starting with 2000 atoms, we prepare 1400
atoms in 300 ms at quantum degeneracy, as confirmed by the appearance of a
bimodal velocity distribution as the system crosses over from a classical gas
to a Bose-condensed, interacting one-dimensional gas with a macroscopic
population of the quantum ground state. The method should be broadly applicable
to many bosonic and fermionic species, and to systems where evaporative cooling
is not possible.

On the other hand, the proposed method has a natural Bayesian version, which
the $L_2$ method does not have. This Bayesian version allows users to calculate
the credible region of the calibration parameters without using a large sample

paper, we investigate incentive mechanism design in cache-assisted D2D
networks, taking advantage of the user mobility information. An inter-contact
model is adopted to capture the average time between two consecutive contacts
of each device pair. A Stackelberg game is formulated, where each user plays as
a follower aiming at maximizing its own utility and the mobile network operator
(MNO) plays as a leader aiming at minimizing the cost. Assuming that user
responses can be predicted by the MNO, a cost minimization problem is
formulated. Since this problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it as a non-negative
submodular maximization problem and develop
$(\frac{1}{4+\epsilon})$-approximation local search algorithm to solve it. In
the simulation, we demonstrate that the local search algorithm provides near
optimal performance. By comparing with other caching strategies, we validate
the effectiveness of the proposed incentive-based mobility-aware caching

These properties are more extreme than what is commonly observed in the
canonical hard state of neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries observed at X-ray
luminosities similar to those we observe from our sources. This suggests that
indeed the very hard state is a distinct spectral-timing state from the hard

entanglement in a manner akin to the W state, surprisingly turned out to be
more robust than the GHZ state. The experimental data were best modeled by
considering the main noise channel to be an uncorrelated phase damping channel
acting independently on each qubit, alongwith a generalized amplitude damping
channel. Using dynamical decoupling, we were able to achieve a significant
protection of entanglement for GHZ states. There was a marginal improvement in

overlying films. Achieving the atomically flat and chemically single terminated
surface state of commercially available substrates, however, requires judicious
efforts because the surface of as-received substrates is of chemically mixed

procedures to accomplish atomically flat surfaces with single terminating layer
for various metal oxide substrates. We particularly focus on the substrates
with lattice constant ranging from 4.00 to 3.70 angstrom, as the lattice
constant of most perovskite materials falls into this range. For materials
outside the range, one can utilize the substrates to induce compressive or
tensile strain on the films and explore new states not available in bulk. The
substrates covered in this review, which have been chosen with commercial
availability and, most importantly, experimental practicality as a criterion,

the number of individuals involved and for the expected increase in AF
incidence in the next 40 years. Although a number of potential haemodynamic
processes, such as microembolisms, altered cerebral blood flow, hypoperfusion

causal mechanisms are far from clear. An in silico approach is proposed that
combines in sequence two lumped-parameter schemes, for the cardiovascular
system and the cerebral circulation. The systemic arterial pressure is obtained
from the cardiovascular system and used as the input for the cerebral
circulation, with the aim of studying the role of AF on the cerebral
haemodynamics with respect to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), over a 5000 beat
recording. In particular, the alteration of the haemodynamic (pressure and
flowrate) patterns in the microcirculation during AF is analysed by means of
different statistical tools, from correlation coefficients to autocorrelation
functions, crossing times, extreme values analysis and multivariate linear
regression models. A remarkable signal alteration, such as a reduction in
signal correlation (NSR, about 3 s; AF, less than 1 s) and increased
probability (up to three to four times higher in AF than in NSR) of extreme
value events, emerges for the peripheral brain circulation. The described
scenario offers a number of plausible cause-effect mechanisms that might
explain the occurrence of critical events and the haemodynamic links relating

demonstrate that higher inverse Compton losses lead to shorter source lifetimes

the generally observed trend with redshift. We evolve the z = 2 RLF based on
observed quasar space densities at high redshifts, and show that our RLF

ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large

This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves
construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not
living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological
organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The
problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an

However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to
explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove
rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In
this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity,

demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity

is the double nucleus of Andromeda, and there is strong evidence for many more

explanation for their longevity has remained a mystery: differential precession
should wipe out large-scale apsidal-alignment on a short timescale. Here we
identify a new dynamical mechanism which stabilizes eccentric nuclear disks,

eccentricity vectors of individual orbits, both in direction (about the mean

gradient, the eccentricity oscillations push some stars near the inner edge of
the disk extremely close to the black hole, potentially leading to tidal
disruption events. Order of magnitude calculations predict extremely high rates
in recently-formed eccentric nuclear disks ($\sim0.1 - 1$ ${\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm

decrease with time as the disk depletes in mass. If eccentric nuclear disks

AM vector. We reproduce the angular separation of the AM vector since a look
back time of 8.5 Gyrs to today ( $\rm \alpha$) with an accuracy of
approximately 0.05 in $\rm cos(\alpha)$. We are releasing this Monte-Carlo
simulation together with this publication. We also create a Monte Carlo
simulation that reproduces the change of the AM modulus. We find that haloes in
denser environments display the most dramatic evolution in their AM direction,
as well as haloes with a lower specific AM modulus. These relations could be
used to improve the way we follow the AM vector in low-resolution simulations.

limit by considering galaxy pairs as discrete objects and cross-correlating
them with the galaxy field. We develop an efficient algorithm using Fast
Fourier Transforms to compute such cross-correlations and their associated
pair-galaxy bias bpg and the squeezed 3PCF coefficient Qeff. We implement our
method using N-body cosmological simulations and a fiducial Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) and present the results in both the real space and redshift
space. In real space, we observe a peak in bpg and Qeff at pair separation of ~
2 Mpc, attributed to the fact that galaxy pairs at 2 Mpc separation trace the
most massive dark matter halos. We also see strong anisotropy in the bpg and
Qeff signals that track the large-scale filamentary structure. In redshift
space, both the 2 Mpc peak and the anisotropy are significantly smeared out
along the line-of-sight due to Finger-of-God effect. In both the real space and
redshift space, the squeezed 3PCF shows a factor of 2 variation, contradicting
the hierarchical ansatz but offering rich information on the galaxy-halo
connection. Thus, we explore the possibility of using the squeezed 3PCF to
constrain the HOD. When we compare two simple HOD models that are closely
matched in their projected two-point correlation function (2PCF), we do not yet
see a strong variation in the 3PCF that is clearly disentangled from variations
in the projected 2PCF. Nevertheless, we propose that more complicated HOD
models, e.g. those incorporating assembly bias, can break degeneracies in the
2PCF and show a distinguishable squeezed 3PCF signal.

is helicity suppressed. Here, we point out that the underlying mechanism is a
subtle combination of two distinct effects, and we present a comprehensive
analysis of how the suppression can be partially or fully lifted by the
internal bremsstrahlung of an additional boson in the final state. As a
concrete illustration, we compute analytically the full amplitudes and
annihilation rates of supersymmetric neutralinos to final states that contain
any combination of two standard model fermions, plus one electroweak gauge
boson or one of the five physical Higgs bosons that appear in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. We classify the various ways in which these
three-body rates can be large compared to the two-body rates, identifying cases
that have not been pointed out before. In our analysis, we put special emphasis
on how to avoid the double counting of identical kinematic situations that
appear for two-body and three-body final states, in particular on how to
correctly treat differential rates and the spectrum of the resulting stable
particles that is relevant for indirect dark matter searches. We find that both
the total annihilation rates and the yields can be significantly enhanced when
taking into account the corrections computed here, in particular for models
with somewhat small annihilation rates at tree-level which otherwise would not
be testable with indirect dark matter searches. Even more importantly, however,
we find that the resulting annihilation spectra of positrons, neutrinos,
gamma-rays and antiprotons differ in general substantially from the
model-independent spectra that are commonly adopted, for these final states,
when constraining particle dark matter with indirect detection experiments.

mean molecular weight term and a $\Gamma_1$ term that are commonly ignored. The
remaining deviation is more difficult to address. We find that the influence of
the scaling relation errors on asteroseismically derived values of $\log g$ are
well within uncertainties. The influence of the errors on mass and radius

Measurements of galaxy rotation velocity $V_{rot}$, which quantify ordered
motions, and gas velocity dispersion $\sigma_g$, which quantify disordered
motions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a
continuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At
low redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are
rotationally supported ($V_{rot}>\sigma_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of
galaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\%$ at low stellar mass
($10^{9}-10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) and 70$\%$ at high stellar mass
($10^{10}-10^{11}M_{\odot}$). For $V_{rot}\,>\,3\,\sigma_g$, the percentage
drops below 35$\%$ for all masses. From $z\,=\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit
remarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards
rotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems.
This is mostly due to an average decline in $\sigma_g$ by a factor of 3 since a
redshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period,
$V_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not
evolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V_{rot}$ and $\sigma_g$ with
time are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary
tracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with
abundance matching, not only does $\sigma_g$ decline with time as before, but
$V_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the
evolution in $V_{rot}/\sigma_g$. These results indicate that $z\,=\,2$ is a
period of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in
today's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.

foreground quasars with precise redshift measurements, using emission-lines
with precision $\lesssim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ and average offsets from the
systemic redshift $\lesssim|100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}|$. We stack the background
quasar spectra at the foreground quasar's systemic redshift to study the mean
absorption in \ion{C}{2}, \ion{C}{4}, and \ion{Mg}{2}. We find that the mean
absorptions exhibit large velocity widths $\sigma_v\approx300\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}}$. Further, the mean absorptions appear to be asymmetric about the
systemic redshifts. The mean absorption centroids exhibit small redshift
relative to the systemic $\delta v\approx+200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, with large
intrinsic scatter in the centroid velocities of the individual absorption
systems. We find the observed widths are consistent with gas in gravitational
motion and Hubble flow. However, while the observation of large widths alone
does not require galactic-scale outflows, the observed offsets suggest that the
gas is on average outflowing from the galaxy. The observed offsets also suggest
that the ionizing radiation from the foreground quasars is anisotropic and/or
intermittent.

making it a prime target for high-resolution imaging in the context of planet
formation. We aim to find signs of disk evolutionary processes by studying the
disk geometry and the dust grain properties at its surface, and to search for
companion candidates. We analyze a set of VLT/SPHERE data at near-infrared and
optical wavelengths. We performed polarimetric imaging of T Cha with IRDIS (1.6
$\mu$m) and ZIMPOL (0.5-0.9 $\mu$m), and obtained intensity images from IRDIS
dual-band imaging with simultaneous spectro-imaging with IFS (0.9-1.3 $\mu$m).
The disk around T Cha is detected in all observing modes and its outer disk is
resolved in scattered light with unprecedented angular resolution and
signal-to-noise. The images reveal a highly inclined disk with a noticeable
east-west brightness asymmetry. The significant amount of non-azimuthal
polarization signal in the $U_{\phi}$ images, with a $U_{\phi}$/$Q_{\phi}$
peak-to-peak value of 14%, is in accordance with theoretical studies on
multiple scattering. Our optimal axisymmetric radiative transfer model
considers two coplanar inner and outer disks, separated by a gap of 0.28""
(~30au) in size. We derive a disk inclination of ~69 deg and PA of ~114 deg. In
order to self-consistently reproduce the intensity and polarimetric images, the
dust grains, responsible for the scattered light, need to be dominated by sizes
of around ten microns. A point source is detected at an angular distance of
3.5"" from the central star. It is, however, found not to be co-moving. We
confirm that the dominant source of emission is forward scattered light from
the near edge of the outer disk. Our point source analysis rules out the
presence of a companion heavier than ~8.5 $M_{\mathrm{jup}}$ between 0.1"" and
0.3"". The detection limit decreases to ~2 $M_{\mathrm{jup}}$ for 0.3"" to 4.0"".

between cuts and discontinuities in a given kinematic channel and furthermore
makes the dependence on the kinematic variables manifest from the beginning. By
combining the Baikov-Lee representation of maximally-cut Feynman integrals and
the properties of periods of algebraic curves, we are able to obtain complete
solution sets for the homogeneous differential equations satisfied by Feynman
integrals which go beyond multiple polylogarithms. We apply our formalism to
the direct evaluation of a number of interesting cut Feynman integrals.

ALMA of the 1.2 mm dust continuum and molecular gas emission in the central
regions of the cluster. These observations detect 14 significant millimetre
sources in a region with a projected diameter of just ~500kpc (~1'). For six of
these galaxies we also obtain 12 CO(2-1) and 12 CO(5-4) line detections,
confirming them as cluster members, and a further five of our millimetre
galaxies have archival 12CO(2-1) detections which also place them in the
cluster. An additional two millimetre galaxies have photometric redshifts
consistent with cluster membership, although neither show strong line emission
in the MUSE spectra. This suggests that the bulk (> 11/14, ~80%) of the
submillimetre sources in the field are in fact luminous infrared galaxies lying
within this young cluster. We then use our sensitive new observations to
constrain the dust-obscured star formation activity and cold molecular gas
within this cluster. We find hints that the cooler dust and gas components
within these galaxies may have been influenced by their environment reducing
the gas reservoir available for their subsequent star formation. We also find
that these actively star- forming galaxies have the dynamical masses and
stellar population ages expected for the progenitors of massive, early-type
galaxies in local clusters potentially linking these populations.

regime of thin films of three-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological
insulators. We start by writing down the effective gauge theory in
2+1-dimensions from the projection of the 3+1-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics. Within this method, we obtain a short-range interaction, which
has the form of a Thirring-like term, and a long-range one. The interaction
between the two surface states of the material induces an excitonic gap. By
using the large-$N$ approximation in the strong-coupling limit, we find that
there is a dynamical mass generation for the excitonic states that preserves
time-reversal symmetry and is related to the dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking
of our model. This symmetry breaking occurs only for values of the
fermion-flavor number smaller than $N_{c}\approx 11.8$. Our results show that
the inclusion of the full dynamical interaction strongly modifies the critical
number of flavors for the occurrence of exciton condensation, and therefore,
cannot be neglected.

But QBism is not Bohr. This paper
attempts to show that, despite a popular misconception, QBism is no minor tweak
to Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is something quite distinct.
Along the way, we lay out three tenets of QBism in some detail: 1) The Born
Rule---the foundation of what quantum theory means for QBism---is a normative
statement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should
strive for; it is not a descriptive ""law of nature"" in the usual sense. 2) All
probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they
never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum
states thus have no ""ontic hold"" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes
just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Particularly,
quantum measurement outcomes are not, to paraphrase Bohr, instances of
""irreversible amplification in devices whose design is communicable in common
language suitably refined by the terminology of classical physics."" Finally, an
explicit comparison is given between QBism and Bohr with regard to three
subjects: a) The issue of the ""detached observer"" as it arose in a debate
between Pauli and Bohr, b) Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and
c) Bohr's mature notion of ""quantum phenomena."" At the end, we discuss how
Bohr's notion of phenomena may have something to offer the philosophy of
William James: A physics from which to further develop his vision of the
world---call it an ontology if you will---in which ""new being comes in local

problems for thickness polarized layers and disks, or length polarized rods,

method that leads to an exact analytical recursive procedure which is
applicable for a wide variety of boundary conditions including nonlinear cases.
A nonlinear damper boundary condition is considered in more detail. The
corresponding nonlinear relationship between stresses and velocities at a
current time moment is used in the recursive procedure. In addition to the
exact recursive procedure that is effective for calculations, some new
practically important explicit exact solutions are presented. Several examples
of the time behavior of the output electric potential difference are given to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed exact approach.

their promising potential for biomedical applications. The pioneering work of
Dreyfus et al (2005) has demonstrated the motion of a microswimmer with an
undulating chain of superparamagnetic beads, which is actuated by an
oscillating external magnetic field. Interestingly, it has also been
theoretically predicted that the swimming direction of this swimmer will
undergo a $90^\circ$-transition when the magnetic field's oscillations
amplitude is increased above a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$. In this work, we
further investigate this transition both theoretically and experimentally by
using numerical simulations and presenting a novel flexible microswimmer with a
superparamagnetic head. We realize the $90^\circ$-transition in swimming
direction, prove that this effect depends on both frequency and amplitude of
the oscillating magnetic field, and demonstrate the existence of an optimal
amplitude, under which, maximal swimming speed can be achieved. By
asymptotically analyzing the dynamic motion of microswimmer with a minimal
two-link model, we reveal that the stability transitions representing the
changes in the swimming direction are induced by the effect of nonlinear
parametric excitation.

devoid of planets. Its mass and radius imply that K2-66b has, at most, a meager

largest planets without a significant envelope. K2-106 hosts an
ultra-short-period planet ($P$ = 13.7 hrs) that is one of the hottest

where the most powerful ones frequently use rank transformations. Re-ranking
the data sequence after each new observation can become too intensive
computationally. This led to the idea of sequential ranks, where only the most
recent observation is ranked. However, difficulties finding, or approximating,
the null distribution of the statistics may have contributed to the lack of
popularity of these methods. In this paper, we propose transforming the
sequential ranks into sequential normal scores which are independent, and
asymptotically standard normal random variables. Thus original methods based on
the normality assumption may be used.
  A novel approach permits the inclusion of a priori information in the form of
quantiles. It is developed as a strategy to increase the sensitivity of the
scoring statistic. The result is a powerful convenient method to analyze
non-normal data sequences. Also, four variations of sequential normal scores
are presented using examples from the literature. Researchers and practitioners
might find this approach useful to develop nonparametric procedures to address
new problems extending the use of parametric procedures when distributional
assumptions are not met. These methods are especially useful with large data
streams where efficient computational methods are required.

collaborative edge computing among SBSs by forming SBS coalitions to share
computation resources with each other, thereby accommodating more computation
workload in the edge system and reducing reliance on the remote cloud. A novel
SBS coalition formation algorithm is developed based on the coalitional game
theory to cope with various new challenges in small-cell-based edge systems,
including the co-provisioning of radio access and computing services,
cooperation incentives, and potential security risks. To address these
challenges, the proposed method (1) allows collaboration at both the user-SBS
association stage and the SBS peer offloading stage by exploiting the ultra
dense deployment of SBSs, (2) develops a payment-based incentive mechanism that
implements proportionally fair utility division to form stable SBS coalitions,
and (3) builds a social trust network for managing security risks among SBSs
due to collaboration. Systematic simulations in practical scenarios are carried
out to evaluate the efficacy and performance of the proposed method, which
shows that tremendous edge computing performance improvement can be achieved.

The result is a set of coefficients that can be used to translate observed

rate which we denote the {\it Star Formation Acceleration (SFA)}, We apply the
method to a test sample of galaxies with GALEX photometry and SDSS

formation rate, and star formation acceleration. We find evidence for a
mass-dependent SFA in the green valley, with low mass galaxies showing greater
quenching and higher mass galaxies greater bursting. We also find evidence for
an increase in average quenching in galaxies hosting AGN. A simple scenario in
which lower mass galaxies accrete and become satellite galaxies, having their
star forming gas tidally and/or ram-pressure stripped, while higher mass
galaxies receive this gas and react with new star formation can qualitatively

process (DPP) $\Phi$ can be coupled with its reduced Palm version $\Phi^{0,!}$

\eta$ in distribution and $\Phi^{0,!} \cap \eta = \emptyset$. The points of
$\eta$ characterize the repulsive nature of a typical point of $\Phi$. In this
paper, the first moment measure of $\eta$ is used to study the repulsive
behavior of DPPs in high dimensions. It is shown that many families of DPPs
have the property that the total number of points in $\eta$ converges in
probability to zero as the space dimension $n$ goes to infinity. It is also
proved that for some DPPs there exists an $R^*$ such that the decay of the
first moment measure of $\eta$ is slowest in a small annulus around the sphere
of radius $\sqrt{n}R^*$. This $R^*$ can be interpreted as the asymptotic reach
of repulsion of the DPP. Examples of classes of DPP models exhibiting this

estimating a p-dimensional vector \b{eta} from its n noisy linear observations
y = X\b{eta}+w. The performance of these schemes are studied under the
high-dimensional asymptotic setting in which p grows linearly with n. In this
asymptotic setting, phase transition diagrams (PT) are often used for comparing
the performance of different estimators. Although phase transition analysis is
shown to provide useful information for compressed sensing, the fact that it
ignores the measurement noise not only limits its applicability in many
application areas, but also may lead to misunderstandings. For instance,
consider a linear regression problem in which n > p and the signal is not
exactly sparse. If the measurement noise is ignored in such systems,
regularization techniques, such as LQLS, seem to be irrelevant since even the
ordinary least squares (OLS) returns the exact solution. However, it is
well-known that if n is not much larger than p then the regularization
techniques improve the performance of OLS. In response to this limitation of PT
analysis, we consider the low-noise sensitivity analysis. We show that this
analysis framework (i) reveals the advantage of LQLS over OLS, (ii) captures
the difference between different LQLS estimators even when n > p, and (iii)
provides a fair comparison among different estimators in high signal-to-noise
ratios. As an application of this framework, we will show that under mild
conditions LASSO outperforms other LQLS even when the signal is dense. Finally,
by a simple transformation we connect our low-noise sensitivity framework to
the classical asymptotic regime in which n/p goes to infinity and characterize
how and when regularization techniques offer improvements over ordinary least
squares, and which regularizer gives the most improvement when the sample size

geostatistical coregionalization modeling approach for combining field
inventory measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based
remote sensing data products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior
Alaska's Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates pixel-level
mapping of AGB density predictions across the entire spatial domain.
Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for statistically sound
estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area---a key
advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This
research focuses on appropriate characterization of prediction uncertainty in
the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations.
Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation
uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from pixel-level predictions of AGB
density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed
coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free
models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total AGB precision.
Additionally, the inclusion of Landsat-derived forest cover as a covariate
further improved estimation precision in regions with lower lidar sampling
intensity. Our findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches that do
not explicitly account for residual spatial dependence can grossly
underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. On
the other hand, in a geostatistical setting, residual spatial structure can be
modeled within a Bayesian hierarchical framework to obtain statistically
defensible assessments of uncertainty for AGB estimates.

Sending the string tension to zero while rescaling the Newton-Cartan clock

string moving in a new type of non-Lorentzian geometry that we call
$U(1)$-Galilean geometry. We apply this to strings on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ for

mobile entities. Intensively studied for systems of autonomous mobile robots,
it has recently been investigated in the realm of programmable matter. Namely,
it has been studied in the geometric Amoebot model, where the anonymous
entities, called particles, operate on a hexagonal tessellation of the plane
and have limited computational power (they have constant memory), strictly
local interaction and communication capabilities (only with particles in
neighboring nodes of the grid), and limited motorial capabilities (from a grid
node to an empty neighboring node); their activation is controlled by an
adversarial scheduler. Recent investigations have shown how, starting from a
well-structured configuration in which the particles form a (not necessarily
complete) triangle, the particles can form a large class of shapes. This result
has been established under several assumptions: agreement on the clockwise
direction (i.e., chirality), a sequential activation schedule, and
randomization (i.e., particles can flip coins).
  In this paper we provide a characterization of which shapes can be formed
deterministically starting from any simply connected initial configuration of
$n$ particles. As a byproduct, if randomization is allowed, then any input
shape can be formed from any initial (simply connected) shape by our algorithm,
provided that $n$ is large enough.
  Our algorithm works without chirality, proving that chirality is
computationally irrelevant for shape formation. Furthermore, it works under a
strong adversarial scheduler, not necessarily sequential. We also consider the
complexity of shape formation in terms of both the number of rounds and of
moves performed by the particles. We prove that our solution has a complexity
of $O(n^2)$ rounds and moves: this number of moves is also asymptotically
optimal.

$S=\frac{c}{3}\ln l+\gamma$, where $c$ is the central charge of the CFT and
$\gamma$ is a cut-off dependent constant which diverges in the absence of an

known as a word embedding, has recently attracted much attention in natural
language processing and information retrieval tasks. The embedding vectors are
typically learned based on term proximity in a large corpus. This means that
the objective in well-known word embedding algorithms, e.g., word2vec, is to
accurately predict adjacent word(s) for a given word or context. However, this
objective is not necessarily equivalent to the goal of many information
retrieval (IR) tasks. The primary objective in various IR tasks is to capture
relevance instead of term proximity, syntactic, or even semantic similarity.
This is the motivation for developing unsupervised relevance-based word
embedding models that learn word representations based on query-document
relevance information. In this paper, we propose two learning models with
different objective functions; one learns a relevance distribution over the
vocabulary set for each query, and the other classifies each term as belonging
to the relevant or non-relevant class for each query. To train our models, we
used over six million unique queries and the top ranked documents retrieved in
response to each query, which are assumed to be relevant to the query. We
extrinsically evaluate our learned word representation models using two IR
tasks: query expansion and query classification. Both query expansion
experiments on four TREC collections and query classification experiments on
the KDD Cup 2005 dataset suggest that the relevance-based word embedding models
significantly outperform state-of-the-art proximity-based embedding models,

have to date turned up no convincing evidence of beyond-the-standard-model
cosmology, the list of models compared against $\Lambda$CDM is by no means
complete and is often governed by readily-coded modifications to standard
Boltzmann codes. Also, standard goodness-of-fit methods such as a naive
$\chi^2$ test fail to put strong pressure on the null $\Lambda$CDM hypothesis,
since modern datasets have orders of magnitudes more degrees of freedom than
$\Lambda$CDM. Here we present a method of tuning goodness-of-fit tests to
detect potential sub-dominant extra-$\Lambda$CDM signals present in the data
through compressing observations in a way that maximizes extra-$\Lambda$CDM
signal variation over noise and $\Lambda$CDM variation. This method, based on a
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transformation of the data, is tuned to be maximally
sensitive to particular types of variations characteristic of the tuning model;
but, unlike direct model comparison, the test is also sensitive to features
that only partially mimic the tuning model. As an example of its use, we apply
this method in the context of a nonstandard primordial power spectrum compared
against the $2015$ $Planck$ CMB temperature and polarization power spectrum. We
find weak evidence of extra-$\Lambda$CDM physics, conceivably due to known

Motivated by that, this paper introduces a novel randomized column sampling
tool dubbed Spatial Random Sampling (SRS), in which data points are sampled

most compelling feature of SRS is that the corresponding probability of
sampling from a given data cluster is proportional to the surface area the

fundamental issues arise that leads one to question this standard picture. To
address these issues we studied equilibrium properties of niobium samples near
and above the upper critical field Hc2 in parallel and perpendicular magnetic
fields. The samples investigated were very high quality films and single
crystal discs with the Ginzburg-Landau parameters 0.8 and 1.3, respectively. A
range of complementary measurements have been performed, which include dc
magnetometry, electrical transport, muSR spectroscopy and scanning Hall-probe
microscopy. Contrarily to the standard scenario, we observed that a
superconducting phase is present in the sample bulk above Hc2 and the field Hc3
is the same in both parallel and perpendicular fields. Our findings suggest
that above Hc2 the superconducting phase forms filaments parallel to the field
regardless on the field orientation. Near Hc2 the filaments preserve the
hexagonal structure of the preceding vortex lattice of the mixed state and the
filament density continuously falls to zero at Hc3. Our work has important
implications for the correct interpretation of properties of type-II
superconductors and can also be essential for practical applications of these

Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to

fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue.
Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom
abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We
propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based
on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and
the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic
sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient
deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly
descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this
framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run
locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We
evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the
proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against
state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using
clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the

channel hardening, i.e., the phenomenon for which, thanks to the large number
of antennas, the effective channel coefficients resulting from beamforming tend
to deterministic quantities. If the channel hardening effect does not hold
sufficiently well, this bound may be quite far from the actual achievable rate.
In recent developments of massive MIMO, several scenarios where channel
hardening is not sufficiently pronounced have emerged. These settings include,
for example, the case of small scattering angular spread, yielding highly
correlated channel vectors, and the case of cell-free massive MIMO. In this
short contribution, we present two new bounds on the achievable ergodic rate
that offer a complementary behavior with respect to the classical bound: while
the former performs well in the case of channel hardening and/or when the
system is interference-limited (notably, in the case of finite number of
antennas and conjugate beamforming transmission), the new bounds perform well
when the useful signal coefficient does not harden but the channel coherence
block length is large with respect to the number of users, and in the case
where interference is nearly entirely eliminated by zero-forcing beamforming.
Overall, using the most appropriate bound depending on the system operating
conditions yields a better understanding of the actual performance of systems
where channel hardening may not occur, even in the presence of a very large
number of antennas.

rapidly-rotating magnetar with fall-back accretion. Such a magnetar could
usually occur in core-collapse supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. We find that
the magnetar's spin and $r$-mode evolution are influenced by accretion. If the
magnetar is sufficiently spun up to a few milliseconds, gravitational radiation
leads to the growth of the $r$-mode amplitude significantly. The maximum
$r$-mode amplitude reaches an order $\sim 0.001$ when the damping due to the
growth of a toroidal magnetic field balances the growth of the $r$-mode
amplitude. If such a sufficiently spun-up magnetar was located at a distance
less than 1\,Mpc, then gravitational waves would be detectable by the Einstein
Telescope but would have an extremely low event rate. However, if the spin-up
is insufficient, the growth of the $r$-mode amplitude is mainly due to the
accretion torque. In this case, the maximum $r$-mode amplitude is of the order
of $\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$.

states that it is NP-hard to distinguish between a graph with a small subset of
vertices whose edge expansion is almost zero and one in which all small subsets
of vertices have expansion almost one. In this work, we prove inapproximability
results for the following graph problems based on this hypothesis:
  - Maximum Edge Biclique (MEB): given a bipartite graph $G$, find a complete
bipartite subgraph of $G$ with maximum number of edges.
  - Maximum Balanced Biclique (MBB): given a bipartite graph $G$, find a
balanced complete bipartite subgraph of $G$ with maximum number of vertices.
  - Minimum $k$-Cut: given a weighted graph $G$, find a set of edges with
minimum total weight whose removal partitions $G$ into $k$ connected
components.
  - Densest At-Least-$k$-Subgraph (DAL$k$S): given a weighted graph $G$, find a
set $S$ of at least $k$ vertices such that the induced subgraph on $S$ has
maximum density (the ratio between the total weight of edges and the number of
vertices).
  We show that, assuming SSEH and NP $\nsubseteq$ BPP, no polynomial time
algorithm gives $n^{1 - \varepsilon}$-approximation for MEB or MBB for every
constant $\varepsilon > 0$. Moreover, assuming SSEH, we show that it is NP-hard
to approximate Minimum $k$-Cut and DAL$k$S to within $(2 - \varepsilon)$ factor
of the optimum for every constant $\varepsilon > 0$.
  The ratios in our results are essentially tight since trivial algorithms give
$n$-approximation to both MEB and MBB and efficient $2$-approximation
algorithms are known for Minimum $k$-Cut [SV95] and DAL$k$S [And07, KS09].

Galaxy Evolution Explorer (\emph{GALEX}) provides multi-epoch photometric
observations in two UV bands: near-ultraviolet (NUV; 1771 -- 2831 \AA) and
far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1344 -- 1786 \AA). Within 30 pc of Earth, there are 357

both\GALEX bands. Our analyses of these data show that low-mass stars are
typically more variable in the FUV than the NUV. Median variability increases
with later spectral types in the NUV with no clear trend in the FUV. We find
evidence that flares increase the FUV flux density far more than the NUV flux
density, leading to variable FUV to NUV flux density ratios in the \GALEX\
bandpasses.The ratio of FUV to NUV flux is important for interpreting the
presence of atmospheric molecules in planetary atmospheres such as oxygen and
methane as a high FUV to NUV ratio may cause false-positive biosignature
detections. This ratio of flux density in the\GALEX\ bands spans three orders
of magnitude in our sample, from 0.008 to 4.6, and is 1 to 2 orders of

of producing a net torque under athermal random forces, its optimization for
mean angular momentum ($L$), mean angular velocity ($\omega$), and efficiency
($\eta$) is considered. In the model, supposing that such a small ratchet
system is placed in a thermal bath, the motion of the rotor in the stator is
described by the Langevin dynamics of a particle in a 2D ratchet potential,
which consists of a static and a time-dependent interaction between rotor and
stator; for the latter, we examine a force [randomly directed d.c. field
(RDDF)] for which only the direction is instantaneously updated in a sequence
of events in a Poisson process. Because of the chirality of the static part of
the potential, it is found that the RDDF causes net rotation while coupling
with the thermal fluctuations. Then, to maximize the efficiency of the power
consumption of the net rotation, we consider optimizing the static part of the
ratchet potential. A crucial point is that the newly designed form of ratchet
potential enables us to capture the essential feature of 2D ratchet potentials
with two closed curves and allows us to systematically construct an
optimization strategy. In this paper, we show a method for maximizing $L$,
$\omega$, and $\eta$, its outcome in 2D two-tooth ratchet systems, and a

formation of dwarf ETGs. The presence of faint disk structures and rotation
within some cluster dwarf ETGs has often been heralded as evidence that they
were once late-type spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies prior to experiencing a
cluster-induced transformation into an ETG. However, CG 611 also contains
significant stellar rotation (~20 km/s) over its inner half light radius,
R_(e,maj)=0.71 kpc, and its stellar structure and kinematics resemble those of
cluster ETGs. In addition to hosting a faint young nuclear spiral within a
possible intermediate-scale stellar disk, CG 611 has accreted an
intermediate-scale, counter-rotating gas disk. It is therefore apparent that
dwarf ETGs can be built by accretion events, as opposed to disk-stripping
scenarios. We go on to discuss how both dwarf and ordinary ETGs with
intermediate-scale disks, whether under (de)construction or not, are not fully
represented by the kinematic scaling S_0.5=sqrt{ 0.5(V_rot)^2 + sigma^2 }, and

Specifically, we show that the minimum size of depth-3 formulas is (up to a
factor of n) equal to the inverse of the maximum, over all depth-2 formulas, of
one-sided-error correlation bound divided by the size of the depth-2 formula,
on a certain hard distribution. We apply this duality to obtain several
consequences:
  1. Any function f can be approximated by a CNF formula of size $O(\epsilon
2^n / n)$ with one-sided error and advantage $\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$,
which is tight up to a constant factor.
  2. There exists a monotone function f such that f can be approximated by some
polynomial-size CNF formula, whereas any monotone CNF formula approximating f
requires exponential size.
  3. Any depth-3 formula computing the parity function requires $\Omega(2^{2
\sqrt{n}})$ gates, which is tight up to a factor of $\sqrt n$. This establishes
a quadratic separation between depth-3 circuit size and depth-3 formula size.
  4. We give a characterization of the depth-3 monotone circuit complexity of
the majority function, in terms of a natural extremal problem on hypergraphs.
In particular, we show that a known extension of Turan's theorem gives a tight
(up to a polynomial factor) circuit size for computing the majority function by
a monotone depth-3 circuit with bottom fan-in 2.

The emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) techniques offer low-latency, high
bandwidth, and persistence for HPC applications. However, the existing I/O
stack are designed and optimized based on an assumption of disk-based storage.
To effectively use NVM, we must re-examine the existing high performance
computing (HPC) I/O sub-system to properly integrate NVM into it. Using NVM as
a fast storage, the previous assumption on the inferior performance of storage
(e.g., hard drive) is not valid any more. The performance problem caused by
slow storage may be mitigated; the existing mechanisms to narrow the
performance gap between storage and CPU may be unnecessary and result in large
overhead. Thus fully understanding the impact of introducing NVM into the HPC
software stack demands a thorough performance study.
  In this paper, we analyze and model the performance of I/O intensive HPC
applications with NVM as a block device. We study the performance from three
perspectives: (1) the impact of NVM on the performance of traditional page
cache; (2) a performance comparison between MPI individual I/O and POSIX I/O;
and (3) the impact of NVM on the performance of collective I/O. We reveal the
diminishing effects of page cache, minor performance difference between MPI
individual I/O and POSIX I/O, and performance disadvantage of collective I/O on
NVM due to unnecessary data shuffling. We also model the performance of MPI
collective I/O and study the complex interaction between data shuffling,
storage performance, and I/O access patterns.

include lighter neutrino eigenstates. In this case part of the decay products
could be visible, as they would interact at neutrino detectors via mixing. At
neutrino oscillation experiments, a characteristic signature of such
\emph{visible neutrino decay} would be an apparent excess of events at low

neutrino decays as $\nu_3 \rightarrow \nu_{1,2} + \phi$, where $\phi$ is a new
light scalar. If neutrinos are Majorana particles the helicity-flipping decays
would be observable (i.e., $\nu \to \bar\nu + \phi$), leading to interesting
observable consequences on the event rates. We compute the sensitivities of the
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to the couplings of the new scalar
as a function of the lightest neutrino mass. Under the assumption that only the
heaviest neutrino is unstable, and for a normal mass ordering, we find that
DUNE will be sensitive to values of $\tau_3/m_3 > 1.95 - 2.6\times

chemical potential which provides the coupling mechanism of charge-heat

explain charge transport in both degenerate and nondegenerate materials, and
also provide the linear and nonlinear relationship between the charge density

developed {gradient recovery methods} for elliptic interface problem based on
body-fitted meshes and immersed finite element methods. Despite the efficiency
and accuracy that these methods bring to recover the gradient, there are still
some cases in unfitted meshes where skinny triangles appear in the generated
local body-fitted triangulation that destroy the accuracy of recovered gradient
near the interface. In this paper, we propose a gradient recovery technique
based on Nitsche's method for elliptic interface problem, which avoids the loss
of accuracy of gradient near the interface caused by skinny triangles. We
analyze the supercloseness between the gradient of the numerical solution by
the Nitsche's method and the gradient of interpolation of the exact solution,
which leads to the superconvergence of the proposed gradient recovery method.
We also present several numerical examples to validate the theoretical results.

Memory writes need to be performed in strict order to satisfy storage
consistency requirements and enable correct recovery from system crashes.
Unfortunately, adhering to such a strict order significantly degrades system
performance and persistent memory endurance. This paper introduces a new
mechanism, Loose-Ordering Consistency (LOC), that satisfies the ordering
requirements at significantly lower performance and endurance loss. LOC
consists of two key techniques. First, Eager Commit eliminates the need to
perform a persistent commit record write within a transaction. We do so by
ensuring that we can determine the status of all committed transactions during
recovery by storing necessary metadata information statically with blocks of
data written to memory. Second, Speculative Persistence relaxes the write
ordering between transactions by allowing writes to be speculatively written to
persistent memory. A speculative write is made visible to software only after
its associated transaction commits. To enable this, our mechanism supports the
tracking of committed transaction ID and multi-versioning in the CPU cache. Our
evaluations show that LOC reduces the average performance overhead of memory
persistence from 66.9% to 34.9% and the memory write traffic overhead from
17.1% to 3.4% on a variety of workloads.

We obtain expressions of the ionization potential and electron affinity in the
form of corrections to electron work function, which require only the
characteristics of 3D defect-free metal.
  The Kohn-Sham method is used to calculate the electron profiles, ionization
potential, electron affinity, electrical capacitance, dissociation, cohesion
and monovacancy-formation energies of the small perfect clusters Na$_{N}$,
Mg$_{N}$, Al$_{N}$ ($N \leq 270$) and the clusters containing a monovacancy

is shown that difference between the characteristics for the neutral and

proven unreliable due to a shallow optimization landscape. On the other hand,
estimation of diffusion kurtosis (DKI) parameters is more robust as the
clinical acquisitions typically probe a regime in which the associated 4th
order cumulant expansion is adequate; however, its parameters are not
microstructurally specific a priori. Given an appropriate biophysical model,
its parameters may be connected to DKI parameters, but it was previously shown
that at the DKI level, it still does not provide sufficient information to
uniquely determine all model parameters. Earlier work has shown that by
neglecting axonal dispersion, this parameter degeneracy reduces to the question
of whether intra-axonal diffusivity is larger than or smaller than extra-axonal
diffusivity. Here we develop a model of diffusion in spinal cord white matter
including axonal dispersion and demonstrate stable estimation of all model
parameters from DKI. By employing the recently developed fast axisymmetric DKI,
we use stimulated echo acquisition mode to collect data over an unprecedented
diffusion time range with very narrow diffusion gradient pulses, enabling
finely resolved measurements of diffusion time dependence of both net diffusion
and kurtosis metrics, as well as model intra- and extra-axonal diffusivities,
and axonal dispersion. Our results demonstrate substantial time dependence of
all parameters except volume fractions, and the additional time dimension
provides support for intra-axonal diffusivity to be larger than extra-axonal
diffusivity in spinal cord white matter, although not unambiguously. We compare
our findings to predictions from effective medium theory.

Recently, Baswana et al. [SODA16] presented a simple algorithm for updating DFS
tree of an undirected graph after an edge/vertex update in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time.
However, their algorithm is strictly sequential. We present an algorithm
achieving similar bounds, that can be adopted easily to the parallel
environment.
  In the parallel model, a DFS tree can be computed from scratch using $m$
processors in expected $\tilde{O}(1)$ time [SiComp90] on an EREW PRAM, whereas
the best deterministic algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ time
[SiComp90,JAlg93] on a CRCW PRAM. Our algorithm can be used to develop optimal
(upto polylog n factors deterministic algorithms for maintaining fully dynamic
DFS and fault tolerant DFS, of an undirected graph.
  1- Parallel Fully Dynamic DFS:
  Given an arbitrary online sequence of vertex/edge updates, we can maintain a
DFS tree of an undirected graph in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time per update using $m$
processors on an EREW PRAM.
  2- Parallel Fault tolerant DFS:
  An undirected graph can be preprocessed to build a data structure of size
O(m) such that for a set of $k$ updates (where $k$ is constant) in the graph,
the updated DFS tree can be computed in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time using $n$
processors on an EREW PRAM.
  Moreover, our fully dynamic DFS algorithm provides, in a seamless manner,
nearly optimal (upto polylog n factors) algorithms for maintaining a DFS tree
in semi-streaming model and a restricted distributed model. These are the first
parallel, semi-streaming and distributed algorithms for maintaining a DFS tree
in the dynamic setting.

  Theorems of Autonomous Crowd Navigation",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the sparsity and optimality properties of crowd navigation and find
that existing techniques do not satisfy both criteria simultaneously: either
they achieve optimality with a prohibitive number of samples or tractability
assumptions make them fragile to catastrophe. For example, if the human and
robot are modeled independently, then tractability is attained but the planner
is prone to overcautious or overaggressive behavior. For sampling based motion
planning of joint human-robot cost functions, for $n_t$ agents and $T$ step
lookahead, $\mathcal O(2^{2n_t T})$ samples are needed for coverage of the
action space. Advanced approaches statically partition the action space into
free-space and then sample in those convex regions. However, if the human is
\emph{moving} into free-space, then the partition is misleading and sampling is
unsafe: free space will soon be occupied. We diagnose the cause of these
deficiencies---optimization happens over \emph{trajectory} space---and propose
a novel solution: optimize over trajectory \emph{distribution} space by using a
Gaussian process (GP) basis. We exploit the ""kernel trick"" of GPs, where a
continuum of trajectories are captured with a mean and covariance function. By
using the mean and covariance as proxies for a trajectory family we reason
about collective trajectory behavior without resorting to sampling. The GP
basis is sparse and optimal with respect to collision avoidance and robot and
crowd intention and flexibility. GP sparsity leans heavily on the insight that
joint action space decomposes into free regions; however, the decomposition
contains feasible solutions only if the partition is dynamically generated. We
call our approach \emph{$\mathcal O(2^{n_t})$-sparse interacting Gaussian
processes}.

analysis of the flow, and often have to be carried out with limited
information. Finite-time coherent sets are regions of the flow that minimally
mix with the remainder of the flow domain over the finite period of time
considered. In the purely advective setting this is equivalent to identifying
sets whose boundary interfaces remain small throughout their finite-time
evolution. Finite-time coherent sets thus provide a skeleton of distinct
regions around which more turbulent flow occurs. They manifest in geophysical
systems in the forms of e.g.\ ocean eddies, ocean gyres, and atmospheric
vortices. In real-world settings, often observational data is scattered and
sparse, which makes the difficult problem of coherent set identification and
tracking even more challenging. We develop three FEM-based numerical methods to
efficiently approximate the dynamic Laplace operator, and introduce a new
dynamic isoperimetric problem using Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using these
FEM-based methods we rapidly and reliably extract finite-time coherent sets
from models or scattered, possibly sparse, and possibly incomplete observed
data.

the whole application. Moreover, the analysis should take into consideration
how file-system vulnerabilities might in- teract with other vulnerabilities
leading an attacker to breach into the web application. In this paper, we first
propose a classification of file- system vulnerabilities, and then, based on
this classification, we present a formal approach that allows one to exploit
file-system vulnerabilities. We give a formal representation of web
applications, databases and file- systems, and show how to reason about
file-system vulnerabilities. We also show how to combine file-system
vulnerabilities and SQL-Injection vulnerabilities for the identification of
complex, multi-stage attacks. We have developed an automatic tool that
implements our approach and we show its efficiency by discussing several
real-world case studies, which are witness to the fact that our tool can
generate, and exploit, complex attacks that, to the best of our knowledge, no
other state-of-the-art-tool for the security of web applications can find.

identifying the influential ones in spreading processes in networks. While the
edges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in
spreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes i and j may
differ in its importance for spreading from i to j and from j to i. The key
issue is whether node j, after infected by i through the edge, would reach out
to other nodes that i itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to
invoke two unequal weights wij and wji characterizing the importance of an edge
according to the neighborhoods of nodes i and j. The total asymmetric
directional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure si which
quantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. A s-shell
decomposition scheme further assigns a s-shell index or weighted coreness to
the nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on si and the
weighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world
networks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the
nodes' degree and k-shell index, while maintaining a low computational
complexity. Our work represents a crucial step towards understanding and
controlling the spread of diseases, rumors, information, trends, and

defined as the set of colors assigned to the edges incident to $v$. A subgraph

The well-known Mantel's theorem states that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices

(1941) showed that $G$ contains at least $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ triangles

Motivated by Rademacher's theorem, we then characterize all graphs $G$ which
satisfy $e(G)+c(G)\geq n(n+1)/2$ but contain only one rainbow triangle. We
further obtain two results on color neighborhood conditions for the existence
of rainbow short cycles. Our results improve a previous theorem due to

enstatite and ordinary chondrites show only small 50Ti variations and scatter
closely around the 50Ti composition of their host chondrites. By contrast,
chondrules from carbonaceous chondrites have highly variable 50Ti compositions,
which, relative to the terrestrial standard, range from the small 50Ti deficits
measured for enstatite and ordinary chondrite chondrules to the large 50Ti
excesses known from Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). These 50Ti variations can be
attributed to the addition of isotopically heterogeneous CAI-like material to
enstatite and ordinary chondrite-like chondrule precursors. The new Ti isotopic
data demonstrate that isotopic variations among carbonaceous chondrite
chondrules do not require formation over a wide range of orbital distances, but
can instead be fully accounted for by the incorporation of isotopically
anomalous nuggets into chondrule precursors. As such, these data obviate the
need for disk-wide transport of chondrules prior to chondrite parent body
accretion and are consistent with formation of chondrules from a given
chondrite group in localized regions of the disk. Lastly, the ubiquitous
presence of 50Ti-enriched material in carbonaceous chondrites, and the lack of
this material in the non-carbonaceous chondrites support the idea that these
two meteorite groups derive from areas of the disk that remained isolated from
each other through the formation of Jupiter.

neural networks (CNN) for classification of breast WSIs into normal/benign,
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We first
train a CNN using high pixel resolution patches to capture cellular level
information. The feature responses generated by this model are then fed as
input to a second CNN, stacked on top of the first. Training of this stacked
architecture with large input patches enables learning of fine-grained
(cellular) details and global interdependence of tissue structures. Our system
is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing 221 WSIs of H&E stained breast
tissue specimens. The system achieves an AUC of 0.962 for the binary
classification of non-malignant and malignant slides and obtains a three class
accuracy of 81.3% for classification of WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and IDC,

outstanding challenge in quantum communication. These rely on entanglement of

between a single photon and a matter system. A practical way to establish such
correlations is via spontaneous Raman scattering in atomic ensembles, known as
the DLCZ scheme. However, time multiplexing is inherently difficult using this
method, which leads to low communication rates even in theory. Moreover, it is
desirable to find solid-state ensembles where such matter-photon correlations
could be generated. Here we demonstrate quantum correlations between a single
photon and a spin excitation in up to 12 temporal modes, in a $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$
doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, using a novel DLCZ approach that is inherently
multimode. After a storage time of 1 ms, the spin excitation is converted into
a second photon. The quantum correlation of the generated photon pair is
verified by violating a Cauchy - Schwarz inequality. Our results show that
solid-state rare-earth crystals could be used to generate remote multi-mode
entanglement, an important resource for future quantum networks.

allows one to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of order $N$, but

solve generic instances with tens of thousands of vertices. Indeed, experiments
show that on inputs without particular combinatorial structure the algorithms
scale almost linearly. In fact, it is non-trivial to create challenging
instances for such solvers and the number of difficult benchmark graphs
available is quite limited. We describe a construction to efficiently generate
small instances for the graph isomorphism problem that are difficult or even
infeasible for said solvers. Up to this point the only other available
instances posing challenges for isomorphism solvers were certain incidence
structures of combinatorial objects (such as projective planes, Hadamard

vertices our new instances are several orders of magnitude more difficult on
comparable input sizes. More importantly, our method is generic and efficient
in the sense that one can quickly create many isomorphism instances on a
desired number of vertices. In contrast to this, said combinatorial objects are
rare and difficult to generate and with the new construction it is possible to
generate an abundance of instances of arbitrary size. Our construction hinges
on the multipedes of Gurevich and Shelah and the Cai-F\""{u}rer-Immerman gadgets

solutions under non-isothermal conditions. This discussion is motivated by an
occurring misinterpretation of thermodynamic transport equations written in
terms of chemical potential in the presence of temperature gradient. The
transport equations contain the contributions owned by a gauge transformation
related to the fact that chemical potential is determined up to the summand of
form (AT+B) with arbitrary constants A and B, where constant A is owned by the
entropy invariance with respect to shifts by a constant value and B is owned by
the potential energy invariance with respect to shifts by a constant value. The
coefficients of the cross-effect terms in thermodynamic fluxes are contributed
by this gauge transformation and, generally, are not the actual cross-effect
physical transport coefficients. Our treatment is based on consideration of the
entropy balance and suggests a promising hint for attempts of evaluation of the
thermal diffusion constant from the first principles. We also discuss the
impossibility of the ""barodiffusion"" for dilute solutions, understood in a
sense of diffusion flux driven by the pressure gradient itself. When one speaks
of ""barodiffusion"" terms in literature, these terms typically represent the
drift in external potential force field (e.g., electric or gravitational
fields), where in the final equations the specific force on molecules is
substituted with an expression with the hydrostatic pressure gradient this
external force field produces. Obviously, the interpretation of the latter as
barodiffusion is fragile and may hinder the accounting for the diffusion fluxes
produced by the pressure gradient itself.

cross-validation study for 3,681 JAVA classes (containing over a million lines
of code) from open source systems, SMOTUNED increased AUC and recall by 60% and
20% respectively. These improvements are independent of the classifier used to
predict for quality. Same kind of pattern (improvement) was observed when a
comparative analysis of SMOTE and SMOTUNED was done against the most recent
class imbalance technique. In conclusion, for software analytic tasks like
defect prediction, (1) data pre-processing can be more important than
classifier choice, (2) ranking studies are incomplete without such
pre-processing, and (3) SMOTUNED is a promising candidate for pre-processing.

which leverages such patterns for concurrent access to objects in a shared

shared object - a thread-local view and a global view. As the thread-local view
is not shared, it can be updated without incurring synchronization costs. These
local updates become visible to other threads only after the thread-local view
is merged with the global view. This enables better performance at the expense

fast decay in small magnetic fields to a slow exponential asymptotic in large

interaction inducing an enhanced spin decay and the nuclear Zeeman term that
suppressed the spin-flip processes. We are able to explain the magnetic field

is that, for typical fading channels, their instantaneous capacity and

is that the cumulative capacity and subsequently the delay and backlog
performance can be upper-bounded by some exponential distributions, which is
often assumed but not justified in the wireless network performance analysis
literature. In addition, various bounds are derived for distributions of the
cumulative capacity and the delay-constrained capacity, considering three
representative dependence structures in the capacity process, namely
comonotonicity, independence, and Markovian. To help gain insights in the
performance of a wireless channel whose capacity process may be too complex or
detailed information is lacking, stochastic orders are introduced to the
capacity process, based on which, results to compare the delay and
delay-constrained capacity performance are obtained. Moreover, the impact of
self-interference in communication, which is an open problem in stochastic

perform here a detailed study of pipe flow relative periodic orbits with

approaches to reduction of the translational symmetry of the system. We study
pipe flow in a minimal computational cell, and report a library of invariant

unstable manifolds of a sample of these solutions is consistent with the
picture that relative periodic orbits are embedded in the chaotic saddle and
that they guide the turbulent dynamics.

to open a band gap in multilayer graphenes from bilayer to 8-layer, while the
nature of the insulating ground state sensitively depends on the band parameter
$\gamma_2$, which is responsible for the semimetallic nature of graphite. In
4-layer graphene, particularly, the ground state assumes an odd-spatial-parity
staggered phase at $\gamma_2 = 0$, while an increasing, finite value of
$\gamma_2$ stabilizes a different state with even parity, where the electrons
are attracted to the top layer and the bottom layer. The two phases are
topologically distinct insulating states with different Chern numbers, and they
can be distinguished by spin or valley Hall conductivity measurements.
Multilayers with more than five layers also exhibit similar ground states with
potential minima at the outermost layers, although the opening of a gap in the
spectrum as a whole is generally more difficult than in 4-layer because of a
larger number of energy bands overlapping at the Fermi energy.

that 21 orbits are linearly stable, which includes all of the progenitors. This

involving a single gene have recently been discussed. However, few works have
been devoted to the transition in two-dimensional models which include the
interaction of genes. Therefore, we investigate here, a quantitative
two-dimensional model (MeKS network) of gene expression dynamics describing the
competence development in the B. subtilis under the influence of L\'evy as well
as Brownian motions, where noises can do the B. subtilis a favor in nutrient
depletion. To analyze the transitions between the vegetative and the competence
regions therein, two deterministic quantities, the mean first exit time (MFET)
and the first escape probability (FEP) from a microscopic perspective, as well
as their averaged versions from a macroscopic perspective, are applied. The
relative contribution factor (RCF), the ratio of non-Gaussian and Gaussian
noise strengths, is adopted to implement optimal control in these transitions.
Schematic representations indicate that there exists an optimum choice that
makes the transition occurring at the highest probability. Additionally, we use
a geometric concept, the stochastic basin of attraction, to exhibit a pictorial
comprehension about the influence of the L\'{e}vy motion on the basin stability
of the competence state.

Particularly, to ensure the quality of the analysis, condensates up to

expansion (OPE) and improve the final results of the studied states. We note
that some condensate contributions could play an important role on the OPE
side. By releasing the rigid OPE convergence criterion, we arrive at the

of metric to follow locally the flow and its deformation, allowing one to find
quickly and accurately the initial phase-space position $Q(P)$ of any test
particle $P$, by expanding at second order the geometry of the motion in the
vicinity of the closest element. It is thus possible to reconstruct accurately
the phase-space distribution function at any time $t$ and position $P$ by
proper interpolation of initial conditions, following Liouville theorem. When
distorsion of the elements of metric becomes too large, it is necessary to
create new initial conditions along with isotropic elements and repeat the
procedure again until next resampling. To speed up the process, interpolation
of the phase-space distribution is performed at second order during the
transport phase, while third order splines are used at the moments of
remapping. We also show how to compute accurately the region of influence of
each element of metric with the proper percolation scheme. The algorithm is
tested here in the framework of one-dimensional gravitational dynamics but is
implemented in such a way that it can be extended easily to four or
six-dimensional phase-space. It can also be trivially generalised to plasmas.

the restoration of a shift symmetry. After applying appropriate constraints to
our parameters, we find, for future CMB experiments, a small contribution to
the tensor-to-scalar ratio which can be at most of the order $r \sim 10^{-5}$.

the energy density in the gravitational waves produced this way might be above

about 88 percent of the radio sources. We used different multi-band diagnostics
to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), both radiatively efficient and
inefficient, from star-forming galaxies. From our analysis, we find that about
80 percent of our radio-selected sample is AGN-dominated, with the fraction
raising to 92 percent when considering only the radio sources with redshift
>1.5. This large fraction of AGN-dominated radio sources at very low flux
densities (the median flux density at 5.5 GHz is 42 microJy), where
star-forming galaxies are expected to dominate, is somewhat surprising and at
odds with other results. Our interpretation is that both the frequency and
angular resolution of our radio observations strongly select against radio
sources whose brightness distribution is diffuse on scale of several kpc.
Indeed, we find that the median angular sizes of the AGN-dominated sources is
around 0.2-0.3 arcsec against 0.8 arcsec for star-forming galaxies. This
highlights the key role that high frequency radio observations can play in
pinpointing AGN-driven radio emission at microJy levels. This work is part of

evidence for this scenario is mixed. To investigate any influence of galaxy
mergers on AGN triggering and luminosities through cosmic time, we present a
sample of 106 luminous X-ray selected type 1 AGN from the COSMOS survey. These
AGN occupy a large redshift range (0.5 < z < 2.2) and two orders of magnitude
in X-ray luminosity ($\sim$10$^{43}$ - 10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). AGN hosts are
carefully mass and redshift matched to 486 control galaxies. A novel technique
for identifying and quantifying merger features in galaxies is developed,
subtracting GALFIT galaxy models and quantifying the residuals. Comparison to
visual classification confirms this measure reliably picks out disturbance
features in galaxies. No enhancement of merger features with increasing AGN
luminosity is found with this metric, or by visual inspection. We analyse the
redshift evolution of AGN associated with galaxy mergers and find no merger
enhancement in lower redshift bins. Contrarily, in the highest redshift bin
(z$\sim$2) AGN are $\sim$4 times more likely to be in galaxies exhibiting
evidence of morphological disturbance compared to control galaxies, at 99%
confidence level ($\sim$2.4$\sigma$) from visual inspection. Since only
$\sim$15% of these AGN are found to be in morphologically disturbed galaxies,
it is implied that major mergers at high redshift make a noticeable but
subdominant contribution to AGN fuelling. At low redshifts other processes
dominate and mergers become a less significant triggering mechanism.

power-law decay of the defect density in the final state reached following a
slow quenching of the chemical potential ($\mu$) across a quantum critical
point, depends non-trivially on the exponent $\alpha$ as long as $\alpha <2$;
on the other hand, for $\alpha >2$, one finds that the exponent saturates to
the corresponding well-know value of $1/2$ expected for the short-range model.
Furthermore, studying the dynamical quantum phase transitions manifested in the
non-analyticities in the rate function of the return possibility ($I(t)$) in
subsequent temporal evolution following a sudden change in $\mu$, we show the
existence of a new region; in this region, we find three instants of cusp
singularities in $I(t)$ associated with a single sector of Fisher zeros.
Notably, the width of this region shrinks as $\alpha$ increases and vanishes in
the limit $\alpha \to 2$.

complexifier in homogeneous and isotropic FRW cosmology. The complexifier is
the dilatation operator acting on the canonical phase space for gravity and
generates the canonical transformations shifting the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.
We focus on the closed algebra consisting in the complexifier, the 3d volume
and the Hamiltonian constraint, which we call the CVH algebra. In standard
cosmology, for gravity coupled to a scalar field, the CVH algebra is identified
as a su(1,1) Lie algebra, with the Hamiltonian as a null generator, the
complexifier as a boost and the su(1,1) Casimir given by the matter density.
The loop gravity cosmology approach introduces a regularization length scale
$\lambda$ and regularizes the gravitational Hamiltonian in terms of SU(2)
holonomies. We show that this regularization is compatible with the CVH
algebra, if we suitably regularize the complexifier and inverse volume factor.
The regularized complexifier generates a generalized version of the Barbero's
canonical transformation which reduces to the classical one when $\lambda
\rightarrow 0$. This structure allows for the exact integration of the actions
of the Hamiltonian constraints and the complexifier. This straightforwardly
extends to the quantum level: the cosmological evolution is described in terms
of SU(1,1) coherent states and the regularized complexifier generates unitary
transformations. The Barbero-Immirzi parameter is to be distinguished from the
regularization scale $\lambda$, it can be rescaled unitarily and the Immirzi
ambiguity ultimately disappears from the physical predictions of the theory.
Finally, we show that the complexifier becomes the effective Hamiltonian when
deparametrizing the dynamics using the scalar field as a clock, thus
underlining the deep relation between cosmological evolution and scale

standard stars as introduced by the Mt. Wilson team, thus giving us a direct
comparison with their huge body of observations taken between 1966 and 1992, as
well as with other cool stars. Carrington cycle 24 activity started from the
unusually deep and long minimum 2008/09, with an S-index average of only 0.154,
by 0.015 deeper than the one of 1986 (<S>=0.169). In this respect,the
chromospheric radiative losses differ remarkably from the variation of the
coronal radio flux F10.7cm and the sunspot numbers. In addition, the cycle 24
S-amplitude remained small, 0.022 (cycles 21 and 22 averaged: 0.024), and so
resulted a very low 2014 maximum of <S>=0.176 (cycles 21 and 22 averaged:

emission is a good proxy for the solar far-UV flux, which plays an important

an important role to stabilize the skyrmion. Additionally, we have obtained a
good agreement between our analytical calculations and previously published
micromagnetic simulations for $n = 10$. For this reliable value of $n$, we have
obtained that for a Dzyaloshinski Moriya constant $D = 5.5 \, (mJ/m^2)$, it is
possible to stabilize a N\'eel skyrmion for $K_u$ in the range, $0.4 \,

quasi-Keplerian profile $q \approx -3/2$ and cover wide ranges of Reynolds
($Re\le 4\cdot10^4$) and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($0\le Pm \le 1$). In the
quasi-Keplerian case, the onset of instability depends on the magnetic Reynolds
number, with $Rm_c \approx 50$, and angular momentum transport scales as
$\sqrt{Pm} Re^2$ in the turbulent regime. The ratio of Maxwell to Reynolds
stresses is set by $Rm$. At the onset of instability both stresses have similar
magnitude, whereas the Reynolds stress vanishes or becomes even negative as
$Rm$ increases. For the profile close to the Rayleigh line, the instability
shares these properties as long as $Pm\gtrsim0.1$, but exhibits a markedly
different character if $Pm\rightarrow 0$, where the onset of instability is
governed by the Reynolds number, with $Re_c \approx 1250$, transport is via

terms of dissipation of a huge internal magnetic field of the order of
$10^{15-16}$G. How such a strong magnetic field can originate during the
formation of a neutron star is still subject of active research. An important
role can be played by fast rotation: if magnetars are born as millisecond
rotators dynamo mechanisms may efficiently amplify the magnetic field inherited
from the progenitor star during the collapse. In this case, the combination of
rapid rotation and strong magnetic field determine the right physical condition
not only for the development of a powerful jet driven explosion, manifesting as
a gamma ray burst, but also for a copious gravitational waves emission. Strong
magnetic fields are indeed able to induce substantial quadrupolar deformations
in the star. In this paper we analyze the joint effect of rotation and
magnetization on the structure of a polytropic and axisymmetric neutron star,
within the ideal magneto-hydrodynamic regime. We will consider either purely
toroidal or purely poloidal magnetic field geometries. Through the sampling of
a large parameter space, we generalize previous results in literature,
inferring new quantitative relations that allow for a parametrization of the
induced deformation, that takes into account also the effects due to the
stellar compactness and the current distribution. Finally, in the case of
purely poloidal field, we also discuss how different prescriptions on the
surface charge distribution (a gauge freedom) modify the properties of the
surrounding electrosphere and its physical implications.

grid. The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on
the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs,
thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid.
In this paper, a novel gametheoretic framework for smart routing of EVs within
the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to balance the
electricity load across the grid while taking into account the traffic
congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is
formulated as a noncooperative game. For this game, it is shown that selfish
behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price
of anarchy upper bounded by the variance of the ground load induced by the
residential, industrial, or commercial users. Moreover, the results are
extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the
subjective behavior of the owners of EVs as captured by using notions from the
behavioral framework of prospect theory. Simulation results provide new
insights on more efficient energy pricing at charging stations and under more
realistic grid conditions.

opened up the possibility for experiments at high power densities, in
particular allowing for fluence-dependent absorption and scattering experiments
to reveal non-linear light-matter interactions at ever shorter wavelengths.
Findings of such non-linear effects in the XUV and X-ray regime are met with
tremendous interest, but prove difficult to understand and model due to the
inherent shot-to-shot fluctuations in photon intensity and the often
structured, non-Gaussian spatial intensity profile of a focused FEL beam.
Presently, the focused beam spot is characterized and optimized separately from
the actual experiment. Here, we present the first simultaneous measurement of
diffraction signals from solid samples in tandem with the corresponding
single-shot spatial fluence distribution on the actual sample. This new in-situ
characterization scheme enables fast and direct monitoring and thus control of
the sample illumination which ultimately is necessary for a quantitative
understanding of non-linear light-matter interaction in X-ray and XUV FEL
experiments.

extinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same

possible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the
other(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher
reproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such
as asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been
found to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine
competitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models,
including stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic
(mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the
""biological clock"" of one species is a factor of $\alpha$ slower than that of
the other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and
competition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems. We find
that a species with a slower biological clock has an advantage if resources are
limited, winning the competition against a species with a faster clock, in
relatively small systems. Periodic or stochastic environmental variations also
favor the slower species, even in much larger systems.

Moreover, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to
context information, which may not be available at a central entity due to
communication overhead or privacy concerns. Additionally, evaluating worker
performance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose
a context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem
of performance maximization in MCS. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC)
in the mobile device of a worker regularly observes the worker's context,
her/his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing
tasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates the worker's
context-specific performance. The mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) then
selects workers based on performance estimates received from the LCs. This
hierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker
performance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers. In addition,
our algorithm preserves worker context locally, and it keeps the number of
required quality assessments low. We prove that our algorithm converges to the
optimal task assignment strategy. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms simpler
task assignment strategies in experiments based on synthetic and real data.

vanishing $\bar{b}_2$ in the large $N$ limit. In the standard form of the
effective string theory possible massive modes and the presence of a rigidity
term are usually not considered, even though they might give a contribution to
the energy levels. To investigate the effect of these terms, we perform a
second analysis, including these contributions. We find that the associated
expression for the potential also provides a good description of the data. The
resulting continuum values for $\bar{b}_2$ are about a factor of 2 smaller than
in the standard analysis, due to contaminations from an additional $1/R^4$
term. However, $\bar{b}_2$ shows a similar decrease in magnitude with
increasing $N$. In the course of this extended analysis we also obtain
continuum results for the masses appearing in the additional terms and we find

heat conduction on a crystal that became a milestone problem of non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Along with its inability to reproduce Fourier's Law -
which subsequent generalizations have been trying to amend - the RLL model is
also characterized by awkward cusps at the ends of the non-equilibrium chain,
an effect that has endured all these years without a satisfactory answer. In
this paper, we first show that such trait stems from the insufficiency of
pinning interactions between the chain and the substrate. Assuming the
possibility of pinning the chain, the analysis of the temperature profile in
the space of parameters reveals that for a proper combination of the border and
bulk pinning values, the temperature profile may shift twice between the RLL
cuspidal behavior and the expected monotonic local temperature evolution along
the system, as a function of the pinning. At those inversions, the temperature
profile along the chain is characterized by perfect plateaux: at the first
threshold, the cumulants of the heat flux reach their maxima and the vanishing
of the two-point velocity correlation function for all sites of the chain so
that the system behaves similarly to a ""phonon box"". On the other hand, at the
second change of the temperature profile, we still have the vanishing of the
two-point correlation function but only for the bulk, which explains the
emergence of the temperature plateau and thwarts the reaching of the maximal
values of the cumulants of the heat flux.

phylogenetics. A particular variant of the reconciliation problem for a gene
tree T and a species tree S assumes that for each interior vertex x of T it is
known whether x represents a speciation or a duplication. This problem appears
in the context of analyzing orthology data.
  Results: We show that S is a species tree for T if and only if S displays all
rooted triples of T that have three distinct species as their leaves and are
rooted in a speciation vertex. A valid reconciliation map can then be found in
polynomial time. Simulated data shows that the event-labeled gene trees convey
a large amount of information on underlying species trees, even for a large
percentage of losses.
  Conclusions: The knowledge of event labels in a gene tree strongly constrains
the possible species tree and, for a given species tree, also the possible
reconciliation maps. Nevertheless, many degrees of freedom remain in the space
of feasible solutions. In order to disambiguate the alternative solutions
additional external constraints as well as optimization criteria could be
employed.

covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and a robust kernel cross-covariance
operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of
the quadratic loss function. Second, we derive the IF for robust kernel CCO and
standard kernel CCA. Using the IF of the standard kernel CCA, we can detect
influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method

two communication pairs, when one communication pair achieves its quality of
service (QoS) requirement, they can help the transmission of the other
communication pair according to the trust degree, which quantifies the
trustworthiness between users in the cooperation. For given trust degree, we
investigate the user cooperation strategies, which include the power allocation
and precoder design for various antenna configurations. For SISO and MISO
cases, we provide the optimal power allocation and beamformer design that
maximize the expected achievable rates while guaranteeing the QoS requirement.
For a SIMO case, we resort to semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and block
coordinate update (BCU) method to solve the corresponding problem, and
guarantee the rank-one solutions at each step. For a MIMO case, as MIMO is the
generalization of MISO and SIMO, the similarities among their problem
structures inspire us to combine the methods from MISO and SIMO together to
efficiently tackle MIMO case. Simulation results show that the trust degree
information has a great effect on the performance of the user cooperation in

strategies achieve high achievable rates for given trust degree.

a frequency much lower than the observational range of pulsar timing arrays
(PTAs) was suggested in Yonemaru et al. (2016). In the PTA analysis, ultra-low
frequency GWs ($\lesssim 10^{-10}$ Hz) which evolve just linearly during the
observation time span are absorbed by the pulsar spin-down rates since both
have the same effect on the pulse arrival time. Therefore, such GWs cannot be
detected by the conventional method of PTAs. However, the bias on the observed
spin-down rates depends on relative direction of a pulsar and GW source and
shows a quadrupole pattern in the sky. Thus, if we divide the pulsars according
to the position in the sky and see the difference in the statistics of the
spin-down rates, ultra-low frequency GWs from a single source can be detected.
In this paper, we evaluate the potential of this method by Monte-Carlo
simulations and estimate the sensitivity, considering only the ""Earth term""
while the ""pulsar term"" acts like random noise for GW frequencies
$10^{-13}-10^{-10}$ Hz. We find that with 3,000 milli-second pulsars, which are
expected to be discovered by a future survey with the Square Kilometre Array,
GWs with the derivative of amplitude of about $3 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{s}^{-1}$
can in principle be detected. Implications for possible supermassive binary
black holes in Sgr${}^*$ and M87 are also given.

Denote $A_S(e)$ as the area of $S$, for a given choice of $e$.
  The Einstein-Hilbert action $S(e,\omega)$ is defined on $e$ and $\omega$. We

classic probability theory. A disjunction fallacy leads to the violation of
these two classical laws. In this paper, an Evidential Markov (EM) decision
making model based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and Markov
modelling is proposed to address this issue and model the real human
decision-making process. In an evidential framework, the states are extended by
introducing an uncertain state which represents the hesitance of a decision
maker. The classical Markov model can not produce the disjunction effect, which
assumes that a decision has to be certain at one time. However, the state is
allowed to be uncertain in the EM model before the final decision is made. An
extra uncertainty degree parameter is defined by a belief entropy, named Deng
entropy, to assignment the basic probability assignment of the uncertain state,
which is the key to predict the disjunction effect. A classical categorization
decision-making experiment is used to illustrate the effectiveness and validity
of EM model. The disjunction effect can be well predicted and the free
parameters are less compared with the existing models.

motion of both objects with non-zero mass and massless particles, under a
conservative attracting force. It is shown that for any conservative force a
properly defined energy is conserved on the trajectories and if this force is
central, the angular momentum is also preserved. An RND equation of motion is
derived for motion under a conservative force. As an application, it is shown
that RND predicts accurately also the Shapiro time delay - the fourth test of
GR.

derive the gravitational deflection of both objects with non-zero mass and of
massless particles passing the strong gravitating field of a massive body.
Equations for the trajectory and the resulting analytical expressions for the
deflection angle, in terms of the distance and velocity at the point of closest
approach to the massive object, were derived in both cases. It is shown that
with a carefully defined limit, the trajectory of a massless particle is the
limiting case of that of an object with non-zero mass. In the ""weak"" deflection
limit, the derived expression for the deflection angle of a massless particle
(photon) reproduces the experimentally tested Einstein's formula for weak
gravitational lensing of a light ray, thereby providing another test for the
validity of the RND.
