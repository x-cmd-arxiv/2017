bulge/disk decompositions). We observed larger sizes for early type and smaller
sizes for massive late type galaxies in clusters in comparison to the field. We
attribute this to longer quenching timescales of more massive galaxies in the
cluster. Our analysis further revealed an increasing importance of recently
quenched transition objects (""red disks""). This is a virialized population
found at higher cluster-centric radii with sizes similar to the quiescent,
spheroid-dominated population of the cluster center, but with disks still
in-tact. The mass-size relation of cluster galaxies may therefore be understood
as the consequence of a mix of progenitors formed at different quenching
epochs. We also find that galaxy sizes smoothly decreasing as a function of
bulge fraction. At same bulge-to-total ratio and same stellar mass, quiescent
galaxies are smaller than star-forming galaxies. This is likely because of a
fading of the outskirts of the disk, which we saw in comparing sizes of their
disk-components. Ram-pressure stripping of the cold gas and other forms of more
gradual gas starvation are likely responsible for this observation.

lower the computational demands significantly. However, for effects that

developed a new technique based on the efficient combination of fine-scale and

computational benefits of the coarse grain model where a lower resolution is
sufficient. To this end, our method establishes two-way coupling between

achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and speedup. This approach enables
us to reach large time and length scales while retaining specifics of crucial

simulations, where the resolution of the CFD mesh may be changed adaptively as

probability distributions on the space of CPTP maps that enable Bayesian
analysis of process tomography. The first is a probability distribution that

maps, that capture meaningful prior information for use in Bayesian estimation.
We show how these distributions can be used for point estimation using either
maximum a posteriori estimates or expected a posteriori estimates, as well as
full Bayesian tomography resulting in posterior credibility intervals. This

U_q(sl(2|1)) is not semi-simple and the quantum dimension of a generic

interacting molecules and surfaces can cause significant shifts in the
excitation and transport behavior of electrons. This phenomenon is crucial in
determining the oxidative stability of nonaqeous electrolytes in high energy
density electrochemical systems such as the Li-O$_2$ battery. On the basis of
partially self-consistent first-principles ScGW0 calculations, we
systematically study how the electronic energy levels of four commonly used
solvent molecules, namely dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethoxyethane (DME),
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetonitrile (ACN), renormalize when physisorbed on
the different stable surfaces of Li$_2$O$_2$, the main discharge product. Using
band level alignment arguments, we propose that the difference between the
solvent's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the surface's
valence band maximum (VBM) is a refined metric of oxidative stability. This
metric and a previously used descriptor, solvent's gas phase HOMO level, agree
quite well for physisorbed cases on pristine surfaces where ACN is oxidatively
most stable followed by DME, THF and DMSO. However, this effect is
intrinsically linked to the surface chemistry of solvent's interaction with the
surfaces states and defects, and depends strongly on their nature. We
conclusively show that the propensity of solvent molecules to oxidize will be
significantly higher on Li$_2$O$_2$ surfaces with defects as compared to
pristine surfaces. This suggests that the oxidatively stability of solvent is
dynamic and is a strong function of surface electronic properties. Thus, while
gas phase HOMO levels could be used for preliminary solvent candidate
screening, a more refined picture of solvent stability requires mapping out the
solvent stability as a function of the state of the surface under the operating
conditions.

inspirals in quasicircular orbits, including the 2.5PN and 3.5PN horizon flux

frequency-domain template with and without the horizon-flux contribution is
typically above the 3% mark. For (supermassive) binary BHs observed by LISA,
even a moderate mass-ratios and spins can produce a similar level of the
mismatch. Meanwhile, the mismatch due to the secular time variations of the BH
masses and spins is well below the 1% mark in both cases, hence this is truly
negligible. We also point out that neglecting the cubic-in-spin, point-particle

refer to the small fraction of faulty or slow processors that delays the entire
computation in time-critical distributed systems. We first show that splitting
the vectors into smaller pieces and using a linear code to encode these pieces
provides better resilience against stragglers than replication-based schemes
under a simple, worst-case straggler analysis. We then demonstrate that under
commonly used models of computation time, coding can dramatically improve the
probability of finishing the computation within a target ""deadline"" time. As
opposed to the more commonly used technique of expected computation time
analysis, we quantify the exponents of the probability of failure in the limit
of large deadlines. Our exponent metric captures the probability of failing to
finish before a specified deadline time, i.e. , the behavior of the ""tail"".
Moreover, our technique also allows for simple closed form expressions for more

shifted exponentials. Thus, through this problem of coded convolution, we
establish the utility of a novel asymptotic failure exponent analysis for

reproducing and storing spatial audio in the higher order ambisonics (HOA)
representation, given its rendering flexibility. Recent standardization for HOA
compression adopted a framework wherein HOA data are decomposed into principal
components that are then encoded by standard audio coding, i.e., frequency
domain quantization and entropy coding to exploit psychoacoustic redundancy. A
noted shortcoming of this approach is the occasional mismatch in principal
components across blocks, and the resulting suboptimal transitions in the data
fed to the audio coder. Instead, we propose a framework where singular value
decomposition (SVD) is performed after transformation to the frequency domain
via the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). This framework not only
ensures smooth transition across blocks, but also enables frequency dependent
SVD for better energy compaction. Moreover, we introduce a novel noise
substitution technique to compensate for suppressed ambient energy in discarded
higher order ambisonics channels, which significantly enhances the perceptual
quality of the reconstructed HOA signal. Objective and subjective evaluation
results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
terms of both higher compression gains and better perceptual quality, compared
to existing methods.

atmosphere model grids including either deep iron/silicate clouds or
sulfide/salt clouds in the photosphere, spanning a range of cloud properties,
including fully cloudy, cloud free and patchy/intermediate opacity clouds.
Model fits suggest that 51 Eri b has an effective temperature ranging between
605-737 K, a solar metallicity, a surface gravity of $\log$(g) = 3.5-4.0 dex,
and the atmosphere requires a patchy cloud atmosphere to model the SED. From
the model atmospheres, we infer a luminosity for the planet of -5.83 to -5.93
($\log L/L_{\odot}$), leaving 51 Eri b in the unique position as being one of
the only directly imaged planet consistent with having formed via cold-start
scenario. Comparisons of the planet SED against warm-start models indicates
that the planet luminosity is best reproduced by a planet formed via core
accretion with a core mass between 15 and 127 M$_{\oplus}$.

halo clustering on a halo property other than mass. This prediction of the
Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmology is essential to modelling the galaxy
distribution to high precision and interpreting clustering measurements. As the
name suggests, different manifestations of secondary halo bias have been
thought to originate from halo assembly histories. We show conclusively that
this is incorrect for cluster-size haloes. We present an up-to-date summary of
secondary halo biases of high-mass haloes due to various halo properties
including concentration, spin, several proxies of assembly history, and subhalo
properties. While concentration, spin, and the abundance and radial
distribution of subhaloes exhibit significant secondary biases, properties that
directly quantify halo assembly history do not. In fact, the entire assembly
histories of haloes in pairs are nearly identical to those of isolated haloes.
In general, a global correlation between two halo properties does not predict
whether or not these two properties exhibit similar secondary biases. For
example, assembly history and concentration (or subhalo abundance) are
correlated for both paired and isolated haloes, but follow slightly different
conditional distributions in these two cases. This results in a secondary halo
bias due to concentration (or subhalo abundance), despite the lack of assembly
bias in the strict sense for cluster-size haloes. Due to this complexity,
caution must be exercised in using any one halo property as a proxy to study
the secondary bias due to another property.

equivalent to the LSM theorem, whereas there is another anomaly, which is not
related to the LSM theorem but is intrinsic to the SPT states. As an
application, we extend the conventional LSM theorem to multiple-charge
multiple-species problems and construct several exotic symmetric insulators. We

originate from the mergers of binary stars, or ""common envelope"" events. Their
light curves often show secondary maxima, which cannot be explained in the
previous models of thermal energy diffusion or hydrogen recombination without
invoking multiple independent shell ejections. We propose that double-peaked
light curves are a natural consequence of a collision between
dynamically-ejected fast shell and pre-existing equatorially-focused material,
which was shed from the binary over many orbits preceding the dynamical event.
The fast shell expands freely in the polar directions, powering the initial
optical peak through cooling envelope emission. Radiative shocks from the
collision in the equatorial plane power the secondary light curve peak on the
radiative diffusion timescale of the deeper layers, similar to luminous Type
IIn supernovae and some classical novae. Using a detailed 1D analytic model,
informed by complementary 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that
shock-powered emission can explain the observed range of peak timescales and
luminosities of the secondary peaks in LRN for realistic variations in the
binary parameters and fraction of the binary mass ejected. The dense shell
created by the radiative shocks in the equatorial plane provides an ideal
location for dust nucleation consistent with the the inferred aspherical
geometry of dust in LRN. For giant stars, the ejecta forms dust when the
shock-powered luminosity is still high, which could explain the infrared
transients recently discovered by Spitzer. Our results suggest that
pre-dynamical mass loss is common if not ubiquitous in stellar mergers,
providing insight into the instabilities responsible for driving the binary

the theory without the defect, such as two-point functions of operators of
unequal conformal dimension. We furthermore exploit the operator product
expansion (OPE) and the boundary operator expansion (BOE), which form the basis
of the boundary conformal bootstrap equations, to extract conformal data both
about the defect CFT and about N=4 SYM theory without the defect. From the
knowledge of the one- and two-point functions of the defect theory, we extract
certain structure constants of N=4 SYM theory using the (bulk) OPE and
constrain certain bulk-bulk-to-boundary couplings using the BOE. The extraction
of the former relies on a non-trivial, polynomial k dependence of the one-point

scenarios involve dissipation processes above or below the photosphere of an
ultra-relativistic outflow. Aims: We search for observational features that
would favour one scenario over the others by constraining the dissipation
radius, the outflow magnetization or by indicating the presence of shocks.
Bursts showing peculiarities can emphasize the role of a specific physical
ingredient, which becomes more apparent under certain circumstances. Methods:
We study GRB 070110, which exhibited several remarkable features during its
early afterglow: a very flat plateau terminated by an extremely steep drop and
immediately followed by a bump. We model the plateau as photospheric emission
from a long lasting outflow of moderate Lorentz factor ($\Gamma\sim 20$) which
lags behind an ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma> 100$) ejecta responsible for the
prompt emission. We compute the dissipation of energy in the forward and
reverse shocks resulting from this ejecta's deceleration by the external
medium. Results: Photospheric emission from the long-lasting outflow can
account for the plateau properties (luminosity and spectrum) assuming some
dissipation takes place in the flow. The geometrical timescale at the
photospheric radius is so short that the observed decline at the end of the
plateau likely corresponds to the shut-down of the central engine. The
following bump results from dissipated power in the reverse shock, which
develops when the slower material catches up with the initially fast component,
after it had been decelerated. Conclusions: Our interpretation suggests that
the prompt phase resulted from dissipation above the photosphere while the
plateau had a photospheric origin. If the bump is produced by the reverse
shock, it implies an upper limit ($\sigma \lesssim 0.1$) on the magnetization
of the slower material.

MMT/Hectospec spectroscopy, we first perform a weak lensing shear analysis to
constrain the mass distribution in this field, including the cluster at $z =

lensing constraint from a multiply-imaged galaxy in the imaging data with a
photometric redshift of $z \approx 5.03$. Unlike previous cluster-scale lens
analyses, our technique accounts for the full three-dimensional mass structure
in the beam, including galaxies along the line of sight. In contrast with past
cluster analyses that use only lensed image positions as constraints, we use
the full surface brightness distribution of the images. This method predicts
that the source galaxy crosses a lensing caustic such that one image is a
highly-magnified ""fold arc"", which could be used to probe the source galaxy's
structure at ultra-high spatial resolution ($< 30$ pc). We calculate the mass
of the primary cluster to be $\mathrm{M_{vir}} = 2.93_{-0.65}^{+0.71} \times

shell-like morphology at TeV energies, matching in size and location with the
supernova remnant G323.7-1.0 discovered in radio observations by the Molonglo

no X-ray counterpart has been seen for HESS J1534-571. The detection of a new
GeV source using data from the \emph{Fermi} satellite that is compatible in
extension with the radio supernova remnant and shows a very hard power-law

the first broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission from this source. It is
shown that leptonic emission is compatible with the known multiwavelength data
and a corresponding set of physical source parameters is given. The required
total energy budget in leptons is reasonable, $\sim 1.5\times10^{48}$ erg for a
distance to the object of $5$ kpc. The new GeV observations imply that a
hadronic scenario, on the other hand, requires a cosmic ray spectrum that

focus on the parameter regime with a single photoactive node and control the
calculation in small impurity concentration. Internode scattering is treated
generically and therefore our results allow to continuously interpolate between
the cases of short range and long range impurities. We find that the time
evolution of the circular PGE may be nonmonotonic for intermediate internode
scattering. Furthermore, we show that the tilt vector introduces three
additional linearly independent components to the steady state photocurrent.
Amongst them, the photocurrent in direction of the tilt takes a particular role
inasmuch it requires elastic internode scattering or inelastic intranode
scattering to be relaxed. It may therefore be dominant. The tilt also generates
skew scattering which leads to a current component perpendicular to both the
incident light and the tilt. We extensively discuss our findings and comment on
the possible experimental implications.

they can quantify modifications to stress or strain across time that finally
lead to a major earthquake. This work uses the history of seismic activity of
micro-earthquakes to analyze the spatio-temporal statistical independence among

finding a relation between the level of dissimilarity among stations' readings

properties of our Universe, targeting both standard and non-standard physics.
In this paper, we study the effects of varying fundamental constants (i.e., the
fine-structure constant, $\alpha_{\rm EM}$, and electron rest mass, $m_{\rm
e}$) around last scattering using the recombination codes CosmoRec and
Recfast++. We approach the problem in a pedagogical manner, illustrating the
importance of various effects on the free electron fraction, Thomson visibility
function and CMB power spectra, highlighting various degeneracies. We
demonstrate that the simpler Recfast++ treatment (based on a three-level atom
approach) can be used to accurately represent the full computation of CosmoRec.
We also include explicit time-dependent variations using a phenomenological
power-law description. We reproduce previous Planck 2013 results in our
analysis. Assuming constant variations relative to the standard values, we find
the improved constraints $\alpha_{\rm EM}/\alpha_{\rm EM,0}=0.9993\pm 0.0025$
(CMB only) and $m_{\rm e}/m_{\rm e,0}= 1.0039 \pm 0.0074$ (including BAO) using
Planck 2015 data. For a redshift-dependent variation, $\alpha_{\rm
EM}(z)=\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)\,[(1+z)/1100]^p$ with $\alpha_{\rm
EM}(z_0)\equiv\alpha_{\rm EM,0}$ at $z_0=1100$, we obtain $p=0.0008\pm 0.0025$.
Allowing simultaneous variations of $\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)$ and $p$ yields
$\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)/\alpha_{\rm EM,0} = 0.9998\pm 0.0036$ and $p = 0.0006\pm
0.0036$. We also discuss combined limits on $\alpha_{\rm EM}$ and $m_{\rm e}$.
Our analysis shows that existing data is not only sensitive to the value of the
fundamental constants around recombination but also its first time derivative.
This suggests that a wider class of varying fundamental constant models can be
probed using the CMB.

promise in finding approximate nearest neighbors in high dimen- sional data

proximity of a pair of points cannot be captured without considering their
surroundings or context. In videos, as for example, a particular frame is
meaningful only when it is seen in the context of its preceding and following
frames. LSH has no mechanism to handle the con- texts of the data points. In
this article, a novel scheme of Context based Locality Sensitive Hashing
(conLSH) has been introduced, in which points are hashed together not only
based on their closeness, but also because of similar context. The contribution
made in this article is three fold. First, conLSH is integrated with a recently
proposed fast optimal sequence alignment algorithm (FOGSAA) using a layered
approach. The resultant method is applied to video retrieval for extracting
similar sequences. The pro- posed algorithm yields more than 80% accuracy on an
average in different datasets. It has been found to save 36.3% of the total
time, consumed by the exhaustive search. conLSH reduces the search space to
approximately 42% of the entire dataset, when compared with an exhaustive
search by the aforementioned FOGSAA, Bag of Words method and the standard LSH
implementations. Secondly, the effectiveness of conLSH is demon- strated in
action recognition of the video clips, which yields an average gain of 12.83%
in terms of classification accuracy over the state of the art methods using
STIP descriptors. The last but of great significance is that this article
provides a way of automatically annotating long and composite real life videos.

$\mu_{\rm rel} = 11.8\pm 0.8\,$mas/yr, which compares to the value of $\mu_{\rm

value for $\mu_{\rm rel}$ has an a priori probability that is a factor of $\sim

system distance of $D_L < 1\,$kpc. Based on the corrected source color, we find
that the lens system consists of a planet of mass $3.4^{+3.7}_{-1.6} M_{\rm

$2.1^{+2.2}_{-1.0}\,$AU and a distance of $1.2^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\,$kpc.

and their environment. The observed strong luminosity bursts of young stellar
objects likely have a long lasting impact on the chemical evolution of the disk
and envelope structure. We want to investigate observational signatures of the
chemical evolution in the post-burst phase for embedded sources. With such
signatures it is possible to identify targets that experienced a recent
luminosity burst. We present a new model for episodic accretion chemistry based
on the 2D, radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo. We have extended
ProDiMo with a proper treatment for envelope structures. For a representative
Class I model, we calculated the chemical abundances in the post-burst phase
and produced synthetic observables like intensity maps and radial profiles.
During a burst many chemical species, like CO, sublimate from the dust
surfaces. As the burst ends they freeze out again (post-burst phase). This
freeze-out happens from inside-out due to the radial density gradient in the
disk and envelope structure. This inside-out freeze-out produces clear
observational signatures in spectral line emission, like rings and distinct
features in the slope of radial intensity profiles. We fitted synthetic C18O
J=2-1 observations with single and two component fits and find that post-burst
images are much better matched by the latter. Comparing the quality of such
fits allows identification of post-burst targets in a model-independent way.
Our models confirm that it is possible to identify post-burst objects from
spatially resolved CO observations. However, to derive proper statistics, like
frequencies of bursts, from observations it is important to consider aspects
like the inclination and structure of the target and also dust properties as
those have a significant impact on the freeze-out timescale.

Hence, an efficient quantification of uncertainty is an important aspect of the

the input variables is crucial. In this paper, input variables are modelled by
probability-boxes, which account for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty.
Two types of probability-boxes are distinguished: free and parametric (also
called distributional) p-boxes. The use of probability-boxes generally
increases the complexity of structural reliability analyses compared to
traditional probabilistic input models. In this paper, the complexity is
handled by two-level approaches which use Kriging meta-models with adaptive
experimental designs at different levels of the structural reliability
analysis. For both types of probability-boxes, the extensive use of meta-models
allows for an efficient estimation of the failure probability at a limited

the additional element of an objective collapse of the wave function. The
incorporation of this new agent to the traditional inflationary setting might
represent a possible solution to the quantum measurement problem during
inflation, a subject that has not reached a consensus among the community.
Specifically, it could provide an explanation for the generation of the
primordial anisotropies and inhomogeneities, starting from a perfectly
symmetric background and invoking symmetric dynamics. We adopt the continuous
spontaneous localization model, in the context of inflation, as the dynamical
reduction mechanism that generates the primordial inhomogeneities. Furthermore,
when enforcing the objective reduction mechanism, the condition for eternal
inflation can be bypassed. In particular, the collapse mechanism incites the
wave function, corresponding to the inflaton, to localize itself around the
zero mode of the field. Then the zero mode will evolve essentially unperturbed,
driving inflation to an end in any region of the Universe where inflation

three-body equations of motion in powers of the ratio $a/A$, where $a$ and $A$
are the semimajor axis of the inner binary's orbit and of the orbit of the
third body relative to the center of mass of the inner binary, respectively.
The leading order ""quadrupole"" terms, of order $(a/A)^3$ relative to the
$1/a^2$ acceleration within the inner binary, are responsible for the
well-known Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital inclination and eccentricity.
The octupole terms, of order $(a/A)^4$ have been shown to allow the inner orbit
to ""flip"" from prograde relative to the outer orbit to retrograde and back, and
to permit excursions to very large eccentricities. We carry the expansion of
the equations of motion to hexadecapole order, corresponding to contributions
of order $(a/A)^5$. We also include the leading orbital effects of
post-Newtonian theory, namely the pericenter precessions of the inner and outer
orbits. Using the Lagrange planetary equations for the orbit elements of both
binaries, we average over orbital timescales, obtain the equations for the
secular evolution of the elements through hexadecapole order, and employ them
to analyze cases of astrophysical interest. We find that, for the most part,
the orbital flips found at octupole order are robust against both relativistic
and hexadecapole perturbations. We show that, for equal-mass inner binaries,
where the octupole terms vanish, the hexadecapole contributions can alone
generate orbital flips and excursions to very large eccentricities.

periodic repetition of a graphene sheet and a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
slab. Surface plasmons in a monolayer graphene can couple with a hyperbolic
phonon polaritons in a single hBN film to form hybrid polaritons that can
assist photon tunneling. For periodic multilayer graphene/hBN structures, the
stacked metallic/dielectric array can give rise to a further effective
hyperbolic behavior, in addition to the intrinsic natural hyperbolic behavior
of hBN. The effective hyperbolicity can enable more hyperbolic polaritons that
enhance the photon tunneling and hence the near-field heat transfer. However,
the hybrid polaritons on the surface, i.e. surface plasmon-phonon polaritons,
dominate the near-field heat transfer between multilayer structures when the
topmost layer is graphene. The effective hyperbolic regions can be well
predicted by the effective medium theory (EMT), thought EMT fails to capture
the hybrid surface polaritons and results in a heat transfer rate much lower
compared to the exact calculation. The chemical potential of the graphene
sheets can be tuned through electrical gating and results in an additional
modulation of the heat transfer. We found that the near-field heat transfer
between multilayer structure does not increase monotonously with the number of
layer in the stack, which provides a way to control the heat transfer rate by
the number of graphene layers in the multilayer structure. The results may
benefit the applications of near-field energy harvesting and radiative cooling
based on hybrid polaritons in two-dimensional materials.

characterised by two features: a stable arc branch of eigenmodes and an
isolated eigenmode. Both features are studied in detail, revealing that,
whereas the former is highly sensitive to numerical domain size and its
existence can be linked to spurious feedback from the outflow boundary, the
latter is the physical eigenmode that is responsible for the appearance of
self-sustained oscillations in low-density jets observed in experiments at low
Mach numbers. In contrast to previous local spatio-temporal stability analyses,
the present global analysis permits, for the first time, the determination of
the critical conditions for the onset of global instability, as well the
frequency of the associated oscillations, without additional hypotheses,
yielding predictions in fair agreement with previous experimental observations.
It is shown that under the conditions of those experiments, viscosity variation
with composition, as well as buoyancy, only have a small effect on the onset of

corresponding to a small flux, $f$, per plaquette. At $f=0$, there is a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T^*$, but at any small but
non-zero $f$, this transition is avoided, and replaced (presumably) by a
vortex-ordering transition at much lower temperatures. We thus have studied the
evolution of the dynamics for small and moderate $f$ as the system is cooled
from above $T^*$ to below. While we do find strongly temperature dependent
slowing of the dynamics as $T$ crosses $T^*$, and that simultaneously the
dynamics becomes more complex, neither effect is anywhere nearly as dramatic as
the corresponding phenomena in glass-forming liquids. At the very least, this
implies that the properties of supercooled liquids must depend on more than
frustration and the existence of an avoided transition.

the nebular continuum and recombination lines. The nebula has a very high inner
ionisation parameter. Consequently, radiation pressure dominates the gas
pressure and dust absorbs a large fraction of ionising photons. Radiation
pressure induces increasing density with radius. From a photoionisation
analysis we derive central star parameters; $\log T_{\mathrm eff} = 4.525$K,
$\log L_*/L_{\odot} = 4.029$, $\log g = 3.5$ and using stellar evolutionary
models we estimate an initial mass of $2.5 < M/M_{\odot} < 3.0$. The inner
filamentary shell is shocked by the rapidly increasing stellar wind ram
pressure, and we model this as an externally photoionised shock. In addition, a
shock is driven into the pre-existing Asymptotic Giant Branch stellar wind by
the strong D-Type ionisation front developed at the outer boundary of the
nebula. From the dynamics of the inner mass-loss bubble, and from stellar
evolutionary models we infer that the nebula became ionised in the last

  Convolutional Codes","25 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Basic properties of a characteristic matrix for a tail-biting convolutional
code are investigated. A tail-biting convolutional code can be regarded as a
linear block code. Since the corresponding scalar generator matrix Gt has a
kind of cyclic structure, an associated characteristic matrix also has a cyclic
structure, from which basic properties of a characteristic matrix are obtained.
Next, using the derived results, we discuss the possibility of trellis
reduction for a given tail-biting convolutional code. There are cases where we
can find a scalar generator matrix Gs equivalent to Gt based on a
characteristic matrix. In this case, if the polynomial generator matrix
corresponding to Gs has been reduced, or can be reduced by using appropriate
transformations, then trellis reduction for the original tail-biting
convolutional code is realized. In many cases, the polynomial generator matrix
corresponding to Gs has a monomial factor in some column and is reduced by
dividing the column by the factor. Note that this transformation corresponds to
cyclically shifting the associated code subsequence (a tail-biting path is
regarded as a code sequence) to the left. Thus if we allow partial cyclic
shifts of a tail-biting path, then trellis reduction is accomplished.

established for both the BiGLasso and TeraLasso estimators of the precision

(T), the gravitational acceleration (Log(g)), the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the
radial velocity (RV) are presented for those observed EW-type systems. It is
shown that about 80.6\% sample stars have metallicity below zero indicating
that EW-type systems are old stellar population. This is in agreement with the
the conclusion that the EW binaries are formed from moderately close binaries
through angular momentum loss via magnetic braking that takes a few hundred
million to a few billion years. The unusual high metallicities of a few percent
of EWs may be caused by contaminating of material from the evolution of unseen
neutron stars and black holes in the systems. The correlations between the
orbital period and the effect temperature, the gravitational acceleration and
the metallicity are presented and their scatters are mainly caused by (i) the
presence of the third bodies and (ii) the wrong determined periods sometimes.
It is shown that some EW contain evolved component stars and the physical
properties of EWs are mainly depending on their orbital periods. It is found
that the extremely short-period EWs may be older than their long-period cousins
because they have lower metallicities. This reveals that they have a longer
timescale of pre-contact evolution and their formation and evolution are mainly
driven by angular momentum loss via magnetic braking.

detect gene members of pathways or other relations such as protein-protein
interactions. In this work, we explore the plausibility of detecting gene
modules by factorizing gene-phenotype associations from a phenotype ontology
rather than the conventionally used gene expression data. In particular, the
hierarchical structure of ontology has not been sufficiently utilized in
clustering genes while functionally related genes are consistently associated
with phenotypes on the same path in the phenotype ontology. Results: We propose
a hierarchal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based method, called
Consistent Multiple Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CMNMF), to factorize
genome-phenome association matrix at two levels of the hierarchical structure
in phenotype ontology for mining gene functional modules. CMNMF constrains the
gene clusters from the association matrices at two consecutive levels to be
consistent since the genes are annotated with both the child phenotype and the
parent phenotype in the consecutive levels. CMNMF also restricts the identified
phenotype clusters to be densely connected in the phenotype ontology hierarchy.
In the experiments on mining functionally related genes from mouse phenotype
ontology and human phenotype ontology, CMNMF effectively improved clustering
performance over the baseline methods. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was
also conducted to reveal interesting gene modules. Conclusions: Utilizing the
information in the hierarchical structure of phenotype ontology, CMNMF can
identify functional gene modules with more biological significance than the
conventional methods. CMNMF could also be a better tool for predicting members
of gene pathways and protein-protein interactions. Availability:

Limits in available thermodynamic data narrow the parameter space that can be
explored: insufficient coverage in pressure, temperature, and composition for
end-member salinities of MgSO$_4$ and NaCl, and for relevant water ices; and a
dearth of suitable data for aqueous mixtures of Na-Mg-Cl-SO$_4$-NH$_3$. For
Europa, ocean compositions that are oxidized and dominated by MgSO$_4$, vs
reduced (NaCl), illustrate these gaps, but also show the potential for
diagnostic and measurable combinations of geophysical parameters. The
low-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals, or anydrous
minerals with high porosity comparable to Earth's upper mantle. Titan's ocean
must be dense, but not necessarily saline, as previously noted, and may have
little or no high-pressure ice at its base. Ganymede's silicious interior is
deepest among all known ocean worlds, and may contain multiple phases of
high-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently
salty. Callisto's likely near-eutectic ocean cannot be adequately modeled using

by the interplay of long-range Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder are
studied by performing a renormalization group analysis. It is found that an
arbitrarily weak disorder drives the double-Weyl semimetal to undergo a quantum
phase transition into a compressible diffusive metal, independent of the
disorder type and the Coulomb interaction strength. In contrast, the nature of
the ground state of triple-Weyl fermion system relies sensitively on the
specific disorder type in the noninteracting limit: The system is turned into a
compressible diffusive metal state by an arbitrarily weak random scalar
potential or $z$ component of random vector potential but exhibits stable
critical behavior when there is only $x$ or $y$ component of random vector
potential. In case the triple-Weyl fermions couple to random scalar potential,
the system becomes a diffusive metal in the weak interaction regime but remains
a semimetal if Coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong. Interplay of Coulomb
interaction and $x$, or $y$, component of random vector potential leads to a
stable infrared fixed point that is likely to be characterized by critical
behavior. When Coulomb interaction coexists with the $z$ component of random
vector potential, the system flows to the interaction-dominated strong coupling
regime, which might drive a Mott insulating transition. It is thus clear that
double- and triple-Weyl fermions exhibit distinct low-energy behavior in
response to interaction and disorder. The physical explanation of such
distinction is discussed in detail. The role played by long-range Coulomb
impurity in triple-Weyl semimetal is also considered.

of swarming in a range of general-purpose robotic systems. This is achieved by
combining a modular and transferable software toolbox with a hardware suite

developed technology can be ported to a relatively vast range of robotic
platforms with minimal changes and high levels of scalability. This

commercial terrestrial robots. We have tested the effectiveness of both of
these distributed robotic systems in performing collective exploration and
search scenarios, as well as other classical cooperative behaviors.
Experimental results on different swarm behaviors are reported for the two
platforms in uncontrolled environments and without any supporting
infrastructure. The design of the associated software library allows for a
seamless switch to other cooperative behaviors, and also offers the possibility
to simulate newly designed collective behaviors prior to their implementation

different monoclinic, M1 and triclinic, T insulating phases which undergo a
first order metal to insulator transition (MIT) followed by a structural phase
transition (SPT) to rutile tetragonal phase. The metal insulator transition
temperature (Tc) was found to be increased with increasing native defects.
Vanadium vacancy (VV) is envisaged to create local strains in the lattice which
prevents twisting of the V-V dimers promoting metastable monoclinic, M2 and T
phases at intermediate temperatures. It is argued that MIT is driven by strong
electronic correlation. The low temperature insulating phase can be considered
as a collection of one-dimensional (1-D) half-filled band, which undergoes Mott
transition to 1-D infinitely long Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains leading to
structural distortion due to spin-phonon coupling. Presence of VV creates
localized holes (d0) in the nearest neighbor, thereby fragmenting the spin 1/2
chains at nanoscale, which in turn increase the Tc value more than that of an
infinitely long one. The Tc value scales inversely with the average size of
fragmented Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains following a critical exponent of 2/3,
which is exactly the same predicted theoretically for Heisenberg spin 1/2 chain
at nanoscale undergoing SPT (spin-Peierls transition). Thus, the observation of
MIT and SPT at the same time in VO2 can be explained from our phenomenological
model of reduced 1-D Heisenberg spin 1/2 chains. The reported increase
(decrease) in Tc value of VO2 by doping with metal having valency less (more)
than four, can also be understood easily with our unified model, for the first
time, considering finite size scaling of Heisenberg chains.

the BS beamformer and the time-splitting (TS) parameter of energy harvesting

maximize the ergodic information rate at the MS, while maintaining the outage

solving for it at each frequency and spherical-harmonic degree and summing over
all these pieces. These computations are performed in parallel

Kernels are calculated by invoking the first-order Born approximation
connecting deviations in the wavefield to perturbations in the operator.
Validated flow kernels are shown to produce travel times within 0.47% of the
true value for uniform flows up to 750 m/s. We find that travel-time can be
obtained with errors of 1 millisecond or less for flows having magnitudes
similar to meridional circulation. Alongside flows, we also compute and
validate sensitivity kernel for sound-speed perturbations. These accurate

the electronic transport properties. One of the most important parasitic
element is the contact resistance appearing between graphene and the metal
electrodes functioning as the source and the drain. Ohmic contacts to graphene,
with low contact resistances, are necessary for injection and extraction of
majority charge carriers to prevent transistor parameter fluctuations caused by
variations of the contact resistance. The International Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors, toward integration and down-scaling of graphene electronic
devices, identifies as a challenge the development of a CMOS compatible process
that enables reproducible formation of low contact resistance. However, the
contact resistance is still not well understood despite it is a crucial barrier
towards further improvements. In this paper, we review the experimental and
theoretical activity that in the last decade has been focusing on the reduction

provide physical insight into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a
recently conjectured principle for statistical errors and irreversible heat
dissipation in nonequilibrium steady states. According to the relation,
nonequilibrium output generated from dissipative processes necessarily incurs
an energetic cost or heat dissipation $q$, and in order to limit the output
fluctuation within a relative uncertainty $\epsilon$, at least
$2k_BT/\epsilon^2$ of heat must be dissipated. Our model shows that this bound
is attained not only at near-equilibrium ($f\ll V'(x)$) but also at
far-from-equilibrium $(f\gg V'(x))$, more generally when the dissipated heat is
normally distributed. Furthermore, the energetic cost is maximized near the
critical force when the barrier separating the potential wells is about to
vanish and the fluctuation of Brownian particle is maximized. These findings
indicate that the deviation of heat distribution from Gaussianity gives rise to
the inequality of the uncertainty relation, further clarifying the meaning of
the uncertainty relation. Our derivation of the uncertainty relation also
recognizes a new bound of nonequilibrium fluctuations that the variance of
dissipated heat ($\sigma_q^2$) increases with its mean ($\mu_q$) and cannot be
smaller than $2k_BT\mu_q$.

(PSSE) aims to obtain complete voltage magnitude and angle information at each
bus given a number of system variables at selected buses and lines. Power flow
analysis is a special case of PSSE, and amounts to solving a set of noise-free
power flow equations. Physical laws dictate quadratic relationships between
available quantities and unknown voltages, rendering general instances of power
flow and PSSE nonconvex and NP-hard. Past approaches are largely based on
gradient-type iterative procedures or semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Due to
nonconvexity, the solution obtained via gradient-type schemes depends on
initialization, while SDR methods do not perform as desired in challenging
scenarios. This paper puts forth novel \emph{feasible point pursuit}
(FPP)-based solvers for power flow and PSSE, which iteratively seek feasible
solutions for a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming
(QCQP) reformulation of the weighted least-squares (WLS) problem. Relative to
the prior art, the developed solvers offer superior performance at the cost of
higher complexity. Furthermore, they converge to a stationary point of the WLS
problem. As a baseline for comparing different estimators, the Cram{\' e}r-Rao
lower bound (CRLB) is derived for the fundamental PSSE problem in this paper.
Judicious numerical tests on several IEEE benchmark systems showcase markedly
improved performance of our FPP-based solvers for both power flow and PSSE
tasks over popular WLS-based Gauss-Newton iterations and SDR approaches.

wish to determine whether the network contains $H$ as a subgraph or not. The
\emph{property-testing} relaxation of the problem only requires us to
distinguish graphs that are $H$-free from graphs that are $\epsilon$-far from
$H$-free, meaning an $\epsilon$-fraction of their edges must be removed to
obtain an $H$-free graph. Recently, Censor-Hillel et. al. and Fraigniaud et al.
showed that in the property-testing regime it is possible to test $H$-freeness
for any graph $H$ of size 4 in constant time, $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rounds,
regardless of the network size. However, Fraigniaud et. al. also showed that
their techniques for graphs $H$ of size 4 cannot test $5$-cycle-freeness in
constant time.
  In this paper we revisit the subgraph-freeness problem and show that
$5$-cycle-freeness, and indeed $H$-freeness for many other graphs $H$
comprising more than 4 vertices, can be tested in constant time. We show that
$C_k$-freeness can be tested in $O(1/\epsilon)$ rounds for any cycle $C_k$,
improving on the running time of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ of the previous algorithms
for triangle-freeness and $C_4$-freeness. In the special case of triangles, we
show that triangle-freeness can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds independently of
$\epsilon$, when $\epsilon$ is not too small with respect to the number of
nodes and edges. We also show that $T$-freeness for any constant-size tree $T$
can be tested in $O(1)$ rounds, even without the property-testing relaxation.
Building on these results, we define a general class of graphs for which we can
test subgraph-freeness in $O(1/\epsilon)$ rounds. This class includes all
graphs over 5 vertices except the 5-clique, $K_5$. For cliques $K_s$ over $s
\geq 3$ nodes, we show that $K_s$-freeness can be tested in
$O(m^{1/2-1/(s-2)}/\epsilon^{1/2+1/(s-2)})$ rounds, where $m$ is the number of

general for many non-equilibrium systems. However, the striking and unexpected

distributed failures, which allows to simulate the routing scheme on the
original network, even in the presence of non-benign node failures (henceforth
called faults). This is attractive as the system specification and routing
policy can simply be preserved.
  We present a scheme for constructing such a reinforced network, given an
existing (synchronous) network and a routing scheme. We prove that this
algorithm comes with small constant overheads, and only requires a minimal
amount of additional node and edge resources. At the same time, it allows to
tolerate a large number of independent random (node) faults, asymptotically
almost surely. We complement our analytical results with simulations on
different real-world topologies.

have been rapidly gaining popularity in recent years, and are particularly
well-suited for simulating crack initiation and growth in complex fracture
networks. In the phase-field framework, the surface energy associated with
crack formation is calculated by evaluating a functional defined in terms of a
scalar order parameter and its gradients, which in turn describe the fractures
in a diffuse sense following a prescribed regularization length scale. Imposing
stationarity of the total energy leads to a coupled system of partial
differential equations, one enforcing stress equilibrium and another governing
phase-field evolution. The two equations are coupled through an energy
degradation function that models the loss of stiffness in the bulk material as
it undergoes damage. In the present work, we introduce a new parametric family
of degradation functions aimed at increasing the accuracy of phase-field models
in predicting critical loads associated with crack nucleation as well as the
propagation of existing fractures. An additional goal is the preservation of
linear elastic response in the bulk material prior to fracture. Through the
analysis of several numerical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed family of functions to the classical quadratic degradation function
that is used most often in the literature.

by supplementing a generalized covariant Galileon-like non-linear derivative
self-interacting term to the standard kinetic term should be ruled out from
inflationary models. This is due to the fact that it suffers from lack of an
oscillatory phase at the end of the inflationary regime which is typically
accompanied by the appearance of a negative squared propagation speed of the
scalar mode leading to instabilities of small-scale perturbations. In this
regard, the warm G-inflation scenario is proposed where for G-inflation to
survive, the Galileon scalar field is coupled to the radiation field through a
dissipation term which results in removing the reheating period due to the
characteristics of warm inflationary scenario. In so doing, a linear stability
analysis is first performed to obtain the appropriate slow-roll conditions in
such a proposal. Cosmological perturbations of the model are then investigated
by utilizing fluctuation-dissipation theorem and analytical expressions are
derived for observable quantities; the power spectrum, tilt spectral index and
tensor-to-scalar ratio in terms of $PSR$ parameters and Galileon flow
functions. Finally, the model is solved for chaotic self-interacting
potentials, particularly the renormalizable Higgs potential $\frac{\lambda}{4}
\phi^{4}$, and shown to be consistent with observations in the weak dissipation
$Q \ll 1+ 3\frac{\delta_{GX}}{\delta_{X}}$ and G-dominant
$3\frac{\delta_{GX}}{\delta_{X}}\gg 1$ regime despite its large self-coupling,
since the energy scale at the horizon crossing is depressed by the synergy of
Galileon and thermal effects.

Examples include recently discovered black phosphorus, ReS2 and ReSe2 from
transition metal dichalcogenides, TiS3 and ZrS3 from transition metal
trichalcogenides and most recently GaTe. The presence of structural anisotropy
impacts their physical properties and leads to direction dependent light-matter
interactions, dichroic optical responses, high mobility channels, and
anisotropic thermal conduction. Despite the numerous reports on the vapor phase
growth of isotropic TMDCs and post transition metal chalcogenides such as MoS2
and GaSe, the synthesis of pseudo-1D materials is particularly difficult due to
the anisotropy in interfacial energy, which stabilizes dendritic growth rather
than single crystalline growth with well-defined orientation. The growth of
monoclinic GaTe has been demonstrated on flexible mica substrates with superior
photodetecting performance. In this work, we demonstrate that pseudo-1D
monoclinic GaTe layers can be synthesized on a variety of other substrates
including GaAs (111), Si (111) and c-cut sapphire by physical vapor transport
techniques. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
measurements, together with angle resolved micro-PL and micro-Raman techniques,
provide for the very first time atomic scale resolution experiments on
pseudo-1D structures in monoclinic GaTe and anisotropic properties.
Interestingly, GaTe nanomaterials grown on sapphire exhibit highly efficient
and narrow localized emission peaks below the band gap energy, which are found
to be related to select types of line and point defects as evidenced by PL and
Raman mapping scans. It makes the samples grown on sapphire more prominent than
those grown on GaAs and Si, which demonstrate more regular properties.

as they remove the Heisenberg spin-rotational symmetry while also introducing a
long- range component to the interaction. We explain how the modes continue to
remain approximately dispersionless, while being lifted to finite energy as
well as being squeezed: they change their ellipticity described by the ratio of
the amplitudes of the canonically conjugate variables comprising them. This
phenomenon provides interesting connections between concepts such as constraint
counting and self-screening underpinning the field of frustrated magnetism. We
discuss variants of these phenomena for different interactions, lattices and

In particular, it eliminates the need for the very short timesteps imposed by a

applicability of the method for cases of non-uniform heating, in particular,
nanoflare trains (uniform in space but non-uniform in time) and spatially
localised impulsive heating, including at the loop apex and base of the
transition region. In all cases the overall behaviour of the coronal density
and temperature shows good agreement with a fully resolved one dimensional
model and is significantly better than the equivalent results from a 1D code
run without using the jump condition but with the same coarse grid. A detailed
assessment of the errors introduced by the jump condition is presented showing
that the causes of discrepancy with the fully resolved code are (i) the neglect
of the terms corresponding to the rate of change of total energy in the
unresolved atmsophere, (ii) mass motions at the base of the transition region
and (iii) for some cases with footpoint heating, an over-estimation of the
radiative losses in the transition region.

proof of Safarevich's conjecture that circumvents the analytic parts in
Buskin's approach, avoiding twistor spaces and non-algebraic K3 surfaces.

function approach. More precisely, we consider a Boltzmann model on the set of
finite planar triangulations, together with a percolation configuration (either
site-percolation or bond-percolation) on this triangulation. By enumerating
triangulations with boundaries according to both the boundary length and the
number of vertices/edges on the boundary, we are able to identify a phase
transition for the geometry of the origin cluster. For instance, we show that
the probability that a percolation interface has length n decays exponentially
with n except at a particular value p\_c of the percolation parameter p for
which the decay is polynomial (of order n --10/3). Moreover, the probability
that the origin cluster has size n decays exponentially if p < p c and
polynomially if p $\ge$ p\_c. The critical percolation value is p\_c = 1/2 for
site percolation, and p c = 2 $\sqrt$ 3--1 11 for bond percolation. These
values coincide with critical percolation thresholds for infinite
triangula-tions identified by Angel for site-percolation, and by Angel \&
Curien for bond-percolation, and we give an independent derivation of these
percolation thresholds. Lastly, we revisit the criticality conditions for
random Boltzmann maps, and argue that at p\_c , the percolation clusters
conditioned to have size n should converge toward the stable map of parameter 7
6 introduced by Le Gall \& Miermont. This enables us to derive heuristically
some new critical exponents.

new approach for studying, modeling and decomposing diffuse gamma-ray emission.
Like most previous analyses, the approach relies on predictions from cosmic-ray
propagation codes like GALPROP and DRAGON. However, in contrast to previous
approaches, we account for the fact that models are not perfect and allow for a
very large number ($\gtrsim10^5$) of nuisance parameters to parameterize these
imperfections. We combine methods of image reconstruction and adaptive
spatio-spectral template regression in one coherent hybrid approach. To this
end, we use penalized Poisson likelihood regression, with regularization
functions that are motivated by the maximum entropy method. We introduce
methods to efficiently handle the high dimensionality of the convex
optimization problem as well as the associated semi-sparse covariance matrix,
using the L-BFGS-B algorithm and Cholesky factorization. We test the method
both on synthetic data as well as on gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy,
$|\ell|<90^\circ$ and $|b|<20^\circ$, as observed by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. We finally define a simple reference model that removes most of the
residual emission from the inner Galaxy, based on conventional diffuse emission
components as well as components for the Fermi bubbles, the Fermi Galactic
center excess, and extended sources along the Galactic disk. Variants of this
reference model can serve as basis for future studies of diffuse emission in
and outside the Galactic disk.

($M_\star-\mu$), demonstrating that surface brightness effects do not
systematically bias our mass function measurement above 10$^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$.
The galaxy distribution in the $M-\mu$-plane appears well bounded, indicating
that no substantial population of massive but diffuse or highly compact
galaxies are systematically missed due to the GAMA selection criteria. The GSMF
is {fit with} a double Schechter function, with $\mathcal
M^\star=10^{10.78\pm0.01\pm0.20}M_\odot$,
$\phi^\star_1=(2.93\pm0.40)\times10^{-3}h_{70}^3$Mpc$^{-3}$,

previously estimated using the GAMA-I sample, although we find a higher value
of $\mathcal M^\star$. Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the
mass function to masses as low as $10^{7.5}$ $M_\odot$, and assess limits to
$10^{6.5}$ $M_\odot$. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS we are able
to comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as
$10^{6}$ $M_\odot$. Beyond the well known upturn seen in the GSMF at $10^{9.5}$
the distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from $10^9$ to
$10^{6.5}$. We calculate the stellar mass density parameter given our
best-estimate GSMF, finding $\Omega_\star= 1.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}\pm0.97

isotopic ratio has the potential to provide information about the initial
environment in which our Sun formed. Recent findings suggest that the Solar
System may have formed in a massive cluster since the presence of short-lived
radioisotopes in meteorites can only be explained by the influence of a
supernova. The aim of this project is to determine the 14N/15N ratio towards a
sample of cold, massive dense cores at the initial stages in their evolution.
We have observed the J=1-0 transitions of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C and H15NC
toward a sample of 22 cores in 4 Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs). IRDCs are
believed to be the precursors of high-mass stars and star clusters. Assuming
LTE and a temperature of 15K, the column densities of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C
and H15NC are calculated and their 14N/15N ratio is determined for each core.
The 14N/15N ratio measured in our sample of IRDC cores range between ~70 and
>763 in HCN and between ~161 and ~541 in HNC. They are consistent with the
terrestrial atmosphere (TA) and protosolar nebula (PSN) values, and with the
ratios measured in low-mass pre-stellar cores. However, the 14N/15N ratios
measured in cores C1, C3, F1, F2 and G2 do not agree with the results from
similar studies toward the same massive cores using nitrogen bearing molecules
with nitrile functional group (-CN) and nitrogen hydrides (-NH) although the
ratio spread covers a similar range. Amongst the 4 IRDCs we measured relatively
low 14N/15N ratios towards IRDC G which are comparable to those measured in
small cosmomaterials and protoplanetary disks. The low average gas density of
this cloud suggests that the gas density, rather than the gas temperature, may

ensemble in an elongated harmonic trap off a centered repulsive barrier,
thereby taking particle correlations into account. The loss of coherence as
well as the oscillation of the center of mass are studied and we analyze the
influence of both particle and spatial correlations. Two different mechanisms
of coherence losses in dependence of the aspect ratio are found. For small
aspect ratios, loss of coherence between the region close to the barrier and
outer regions occurs, due to spatial correlations, and for large aspect ratios,
incoherence between the two density fragments of the left and right side of the
barrier arises, due to particle correlations. Apart form the decay of the
center of mass motion induced by the reflection and transmission, further
effects due to the particle and spatial correlations are explored. For tight
transversal traps, the amplitude of the center of mass oscillation experiences
a weaker damping, which can be traced back to the population of a second
natural orbital, and for a weaker transversal confinement, we detect a strong
decay, due to the possibility of transferring energy to transversal excited
modes. These effects are enhanced if the aspect ratio is integer valued.

usually supposed that the He enhancement is caused by the rotational mixing,
and the mass increase is by a binary merger. Thus, we have investigated these
scenarios thoroughly. The obtained findings are that rotating single star
models do not satisfy all the observational constraints and that the
enhancement of envelope mass alone does not explain observations. Here, we
consider a slow merger scenario in which both the He abundance and the envelope
mass enhancements are expected to occur. We indeed show that most observational
constraints such as the red-to-blue evolution, lifetime, total mass, position
in the HR diagram at collapse, and the chemical anomalies are well reproduced
by the merger model of 14 and 9 M$_{\odot}$ stars. We also discuss the effects
of the added envelope spin in the merger scenarios.

Grassmann manifold $\mathbb{G}_r(\mathbb{R}^k)$ of linear subspaces of
dimension $r<k$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ which avoids the use of equivalence classes.
The set $\mathbb{G}_r(\mathbb{R}^k)$ is equipped with an atlas which provides
it with the structure of an analytic manifold modelled on
$\mathbb{R}^{(k-r)\times r}$. Then we define an atlas for the set
$\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{R}^{k \times r})$ of full rank matrices and prove that
the resulting manifold is an analytic principal bundle with base
$\mathbb{G}_r(\mathbb{R}^k)$ and typical fibre $\mathrm{GL}_r$, the general
linear group of invertible matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{k\times k}$. Finally, we
define an atlas for the set $\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{R}^{n \times m})$ of
non-full rank matrices and prove that the resulting manifold is an analytic
principal bundle with base $\mathbb{G}_r(\mathbb{R}^n) \times
\mathbb{G}_r(\mathbb{R}^m)$ and typical fibre $\mathrm{GL}_r$. The atlas of
$\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{R}^{n \times m})$ is indexed on the manifold itself,

neighbourhood being proved to possess the structure of a Lie group. Moreover,
the set $\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{R}^{n \times m})$ equipped with the topology
induced by the atlas is proven to be an embedded submanifold of the matrix
space $\mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ equipped with the subspace topology. The
proposed geometric description then results in a description of the matrix

$\mathcal{M}_r(\mathbb{R}^{n \times m})$, as an analytic manifold equipped with
a topology for which the matrix rank is a continuous map.

for experimental, theoretical, or simulation studies, jamming at zero
temperature has been explored in great detail. It is a widely discussed
question whether this athermal jamming transition is related to the glass
transition. Motivated by the exploration of the energy landscape that has been
successfully used to describe athermal jamming, we introduce a new method to
determine whether the configuration space of a soft sphere system can be
explored within a reasonable timescale or not, i.e., whether the system is
ergodic or effectively non-ergodic. While in case of athermal jamming for a
given random starting configuration only the local energy minimum is
determined, we allow the thermally excited crossing of energy barriers.
Interestingly, we observe that a transition exists where the system becomes
effectively non-ergodic if the density is increased. In the limit of small but
non-zero temperatures the density where the ergodicity breaking transition
occurs approaches a value that is independent of temperature and below the
transition density of athermal jamming. This confirms recent computer
simulation studies where athermal jamming occurs deep inside the glass phase.
In addition, with our method we determined the critical behavior of the
ergodicity breaking transition and show that it is in the universality class of
directed percolation. Therefore, our approach not only makes the transition
from an ergodic to an effectively non-ergodic systems easily accessible and
helps to reveal its universality class but also shows that it is fundamentally
different from athermal jamming.

based on the weak CSR expansion. Using this expansion, the transient can be
expressed by $\max\{T_1,T_2\}$, where $T_1$ is the weak CSR threshold and $T_2$
is the time after which the purely pseudoperiodic CSR terms start to dominate
in the expansion. Various bounds have been derived for $T_1$ and $T_2$,
naturally leading to the question which matrices, if any, attain these bounds.
  In the present paper we characterize the matrices attaining two particular
bounds on $T_1$, which are generalizations of the bounds of Wielandt and
Dulmage-Mendelsohn on the indices of non-weighted digraphs. This also leads to
a characterization of tightness for the same bounds on the transients of
critical rows and columns. The characterizations themselves are generalizations
of those for the non-weighted case.

revealed that there is a correlation between the starting time of the QNM and

orthogonal multiple access techniques fail to achieve the system capacity limit

prominent when fairness among the users is considered in the system. Current
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques introduce redundancy by
coding/spreading to facilitate the users' signals separation at the receiver,
which degrade the system spectral efficiency. Hence, in order to achieve higher
capacity, more efficient NOMA schemes need to be developed. In this paper, we
propose a NOMA scheme for uplink that removes the resource allocation
exclusivity and allows more than one user to share the same subcarrier without
any coding/spreading redundancy. Joint processing is implemented at the
receiver to detect the users' signals. However, to control the receiver
complexity, an upper limit on the number of users per subcarrier needs to be
imposed. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is
proposed for the new NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' sum-rate. The
link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed scheme achieves
bit error rate close to the single-user case. Numerical results show that the
proposed NOMA scheme can significantly improve the system performance in terms
of spectral efficiency and fairness comparing to OFDMA.

properties of sigma models is necessary to understand the underlying structures

N=(2,2) supersymmetry can be parametrized by chiral, twisted chiral and
semichiral superfields. In the research presented in this thesis, N=(4,4)
(twisted) supersymmetry is constructed for a semichiral sigma model. It is
found that the model can only have additional supersymmetry off-shell if the
target space has a dimension larger than four. For four-dimensional target
manifolds, supersymmetry can be introduced on-shell, leading to a hyperk\""ahler
manifold, or pseudo-supersymmetry can be imposed off-shell, implying a target
space which is neutral hyperk\""ahler.
  Different sigma models and corresponding geometries can be related to each
other by T-duality, obtained by gauging isometries of the Lagrangian. The
semichiral vector multiplet and the large vector multiplet are needed for
gauging isometries mixing semichiral superfields, and chiral and twisted chiral
superfields, respectively. We find transformations that close off-shell to a
N=(4,4) supersymmetry on the field strengths and gauge potentials of the
semichiral vector multiplet, and show that this is not possible for the large
vector multiplet.
  A sigma model parametrized by chiral and twisted chiral superfields can be
related to a semichiral sigma model by T-duality. The N=(4,4) supersymmetry
transformations of the former model are linear and close off-shell, whereas
those of the latter are non-linear and close only on-shell. We show that this
discrepancy can be understood from T-duality, and find the origin of the

mean-field level electrohydrodynamic equations with the Smoluchowski formalism
to characterize the interplay between the electrostatic barrier, the
electrophoretic drift, and the electro-osmotic liquid flow. In particular, we
find that due to distinct ion density regimes where the salt screening of the
drift and barrier effects occur, there exists a characteristic salt
concentration maximizing the probability of barrier-limited polymer capture
into the pore. We also show that in the barrier-dominated regime, the polymer
translocation time increases exponentially with the membrane charge and decays
exponentially fast with the pore radius and the salt concentration. These
results suggest that the alteration of these parameters in the barrier-driven
regime can be an efficient way to control the duration of the translocation
process and facilitate more accurate measurements of the ionic current signal
in the pore.

role in applied statistics ranges from scenarios in forecasting and time series
analysis, to image reconstruction, machine learning, and the degradation
modeling for reliability assessment. A general solution to the problem of
filtering and prediction entails some formidable mathematics. Efforts to
circumvent the mathematics has resulted in the need for introducing more
explicit descriptions of the underlying process. One such example, and a
noteworthy one, is the Kalman Filter Model, which is a special case of state
space models or what statisticians refer to as Dynamic Linear Models.
Implementing the Kalman Filter Model in the era of ""big and high velocity

certificates that can be verified locally by distributed algorithms. Given a
boolean predicate on network states, such schemes enable to check whether the
predicate is satisfied by the actual state of the network, by having nodes
interacting with their neighbors only. Proof-labeling schemes are typically
designed for enforcing fault-tolerance, by making sure that if the current
state of the network is illegal with respect to some given predicate, then at
least one node will detect it. Such a node can raise an alarm, or launch a
recovery procedure enabling the system to return to a legal state. In this
paper, we introduce error-sensitive proof-labeling schemes. These are
proof-labeling schemes which guarantee that the number of nodes detecting
illegal states is linearly proportional to the edit-distance between the
current state and the set of legal states. By using error-sensitive
proof-labeling schemes, states which are far from satisfying the predicate will
be detected by many nodes, enabling fast return to legality. We provide a
structural characterization of the set of boolean predicates on network states

acyclicity, and leader admit error-sensitive proof-labeling schemes, while

that up to 84% of them could be correctly fixed. This result suggests that
there is plenty of space for current automated program repair techniques to
improve. Furthermore, we summarized seven fault localization strategies and
seven patch generation strategies that were useful in localizing and fixing
these defects, and compared those strategies with current repair techniques.
The results indicate potential directions to improve automatic program repair
in the future research.

introducing the dynamic compositional neural networks over tree structure

global O(N) linear $\sigma$-model with N = 2,3, which have global strings and
monopoles as topological defects. In order to compute the CMB power spectra we
compute the unequal time correlators (UETCs) of the energy-momentum tensor,
showing that they fall off at high wave number faster than naive estimates
based on the geometry of the defects, indicating non-trivial
(anti-)correlations between the defects and the surrounding Goldstone boson
field. We obtain source functions for Einstein-Boltzmann solvers from the
UETCs, using a recent method that improves the modelling at the radiation-
matter transition. We show that the interpolation function that mimics the
transition is similar to other defect models, but not identical, confirming the
non-universality of the interpolation function. The CMB power spectra for
global strings and monopoles have the same overall shape as those obtained
using the non-linear $\sigma$-model approximation, which is well captured by a
large-N calculation. However, the amplitudes are larger than the large-N
calculation predict, and in the case of global strings much larger: a factor of
20 at the peak. Finally we compare the CMB power spectra with the latest CMB
data to put limits on the allowed contribution to the temperature power
spectrum at multipole $\ell$ = 10 of 1.7% for global strings and 2.4% for
global monopoles. These limits correspond to symmetry-breaking scales of
2.9x1015 GeV (6.3x1014 GeV with the expected logarithmic scaling of the
effective string tension between the simulation time and decoupling) and
6.4x1015 GeV respectively. The bound on global strings is a significant one for
the ultra-light axion scenario with axion masses ma 10-28 eV. These upper
limits indicate that gravitational wave from global topological defects will
not be observable at the GW observatory LISA.

renormalization-group (RG) approach by Wetterich. Our main finding is that the
nonzero misfit parameter of the model, which can be related with the linear
gradient term (Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction), makes such a transition
impossible, what contradicts the previous consideration of this problem by
non-perturbative RG methods. To support the conclusion the initial PT model is
reformulated in terms of the 2D theory of relativistic fermions using an
analogy between the 2D sine-Gordon and the massive Thirring models. In the new
formalism the misfit parameter corresponds to an effective gauge field that
enables to include it in the RG procedure on an equal footing with the other
parameters of the theory. The Wetterich equation is applied to obtain flow
equations for the parameters of the new fermionic action. We demonstrate that
these equations reproduce the KT type of behavior if the misfit parameter is
zero. However, any small nonzero value of the quantity rules out a possibility
of the KT transition. To confirm the finding we develop a description of the
problem in terms of the 2D Coulomb gas model. Within the approach the breakdown
of the KT scenario gains a transparent meaning, the misfit gives rise to an
effective in-plane electric field that prevents a formation of bound
vortex-antivortex pairs.

atmospheric escape. In agreement with the theory of atmospheric-loss processes,
it is likely that the outer planet has a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. The

infer the latent geometry from the mere topology of a complex network. The
human brain structural connectome represents the perfect benchmark to test
algorithms aimed to solve this problem. Coalescent embedding was recently
designed to map a complex network in the hyperbolic space, inferring the node
angular coordinates. Here we show that this methodology is able to
unsupervisedly reconstruct the latent geometry of the brain with an incredible
accuracy and that the intrinsic geometry of the brain networks strongly relates
to the lobes organization known in neuroanatomy. Furthermore, coalescent
embedding allowed the detection of geometrical pathological changes in the

function that is a real-valued polymatroid function subject to matroid
constraints. The greedy strategy provides an approximate solution to the
optimization problem, and it is known to satisfy some performance bounds in
terms of the total curvature. The total curvature depends on the value of
objective function on sets outside the constraint matroid. If we are given a
function defined only on the matroid, the problem still makes sense, but the
existing bounds involving the total curvature do not apply. This is puzzling:
If the optimization problem is perfectly well defined, why should the bounds no
longer apply? This motivates an alternative formulation of such bounding
techniques. The first question that comes to mind is whether it is possible to
extend a polymatroid function defined on a matroid to one on the entire power
set. This was recently shown to be negative in general. Here, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an \emph{incremental}
extension of a polymatroid function defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k$
to one defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k+1$, together with an algorithm
for constructing the extension. Whenever a polymatroid objective function
defined on a matroid can be extended to the entire power set, the greedy
approximation bounds involving the total curvature of the extension apply.
However, these bounds still depend on sets outside the constraint matroid.
Motivated by this, we define a new notion of curvature called \emph{partial
curvature}, involving only sets in the matroid. We derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for an extension of the function to have a total
curvature that is equal to the partial curvature. Moreover, we prove that the
bounds in terms of the partial curvature are in general improved over the
previous ones......

ignored in previous prediction to predict the high pressure stable structures
of LiHn (n = 2-11, 13) up to 200 GPa. We reproduce the previously predicted
structures, and further find novel compositions that adopt more stable
structures. The van der Waals functional (vdW-DF) significantly alters the
relative stability of lithium polyhydrides, and predicts that the stable
stoichiometries for the ground-state should be LiH2 and LiH9 at 130-170 GPa,
and LiH2, LiH8 and LiH10 at 180-200 GPa. Accurate electronic structure
calculation with GW approximation indicates that LiH, LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are
insulative up to at least 208 GPa, and all other lithium polyhydrides are
metallic. The calculated vibron frequencies of these insulating phases are also
in accordance with the experimental infrared (IR) data. This reconciliation
with the experimental observation suggests that LiH2, LiH7, and LiH9 are the
possible candidates for lithium polyhydrides synthesized in that experiment.
Our results reinstate the credibility of density functional theory in
description H-rich compounds, and demonstrate the importance of considering van
der Waals interaction in this class of materials.

signing behavior in order to identify systematic differences between popular
petitions, which receive a high volume of signatures, and unpopular ones. We
find that, in line with other temporal characterizations of human activity, the
signing process is typically non-Poissonian and non-homogeneous in time.
However, this process exhibits anomalously high memory for human activity,
possibly indicating that synchronized external influence or contagion play and
important role. More interestingly, we find clear differences in the
characteristics of the inter-event time distributions depending on the total
number of signatures that petitions receive, independently of the total
duration of the petitions. Specifically, popular petitions that attract a large
volume of signatures exhibit more variance in the distribution of inter-event
times than unpopular petitions with only a few signatures, which could be
considered an indication that the former are more bursty. However, petitions
with large signature volume are less bursty according to measures that consider
the time ordering of inter-event times. Our results, therefore, emphasize the
importance of accounting for time ordering to characterize human activity.

law density structure we compare synchrotron emission with radio observations.
Assuming that 20$\%$ of the bulk shock energy is being shared equally between
electrons and magnetic fields we found a very low density medium around both
the SNe. A less tenuous medium with particle density $\sim$ 1 $\rm cm^{-3}$,
which could be expected around both SNe, can be estimated when the magnetic
field amplification is less than that presumed for energy equipartition. This
conclusion also holds if the progenitor of SN 2014J was a rigidly rotating
white dwarf (WD) with a main sequence (MS) or red giant companion. For a He
star companion, or a MS for SN 2014J, with 10$\%$ and 1$\%$ of bulk kinetic
energy in magnetic fields, we obtain a mass loss rate $< 10^{-9}$ and $< \sim
4\times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for a wind velocity of 100 km/s. The
former requires a mass accretion efficiency $>$ 99$\%$ onto the WD, but is less
restricted for the latter case. However, if the tenuous medium is due to a
recurrent nova it is difficult from our model to predict synchrotron
luminosities. Although the formation channels of SNe 2011fe and 2014J are not

  1. Testing 2-monotonicity on the hypercube non-adaptively with one-sided
error requires an exponential in \sqrt n number of queries. This behavior shows
a stark contrast with testing (1-)monotonicity, which only needs O(\sqrt n)
queries (Khot et al. (FOCS 2015)). Furthermore, even the apparently easier task
of distinguishing 2-monotone functions from functions that are far from being
n^.01 -monotone also requires an exponential number of queries.
  2. On the hypercube [n]^d domain, there exists a testing algorithm that makes
a constant number of queries and distinguishes functions that are k-monotone
from functions that are far from being O(kd^2)-monotone. Such a dependency is
likely necessary, given the lower bound above for the hypercube.

Its efficiency and fairness properties make it particularly appealing as a rule
for fair allocation of resources among agents with possibly different
entitlements. However, when the resources are indivisible, a CE might not exist
even when there is one resource and two agents with equal incomes. Recently,
Babaioff and Nisan and Talgam-Cohen (2017) have suggested to consider the
entire space of possible incomes, and check whether there exists a competitive
equilibrium for almost all income-vectors --- all income-space except a subset
of measure zero. They proved various existence and non-existence results, but
left open the cases of four goods and three or four agents with
monotonically-increasing preferences.
  This paper proves non-existence in both these cases, thus completing the
characterization of CE existence for almost all incomes in the domain of
monotonically increasing preferences. Additionally, the paper provides a
complete characterization of CE existence in the domain of monotonically
decreasing preferences, corresponding to allocation of chores.
  On the positive side, the paper proves that CE exists for almost all incomes
when there are four goods and three agents with additive preferences. The proof
uses a new tool for describing a CE, as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a
specific sequential game. The same tool also enables substantially simpler
proofs to the cases already proved by Babaioff et al.
  Additionally, this paper proves several strong fairness properties that are
satisfied by any CE allocation, illustrating its usefulness for fair allocation
among agents with different entitlements.

promising technology that allows heavy vehicles to save fuel by driving with
small automatically controlled inter-vehicle distances. In order to leverage
the full potential of platooning, platoons can be formed dynamically en route
by small adjustments to their speeds. However, in heavily used parts of the
road network, travel times are subject to random disturbances originating from
traffic, weather and other sources. We formulate this problem as a stochastic
dynamic programming problem over a finite horizon, for which solutions can be
computed using a backwards recursion. By exploiting the characteristics of the

we fit synthetic galaxy spectra representing a wide range of galaxy star

previously inferred in a pilot study on this subject, our results show that the
neglect of a PL component in spectral fitting can lead to an overestimation by
$\sim$2 dex in stellar mass and by up to $\sim$1 and $\sim$4 dex in the light-

fully determined by the asymptotic tails of the two-body potential. As an
important application of our findings, we describe how to eliminate finite-size

observed to be a dimensionless parameter, $\gamma$, that describes the
influence of solvent-induced swelling in lowering the potential barriers

inclusion of polymer viscosity in the Thomas-Windle model; it thus represents a
variant of Fick's second law utilizing a concentration-dependent diffusivity

forward shock in the interstellar medium becomes radiative at a radius $\sim $
100 pc. The emission is primarily in the optical and UV, and the radiative
luminosity is about 50% of the total kinetic luminosity of the wind. In
contrast, the reverse shock in the wind is adiabatic so long as the terminal
outflow velocity of the wind $v_{\rm w} \sim 0.003c$. The shocked wind in these
models radiates in X-rays, but with a luminosity of only $\sim 10^{35}

wind becomes radiative, but it is no longer hot enough to produce X-rays.
Instead it emits in optical and UV, and the radiative luminosity is comparable
to 100% of the wind kinetic luminosity. We suggest that measuring the optical

a whole new realm of research exhibiting a number of important distinctions

continuum of free space modes which makes it feasible to control and manipulate
scattering properties of the photonic structure via topology. At the same time,
the direct connection of scattering and topological properties of the photonic
states allows their probing by spectroscopic means via Fano resonances. Here we
demonstrate that the radiative coupling of modes supported by an all-dielectric

to band inversion, correspondingly inducing a distinct switching of the quality
factors of the resonances associated with the bands. In addition, we develop a
technique to retrieve the topological properties of all-dielectric metasurfaces

enables retrieval of the effective photonic Hamiltonian, including the effects

orbital parameters from our PPI and noPPI models differ by up to $2\sigma$,
with our noPPI model being statistically consistent with previous results. In
addition, our new PPI model strongly favours the planets being in MMR while our
noPPI model strongly disfavours MMR. We conduct a stability analysis by drawing
samples from our PPI model's posterior distribution and simulating them for
$10^9$ years, finding that our best-fit values land firmly in a stable region
of parameter space.
  We explore a series of formation models that migrate the planets into their
observed MMR. We then use these models to directly fit to the observed RV data,
where each model is uniquely parameterized by only three constants describing
its migration history. Using a Bayesian framework we find that a number of
migration models fit the RV data surprisingly well, with some migration
parameters being ruled out.
  Our analysis shows that planet-planet interactions are important to take into

plausible model chosen by the adversary - who, on the other hand, wishes to
increase the expected loss. The regularization parameter turns out to be
precisely determined by the amount of perturbation on the training data allowed
by the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven (statistical)
criterion for the optimal choice of regularization, which we evaluate
asymptotically, in closed form, as the size of the training set increases. Our
easy-to-evaluate regularization formula is compared against cross-validation,
showing good (sometimes superior) performance.

recently localized in a star forming galaxy at $z=0.193$, which is associated
with an extended radio source at the burst location. One possibility is that
the repeating FRBs are produced by a new-born magnetar, which also powers the
radio nebula. If so, the magnetar may produce $\gamma$-ray emission due to
magnetic dipolar spin-down. The luminosity depends on the magnetar spin
parameters and age. We process the eight-year Fermi LAT data at the position of
FRB 121102 and place an energy flux upper limit of $\sim 10^{-11} \ {\rm erg \

upper limits are $\sim 10^{45} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$ and $\sim 4\times 10^{44}

nearest-neighbor dynamics and spherical models for Langevin dynamics. Finally,
in the case of Ising spins, Panchenko's recent rigorous calculation [79] of the
free energy for a system of ""two real replica"" enables us to prove a quenched
LDP for the overlap distribution, which gives us a wider criterion for slow
mixing directly related to the Franz-Parisi-Virasoro approach [43,60]. This

dwarfs. We explore for the first time their mid-IR spectral morphology in a
quantitative way. We use NLTE expanding atmosphere models to help with line
identifications, analyze profile contributions and line-formation regions. The
O supergiants present a rich emission line spectra. The most intense features
are from hydrogen - $6\alpha$, 7$\alpha$, and $8\alpha$ - which have
non-negligible contributions of HeI or HeII lines, depending on the spectral
type. The spectrum of early O supergiants is a composite of HI and HeII lines,
HeI lines being absent. On the other hand, late O supergiants present features
composed mainly by HI and HeI lines. All emission lines are formed throughout
the stellar wind. We found that O dwarfs exhibit a featureless mid-IR spectrum.
Two stars of our sample exhibit very similar mid-IR features, despite having a
very different optical spectral classification. The analysis of O-type stars
based on mid-IR spectra alone to infer spectral classes or to estimate physical
parameters may thus be prone to substantial errors. Our results may therefore
inform spectroscopic observations of massive stars located in heavily obscured

complexity to achieve that computational complexity is O(Kn + m). As such, both

this uncertainty is not sufficiently addressed, it will limit the further
penetration of renewables into the grid and even result in blackouts. Compared
to energy storage, Demand Response (DR) has advantages to provide reserves to
the load serving entities (LSEs) in a cost-effective and environmentally
friendly way. DR programs work by changing customers' loads when the power grid
experiences a contingency such as a mismatch between supply and demand.
Uncertainties from both the customer-side and LSE-side make designing
algorithms for DR a major challenge.
  This paper makes the following main contributions: (i) We propose DR control
policies based on the optimal structures of the offline solution. (ii) A

last 20 years due to the important role that geographical information can play
in predicting survival. This paper provides an introduction to a set of
programs for implementing some Bayesian spatial survival models in R using the
package spBayesSurv. The function survregbayes includes the three most
commonly-used semiparametric models: proportional hazards, proportional odds,
and accelerated failure time. All manner of censored survival times are
simultaneously accommodated including uncensored, interval censored,
current-status, left and right censored, and mixtures of these. Left-truncated
data are also accommodated. Time-dependent covariates are allowed under the
piecewise constant assumption. Both georeferenced and areally observed spatial
locations are handled via frailties. Model fit is assessed with conditional
Cox-Snell residual plots, and model choice is carried out via the log pseudo
marginal likelihood, the deviance information criterion and the Watanabe-Akaike
information criterion. The accelerated failure time frailty model with a
covariate-dependent baseline is included in the function frailtyGAFT. In
addition, the package also provides two marginal survival models: proportional
hazards and linear dependent Dirichlet process mixture, where the spatial
dependence is modeled via spatial copulas. Note that the package can also
handle non-spatial data using non-spatial versions of aforementioned models.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1611.08364",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important and
urgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace
in the near future. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for
analyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to
several small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability
to large scale systems is often intractable because of its
exponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,
also known as the ""curse of dimensionality"". To overcome this problem, the
sequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to
vehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be
done with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems. In
particular, we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two different
urban environments, a city environment and a multi-city environment, and use
the SPP algorithm for trajectory planning. SPP is able to efficiently design
collision-free trajectories in both environments despite the presence of
disturbances in vehicles' dynamics. To ensure a safe transition of vehicles to
their destinations, our method automatically allocates space-time reservations
to vehicles while accounting for the magnitude of disturbances such as wind in
a provably safe way. Our simulation results show an intuitive multi-lane
structure in airspace, where the number of lanes and the distance between the
lanes depend on the size of disturbances and other problem parameters.

algorithms for noise reduction and image segmentation processes for selecting

solves pixelwise the non-linear inverse problem of determining the kinetic

  Finally, we present the $\mathcal{V}$-fractional integral from which, as a
natural consequence, new results appear as applications. Specifically, we
generalize inverse property, the fundamental theorem of calculus, a theorem
associated with classical integration by parts, and the mean value theorem for
integrals. Also, we calculate the $\mathcal{V}$-fractional integral of the two
parameters Mittag-Leffler function. Further, through the truncated
$\mathcal{V}$-fractional derivative and the $\mathcal{V}$-fractional integral,
we obtain a relation with the fractional derivative and integral in the
Riemann-Liouville sense, in the case $0<\alpha<1$.

technology which enables human beings to interact with computers conveniently.
The human being wears an emitter on the finger or holds a digital pen that
generates a time harmonic point charge. The inputs/instructions are performed
through moving the finger or the digital pen. The computer recognizes the
instruction by determining the motion trajectory of the dynamic point charge
from the collected electromagnetic field measurement data. The identification
process is mathematically modelled as a dynamic inverse source problem for
time-dependent Maxwell's equations. From a practical point of view, the point
source should be assumed to move in an unknown inhomogeneous background medium,
which models the human body and the surroundings. Moreover, a salient feature
is that the electromagnetic radiated data are only collected in a limited
aperture. For the inverse problem, we develop, from the respectively
deterministic and stochastic viewpoints, a dynamic direct sampling method and a
modified particle filter method. Both approaches can effectively recover the
motion trajectory. Rigorous theoretical justifications are presented for the
mathematical modelling and the proposed recovery methods. Extensive numerical
experiments are conducted to illustrate the promising features of the two
proposed recognition approaches.

coatings, where the goal is to protect an underlying substrate from the onset
of corrosion caused by buildup of water or other aggressive species. Such
coatings are often exposed to cyclic moisture, either in laboratory testing or
in service due to natural environmental fluctuations. In this paper, we use
lattice Boltzmann numerical techniques to investigate the effects of reservoir
cycling on moisture propagation and concentration at the substrate where
corrosion onset occurs. We examine both the simple case of constant
diffusivity, representing idealized Fickian diffusion, and diffusivity that
depends on concentration via either a step or linear function, representing
polymer network swelling. The use of a coating subject to swelling is shown to
lead to highly variable equilibrium behavior. We show that the nature of the
functional diffusivity has large effects on water concentration at the
substrate, and has implications for material design and analysis to avoid
corrosion.

  memory effects and airway reopening",,,"10.1017/jfm.2017.828",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate both experimentally and theoretically the
dynamics of a liquid plug driven by a cyclic periodic forcing inside a
cylindrical rigid capillary tube. First, it is shown that depending on the type
of forcing (flow rate or pressure cycle), the dynamics of the liquid plug can
either be stable and periodic, or conversely accelerative and eventually
leading to the plug rupture. In the latter case, we identify the sources of the
instability as: (i) the cyclic diminution of the plug viscous resistance to
motion due to the decrease in the plug length and (ii) a cyclic reduction of
the plug interfacial resistance due to a lubrication effect. Since the flow is
quasi-static and the forcing periodic, this cyclic evolution of the resistances
relies on the existence of flow memories stored in the length of the plug and
the thickness of the trailing film. Second, we show that contrary to
unidirectional pressure forcing, cyclic forcing enables breaking of large plugs
in confined space though it requires longer times. All the experimentally
observed tendencies are quantitatively recovered from an analytical model. This
study not only reveals the underlying physics but also opens up the prospect
for the simulation of ""breathing"" of liquid plugs in complex geometries and the
determination of optimal cycles for obstructed airways reopening.

promising in the science, engineering, and military applications. Here we
present a compressed-sensing (CS) inspired large- aperture computational
single-sensor imager using 1-bit programmable coding metasurface for efficient
microwave imaging, which is an instance of the coded aperture imaging system.
However, unlike a conventional coded aperture imager where elements on random
mask are manipulated in the pixel-wised manner, the controllable elements in
the proposed scheme are encoded in a column-row-wised manner. As a consequence,
this single-sensor imager has a reduced data-acquisition time with improved
obtainable temporal and spatial resolutions. Besides, we demonstrate that the
proposed computational single-shot imager has a theoretical guarantee on the
successful recovery of a sparse or compressible object from its reduced
measurements by solving a sparsity-regularized convex optimization problem,
which is comparable to that by the conventional pixel-wise coded imaging
system. The excellent performance of the proposed imager is validated by both
numerical simulations and experiments for the high-resolution microwave
imaging.

  Video with Variable Background",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel approach to create an automated visual
surveillance system which is very efficient in detecting and tracking moving
objects in a video captured by moving camera without any apriori information
about the captured scene. Separating foreground from the background is
challenging job in videos captured by moving camera as both foreground and
background information change in every consecutive frames of the image
sequence; thus a pseudo-motion is perceptive in background. In the proposed
algorithm, the pseudo-motion in background is estimated and compensated using
phase correlation of consecutive frames based on the principle of Fourier shift
theorem. Then a method is proposed to model an acting background from recent
history of commonality of the current frame and the foreground is detected by
the differences between the background model and the current frame. Further
exploiting the recent history of dissimilarities of the current frame, actual
moving objects are detected in the foreground. Next, a two-stepped
morphological operation is proposed to refine the object region for an optimum
object size. Each object is attributed by its centroid, dimension and three
highest peaks of its gray value histogram. Finally, each object is tracked
using Kalman filter based on its attributes. The major advantage of this
algorithm over most of the existing object detection and tracking algorithms is
that, it does not require initialization of object position in the first frame
or training on sample data to perform. Performance of the algorithm is tested
on benchmark videos containing variable background and very satisfiable results
is achieved. The performance of the algorithm is also comparable with some of
the state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection and tracking.
