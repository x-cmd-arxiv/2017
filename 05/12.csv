  Approach",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the community detection problem in signed
networks, where there are two types of edges: positive edges (friends) and
negative edges (enemies). One renowned theorem of signed networks, known as
Harary's theorem, states that structurally balanced signed networks are
clusterable. By viewing each cycle in a signed network as a parity-check
constraint, we show that the community detection problem in a signed network
with two communities is equivalent to the decoding problem for a parity-check
code. We also show how one can use two renowned decoding algorithms in error-
correcting codes for community detection in signed networks: the bit-flipping
algorithm, and the belief propagation algorithm. In addition to these two
algorithms, we also propose a new community detection algorithm, called the
Hamming distance algorithm, that performs community detection by finding a
codeword that minimizes the Hamming distance. We compare the performance of
these three algorithms by conducting various experiments with known ground
truth. Our experimental results show that our Hamming distance algorithm
outperforms the other two.

improved accuracy compared to its predecessors, with two-month waveform
overlaps against a more accurate fiducial model exceeding 0.97 for a generic
range of sources; it also generates waveforms 5-15 times faster than the

issues in the upcoming round of mock LISA data challenges. A simple analytic
argument shows that it might even be viable for detecting EMRIs with LISA

scheme is not based upon the electrical circuits, hence the sensitivity of the
phase and the amplitude/strength of the MW field is not limited by the Nyquist
thermal noise. Further this system has great advantage due to its very high
bandwidth, ranging from radio frequency (RF), micro wave (MW) to terahertz

only sensitive to the field strength but not to the phase and hence this scheme
provides a great opportunity to characterize the MW completely including the
propagation direction and the wavefront. This study opens up a new dimension in
the Radar technology such as in synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The MW

precursors of young supernova remnants and be responsible for magnetic-field
amplification, plasma heating and turbulence. Earlier simulations demonstrated
magnetic-field amplification, and in kinetic studies a reduction of the
relative drift between cosmic rays and thermal plasma was observed as
backreaction. However, all published simulations used periodic boundary
conditions, which do not account for mass conservation in decelerating flows
and only allow the temporal development to be studied. Here we report results
of fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell simulations with open boundaries that permit
inflow of plasma on one side of the simulation box and outflow at the other
end, hence allowing an investigation of both the temporal and the spatial
development of the instability. Magnetic-field amplification proceeds as in
studies with periodic boundaries and, observed here for the first time, the
reduction of relative drifts causes the formation of a shock-like compression
structure at which a fraction of the plasma ions are reflected. Turbulent
electric field generated by the nonresonant instability inelastically scatters
cosmic rays, modifying and anisotropizing their energy distribution. Spatial CR
scattering is compatible with Bohm diffusion. Electromagnetic turbulence leads
to significant nonadiabatic heating of the background plasma maintaining bulk
equipartition between ions and electrons. The highest temperatures are reached
at sites of large-amplitude electrostatic fields. Ion spectra show
supra-thermal tails resulting from stochastic scattering in the turbulent
electric field. Together, these modifications in the plasma flow will affect
the properties of the shock and particle acceleration there.

long-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated
simulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion.
However, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the
outcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar
planetary systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of
initial parameters of planet formation via pebble accretion, and present the
first results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate the pebble accretion
model by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along
with the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and
planet migration in the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads
to a variety of planetary systems, but have difficulty in reproducing observed
properties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary mass, semimajor axis, and
eccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient type
I migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our
simulations also lead to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that
formation efficiencies of planets depend on the stellar metallicities, not only
for giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths (SEs). The
dependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead
to faster formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost
later via dynamical instability. Second, our results indicate that a wide range
of bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural consequence of dynamical
evolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations
suggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass
planets.

low-latency DNNs based on fixed-point, ternary, or even binary data precision.
While recent works in this area offer promising results, they often lead to
large accuracy drops when compared to the floating-point networks. We propose a
novel approach to map floating-point based DNNs to 8-bit dynamic fixed-point

simplifies both the buffer and adder design. In addition, we propose a hardware
accelerator design to achieve low-power, low-latency inference with
insignificant degradation in accuracy. Using our custom accelerator design with
the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that our method achieves
significant power and energy savings while increasing the classification

Assuming SUs operate in a time switching fashion, each time slot is partitioned
into three non-overlapping parts devoted for energy harvesting, spectrum
sensing and data transmission. The general problem of joint resource allocation
and structure optimization is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear
Programming task which is NP-hard and intractable. Thus, we propose to tackle
it by decomposing it into two subproblems. We first propose a sub-channel
allocation scheme to approximately satisfy SUs' rate requirements and remove
the integer constraints. For the second step, we prove that the general
optimization problem is reduced to a convex optimization task. Considering the
trade-off among fractions of each time slot, we focus on optimizing the time
slot structures of SUs that maximize the total throughput while guaranteeing
the rate requirements of both real-time and non-real-time SUs. Since the
reduced optimization problem does not have a simple closed-form solution, we
thus propose a near optimal closed-form solution by utilizing Lambert-W
function. We also exploit iterative gradient method based on Lagrangian dual
decomposition to achieve near optimal solutions. Simulation results are
presented to validate the optimality of the proposed schemes.

  A displayed category over a category C is equivalent to ""a category D and
functor F : D --> C"", but instead of having a single collection of ""objects of
D"" with a map to the objects of C, the objects are given as a family indexed by
objects of C, and similarly for the morphisms. This encapsulates a common way
of building categories in practice, by starting with an existing category and
adding extra data/properties to the objects and morphisms.
  The interest of this seemingly trivial reformulation is that various
properties of functors are more naturally defined as properties of the
corresponding displayed categories. Grothendieck fibrations, for example, when
defined as certain functors, use equality on objects in their definition. When
defined instead as certain displayed categories, no reference to equality on
objects is required. Moreover, almost all examples of fibrations in nature are,
in fact, categories whose standard construction can be seen as going via
displayed categories.
  We therefore propose displayed categories as a basis for the development of
fibrations in the type-theoretic setting, and similarly for various other
notions whose classical definitions involve equality on objects.
  Besides giving a conceptual clarification of such issues, displayed
categories also provide a powerful tool in computer formalisation, unifying and
abstracting common constructions and proof techniques of category theory, and
enabling modular reasoning about categories of multi-component structures. As
such, most of the material of this article has been formalised in Coq over the
UniMath library, with the aim of providing a practical library for use in

cuspidal data (in the sense of Lusztig). Each block admits a monadic
description in terms a certain differential graded algebra related to the
homology of Steinberg varieties, which resembles a ""triple affine"" Hecke
algebra. Our results generalize the work of Rider and Rider--Russell on
constructible complexes on the nilpotent cone, and the earlier work of the

However, the algebra controlling the entire derived category of $D$-modules
appears to be substantially more complicated than either of these special
cases, as evidenced by the non-splitting of the Mackey filtration on the monad
controlling each block.

with previous Fourier methods and show an increase in performance in terms of
Strehl ratio and a reduction in noise propagation for a 40x40 SPHERE-like
adaptive optics system. For closed loop operation with minimal iterations the
Gerchberg method provides an improvement in Strehl, from 95.4% to 96.9% in
K-band. This corresponds to ~40 nm improvement in rms, and avoids the high
spatial frequency errors present in other methods, providing an increase in
contrast towards the edge of the correctable band.

results with fully trained DCNNs as well.

we argue that the formalism of quantum theory can be derived from two related
intuitive principles: (i) inference is a physical process performed by physical
systems, observers, which are part of the experimental setup---this implies
non-commutativity and imaginary-time quantum mechanics; (ii) experiments must
be described from a first-person perspective---this leads to self-reference,
complementarity, and real-time quantum dynamics. This approach sheds new light
on the foundations of quantum theory and suggests fundamental equations in
physics are typically of second order due to the physical nature of the
observer. It also suggests some experimental conjectures: (i) the quantum of
action could be understood as the result of the additional energy required to
transition from unconscious to conscious perception; (ii) humans can observe a
single photon of visible light; (iii) self-aware systems and the neural
correlates of the self should be composed of two complementary sub-systems,
much like the DNA molecule is composed of two strands---this may help explain
the double-hemisphere architecture of the brain. Moreover, this approach may
help bridge the gap between science and human experience. We discuss the
potential implications of these ideas for the modern research programs on
consciousness and contemplative science. As side results: (i) we show that
message-passing algorithms and stochastic processes can be written in a
quantum-like manner; (ii) we provide evidence that non-stoquasticity, a quantum
computational resource, may be related to non-equilibrium phenomena.

pressing issues in the life sciences. It is of especially great importance for
many applications in neuroimaging and genomics, where datasets are typically
high-dimensional, which means that the number of explanatory variables exceeds
the sample size. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that can be
employed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great popularity as a tool
for testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a
statistical technique that is used to make sense of the cross-correlation of
two sets of measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain
imaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients), and sparse CCA
extends the classical method to high-dimensional settings. Here we propose a
way of applying the FDR concept to sparse CCA, and a method to control the FDR.
The proposed FDR correction directly influences the sparsity of the solution,
adapting it to the unknown true sparsity level. Theoretical derivation as well
as simulation studies show that our procedure indeed keeps the FDR of the
canonical vectors below a user-specified target level. We apply the proposed
method to an imaging genomics dataset from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental

dust-related photoluminescence process that is still poorly understood, in
these two clouds. The spatial distribution of the ERE relative to the direction
of the incident radiation and relative to other emission processes, whose
carriers and excitation requirements are known, provides important constraints
on the excitation of the ERE. In both nebulae, we find the ERE intensity to
peak spatially well before the more extended distribution of mid-infrared
emission in the unidentified infrared bands, supporting earlier findings that
point toward far-ultraviolet (11 eV < E$_\mathrm{{photon}}$ < 13.6 eV) photons
as the source of ERE excitation. The band-integrated absolute intensities of
the ERE in IC 59 and IC 63 measured relative to the number density of photons
available for ERE excitation are lower by about two orders of magnitude
compared to ERE intensities observed in the high-latitude diffuse interstellar
medium (ISM). This suggests that the lifetime of the ERE carriers is
significantly reduced in the more intense radiation field prevailing in IC 59

against photo-processing under interstellar conditions. A model involving
isolated molecules or molecular ions, capable of inverse internal conversion
and recurrent fluorescence, appears to provide the most likely explanation for

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with increasing AGN luminosity. This has often been

with increasing luminosity, the so-called receding torus models. Using a
complete flux-limited X-ray selected sample of 199 AGN, from the Bright
Ultra-hard XMM-Newton Survey, we determine the intrinsic fraction of optical
type-2 AGN at 0.05$\leq$z$\leq$1 as a function of rest-frame 2-10 keV X-ray
luminosity from 10$^{42}$ to 10$^{45}$ erg/s. We use the distributions of
covering factors of AGN tori derived from CLUMPY torus models. Since these
distributions combined over the total AGN population need to match the
intrinsic type-2 AGN fraction, we reveal a population of X-ray undetected
objects with high-covering factor tori, which are increasingly numerous at
higher AGN luminosities. When these ""missing"" objects are included, we find
that Compton-thick AGN account at most for 37$_{-10}^{+9}$% of the total
population. The intrinsic type-2 AGN fraction is 58$\pm$4% and has a weak,
non-significant (less than 2$\sigma$) luminosity dependence. This contradicts
the results generally reported by AGN surveys, and the expectations from
receding torus models. Our findings imply that the majority of luminous
rapidly-accreting supermassive black holes at z<1 reside in highly-obscured
nuclear environments but most of them are so deeply embedded that they have so
far escaped detection in X-rays in <10 keV wide-area surveys.

~95% in the warmest LIRGs. The [OI]63/[CII]158PDR ratio is tightly correlated
with the PDR gas kinetic temperature in sources where [OI]63 is not
optically-thick or self-absorbed. For each galaxy, we derive the average PDR
hydrogen density, $n_{\rm H}$, and intensity of the interstellar radiation
field, in units of G$_0$, and find G$_0$/$n_{\rm H}$ ratios ~0.1-50 cm$^3$,
with ULIRGs populating the upper end of the distribution. There is a relation

IR}^{\star}$, G$_0$/$n_{\rm H}$ remains constant, ~0.32 cm$^3$, and variations
in $\Sigma_{\rm IR}$ are driven by the number density of star-forming regions
within a galaxy, with no change in their PDR properties. Above $\Sigma_{\rm

signaling a departure from the typical PDR conditions found in normal
star-forming galaxies towards more intense/harder radiation fields and compact

properties such as concentration and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as
assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly bias on halo definition,
parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\Delta$. We summarize the
strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a
function of halo mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering
depends strongly on mass at all $\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions
($\Delta \sim 200\mathrm{m}-600\mathrm{m}$), concentration-dependent clustering
at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered through
interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can
be greatly reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\Delta \sim
20\mathrm{m}-40\mathrm{m}$ for haloes with $M_{200\mathrm{m}} \lesssim
10^{12}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Smaller $\Delta$ implies larger radii and
mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called backsplash
haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}
\gtrsim 10^{13}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\Delta
\gtrsim 600\mathrm{m}$, are necessary. Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are
significant for all halo definitions that we explore and exhibit a relatively
weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly
bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common
definitions. We identify no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations
of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates assembly bias based on one
halo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo
definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not
coincide with the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.

scalar fields. The proposal is guided by properties of extremal black holes in
${\cal N}=2$ supergravity, but can be understood more generally in terms of
forbidding towers of stable gravitationally bound states. It amounts to the
statement that there must exist a particle on which the gauge force acts more
strongly than gravity and the scalar forces combined. We also propose that the
scalar force itself should act on this particle stronger than gravity. This
implies that generically the mass of this particle decreases exponentially as a
function of the scalar field expectation value for super-Planckian variations,
which is behaviour predicted by the Refined Swampland Conjecture. In the
context of ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity the Weak Gravity Conjecture bound can be
tied to bounds on scalar field distances in field space. Guided by this, we
present a general proof that for any linear combination of moduli in any
Calabi-Yau compactification of string theory the proper field distance grows at
best logarithmically with the moduli values for super-Planckian distances.

correction terms that take into account cluster miscentering, non-weak shear,

function is obtained by minimizing the energy expectation value over a set of

results for the binding energy, charge radius, one- and two-body densities,

We find that the employed three-nucleon interaction becomes repulsive for
$A\geq16$. In $^{16}$O the inclusion of such a force provides a better
description of the properties of the nucleus. In $^{40}$Ca instead, the
repulsive behavior of the three-body interaction fails to reproduce
experimental data for the charge radius and the charge form factor. We find
that the high-momentum region of the momentum distributions, determined by the
short-range terms of nuclear correlations, exhibit a universal behavior

expressing the integer Fourier coefficients of modular forms as an infinite sum
of Bessel functions, also known as Rademacher formula. The generalization to
vector-valued modular forms is known as generalized Kloosterman sums. In the
paper arxiv:1404.0033, a remarkable connection between these arithmetic sums
and quantum black hole entropy was found. Nevertheless, the computation was
particular for one-eighth BPS black holes in $\mathcal{N}=8$ string theory,
which have a simple counting formula. Here, we review this construction and
extend it to the case of one-quarter BPS black holes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ string
theory, which are counted by (mock) Jacobi forms of arbitrary index. The main
result is an holographic derivation of the Kloosterman sums which includes the
intricate sum over phases and depends exactly on the spectral flow sectors and
the spectrum of polar states. On the microscopic side we derive an analytic
formula for the Kloosterman sums valid for any index, whereas from the
macroscopic side we reproduce the same formula from the M-theory path integral
on $\mathbb{Z}_c$ orbifolds of $AdS_2\times S^1$. A key aspect of the
derivation is the identification of the spectral flow sectors with the
contribution of M2 branes wrapping cycles on the compactification manifold.
After a careful treatment of the measure, the sum over orbifolds results in the
sum over Bessels, in perfect agreement with the Rademacher expansion at any
order in perturbation theory.

than 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution ($R \sim$\,115000) and
high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are derived by
a standard Local Thermodinamyc Equilibrium (LTE) analysis using measured
Equivalent Widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. We find that thick disk stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and
Eu and also show on average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y when compared to the
thin disk stars. We also discovered that the previously identified
high-$\alpha$ metal-rich population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd and Eu with
respect to the thin disk but presents Ba and Y abundances lower on average,
following the trend of thick disk stars towards higher metallities and further
supporting the different chemical composition of this population. The ratio of
heavy-s to light-s elements of thin disk stars presents the expected behaviour
(increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be explained by a major
contribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process production at disk
metallicities. However, the opposite trend found for thick disk stars suggests
that intermediate-mass AGB stars played an important role in the enrichment of
the gas from where these stars formed. Previous works in the literature also
point to a possible primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities
to explain this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements
in the thin disk at super solar metallicities which could be caused by the
contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. (short version)

efficient hardware for embedded computer vision. Hardware vision acceleration,
however, does not address the cost of capturing and processing the image data

(ISP) pipeline in computer vision to identify opportunities to reduce
computation and save energy. The key insight is that imaging pipelines should
be designed to be configurable: to switch between a traditional photography
mode and a low-power vision mode that produces lower-quality image data
suitable only for computer vision. We use eight computer vision algorithms and
a reversible pipeline simulation tool to study the imaging system's impact on
vision performance. For both CNN-based and classical vision algorithms, we
observe that only two ISP stages, demosaicing and gamma compression, are
critical for task performance. We propose a new image sensor design that can
compensate for skipping these stages. The sensor design features an adjustable
resolution and tunable analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our proposed
imaging system's vision mode disables the ISP entirely and configures the
sensor to produce subsampled, lower-precision image data. This vision mode can
save ~75% of the average energy of a baseline photography mode while having
only a small impact on vision task accuracy.

investigation. Extremal records summarize the limits of the space explored by a

underlying dynamics of the process. Existing analyses of prediction,
statistical properties, and ultimate limits of record progressions have focused
on particular domains. However, a broad perspective on how record progressions
vary across different spheres of activity needs further development. Here we
employ cross-cutting metrics to compare records across a variety of domains,
including sports, games, biological evolution, and technological development.
We find that these domains exhibit characteristic statistical signatures in
terms of rates of improvement, ""burstiness"" of record-breaking time series, and
the acceleration of the record breaking process. Specifically, sports and games
exhibit the slowest rate of improvement and a wide range of rates of
""burstiness."" Technology improves at a much faster rate and, unlike other
domains, tends to show acceleration in records. Many biological and
technological processes are characterized by constant rates of improvement,
showing less burstiness than sports and games. It is important to understand
how these statistical properties of record progression emerge from the
underlying dynamics. Towards this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of a
particular record-setting event: elite marathon running. In this domain, we
find that studying record-setting data alone can obscure many of the structural
properties of the underlying process. The marathon study also illustrates how
some of the standard statistical assumptions underlying record progression
models may be inappropriate or commonly violated in real-world datasets.

approach relies on the use of singular classical solutions to a certain

tree-level, and also at the next-to-leading order level in the small $\lambda

contribution to the exponent of the multi-particle rate in this large $\lambda

This calculation relies on the idea of Gorsky and Voloshin to use a thin wall
approximation for the singular solutions that resemble critical bubbles. This
approximation is justified in precisely the high-multiplicity $\sqrt{\lambda n}

size determination and assessment of the probability of success (POS) for a
future trial. The BEP takes into consideration the uncertainty around the
parameters assumed by a power analysis and is thus more robust compared to the
traditional power that assumes a single set of parameters. Current methods for
assessing BEP are often based in a parametric framework by imposing a model on
the pilot data to derive and sample from the posterior distributions of the
parameters. Implementation of the model-based approaches can be analytically
challenging and computationally costly especially for multivariate data sets;
it also runs the risk of generating misleading BEP if the model is
mis-specified. We propose an approach based on the Bayesian bootstrap technique
(BBS) to simulate future trials in the presence of individual-level pilot data,
based on which the empirical BEP can be calculated. The BBS approach is
model-free with no assumptions about the distribution of the prior data and
circumvents the analytical and computational complexity associated with
obtaining the posterior distribution of the parameters. Information from
multiple pilot studies is also straightforward to combine. We also propose the
double bootstrap (BS2), a frequentist counterpart to the BBS, that shares
similar properties and achieves the same goal as the BBS for BEP assessment.
Simulation studies and case studies are presented to demonstrate the
implementation of the BBS and BS2 techniques and to compare the BEP results
with model-based approaches.

Einstein equation is known to be strongly hyperbolic in harmonic gauge so we
study Lovelock theories in harmonic gauge. We show that the equation of motion

that, for weak fields, the equation of motion is always weakly hyperbolic in
any generalized harmonic gauge. For some Horndeski theories there exists a
generalized harmonic gauge for which the equation of motion is strongly
hyperbolic in a weak-field background. This includes ""k-essence"" like theories.
However, for more general Horndeski theories, there is no generalized harmonic
gauge for which the equation of motion is strongly hyperbolic in a generic

establish local well-posedness of the Einstein equation does not extend to
Lovelock or general Horndeski theories. This raises the possibility that these

transitions from one mechanically stable state to another. This work describes
coordinated experimental and computational studies of bubble rafts, which are
quasi-two dimensional systems of bubbles confined to the air-water interface.
We focus on small mechanically stable clusters of four, five, six, and seven
bubbles with two different sizes with diameter ratio $\sigma_L/\sigma_S = 1.4$.
Focusing on small bubble clusters, which can be viewed as subsystems of a
larger system, allows us to investigate the full ensemble of clusters that
form, measure the respective frequencies with which the clusters occur, and
determine the form of the bubble-bubble interactions. We emphasize several
important results. First, for clusters with N > 5 bubbles, we find using
discrete element simulations that short-range attractive interactions between
bubbles give rise to a larger ensemble of distinct mechanically stable clusters
compared to that generated by long-range attractive interactions. The
additional clusters in systems with short-range attractions possess larger gaps
between pairs of neighboring bubbles on the periphery of the clusters. The
ensemble of bubble clusters observed in experiments is similar to the ensemble
of clusters with long-range attractive interactions. We also compare the
frequency with which each cluster occurs in simulations and experiments. We
find that the cluster frequencies are extremely sensitive to the protocol used
to generate them and only weakly correlated to the energy of the clusters.

both service interruptions and resource waste can be reduced with the
implementation of an effective forecasting system. Significant research has
thus been devoted to the design and development of methodologies for short term
load forecasting over the past decades. A class of mathematical models, called
Recurrent Neural Networks, are nowadays gaining renewed interest among
researchers and they are replacing many practical implementation of the
forecasting systems, previously based on static methods. Despite the undeniable
expressive power of these architectures, their recurrent nature complicates
their understanding and poses challenges in the training procedures. Recently,
new important families of recurrent architectures have emerged and their
applicability in the context of load forecasting has not been investigated
completely yet. In this paper we perform a comparative study on the problem of
Short-Term Load Forecast, by using different classes of state-of-the-art
Recurrent Neural Networks. We test the reviewed models first on controlled
synthetic tasks and then on different real datasets, covering important
practical cases of study. We provide a general overview of the most important
architectures and we define guidelines for configuring the recurrent networks
to predict real-valued time series.

structured data in the RDF format on the Web. In contrast to structured data
published in relational databases where a key is often provided explicitly,
finding a set of properties that allows identifying a resource uniquely is a
non-trivial task. Still, finding keys is of central importance for manifold
applications such as resource deduplication, link discovery, logical data
compression and data integration. In this paper, we address this research gap
by specifying a refinement operator, dubbed ROCKER, which we prove to be
finite, proper and non-redundant. We combine the theoretical characteristics of
this operator with two monotonicities of keys to obtain a time-efficient
approach for detecting keys, i.e., sets of properties that describe resources
uniquely. We then utilize a hash index to compute the discriminability score
efficiently. Therewith, we ensure that our approach can scale to very large
knowledge bases. Results show that ROCKER yields more accurate results, has a
comparable runtime, and consumes less memory w.r.t. existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

that the majority of maser sources belonging to the Local arm, together with
the Sun, evolve inside the corotation resonance, never crossing the main spiral

the spline degree $p$. In the present work, we discuss how a similar approach
can applied to the considered nonsymmetric linear systems. The efficiency of
the proposed preconditioning strategy is assessed with numerical experiments on

mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems that outsource sensory data collection to
the public crowd. In order to identify truthful values from (crowd) workers'
noisy or even conflicting sensory data, truth discovery algorithms, which
jointly estimate workers' data quality and the underlying truths through
quality-aware data aggregation, have drawn significant attention. However, the
power of these algorithms could not be fully unleashed in MCS systems, unless
workers' strategic reduction of their sensing effort is properly tackled. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a payment mechanism, named
Theseus, that deals with workers' such strategic behavior, and incentivizes
high-effort sensing from workers. We ensure that, at the Bayesian Nash
Equilibrium of the non-cooperative game induced by Theseus, all participating
workers will spend their maximum possible effort on sensing, which improves
their data quality. As a result, the aggregated results calculated subsequently
by truth discovery algorithms based on workers' data will be highly accurate.
Additionally, Theseus bears other desirable properties, including individual
rationality and budget feasibility. We validate the desirable properties of
Theseus through theoretical analysis, as well as extensive simulations.

be driven by surveys of large-scale structure. Its inherent non-linearity
suggests that significant information will be embedded in higher correlations
beyond the two-point function. Extracting this information is extremely
challenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant
computational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing
correlations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether
it is possible to reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of
information by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of
Fourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on $\Lambda$CDM
parameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum
decomposition, (b) the line correlation function and (c) the integrated
bispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on $\Lambda$CDM parameters
using these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those
obtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple
estimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise. Our results
demonstrate that the modal bispectrum performs as well as the Fourier
bispectrum, even with considerably fewer modes than Fourier configurations. The
line correlation function has good performance but does not match the modal
bispectrum. The integrated bispectrum is comparatively insensitive to changes
in the background cosmology. We find that adding bispectrum data can improve
constraints on bias parameters and the normalization $\sigma_8$ by up to 5
compared to power spectrum measurements alone. For other parameters,
improvements of up to $\sim$ 20% are possible. Finally, we use a range of
theoretical models to explore how the sophistication required for realistic
predictions varies with each proxy. (abridged)

the scattering rates for both hot carriers and phonons currently requires
multiple measurements with incommensurate timescales. Here, transient
extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy on the silicon 2p core level at 100 eV
is used to measure hot carrier and phonon thermalization in Si(100) from tens
of femtoseconds to 200 ps following photoexcitation of the indirect transition
to the {\Delta} valley at 800 nm. The ground state XUV spectrum is first
theoretically predicted using a combination of a single plasmon pole model and
the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) with density functional theory (DFT). The
excited state spectrum is predicted by incorporating the electronic effects of
photo-induced state-filling, broadening, and band-gap renormalization into the
ground state XUV spectrum. A time-dependent lattice deformation and expansion
is also required to describe the excited state spectrum. The kinetics of these
structural components match the kinetics of phonons excited from the
electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering processes following
photoexcitation. Separating the contributions of electronic and structural
effects on the transient XUV spectra allows the carrier population, the
population of phonons involved in inter- and intra-valley electron-phonon
scattering, and the population of phonons involved in phonon-phonon scattering
to be quantified as a function of delay time.

minimizing the sum of a smooth strongly convex function and a non-smooth convex
function whose proximal operator is available.
  We establish the exact worst-case convergence rates of the proximal gradient
method in this setting for any step size and for different standard performance
measures: objective function accuracy, distance to optimality and residual
gradient norm.
  The proof methodology relies on recent developments in performance estimation
of first-order methods based on semidefinite programming. In the case of the
proximal gradient method, this methodology allows obtaining exact and
non-asymptotic worst-case guarantees that are conceptually very simple,
although apparently new.
  On the way, we discuss how strong convexity can be replaced by weaker
assumptions, while preserving the corresponding convergence rates. We also
establish that the same fixed step size policy is optimal for all three
performance measures. Finally, we extend recent results on the worst-case
behavior of gradient descent with exact line search to the proximal case.

integrity is presented. The wheel can be seen as an organic extension to the
central unit (eg the vehicle) it is attached to, that is, the system and the
wheel can be completely surrounded by the same tegument while enabling
continuous wheel rotation without tearing the tegument. Furthermore, a skeleton
linking the central unit of the system to the wheel's center can be made
through the use of joints and linear links, while allowing the apparatus to
rotate continuously in the same direction with bounded twisting and no tegument
tear. For that reason, artificial muscles can also be used to actuate the
entire system. The underlying enabling mechanism is the rectification of a
small number of oscillatory inputs. Another contribution of the proposed setup
is to offer a plausible, yet untested, evolutionary path from today's living
animals towards animals capable of wheeled locomotion.

coordinate charts, it is common in engineering applications to adopt the unit
quaternion representation, and the numerical simulations typically impose the
unit length condition using constraints or by normalization at each step. From
the perspective of geometric structure-preserving, such approaches are
undesirable as they are either computationally less efficient, or interfere
with the preservation of other geometric properties of the dynamics.
  In this paper, we adopt the approach used in constructing Lie group
variational integrators for rigid body dynamics on the rotation group to the
representation in terms of unit quaternions. In particular, the rigid body
dynamics is lifted to unit quaternions, and the Lie group structure of unit
quaternions is used to represent tangent vector intrinsically, thereby avoiding
the use of a Lagrange multiplier. A Lie group variational integrator in the
unit quaternion representation is derived, and numerical results are presented.

simulation, we demonstrated that the local stress generated by these defects
produces equilibrium nano-size martensitic embryos (MEs) in pre-transitional
state, these embryos being orientation variants of martensite. This is a new
type of equilibrium: the thermoelastic equilibrium between the MEs and parent
phase in which the total volume of MEs and their size are equilibrium internal
thermodynamic parameters. This thermoelastic equilibrium exists only in
presence of the stress-generating defects. Cooling the pre-transitional state
towards Ms or applying the external stimuli, stress or magnetic field, results
in a shift of the thermoelastic equilibrium provided by a reversible
anhysteretic growth of MEs that results in a giant ME-generated macroscopic
strain. In particular, this effect can be associated with the diffuse phase
transformations observed in some ferroelectrics above the Curie point. It is
shown that the ME-generated strain is giant and describes a superelasticity if
the applied field is stress. It describes a super magnetostriction if the
martensite (or austenite) are ferromagnetic and the applied field is a magnetic
field. In general, the material with defects can be a multiferroic with a giant
multiferroic response if the parent and martensitic phase have different
ferroic properties. Finally the ME-generated strain may explain or, at least,
contribute to the Invar and Elinvar effects that are typically observed in
pre-transitional austenite. The thermoelastic equilibrium and all these effects
exist only if the interaction between the defects and MEs is infinite-range.

driven by the Z-machine using 27 MA of electrical current in 100 ns. Since the
implosion time is long compared to the heat diffusion time of a non-magnetized
plasma, MagLIF requires an initial axial magnetic of 30T to reduce heat losses
to the liner wall. Since the field needs to penetrate the transmission lines of
the pulsed-power generator, as well as the liner itself, the rise time must
exceed tens of microseconds. Any coil capable of producing such field on that
long a pulse-length is inevitably bulky. The space required to house the coil
near the liner increase the inductance of the load, which becomes problematic
since the voltage at the load cannot exceed what the driver can already

surrounding the liner. However, the field penetration is limited by the skin
effect of the liner wall. This paper shows that when current densities are
large enough, the material generate resistivity gradients which forces the
current to diffusive across the liner wall much fast than the skin time. As a
result, the 30T coil can be eliminated and replaced by return current posts
with minimal helicity.

various particle physics models have been proposed to explain the neutrino
spectrum by dark matter particles decaying into neutrinos and other Standard
Model particles.In such scenarios, simultaneous $\gamma$-ray emission is
commonly expected. Therefore, multi-messenger connections are generally
important for the indirect searches of dark matters. The recent development of
$\gamma$-ray astronomy puts stringent constraints on the properties of dark
matter, especially by observations with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray satellite in the
last several years. Motivated by the lack of $\gamma$-ray as well as the shape
of the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, we discuss a scenario in which
the DM is a PeV scale particle which couples strongly to other invisible
particles and its decay products do not contain a charged particle. As an
example to realize such possibilities, we consider a model of fermionic dark
matter that decays into a neutrino and many invisible fermions. The dark matter
decay is secluded in the sense that the emitted products are mostly neutrinos
and dark fermions. One remarkable feature of this model is the resulting
broadband neutrino spectra around the energy scale of the dark matter. We apply
this model to multi-PeV dark matter, and discuss possible observable
consequences in light of the IceCube data. In particular, this model could
account for the large flux at medium energies of $\sim10-100$ TeV, possibly as
well as the second peak at PeV, without violating the stringent $\gamma$-ray
constraints from Fermi and air-shower experiments such as CASA-MIA.

Navier-Stokes equations can be quantified using a so-called `energy measure':
the weak-$*$ limit of the measures $|u(t)|^2\,\mbox{d}x$ as $t$ approaches the
first possible blowup time. We show that membership of $u$ in certain (weak or
strong) $L^q L^p$ classes gives a uniform lower bound on the lower local
dimension of $\mathcal{E}$; more precisely, it implies uniform boundedness of a
certain upper $s$-density of $\mathcal{E}$. We also define and give lower
bounds on the `concentration dimension' associated to $\mathcal{E}$, which is
the Hausdorff dimension of the smallest set on which energy can concentrate.
Both the lower local dimension and the concentration dimension of $\mathcal{E}$
measure the departure from energy equality. As an application of our estimates,
we prove that any solution to the $3$-dimensional Navier-Stokes Equations which
is Type-I in time must satisfy the energy equality at the first blowup time.

investigate jointness in the case of various kinds of Laver diamonds. In the

joint families of Laver diamonds of a given length get strictly stronger with
increasing length, they are all equiconsistent. This is contrasted with the
case of partially strong cardinals, where we can derive additional consistency
strength, and ordinary diamond sequences, where large joint families exist
whenever even one diamond sequence does. Grounded forcing axioms modify the
usual forcing axioms by restricting the posets considered to a suitable ground

holds for posets coming from some ccc ground model. I examine the new axiom's
effects on the cardinal characteristics of the continuum and show that it is
quite a bit more robust under mild forcing than Martin's axiom itself.

addressed through signed digraphs subject to switching topologies. Further, a
state transition matrix-based approach is developed for the analysis of opinion

separation of cooperations and antagonisms, a relationship can be bridged

This helps to solve convergence problems for opinion dynamics. In particular,
bipartite consensus (or stability) emerges if and only if the associated

a general and fast framework of statistical inference for ODE based models by
relaxation of the underlying ODE system. Relaxation is achieved by a properly

additive Gaussian noises with small variances. Consequently, filtering methods
can be applied to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters in the

threshold, on fluctuation measures are discussed. A strong dependence of $D$
with the $\Delta\eta$ in HIJING and UrQMD models is observed as opposed to
results obtained from the HRG model. The dissipation of fluctuation signal is
estimated by fitting the $D$-measure as a function of the $\Delta\eta$. An
extrapolated function for higher $\Delta\eta$ values at lower \sqsn is
different from the results obtained from models. Particle species dependence of
$D$ and the effect of the $p_T^{min}$ selection threshold are discussed in
HIJING and HRG models. The comparison of $D$, at midrapidity, of net-charge
fluctuations at various \sqsn obtained from the models with the data from the
ALICE experiment is discussed. The results from the present work as a function
of $\Delta\eta$ and \sqsn will provide a baseline for comparison to

  Constraint","5 pages, to be published in Proc. IEEE ISIT 2017, Aachen, Germany",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analog beamforming with phased arrays is a promising technique for 5G
wireless communication in millimeter wave bands. A beam focuses on a small
range of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase
shifts across frequency due to practical hardware constraints. In switched
beamforming, a discrete codebook consisting of multiple beams is used to cover
a larger angle range. However, for sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain
provided by the phased array is frequency dependent even if the radiation
pattern of the antenna elements is frequency independent, an effect called beam
squint. This paper shows that the beam squint reduces channel capacity of a
uniform linear array (ULA). The beamforming codebook is designed to compensate
for the beam squint by imposing a channel capacity constraint. For example, our
codebook design algorithm can improve the channel capacity by 17.8% for a ULA
with 64 antennas operating at bandwidth of 2.5 GHz and carrier frequency of 73
GHz. Analysis and numerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required
to compensate for the beam squint compared to the case without beam squint.
Furthermore, the effect of beam squint is shown to increase as bandwidth
increases, and the beam squint limits the bandwidth given the number of
antennas in the array.

the upcoming high quality radio data expected from radio surveys like SKA with
its higher sensitivity, high spatial and spectral resolutions, we review our

impact that SKA can have in revolutionizing our understanding of AGN feedback

its possible contribution to excess entropy in the hot atmospheres of groups

be expected from SKA observations. In the context of cluster cosmology, for
example, we point out the importance of SKA observations for cluster mass
calibration by noting that most of $z>1$ clusters discovered by eROSITA X-ray

is an important noise source when characterising extra-solar planets. Current
1D models of faculae do not capture the geometric properties and fail to
reproduce observed solar facular contrasts. Magnetoconvection simulations
provide facular contrasts accounting for geometry. Aims. We calculate facular
contrast spectra from magnetoconvection models of the solar photosphere with a
view to improve (a) future parameter determinations for planets with early G
type host stars and (b) reconstructions of solar spectral variability. Methods.
Regions of a solar twin (G2, log g=4.44) atmosphere with a range of initial
average vertical magnetic fields (100 to 500~G) were simulated using a 3D
radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, MURaM, and synthetic intensity spectra
were calculated from the ultraviolet (149.5~nm) to the far infrared (160000~nm)
with the ATLAS9 radiative transfer code. Nine viewing angles were investigated
to account for facular positions across most of the stellar disc. Results.
Contrasts of the radiation from simulation boxes with different levels of
magnetic flux relative to an atmosphere with no magnetic field are a
complicated function of position, wavelength and magnetic field strength that
is not reproduced by 1D facular models. Generally, contrasts increase towards
the limb, but at UV wavelengths a saturation and decrease are observed close to
the limb. Contrasts also increase strongly from the visible to the UV; there is
a rich spectral dependence, with marked peaks in molecular bands and strong
spectral lines. At disc centre, a complex relationship with magnetic field was
found and areas of strong magnetic field can appear either dark or bright,
depending on wavelength...

the electric field can be arbitrary large. We establish both the pointwise

blow-up rates of electric field for conductors with arbitrary shape and in all

the mass-transfer rate between a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) and its

the surface of the CE by a CE wind (CEW). Because of the low CE density, the
binary system will avoid a fast spiral-in phase and finally re-emerge from the
CE phase. Our model may share the virtues of the OTW model but avoid some of
its shortcomings. We performed binary stellar evolution calculations for more
than 1100 close WD + MS binaries. Compared with the OTW model, the parameter
space for SNe Ia from our CEW model extends to more massive companions and less
massive WDs. Correspondingly, the Galactic birth rate from the CEW model is
higher than that from the OTW model by $\sim$30\%. Finally, we discuss the

solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter,
which we call the shear interaction parameter $\chi$. The fluid satisfies a
no-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow 0$, which occurs
when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a
free-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow \infty$, which

findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid
dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical
solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction

  Results: The PL relation for the T2Cs does not appear to depend on
metallicity, and, excluding the dusty RV Tau stars, is $M_{\rm bol}= +0.12
-1.78 \log P$ (for $P < 50$ days). Relations for fundamental and first overtone
LMC ACs are also presented. The PR relation for T2C also shows little or no
dependence on metallicity or period. Our preferred relation combines SMC and
LMC stars and all T2C subclasses, and is $\log R = 0.846 + 0.521 \log P$.
Relations for fundamental and first overtone LMC ACs are also presented. The
pulsation masses from the RR Lyrae and classical Cepheid pulsation models agree
well for the short period T2Cs, the BL Her subtype, and ACs, and are consistent
with estimates in the literature, i.e. $M_{\rm BLH} \sim 0.49$ \msol\ and
$M_{\rm AC} ~\sim 1.3$ \msol, respectively. The masses of the W Vir appear
similar to the BL Her. The situation for the pWVir and RV Tau stars is less

the cost of transport of image intensities and the variation of image

discretization for the geodesic interpolation was proposed by Berkels et al. In
this paper, this time discrete model is expanded and an image extrapolation via
a discrete exponential map is consistently derived for the variational time

image variation, the exponential map allows to compute a discrete geodesic
extrapolation path in the space of images. It is shown that a time step of this
shooting method can be formulated in the associated deformations only. For
sufficiently small time steps local existence and uniqueness are proved using a
suitable fixed point formulation and the implicit function theorem. A spatial
Galerkin discretization with cubic splines on coarse meshes for the deformation

are used to derive a fully practical algorithm. Different applications

to be a finitary analogue of the well-studied downward L\""owenheim-Skolem
property from classical model theory. We call this property as the
*$\mathcal{L}$-equivalent bounded substructure property*, denoted
$\mathcal{L}$-$\mathsf{EBSP}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is either FO or MSO.
Intuitively $\mathcal{L}$-$\mathsf{EBSP}$ states that a large finite structure
contains a small ""logically similar"" substructure, where logical similarity
means indistinguishability with respect to sentences of $\mathcal{L}$ having a
given quantifier nesting depth. It turns out that this simply stated property
is enjoyed by a variety of classes of interest in computer science: examples
include various classes of posets, such as regular languages of words, trees
(unordered, ordered or ranked) and nested words, and various classes of graphs,
such as cographs, graph classes of bounded tree-depth, those of bounded
shrub-depth and $n$-partite cographs. Further, $\mathcal{L}$-$\mathsf{EBSP}$
remains preserved in the classes generated from the above by operations that
are implementable using quantifier-free translation schemes. We show that for
natural tree representations for structures that all the aforementioned classes
admit, the small and logically similar substructure of a large structure can be
computed in time linear in the size of the representation, giving linear time
fixed parameter tractable (f.p.t.) algorithms for checking $\mathcal{L}$
definable properties of the large structure. We conclude by presenting a
strengthening of $\mathcal{L}$-$\mathsf{EBSP}$, that asserts ""logical
self-similarity at all scales"" for a suitable notion of scale. We call this the
*logical fractal* property and show that most of the classes mentioned above
are indeed, logical fractals.

detail how heterogeneity in susceptibilities and propensities to pass on the
disease affects these quasi-cycles. While the system can only be described by a
large hierarchical set of equations in the transient regime, we derive a
reduced closed set of equations for population-level quantities in the
stationary regime. We analytically obtain the spectra of quasi-cycles in the
linear-noise approximation. We find that the characteristic frequency of these

lower luminosity LERGs are indistinguishable from that of a matched control

multiple access technique that enables near optimum multiuser detection. In
MC-LDSMA, each user's symbol spread on a small set of subcarriers, and each
subcarrier is shared by multiple users. The unique structure of MC-LDSMA makes
the radio resource allocation more challenging comparing to some well-known
multiple access techniques. In this paper, we study the radio resource
allocation for single-cell MC-LDSMA system. Firstly, we consider the
single-user case, and derive the optimal power allocation and subcarriers
partitioning schemes. Then, by capitalizing on the optimal power allocation of
the Gaussian multiple access channel, we provide an optimal solution for
MC-LDSMA that maximizes the users' weighted sum-rate under relaxed constraints.
Due to the prohibitive complexity of the optimal solution, suboptimal
algorithms are proposed based on the guidelines inferred by the optimal
solution. The performance of the proposed algorithms and the effect of
subcarrier loading and spreading are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations.
Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform
conventional static resource allocation, and MC-LDSMA can improve the system
performance in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness in comparison with

simulations of extragalactic jets of pure leptonic and baryonic plasma
compositions propagating into a hydrostatic intracluster medium environment.
The numerical simulations use a general equation of state for a multi-component
relativistic gas which closely reproduces the Synge equation of state for a
relativistic perfect gas. We find that morphological and dynamical differences
between leptonic and baryonic jets are much less evident than those between hot
and cold jets. In all these models, the jets first propagate with essentially
constant velocities within the core radius of the intracluster medium and then
accelerate progressively so as to increase the jet advance velocity by a factor
of between 1.2 and 1.6 at the end of simulations, depending upon the models.
The temporal evolution of the average cavity pressure is not consistent with
that expected by the extended theoretical model even if the average cavity
pressure decreases as a function of time with a power-law. Our simulations
produce synthetic radio images that are dominated by bright hot spots and
appear similar to observations of the extended radio galaxies with collimated
radio jets. These bright radio lobes would be visible as dark regions in X-ray
images and are morphologically similar to observed X-ray cavities in the
intracluster medium. This supports the expectation that the bow shock
surrounding the head of the jet is important mechanism for producing X-ray
cavities in the intracluster medium. Although there are quantitative
differences among the models the total radio and X-ray intensity curves show
qualitatively similar trends in all of them.

channel (G-IC), k-user G-IC or the Gaussian X-channel. This has motivated
investigations of interference-limited multi-user channels, for example, the
Gaussian interfering multiple access channel (G-IMAC). Networks with
interference usually require the use of interference alignment (IA) as a
technique to achieve the upper bounds of a network. A promising approach in
view of constant-gap capacity results is a special form of IA called
signal-scale alignment, which works for time-invariant, frequency-flat,
single-antenna networks. However, until now, results were limited to the
many-to-one interference channel and the Gaussian X-channel. To make progress
on this front, we investigate signal-scale IA schemes for the G-IMAC and aim to
show a constant-gap capacity result for the G-IMAC. We derive a constant-gap
sum capacity approximation for the lower triangular deterministic (LTD)-IMAC
and see that the LTD model can overcome difficulties of the linear
deterministic model. We show that the schemes can be translated to the Gaussian
IMAC and that they achieve capacity within a constant gap. We show that
multi-user gain is possible in the whole regime and provide a new look at

widely used to track and analyze human's affective information. According to
their common characteristics of spatial-temporal volumes, in this paper we
propose a novel deep learning framework named spatial-temporal recurrent neural
network (STRNN) to unify the learning of two different signal sources into a
spatial-temporal dependency model. In STRNN, to capture those spatially
cooccurrent variations of human emotions, a multi-directional recurrent neural
network (RNN) layer is employed to capture longrange contextual cues by
traversing the spatial region of each time slice from multiple angles. Then a
bi-directional temporal RNN layer is further used to learn discriminative
temporal dependencies from the sequences concatenating spatial features of each
time slice produced from the spatial RNN layer. To further select those salient
regions of emotion representation, we impose sparse projection onto those
hidden states of spatial and temporal domains, which actually also increases
the model discriminant ability because of this global consideration.
Consequently, such a two-layer RNN model builds spatial dependencies as well as
temporal dependencies of the input signals. Experimental results on the public
emotion datasets of EEG and facial expression demonstrate the proposed STRNN
method is more competitive over those state-of-the-art methods.

estimating rate of the weight parameter via the Fisher information function
$(\mathcal{F}_\theta)$ is possible with small values of the atomic detuning

  Fisher information $(\mathcal{F}_\phi)$ increases suddenly at resonant case
to reach its maximum value if the initial phase $\phi=\pi/2$ and consequently
one may estimate the phase parameter with high degree of precision. If the
initial system is coded with classical information, the upper bounds of Fisher
information for resonant and non-resonant cases are much larger and
consequently one may estimate the pahse parameter with high degree of

decreases and therefore the possibility of estimating the phase parameter

theoretical analysis. Specifically, a $2 \rightarrow \infty$ norm and central

show consistency and partially correct the bias of the procedure.

Automatic classification of ECG could make the work of cardiologic departments
faster and more efficient. It would also reduce the number of false diagnosis

translating the data into a high dimensional feature space and separating it
using a linear classificator. In order to provide an optimal representation for
SVM application, the Hermite transform domain is used. This domain is proved to
be suitable because of the similarity of the QRS complex with Hermite basis

features that are used for detection of irregular QRS complexes. The aim of the
paper is to show that these features can be employed for automatic ECG signal

tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of
3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction

evidenced by the network committee methods. Unlike the conventional committee

partial solutions (so-called building blocks) to find increasingly better
solutions. It is thought that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) implement the BBH.
However, for GAs building blocks are semi-theoretical objects in that they are
thought only to be implicitly exploited via the selection and crossover
operations of a GA. In the current work, we discover a mathematical method to
identify the complete set of schemata present in a given population of a GA; as
such a natural way to study schema processing (and thus the BBH) is revealed.
We demonstrate how this approach can be used both theoretically and
experimentally. Theoretically, we show that the search space for good schemata
is a complete lattice and that each generation samples a complete sub-lattice
of this search space. In addition, we show that combining schemata can only
explore a subset of the search space. Experimentally, we compare how well
different crossover methods combine building blocks. We find that for most
crossover methods approximately 25-35% of building blocks in a generation
result from the combination of the previous generation's building blocks. We
also find that an increase in the combination of building blocks does not lead
to an increase in the efficiency of a GA. To complement this article, we

is a major challenge to engineer into artificial membranes. Here, we
demonstrate, with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, that bare graphene
nanopores yield measurable ion selectivity that varies over one to two orders
of magnitude simply by changing the pore radius and number of graphene layers.
Monolayer graphene does not display dehydration-induced selectivity until the
pore radius is small enough to exclude the first hydration layer from inside
the pore. Bi- and tri-layer graphene, though, display such selectivity already
for a pore size that barely encroaches on the first hydration layer, which is
due to the more significant water loss from the second hydration layer.
Measurement of selectivity and activation barriers from both first and second
hydration layer barriers will help elucidate the behavior of biological ion
channels. Moreover, the energy barriers responsible for selectivity -- while
small on the scale of hydration energies -- are already relatively large, i.e.,
many $k_B$. For separation of ions from water, therefore, one can exchange
longer, larger radius pores for shorter, smaller radius pores, giving a
practical method for maintaining exclusion efficiency while enhancing other
properties (e.g., water throughput).

optical elements for the beam shaping process can benefit the compactness of
the optical system and reduce its cost. The single freeform surface design for
input wavefronts, which are neither planar nor spherical, is therefore of
interest. In this work, the design of single freeform surfaces for a given
zero-\'etendue source and complex target irradiances is investigated. Hence,
not only collimated input beams or point sources are assumed. Instead, a
predefined input ray direction vector field and irradiance distribution on a
source plane, which has to be redistributed by a single freeform surface to
give the predefined target irradiance, is considered. To solve this design
problem, a partial differential equation (PDE) or PDE system, respectively, for
the unknown surface and its corresponding ray mapping is derived from energy
conservation and the ray-tracing equations. In contrast to former PDE
formulations of the single freeform design problem, the derived PDE of
Monge-Amp\`ere type is formulated for general zero-\'etendue sources in
cartesian coordinates. The PDE system is discretized with finite differences
and the resulting nonlinear equation system solved by a root-finding algorithm.
The basis of the efficient solution of the PDE system builds the introduction
of an initial iterate constuction approach for a given input direction vector
field, which uses optimal mass transport with a quadratic cost function. After
a detailed description of the numerical algorithm, the efficiency of the design
method is demonstrated by applying it to several design examples. This includes

electrons is important to the proper description of the electronic states in
the normal state of the iron-based superconductors. Earlier studies of the
pertinent multiorbital Hubbard models identified an orbital-selective Mott
phase, which anchors the orbital-selective behavior seen in the overall phase
diagram. An important characteristics of the models is that the orbitals are
kinetically coupled -- i.e. hybridized -- to each other, which makes the
orbital-selective Mott phase especially nontrivial. A U(1) slave-spin method
was used to analyze the model with nonzero orbital-level splittings. Here we
develop a Landau free-energy functional to shed further light on this issue. We
put the microscopic analysis from the U(1) slave-spin approach in this
perspective, and show that the intersite spin correlations are crucial to the
renormalization of the bare hybridization amplitude towards zero and the
concomitant realization of the orbital-selective Mott transition. Based on this
insight, we discuss additional ways to study the orbital-selective Mott physics
from a dynamical competition between the interorbital hybridization and
collective spin correlations. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the
orbital-selective Mott phase in the multiorbital models appropriate for the
iron-based superconductors.

on the theory of $U$-statistics and $U$-processes, for which we show a central

Iterations for obtaining the solutions are constructed for the spherically
symmetric form of the CR propagation equation. The main solution of the
considered problem consists of the zero-order solution that is obtained during
the initial iteration and amendments that may be obtained by subsequent
iterations. The finding of the zero-order solution is based on the CR isotropy
during propagation in the space, whereas the anisotropy is taken into account
when finding the next amendments. To begin with, the method is applied to solve
the problem of CR modulation where the diffusion coefficient $\kappa$ and the
solar wind speed $u$ are constants with an Local Interstellar Spectra (LIS)
spectrum. The solution obtained with two iterations was compared with an
analytical solution and with numerical solutions. Finally, solutions that have
only one iteration for two problems of CR modulation with $u = constant$ and
the same form of LIS spectrum were obtained and tested against numerical
solutions. For the first problem, $\kappa$ is proportional to the momentum of
the particle $p$, so it has the form $\kappa=k_0\eta$, where
$\eta=\frac{p}{m_0c}$. For the second problem, the diffusion coefficient is
given in the form $\kappa=k_0\beta\eta$, where $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$ is the
particle speed relative to the speed of light. There was a good matching of the
obtained solutions with the numerical solutions as well as with the analytical

topic of interest. We present a new way to constrain the CDDR $\eta(z)$ using
different dynamic and geometric properties of strong gravitational lenses (SGL)
along with SNe Ia observations. We use a sample of $102$ SGL with the
measurement of corresponding velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ and Einstein radius
$\theta_E$. In addition, we also use a dataset of $12$ two image lensing

Jointly these two datasets give us the angular diameter distance $D_{A_{ol}}$
of the lens. Further, for luminosity distance, we use the $740$ observations
from JLA compilation of SNe Ia. To study the combined behavior of these
datasets we use a model independent method, Gaussian Process (GP). We also
check the efficiency of GP by applying it on simulated datasets, which are
generated in a phenomenological way by using realistic cosmological error bars.
Finally, we conclude that the combined bounds from the SGL and SNe Ia
observation do not favor any deviation of CDDR and are in concordance with the
standard value ($\eta=1$) within $2\sigma$ confidence region, which further
strengthens the theoretical acceptance of CDDR.

density is diluted by the strong expansion of quark gluon plasma, which
suppresses the combination probability of heavy quarks and $J/\psi$
regeneration. This effect is more important in higher colliding energies where
QGP expansion is strong. We also propose the ratio $N_{J/\psi}/(N_D)^2$ as a
measurement of $c$ and $\bar c$ coalescence probability, which is only affected

fidelity dynamics. One way of achieving this is to use adiabatic schemes where
the system follows an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian over
timescales that do not allow transitions to other states. This, however, makes
control dynamics very slow. Here we introduce another concept that takes
advantage of preventing unwanted transitions in fermionic systems by using
Pauli blocking: excitations from a protected ground state to higher-lying
states are avoided by adding a layer of buffer fermions, such that the
protected fermions cannot make a transition to higher lying excited states
because these are already occupied. This allows to speed-up adiabatic
evolutions of the system. We do a thorough investigation of the technique, and
demonstrate its power by applying it to high fidelity transport, trap expansion
and splitting in ultracold atoms systems in anharmonic traps. Close analysis of
these processes also leads to insights into the structure of the orthogonality
catastrophe phenomenon.

approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Its convergence
properties are well-known in the case of globally Lipschitz continuous
coefficients. However, in many situations, relevant systems do not show a
smooth behavior, which results in SDE models with discontinuous drift
coefficient. In this work, we will analyze the long time properties of the
Euler scheme applied to SDEs with a piecewise constant drift and a constant
diffusion coefficient and carry out intensive numerical tests for its
convergence properties. We will emphasize on numerical convergence rates and
analyze how they depend on properties of the drift coefficient and the initial
value. We will also give theoretical interpretations of some of the arising
phenomena. For application purposes, we will study a rank-based stock market
model describing the evolution of the capital distribution within the market
and provide theoretical as well as numerical results on the long time ranking
behavior.

combining Answer Set Programming (ASP) with finite domain constraint processing
(CP). While its predecessors rely on a black-box approach to hybrid solving by
integrating the CP solver gecode, the new clingcon system pursues a lazy
approach using dedicated constraint propagators to extend propagation in the
underlying ASP solver clasp. No extension is needed for parsing and grounding
clingcon's hybrid modeling language since both can be accommodated by the new
generic theory handling capabilities of the ASP grounder gringo. As a whole,
clingcon 3 is thus an extension of the ASP system clingo 5, which itself relies
on the grounder gringo and the solver clasp. The new approach of clingcon
offers a seamless integration of CP propagation into ASP solving that benefits
from the whole spectrum of clasp's reasoning modes, including for instance
multi-shot solving and advanced optimization techniques. This is accomplished
by a lazy approach that unfolds the representation of constraints and adds it
to that of the logic program only when needed. Although the unfolding is
usually dictated by the constraint propagators during solving, it can already
be partially (or even totally) done during preprocessing. Moreover, clingcon's
constraint preprocessing and propagation incorporate several well established
CP techniques that greatly improve its performance. We demonstrate this via an
extensive empirical evaluation contrasting, first, the various techniques in
the context of CSP solving and, second, the new clingcon system with other

increasingly used in a wide range of applications, geometric ergodicity results

assumptions. We give here verifiable conditions on the target distribution
under which the Bouncy Particle Sampler algorithm introduced in \cite{P_dW_12}
is geometrically ergodic. This holds whenever the target satisfies a curvature
condition and has tails decaying at least as fast as an exponential and at most
as fast as a Gaussian distribution. This allows us to provide a central limit
theorem for the associated ergodic averages. When the target has tails thinner
than a Gaussian distribution, we propose an original modification of this
scheme that is geometrically ergodic. For thick-tailed target distributions,
such as $t$-distributions, we extend the idea pioneered in \cite{J_G_12} in a
random walk Metropolis context. We apply a change of variable to obtain a
transformed target satisfying the tail conditions for geometric ergodicity. By
sampling the transformed target using the Bouncy Particle Sampler and mapping

Another characteristic of this transition is the high mass loss rate, that can
be partially explained by radiation pressure and a combination of various
factors like the stellar pulsation, the dust grain condensation and opacity in
the upper atmosphere. The magnetic field can also be one of the main
ingredients that shapes the stellar upper atmosphere and envelope. Our main
goal is to investigate for the first time the spatial distribution of the
magnetic field in the envelope of IRC+10216. More generally we intend to
determine the magnetic field strength in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of
C-rich evolved stars, compare this field with previous studies for O-rich
stars, and constrain the variation of the magnetic field with r the distance to
the star's center. We use spectropolarimetric observations of the Stokes V
parameter, collected with Xpol on the IRAM-30m radiotelescope, observing the
Zeeman effect in seven hyperfine components of the CN J = 1-0 line. We use
Crutcher's method to estimate the magnetic field. For C-rich evolved stars, we
derive a magnetic field strength (B) between 1.6 and 14.2 mG while B is
estimated to be 6 mG for the proto-PN (PPN) AFGL618, and an upper value of 8 mG
is found for the PN NGC7027. These results are consistent with a decrease of B
as 1/r in the environment of AGB objects, i.e., with the presence of a toroidal
field. But this is not the case for PPN and PN stars. Our map of IRC+10216
suggests that the magnetic field is not homogeneously strong throughout or
aligned with the envelope and that the morphology of the CN emission might have
changed with time.

pharmaceuticals, agrichemicals and personal care products. The droplets in
these formulations are limited to being spherical as a consequence of the
interfacial tension between the dispersed phase and continuous phase. The
ability to control emulsion droplet morphology and stabilise non-spherical
droplets would enable the modification of emulsion properties such as
stability, substrate binding, delivery rate and rheology. One way of
controlling droplet microstructure is to apply an elastic film around the
droplet to prevent it from relaxing into a sphere. We have previously shown
that BslA, an interfacial protein produced by the bacterial genus Bacillus,
forms an elastic film when exposed to an oil- or air-water interface. Here, we
highlight BslA's ability to stabilise anisotropic emulsion droplets. First, we
show that BslA is capable of arresting dynamic emulsification processes leading
to emulsions with variable morphologies depending on the conditions and
emulsification technique applied. We then show that frozen emulsion droplets
can be manipulated to induce partial coalescence. The structure of the
partially coalesced droplets is retained after melting, but only when there is
sufficient free BslA in the continuous phase. That the fidelity of replication
can be tuned by adjusting the amount of free BslA in solution suggests that
freezing BslA-stabilised droplets disrupts the BslA film. Finally, we utilise
BslA's ability to preserve emulsion droplet structural integrity throughout the
melting process to design emulsion droplets with a chosen shape and size.

concussion classification using implicit features of the entire voxel-wise

objectively compare injury prediction performances against two baseline machine
learning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and
four scalar metrics via univariate logistic regression (Brain Injury Criterion
(BrIC), cumulative strain damage measure of the whole brain (CSDM-WB) and the
corpus callosum (CSDM-CC), and peak fiber strain in the CC). Feature-based deep
learning and machine learning classifiers consistently outperformed all scalar
injury metrics across all performance categories in cross-validation (e.g.,
average accuracy of 0.844 vs. 0.746, and average area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) of 0.873 vs. 0.769, respectively, based on the testing

of deep learning in concussion prediction, and suggest its promise for future

to alleviate the load over the shared link, a two-step correlation-aware

Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via one common and two

experiment in which humans are used to decide the settings at each end. To get
a sufficiently high rate of switching at both ends, I suggest an experiment
over a distance of about 100km with 100 people at each end wearing EEG
headsets, with the signals from these headsets being used to switch the
settings.
  The radical possibility we wish to investigate is that, when humans are used
to decide the settings (rather than various types of random number generators),
we might then expect to see a violation of Quantum Theory in agreement with the
relevant Bell inequality. Such a result, while very unlikely, would be
tremendously significant for our understanding of the world (and I will discuss
some interpretations).
  Possible radical implications aside, performing an experiment like this would
push the development of new technologies. The biggest problem would be to get
sufficiently high rates wherein there has been a human induced switch at each
end before a signal as to the new value of the setting could be communicated to
the other end and, at the same time, a photon pair is detected. It looks like
an experiment like this, while challenging, is just about feasible with current
technologies.

  with nontransversal heteroclinic cycles","14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lorenz attractors are important objects in the modern theory of chaos. The
reason from one side is that they are met in various natural applications
(fluid dynamics, mechanics, laser dynamics, etc.). At the same time, Lorenz
attractors are robust, in the sense that they are generally not destroyed by
small perturbations (autonomous, non-autonomous, stochastic). This allows us to
be sure that the observed in the experiment object is exactly the chaotic
attractor, rather than a long-time periodic orbit. Discrete-time analogs of the
Lorenz attractor possess even more complicated structure -- they allow
homoclinic tangencies of invariant manifolds within the attractor. Thus,
discrete Lorenz attractors belong to the class of wild chaotic attractors.
These attractors can be born in codimension-three local and certain global
(homoclinic and heteroclinic) bifurcations. While various homoclinic
bifurcations leading to such attractors were studied, for heteroclinic cycles
only cases when at least one of the fixed points is saddle-focus were
considered to date. In the present paper the case of a heteroclinic cycle
consisting of saddle fixed points with a quadratic tangency of invariant
manifolds, is considered. It is shown that in order to have a three-dimensional
chaos such as the discrete Lorenz attractors, one needs to avoid the existence
of lower-dimensional global invariant manifolds. Thus, it is assumed that
either the quadratic tangency or the transversal heteroclinic orbit is
non-simple. The main result of the paper is the proof that the original system
is the limiting point in the space of dynamical systems of a sequence of
domains in which the diffeomorphism possesses discrete Lorenz attractors.

We then show that the observed structure is consistent with a mapping of the

observations were conducted at the Russian 6-m telescope. The aim of the study
was to clarify the kinematics and structure, as well as the properties of
stellar populations of the galaxies. The results of observations disproved the
peculiarly low mass-to-light ratios of both galaxies. The most probable reasons
of underestimation of their masses are discussed. We tried to reproduce the
main observed features of kinematical profiles of the galaxies in the N-body
simulations of barred galaxies. We found that both galaxies possess central
components of different structure. Indeed, the age and velocity dispersion of
stellar population in NGC 5347 are low in its innermost part in comparison to
that of the bulge or a bar, which agrees with the presence of nuclear
kinematically decoupled disc. It probably was formed due to the bar which
supplied the inner region with gas. The kinematical profiles of the second
galaxy UGC 1344 give evidences in favour of the central peanut-shaped bulge. In
spite of the different luminosities of the two galaxies, they possess nearly
equal (close to solar) central stellar abundance and the flattening of the

Previous work has argued that scale-free topologies maximize a system's overall
rationality in this setup. Here we show that while, for certain games, it is
true that increasing degree heterogeneity of complex networks enhances
rationality, rationality-optimal configurations are not scale-free. For the
Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games, we provide analytic arguments
complemented by numerical optimization experiments to demonstrate that
core-periphery networks composed of a few dominant hub nodes surrounded by a
periphery of very low degree nodes give strikingly smaller overall deviations
from rationality than scale-free networks. Similarly, for the Battle of the
Sexes and the Matching Pennies games, we find that the optimal network
structure is also a core-periphery graph but with a smaller difference in the
average degrees of the core and the periphery. These results provide insight on
the interplay between the topological structure of socioecological systems and
their collective cognitive behavior, with potential applications to
understanding wealth inequality and the structural features of the network of

institutions. Very recently, pratical setups of large scale quantum computers
are widely studied e.g. quantum repeaters, memories and processors.
Entanglement provides us a computational advantage in realization of quantum
algorithms. Some ways to quantifiying entanglement were defined. The best
formal way to quantify it, is the methods that we call Entanglement Measures or
Entanglement Monotones. In this research area, State Ordering Problem is
defined and still an open problem especially for multiparticle entangled
states. Fisher Information provides a good background for the solution of some
actual Information Theory problems. Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a value
that could be used in situations where phase sensitivity is important and this
concept is expected to be the quantum version of the mentioned inftrastructure
for Quantum Systems. QFI cannot be defined as an Entaglement Measure or
Monotone. In the scope of this thesis, a new optimization technique is proposed
for optimizing QFI and thanks to this optimization method, the ordering
relation between QFI and entanglement measures is studied. Based on the studies
made in the area of quantum state ordering, new and interesting analysis
results are found and reported. The main important and interesting result
achieved is that for two qubit quantum states, QFI maximized under Local
Operation and Classical Communication has an interesting ordering relation with
entanglement measures especially with Relative Entropy of Entanglement. Our
study is extended for the qubit-qutrit systems and ordering relations and
classification results are presented. For some quantum systems, the changes in
QFI under decoherence channels are also considered.

Feedback is an essential component in learning, and should be provided to the
trainee during the training process in order to improve skills, to correct
mistakes, and most importantly, to inspire reasoning and critical thinking. In
CBST, feedback should be provided in a useful and timely manner, ideally in a
way that mimics the advice of an experienced tutor. Here, we explore the
provision of feedback in CBST from three perspectives: 1) types of feedback to
be provided, 2) presentation modalities of feedback, and 3) methods for
feedback extraction/learning. This review is aimed at providing insight into
how feedback is extracted, organized, and delivered in current applications, to
be used as a guide to the development of future feedback intervention systems
in CBST applications.

enlighten our understanding of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), as
BHs>30Msun can reach luminosities>4x10^39 erg s^-1 without exceeding their
Eddington limit. It is then important to study variations of evolutionary
channels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become
ULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to
unity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve
chemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar
systems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering
a wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,
primaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and
forming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands
and transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of
10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs
per Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference
for low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited
to 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no
remnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very
massive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead
form BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity
distribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less
than a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. We
expect that upcoming X-ray observatories will test these predictions, which
together with additional gravitational wave detections will provide strict
constraints on the origin of the most massive BHs that can be produced by
stars.

problem, even for lead times as short as one month. Motivated by Arctic
intraannual variability phenomena such as reemergence of sea surface
temperature and sea ice anomalies, we use a prediction approach for sea ice
anomalies based on analog forecasting. Traditional analog forecasting relies on
identifying a single analog in a historical record, usually by minimizing
Euclidean distance, and forming a forecast from the analog's historical
trajectory. Here an ensemble of analogs are used to make forecasts, where the
ensemble weights are determined by a dynamics-adapted similarity kernel, which
takes into account the nonlinear geometry on the underlying data manifold. We
apply this method for forecasting pan-Arctic and regional sea ice area and
volume anomalies from multi-century climate model data, and in many cases find
improvement over the benchmark damped persistence forecast. Examples of success
include the 3--6 month lead time prediction of pan-Arctic area, the winter sea
ice area prediction of some marginal ice zone seas, and the 3--12 month lead
time prediction of sea ice volume anomalies in many central Arctic basins. We
discuss possible connections between KAF success and sea ice reemergence, and
find KAF to be successful in regions and seasons exhibiting high interannual
variability.

huge, it has become increasingly important and convenient to build a
recommendation or search system to facilitate surfacing these content to the

primary species, collaborative filtering based and content based approaches.
Variants of instantiations of collaborative filtering approach suffer from the
common issues of so called ""cold start"" and ""long tail"" problems where there is
not much user interaction data to reveal user opinions or affinities on the
content and also the distortion towards the popular content. Content-based
approaches are sometimes limited by the richness of the available content data
resulting in a heavily biased and coarse recommendation result. In recent
years, the deep neural network has enjoyed a great success in large-scale image
and video recognitions. In this paper, we propose and experiment using deep
convolutional neural network to imitate how human brain processes hierarchical
structures in the auditory signals, such as music, speech, etc., at various
timescales. This approach can be used to discover the latent factor models of
the music based upon acoustic hyper-images that are extracted from the raw
audio waves of music. These latent embeddings can be used either as features to
feed to subsequent models, such as collaborative filtering, or to build
similarity metrics between songs, or to classify music based on the labels for
training such as genre, mood, sentiment, etc.

geometry processing applications ranging from shape retrieval and segmentation
to classification. In this pa- per, we propose a spectral graph wavelet
approach for 3D shape classification using the bag-of-features paradigm. In an
effort to capture both the local and global geometry of a 3D shape, we present
a three-step feature description framework. First, local descriptors are
extracted via the spectral graph wavelet transform having the Mexican hat
wavelet as a generating ker- nel. Second, mid-level features are obtained by
embedding lo- cal descriptors into the visual vocabulary space using the soft-
assignment coding step of the bag-of-features model. Third, a global descriptor
is constructed by aggregating mid-level fea- tures weighted by a geodesic
exponential kernel, resulting in a matrix representation that describes the
frequency of appearance of nearby codewords in the vocabulary. Experimental
results on two standard 3D shape benchmarks demonstrate the effective- ness of
the proposed classification approach in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods.

of gravity. In particular, to gain insight in the physical behavior of three
stars namely, Her $X1$, SAX J $1808$-$3658$ and 4U $1820$-$30$, energy density,
and radial and tangential pressures are calculated. The $f(R,G)$ gravity model
is split into a Starobinsky like $f(R)$ model and a power law $f(G)$ model. The
main feature of the work is a $3$-dimensional graphical analysis in which,
anisotropic measurements, energy conditions and stability attributes of these
stars are discussed. It is shown that all three stars behave as usual for
positive values of $f(G)$ model parameter $n$.

Zak phase in the Rice-Mele model. We reconstruct the underlying probability
distribution by maximizing the information entropy and applying the moments as
constraints. When the Wannier functions are localized within one unit cell, the
probability distribution so obtained corresponds to that of the Wannier
function. We show that in the fully dimerized limit the magnitude of the
moments are all equal. In this limit, if the on-site interaction is decreased
towards zero, the distribution shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,
but the overall shape of the distribution remains the same. Away from this
limit, if alternate hoppings are finite, and the on-site interaction is
decreased, the distribution also shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,
but it does this by changing shape, by becoming asymmetric around the maximum,
as well as by shifting. We also follow the probability distribution of the
polarization in cycles around the topologically non-trivial point of the model.
The distribution moves across to the next unit cell, its shape distorting
considerably in the process. If the radius of the cycle is large, the shift of
the distribution is accompanied by large variations in the maximum.

phenomena, which are determining the orbital evolution of the satellites. We
suggest in the current research to take into consideration the additional
well-known effect of differential rotation which obviously takes place in the
gaseous or fluid convection zone of primary giant Planet (indeed, the
aforementioned effect exists even not depending on the orbital evolution of
satellites around host Planet). Nevertheless, estimations for the contribution
of the aforementioned effect of differential rotation in the Uranus system
(including all its most massive satellites) let us exclude using such effect
from calculations of mutual evolution of the eccentricity e along with the
semi-major axis a for all satellites of Uranus (Planet of ice-type). It means
that the Uranus can be considered in the analytic exploration of governing
equations as to be the appropriate candidate for applying the modern ansatz
[Efroimsky, 2015] (tidal dissipation effect depending on the tidal-flexure
frequency) in regard to estimations of eccentricity e along with semi-major
axis a for satellites of Uranus. We can see from the results of calculations in
Section 3 that the combined system of governing equations (in the sense of
combined contributions to the tidal dissipation from Uranus + from satellite)
yields the really observed magnitudes of decelerations for semi-major axises of
all the satellites of Uranus. Meanwhile, internal heat generation effects in
the satellites (due to tidal dissipation effect) are much more than those which
definitely take place in the Uranus, excepting the case of Ariel.

several objectives has a central role in many engineering and research fields.
Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity
optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms.
Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are
searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions.
The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as
much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying
framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main
algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and
the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large
variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we
propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity
algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we
present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed
when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by
extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three
different experimental scenarios.
