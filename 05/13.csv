conflicting interest games of incomplete information between two players, Alice
and Bob [Pappa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401 (2015)]. General setting
for such games is that of correlated strategies where the correlation between
competing players is established through a trusted common adviser; however,
players need not reveal their input to the adviser. So far, quantum advantage
in such games has been revealed in a restricted sense. Given a quantum
correlated equilibrium strategy, one of the players can still receive a higher
than quantum average payoff with some classically-correlated equilibrium
strategy. In this work, by considering a class of asymmetric Bayesian games, we
show the existence of games with quantum correlated equilibrium where average
payoff of both the players exceed respective individual maximum for each player
over all classically-correlated equilibriums.

to recognize human actions in still images by predicting the future motion, and
detecting the shape and location of the salient parts of the image. We make the
following major contributions to this important area of research: (i) We use
the predicted future motion in the static image (Walker et al., 2015) as a
means of compensating for the missing temporal information, while using the
saliency map to represent the the spatial information in the form of location
and shape of what is predicted as significant. (ii) We cast action
classification in static images as a domain adaptation problem by transfer
learning. We first map the input static image to a new domain that we refer to
as the Predicted Optical Flow-Saliency Map domain (POF-SM), and then fine-tune
the layers of a deep CNN model trained on classifying the ImageNet dataset to
perform action classification in the POF-SM domain. (iii) We tested our method
on the popular Willow dataset. But unlike existing methods, we also tested on a
more realistic and challenging dataset of over 2M still images that we
collected and labeled by taking random frames from the UCF-101 video dataset.

differs markedly from the elliptical shape assumed in other analytical models,

axis is flattish, as befits models for bars in early-type galaxies (SB0, SBa).
The two-dimensional orbital structure of the models is analysed with surfaces
of section and characteristic diagrams and it reveals qualitatively new
features. For some pattern speeds, additional Lagrange points can exist along
the major axis, and give rise to off-centered, trapped orbits. When the bar is
weak, the orbital structure is very simple, comprising just prograde, aligned
$x_1$ orbits and retrograde anti-aligned $x_4$ orbits. As the bar strength
increases, the $x_1$ family becomes unstable and vanishes, with propeller

superconducting order parameter to a perpendicular node by rotating the
in-plane magnetic field through the antinodal direction within a fraction of a
degree. Here, we address the dynamics of the switching of $\mathbf{Q}$. We use
a free energy functional based on the magnetization density, which describes
the condensation of magnetic fluctuations of nodal quasiparticles, and show
that the switching process includes closing of the SDW gap at one $\mathbf{Q}$

field associated with the SDW transition, consistent with our thermal
conductivity measurements. The agreement between theory and experiment supports
our scenario of the hypersensitivity of the $Q$ phase on the direction of

in order to determine the most accurate and precise stellar atmospheric
parameters via spectroscopy. This is particularly important for determining the
fundamental parameters of exoplanets, which directly depend on the stellar
properties. However, different techniques can be implemented when analysing
these spectra which will influence the results. These include performing an
abundance analysis relative to the solar values in order to negate
uncertainties in atomic data, and fixing the surface gravity (log g) to an
external value such as those from asteroseismology. The choice of lines used
will also influence the results. In this paper, we investigate differential
analysis and fixing log g for a set of FGK stars that already have accurate
fundamental parameters known from external methods. We find that a differential
line list gives slightly more accurate parameters compared to a laboratory line
list, however the laboratory line list still gives robust parameters. We also
find that fixing the log g does not improve the spectroscopic parameters. We
investigate the effects of line selection on the stellar parameters and find
that the choice of lines used can have a significant effect on the parameters.
In particular, removal of certain low excitation potential lines can change the
Teff by up to 50 K. For future HoSTS papers we will use the differential line

classical notion of the Witt ring of symmetric bilinear forms over a field
makes sense in the context of quadratically presentable fields, that is fields
equipped with a presentable partial order inequationaly compatible with the
algebraic operations. As an application, we show that Witt rings of symmetric
bilinear forms over fields, of both characteristic 2 and not 2, are isomorphic
to Witt rings of suitably built quadratically presentable fields, which
therefore provide a uniform construction of Witt rings for all characteristics.

cells systematically change their shape. In each of these processes cell shape
is studied extensively, whereas variation of shape from cell-to-cell is
dismissed most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and variation
of cell shape come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variation are
mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That
relationship is shown to govern maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial
epithelial layer cultured from both non-asthmatic and asthmatic donors as well
as formation of the ventral furrow in the epithelial monolayer of the
Drosophila embryo in vivo. Across these and other vastly different epithelial
systems, cell shape variation collapses to a family of distributions that is
common to all and potentially universal. That distribution, in turn, is
accounted for quantitatively by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction
showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable
as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings thus uncover a
connection between jamming and geometry that is generic -spanning jammed living
and inert systems alike- and demonstrate that proximity of the cell layer to
the jammed state is the principal determinant of the most primitive features of
epithelial cell shape and shape variation.

and as such the interaction architecture is well modelled by a multiplex

experimental access to an aggregated projection. A fundamental challenge is
thus to determine whether the hidden underlying architecture of complex systems
is better modelled as a single interaction layer or results from the
aggregation and interplay of multiple layers. Here we show that using local
information provided by a random walker navigating the aggregated network one
can decide in a robust way if the underlying structure is a multiplex or not
and, in the former case, to determine the most probable number of hidden
layers. As a byproduct, we show that the mathematical formalism also provides a
principled solution for the optimal decomposition and projection of complex,
non-Markovian dynamics into a Markov switching combination of diffusive modes.
We validate the proposed methodology with numerical simulations of both (i)
random walks navigating hidden multiplex networks (thereby reconstructing the
true hidden architecture) and (ii) Markovian and non-Markovian continuous
stochastic processes (thereby reconstructing an effective multiplex
decomposition where each layer accounts for a different diffusive mode). We
also state and prove two existence theorems guaranteeing that an exact
reconstruction of the dynamics in terms of these hidden jump-Markov models is
always possible for arbitrary finite-order Markovian and fully non-Markovian
processes. Finally, we showcase the applicability of the method to experimental

speaker masks. We call this technique source-contrastive estimation. The
methodology is inspired by negative sampling, which has seen success in natural
language processing, where an embedding is learned by correlating and
de-correlating a given input vector with output weights. Although the matrix
determined by the output weights is dependent on a set of known speakers, we
only use the input vectors during inference. Doing so will ensure that source
separation is explicitly speaker-independent. Our approach is similar to recent
deep neural network clustering and permutation-invariant training research; we
use weighted spectral features and masks to augment individual speaker
frequencies while filtering out other speakers. We avoid, however, the severe
computational burden of other approaches with our technique. Furthermore, by
training a vector space rather than combinations of different speakers or
differences thereof, we avoid the so-called permutation problem during
training. Our algorithm offers an intuitive, computationally efficient response
to the cocktail party problem, and most importantly boasts better empirical
performance than other current techniques.

relevance, fundamentally arises due to anharmonic scattering from interatomic
potentials. Despite its prevalence, accurate first-principles calculations of
thermal conductivity remain challenging, primarily due to the high
computational cost of anharmonic interatomic force constant (IFCs)
calculations. Meanwhile, the related anharmonic phenomenon of thermal expansion
is much more tractable, being computable from the Gr\""uneisen parameters
associated with phonon frequency shifts due to crystal deformations. In this
work, we propose a novel approach for computing the largest cubic IFCs from the
Gr\""uneisen parameter data. This allows an approximate determination of the
thermal conductivity via a much less expensive route. The key insight is that
although the Gr\""uneisen parameters cannot possibly contain all the information
on the cubic IFCs, being derivable from spatially uniform deformations, they
can still unambiguously and accurately determine the largest and most
physically relevant ones. By fitting the anisotropic Gr\""uneisen parameter data
along judiciously designed deformations, we can deduce (i.e., reverse engineer)
the dominant cubic IFCs and estimate three-phonon scattering amplitudes. We
illustrate our approach by explicitly computing the largest cubic IFCs and
thermal conductivity of graphene, especially for its out-of-plane (flexural)
modes that exhibit anomalously large anharmonic shifts and thermal conductivity
contributions. Our calculations on graphene not only exhibits reasonable
agreement with established DFT results, but also presents a pedagogical
opportunity for introducing an elegant analytic treatment of the Gr\""uneisen
parameters of generic two-band models. Our approach can be readily extended to
more complicated crystalline materials with nontrivial anharmonic lattice
effects.

  reaction models",,,,,"cs.CE q-bio.QM stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of chemical reaction models aids understanding and prediction
in areas ranging from biology to electrochemistry and combustion. A systematic
approach to building reaction network models uses observational data not only
to estimate unknown parameters, but also to learn model structure. Bayesian
inference provides a natural approach to this data-driven construction of
models. Yet traditional Bayesian model inference methodologies that numerically
evaluate the evidence for each model are often infeasible for nonlinear
reaction network inference, as the number of plausible models can be
combinatorially large. Alternative approaches based on model-space sampling can
enable large-scale network inference, but their realization presents many
challenges. In this paper, we present new computational methods that make
large-scale nonlinear network inference tractable. First, we exploit the
topology of networks describing potential interactions among chemical species
to design improved ""between-model"" proposals for reversible-jump Markov chain
Monte Carlo. Second, we introduce a sensitivity-based determination of move
types which, when combined with network-aware proposals, yields significant
additional gains in sampling performance. These algorithms are demonstrated on
inference problems drawn from systems biology, with nonlinear differential
equation models of species interactions.

young star-forming regions to search for differences in the spatial
distributions of massive stars compared to lower-mass stars. The competitive
accretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars
should sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be
observable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most
massive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in
cool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and
are mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming
regions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than
average stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH
simulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is
due to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds
are implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass
of the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.
This generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,
and prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn
results in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration
and surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do
form via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a
different spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation
in an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a
viable formation mechanism for massive stars.

we compare galactic outflows traced by diffuse, soft X-ray emission from
Chandra Space Telescope archival observations to the star formation histories
derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the resolved stellar populations
in six starburst dwarfs. We constrain the longevity of a wind to have an upper
limit of 25 Myr based on galaxies whose starburst activity has already
declined, although a larger sample is needed to confirm this result. We find an
average 16% efficiency for converting the mechanical energy of stellar feedback
to thermal, soft X-ray emission on the 25 Myr timescale, somewhat higher than
simulations predict. The outflows have likely been sustained for timescales
comparable to the duration of the starbursts (i.e., 100's Myr), after taking
into account the time for the development and cessation of the wind. The wind
timescales imply that material is driven to larger distances in the
circumgalactic medium than estimated by assuming short, 5-10 Myr starburst
durations, and that less material is recycled back to the host galaxy on short
timescales. In the detected outflows, the expelled hot gas shows various
morphologies which are not consistent with a simple biconical outflow
structure. The sample and analysis are part of a larger program, the STARBurst

spirals to tighter orbital separations under the influence of drag from the
surrounding envelope material. As this object sweeps through material with a
steep radial gradient of density, net angular momentum is introduced into the
flow, potentially leading to the formation of an accretion disk. The presence
of a disk would have dramatic consequences for the outcome of the interaction
because accretion might be accompanied by strong, polar outflows with enough
energy to unbind the entire envelope. Without a detailed understanding of the
necessary conditions for disk formation during common envelope, therefore, it
is difficult to accurately predict the population of merging compact binaries.
This paper examines the conditions for disk formation around objects embedded
within common envelopes using the `wind tunnel' formalism developed by MacLeod
et al. (2017). We find that the formation of disks is highly dependent on the
compressibility of the envelope material. Disks form only in the most
compressible of stellar envelope gas, found in envelopes' outer layers in zones
of partial ionization. These zones are largest in low-mass stellar envelopes,
but comprise small portions of the envelope mass and radius in all cases. We
conclude that disk formation and associated accretion feedback in common
envelope is rare, and if it occurs, transitory. The implication for LIGO black
hole binary assembly is that by avoiding strong accretion feedback, common
envelope interactions should still result in the substantial orbital tightening
needed to produce merging binaries.

scientific driver over the next decade, involving the development of very large
telescopes and requires high-contrast imaging close to the optical axis. Some
complex techniques have been developed to improve the performance at small
separations (coronagraphy, wavefront shaping, etc). In this paper, we study
some of the fundamental limitations of high contrast at the instrument design
level, for cases that use a combination of a coronagraph and two deformable
mirrors for wavefront shaping. In particular, we focus on small-separation
point-source imaging (around 1 $\lambda$/D). First, we analytically or
semi-analytically analysing the impact of several instrument design parameters:
actuator number, deformable mirror locations and optic aberrations (level and
frequency distribution). Second, we develop in-depth Monte Carlo simulation to
compare the performance of dark hole correction using a generic test-bed model
to test the Fresnel propagation of multiple randomly generated optics static
phase errors. We demonstrate that imaging at small separations requires large
setup and small dark hole size. The performance is sensitive to the optic
aberration amount and spatial frequencies distribution but shows a weak
dependence on actuator number or setup architecture when the dark hole is
sufficiently small (from 1 to $\lesssim$ 5 $\lambda$/D).

phase shifts due to the dynamical tide are sensitive to the stratification,
composition, and superfluid state of the core. We extend our previous study of
the dynamical tide in superfluid neutron stars by allowing for hyperons in the
core. Hyperon gradients give rise to a new type of composition g-mode. Compared
to g-modes due to muon-to-electron gradients, those due to hyperon gradients
are concentrated much deeper in the core and therefore probe higher density
regions. We find that the phase shifts due to resonantly excited hyperonic
modes are ~ 10^{-3} rad, an order of magnitude smaller than those due to muonic
modes. We show that by stacking events, third generation gravitational-wave

exact analytic expressions for their density, which is directly related to the

has implications for the use of these origami tilings as tunable metamaterials;
our analysis shows that Miura-ori's density is more tunable than Barreto's
Mars, for example. We also find that there is a broader range of tunability as
a function of the density of layering defects compared to as a function of the
density of crease order defects before the phase transition point is reached;
material and mechanical properties that depend on local layer ordering
properties will have a greater amount of tunability. The defect density of
Barreto's Mars, on the other hand, can be increased until saturation without

Previous surveys of M67 observed that 15% of its Sun-like stars exhibited
chromospheric activity levels below solar minimum, which suggest that these
stars might be in activity-minimum states analogous to the Maunder Minimum. The
activity diagnostic used, the HK index (relative intensities of the Ca II H&K
lines integrated over 1 Ang. bandpasses), was measured from low-resolution
spectra ($R\approx 5000$), as is traditional and suitable for nearby, bright
stars. However, for stars beyond the Local Bubble, the interstellar medium
(ISM) imprints absorption lines in spectra at Ca II H&K, which negatively bias
activity measurements when these lines fall within the HK index bandpass. I
model the ISM clouds in the M67 foreground with high-resolution spectra of blue
stragglers and solar analogs. I demonstrate that ISM absorption varies across
the cluster and must be accounted for on a star-by-star basis. I then apply the
ISM model to a solar spectrum and broaden it to the lower spectral resolution
employed by prior surveys. Comparing HK indices measured from ISM-free and
ISM-contaminated spectra, I find that all stars observed below solar minimum
can be explained by this ISM bias. I conclude that there is no compelling
evidence for Maunder minimum candidates in M67 at this time.

is desirable to decompose the theory into a number of weakly-related or
independent components. However, a theory may represent knowledge that is
subject to change, as a result of executing actions that have effects on some
of the initial properties mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a
decomposition of a theory, it is advantageous to know whether a decomposition
has to be computed again in the newly-changed theory (obtained from taking into
account changes resulting from execution of an action). In the paper, we
address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where a change of
an initial theory is related to the notion of progression. Progression provides
a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those
properties, which are subject to change, and computing new values for them. We
consider decomposability and inseparability, two component properties known
from the literature, and contribute by 1) studying the conditions when these
properties are preserved and 2) when they are lost wrt progression and the
related operation of forgetting. To show the latter, we demonstrate the
boundaries using a number of negative examples. To show the former, we identify
cases when these properties are preserved under forgetting and progression of
initial theories in local-effect basic action theories of the situation
calculus. Our paper contributes to bridging two different communities in
Knowledge Representation, namely research on modularity and research on

opened when extending General Relativity. For linear perturbations, one
solution consists in using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFT of
DE). Even then, the theory space is described in terms of a handful of free
functions of time. This needs to be reduced to a finite number of parameters to
be practical for cosmological surveys. We explore in this article how well
simple parametrizations, with a small number of parameters, can fit observables
computed from complex theories. Imposing the stability of linear perturbations
appreciably reduces the theory space we explore. We find that observables are
not extremely sensitive to short time-scale variations and that simple, smooth
parametrizations are usually sufficient to describe this theory space. Using
the Bayesian Information Criterion, we find that using two parameters for each
function (an amplitude and a power law index) is preferred over complex models
for 86% of our theory space.

wells with a width $(8-20)$~nm has been studied experimentally by
magnetotransport effects and theoretically in framework $4$-bands $kP$-method.
Comparison of the Hall density with the density found from period of the
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations clearly shows that the degeneracy of
states of the top of the valence band is equal to 2 at the hole density $p<
5.5\times 10^{11}$~cm$^{-2}$. Such degeneracy does not agree with the
calculations of the spectrum performed within the framework of the $4$-bands
$kP$-method for symmetric quantum wells. These calculations show that the top
of the valence band consists of four spin-degenerate extremes located at $k\neq
0$ (valleys) which gives the total degeneracy $K=8$. It is shown that taking
into account the ""mixing of states"" at the interfaces leads to the removal of
the spin degeneracy that reduces the degeneracy to $K=4$. Accounting for any
additional asymmetry, for example, due to the difference in the mixing
parameters at the interfaces, the different broadening of the boundaries of the
well, etc, leads to reduction of the valleys degeneracy, making $K=2$. It is
noteworthy that for our case two-fold degeneracy occurs due to degeneracy of
two single-spin valleys. The hole effective mass ($m_h$) determined from
analysis of the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the SdH oscillations
show that $m_h$ is equal to $(0.25\pm0.02)\,m_0$ and weakly increases with the
hole density. Such a value of $m_h$ and its dependence on the hole density are
in a good agreement with the calculated effective mass.

  Planning",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nearly all autonomous robotic systems use some form of motion planning to
compute reference motions through their environment. An increasing use of
autonomous robots in a broad range of applications creates a need for
efficient, general purpose motion planning algorithms that are applicable in
any of these new application domains.
  This thesis presents a resolution complete optimal kinodynamic motion
planning algorithm based on a direct forward search of the set of admissible
input signals to a dynamical model. The advantage of this generalized label
correcting method is that it does not require a local planning subroutine as in
the case of related methods.
  Preliminary material focuses on new topological properties of the canonical
problem formulation that are used to show continuity of the performance
objective. These observations are used to derive a generalization of Bellman's
principle of optimality in the context of kinodynamic motion planning. A
generalized label correcting algorithm is then proposed which leverages these
results to prune candidate input signals from the search when their cost is
greater than related signals.
  The second part of this thesis addresses admissible heuristics for
kinodynamic motion planning. An admissibility condition is derived that can be
used to verify the admissibility of candidate heuristics for a particular
problem. This condition also characterizes a convex set of admissible
heuristics.
  A linear program is formulated to obtain a heuristic which is as close to the
optimal cost-to-go as possible while remaining admissible. This optimization is
justified by showing its solution coincides with the solution to the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Lastly, a sum-of-squares relaxation of this
infinite-dimensional linear program is proposed for obtaining provably
admissible approximate solutions.

at the level of linear perturbations, and can be trusted deep in the nonlinear
regime. As a specific example, we focus on the case of a Dirac, Born-Infeld
(DBI) field conformally coupled to a quintessence field. We show that the fluid
linear regime breaks before the field gradients become large; this means that
the field theory is valid inside a large region of the fluid nonlinear regime.

  Technology, September 2016",,"1721.1/107045",,"nucl-ex physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements of the ratio of the proton elastic form factors ($\mu_pG_E/G_M$)
using Rosenbluth separation and those using polarization-based techniques show
a strong discrepancy, which has persisted both in modern experimental results
and in re-analyses of previous data. The most widely accepted hypothesis to
explain this discrepancy is the treatment of the contributions from hard
two-photon exchange (TPE) to elastic electron-proton scattering in the
radiative corrections applied to the Rosenbluth separation measurements.
Calculations of the hard TPE contribution are highly model dependent, but the
effect may be measured experimentally with a precise determination of the ratio
of the positron-proton and electron-proton elastic scattering cross sections.
  The OLYMPUS experiment collected approximately 4 fb$^{-1}$ of \pp and \ep
scattering data at the DORIS storage ring at DESY in 2012, with the goal of
measuring the elastic \ratio ratio over the kinematic range $(0.4 \leq \epsilon
\leq 0.9)$, $(0.6 \leq Q^2 \leq 2.2)$ GeV$^2/c^2$ at a fixed lepton beam energy
of 2.01 GeV. The detector for the OLYMPUS experiment consisted of refurbished
elements of the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST) surrounding
an internal gaseous hydrogen target, with the addition of multiple systems for
the monitoring of the luminosity collected by the experiment. A detailed
simulation of the experiment was developed to account for both radiative
corrections and various systematic effects.
  This work presents preliminary results from the OLYMPUS data, demonstrating
that the elastic \ratio ratio rises to several percent at $\epsilon\approx 0.4$
and indicating a significant contribution from TPE to \pmp scattering.
Additionally, the value of \ratio has been measured to unprecedented precision
at $\epsilon=0.98$, which provides a valuable normalization point for other
experimental data.

theoretical paper aims to expand on some of the aspects of the Global Workspace

proposes that: familiar input which does not elicit intense emotions becomes
processed subconsciously and such processing can be continuous and sustained;
input that elicits relatively intense emotions is subjected to highly

show that the energy needed for cosmic expansion can be found using basic
thermodynamic principles, and that cosmic expansion had as its origin, a finite
initial energy density, pressure, volume, and temperature. Inflation in the
traditional sense, with the inflaton field, may also not be required as it can
be argued that homogeneities and in-homogeneities in the WMAP temperature
profile can be attributed to quantum mechanical fluctuations about a fixed
background temperature in the initial isothermal expansion phase. Fluctuations
in temperature can cause certain regions of space to lose heat to other pockets
producing voids forcing, i.e., fueling expansion of the latter and creating
slightly cooler temperatures in the former, where matter will later congregate.
Upon freeze-out, this could produce the observed WMAP signature with its
associated CBR fluctuation in magnitude. Finally, we estimate that the
freeze-out temperature and time for WMAP in-homogeneities occurred at roughly
3.02 * 1027 K and 2.54 * 10-35 s, respectively, after first initiation of
volume expansion, in line with current estimates for the end of the

Traditionally, constraints on the gas mass distribution are derived from
observations of the dust emission from disks, but this approach suffers from
large uncertainties in grain growth and gas-to-dust ratio. On the other hand,
previous observations of gas tracers only probe surface layers above the bulk
mass reservoir. Here we present the first partially spatially resolved
observations of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=3-2 line emission in the closest
protoplanetary disk, TW Hya, a gas tracer that probes the bulk mass
distribution. Combining it with the C$^{18}$O J=3-2 emission and the previously
detected HD J=1-0 flux, we directly constrain the mid-plane temperature and
optical depths of gas and dust emission. We report a gas mass distribution of
13$^{+8}_{-5}\times$(R/20.5AU)$^{-0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}}$ g cm$^{-2}$ in the
expected formation zone of gas and ice giants (5-21AU). We find the total
gas/millimeter-sized dust mass ratio is 140 in this region, suggesting that at
least 2.4M_earth of dust aggregates have grown to >centimeter sizes (and
perhaps much larger). The radial distribution of gas mass is consistent with a
self-similar viscous disk profile but much flatter than the posterior
extrapolation of mass distribution in our own and extrasolar planetary systems.

With the chemical model, radial profiles of molecules including COMs are
calculated for the case of the prototypical prestellar core L1544 at the
timescales when the modeled depletion factor of CO becomes equal to that
observed. We find that COMs can be formed efficiently in L1544 up to the
fractional abundances of 10(-10) wrt. total hydrogen nuclei. Abundances of many
COMs such as CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, and others peak at similar radial distances of
~2000-4000 AU. Gas-phase abundances of COMs depend on the efficiency of
reactive desorption, which in turn depends on the composition of the outer
monolayers of icy mantles. In prestellar cores, the outer monolayers of mantles
likely include large fractions of CO and its hydrogenation products, which may
increase the efficiency of reactive desorption according to Minissale et al.
(2016), and makes the formation of COMs efficient under conditions typical for
prestellar cores, although this assumption is yet to be confirmed
experimentally. The hydroxyl radical (OH) appears to play an important role in
gas-phase chemistry of COMs, which makes it deserving further detailed studies.

balanced system that gives better training performance in terms of energy and

for tolerable accuracy degradation. We show that the accuracy degradation can
be mitigated by partially training the Gabor kernels, for a small fraction of
the total training cycles. We evaluated the proposed approach on 4 benchmark

of object recognition (CIFAR10) was implemented on a state of the art deep CNN

of the single-species subspaces and are gapless if gapless on either

any new gapless phases.

regression models via algorithms coined `control polygon reduction' (CPR) and
`control net reduction' (CNR). B-Splines are commonly used in regression models
to smooth data and approximate unknown functional forms. B-Splines are defined
by a polynomial order and a knot sequence. Defining the knot sequence is
non-trivial, but is critical with respect to the quality of the regression
models. The focus of the CPR and CNR algorithms is to reduce a large knot
sequence down to a parsimonious collection of elements while maintaining a high
quality of fit. The algorithms are quick to implement and are flexible enough
to support many types of data and regression approaches. The cpr package
provides the end user collections of tools for the construction of B-spline
basis matrices, construction of control polygons and control nets, and the use
of diagnostics of the CPR and CNR algorithms.

distinct detection properties, to develop a multiple target, multiple type
filtering, N-type PHD filter, where $N\geq2$, for handling confusions among
target types. In this approach, we assume that there will be confusions between
detections, i.e. clutter arises not just from background false positives, but
also from target confusions. Then, under the assumptions of Gaussianity and
linearity, we extend the Gaussian mixture (GM) implementation of the standard
PHD filter for the proposed N-type PHD filter termed the N-type GM-PHD filter.
Furthermore, we analyze the results from simulations to track sixteen targets
of four different types using a four-type (quad) GM-PHD filter as a typical
example and compare it with four independent GM-PHD filters using the Optimal
Subpattern Assignment (OSPA) metric. This shows the improved performance of our
strategy that accounts for target confusions by efficiently discriminating

the most powerful events in the universe. If the produced axions decay into
photons or $e^+e-$ pairs at the correct distances, a fireball is generated. We
calculate the structure transient accretion disks in GRBs (density, temperature

to obtain the values of the coupling constant g_{aN} in order for the axions
not to become trapped, and we can also compute the emitted heavy axion
luminosity from the entire disk. We find that for the couplings within the
ranges found, then the mechanism for powering GRBs based on heavy axion
production and decay becomes an alternative to the standard picture based upon
magnetohydrodynamic processes and neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.
Otherwise, if heavy axions are produced in the disk but their decay to takes
place further away, the mechanism fails. Still, the decay products (gamma rays

observed for different ranges of values of the coupling constants, depending on

The $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller forces the system to behave in a
repeatable, predefined way, even in the presence of unknown and changing
disturbances; however, this does not imply that perfect trajectory tracking is
achieved. ILC improves the tracking performance based on experience from
previous executions. The performance of ILC is limited by the robustness and
repeatability of the underlying system, which, in this approach, is handled by
the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller. In particular, we are able to
generalize learned trajectories across different system configurations because
the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller handles the underlying changes in the
system. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking performance and
generalization capabilities of the combined method compared to pure ILC in

between the set of assumptions which lead to a specific conclusion and those
which do not. In a potential outcomes model with a binary treatment, we
consider two conclusions: First, that ATE is at least a specific value (e.g.,
nonnegative) and second that the proportion of units who benefit from treatment
is at least a specific value (e.g., at least 50\%). For these conclusions, we
derive the breakdown frontier for two kinds of assumptions: one which indexes
relaxations of the baseline random assignment of treatment assumption, and one
which indexes relaxations of the baseline rank invariance assumption. These
classes of assumptions nest both the point identifying assumptions of random
assignment and rank invariance and the opposite end of no constraints on
treatment selection or the dependence structure between potential outcomes.
This frontier provides a quantitative measure of robustness of conclusions to
relaxations of the baseline point identifying assumptions. We derive
$\sqrt{N}$-consistent sample analog estimators for these frontiers. We then
provide two asymptotically valid bootstrap procedures for constructing lower
uniform confidence bands for the breakdown frontier. As a measure of
robustness, estimated breakdown frontiers and their corresponding confidence
bands can be presented alongside traditional point estimates and confidence
intervals obtained under point identifying assumptions. We illustrate this
approach in an empirical application to the effect of child soldiering on
wages. We find that sufficiently weak conclusions are robust to simultaneous
failures of rank invariance and random assignment, while some stronger
conclusions are fairly robust to failures of rank invariance but not
necessarily to relaxations of random assignment.

remarkable fast-scanning capabilities of the ALMA 12m dishes to make

extensive commissioning effort to optimize the mapping procedure, and it
describes the nature of the resulting data. Amplitude calibration is discussed
in detail: a path that utilizes the two loads in the ALMA calibration system as

mm and 5900 K at lambda=1.3 mm. These values have statistical uncertainties of
order 100 K, but systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale that may be
significantly larger. Example images are presented from two periods with very
different levels of solar activity. At a resolution of order 25 arcsec, the 1.3

this work, we identify another useful structural feature for predicting gender,
an overdispersion of gender preferences introduced by individuals who have
extreme preferences for a particular gender, regardless of their own gender. We
call this property monophily for ""love of one,"" and jointly characterize the
statistical structure of homophily and monophily in social networks in terms of
preference bias and preference variance. For prediction, we find that this
pattern of extreme gender preferences introduces friend-of-friend correlations,

being similar to their friends. We analyze a population of online friendship

mm/submm VLBI arrays for (a) exploring the vicinity of black holes with an
ultimate angular resolution down to 1~R$_{S}$ (Schwarzschild radius) and (b)
investigating the dynamics of circumstellar gas in star-forming regions and
late-type stars, and circumnuclear gas around active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In
the first half of this White Paper, we highlight scientific accomplishments of
the East Asia (EA) VLBI community. Various VLBI research results on M87, Sgr

described, and future visions of our VLBI science are briefly presented. Maser
science of star formation, stellar evolution, and physics of accretion disks

collocated-mesh approach suited for unstructured grid formulation is provided.
Unlike other fluid dynamics models, LES accuracy is intricately linked to
so-called primary and secondary conservation properties of the numerical
discretization schemes. This implies that although the solver only evolves
equations for mass, momentum, and energy, the implied discrete equation for
kinetic energy (square of velocity) should be minimally-dissipative. Here, a

energy dissipation is minimized. The method is demonstrated using manufactured

molecular transport and a neck between adjacent grains grows. This growth

the critical velocity for growth, below which the mass of an aggregate
increases, decreased from 50\,m\,s$^{-1}$ for the non-sintered case to
20\,m\,s$^{-1}$. For compacted aggregates, the main collisional outcome is
bouncing. These results come from the fact that the strength of the neck is

with complex systems. This is usually accomplished by employing a complexity
measure such as entropies and fractal dimensions. However, such measures
usually only capture a single aspect of the system dynamics. Here, we propose a
family of complexity measures for time series based on a generalization of the
complexity-entropy causality plane. By replacing the Shannon entropy by a
mono-parametric entropy (Tsallis $q$-entropy) and after considering the proper
generalization of the statistical complexity ($q$-complexity), we build up a
parametric curve (the $q$-complexity-entropy curve) that is used for
characterizing/classifying time series. Based on simple exact results and
numerical simulations of stochastic processes, we show that these curves can
distinguish among different long-range, short-range and oscillating correlated
behaviors. Also, we verify that simulated chaotic and stochastic time series
can be distinguished based on whether these curves are open or closed. We
further test this technique in experimental scenarios related to chaotic laser
intensity, stock price, sunspot, and geomagnetic dynamics, confirming its
usefulness. Finally, we prove that these curves enhance the automatic
classification of time series with long-range correlations and interbeat
intervals of healthy subjects and patients with heart disease.

a photoelectric absorption, showed that the hydrogen column density increased
from (2.9+-0.4)E+21 to (4.7+-1.1)E+21 cm^-2 around the superior conjunction,
although more complex spectral variation, such as a partial absorption, was
suggested, and the flux of the power law component decreased with 6+-1%. On the
other hand, the MFs of the folded light curves in the high/soft state, were
4+-1% and 4+-2% for 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands, respectively. We applied a
model consisting of a power law and a diskblackbody with a photoelectric
absorption and found a modulation of the flux of the power law component with
7+-5% in MF, while the modulation of the hydrogen column density was less than
1E+21 cm^-2. These results can be interpreted as follows; the modulation of
both states can be mainly explained by scattering of the X-rays by an ionized
stellar wind, but only at the superior conjunction in the low/hard state, a
large photoelectric absorption appears, because of a low ionization state of
the wind in the line of sight at the phase. Such a condition can be established
by reasonable parameters of an in-homogeneous wind and the observed
luminosities.

for the first time a non trivial example where the eigenvalue distribution of
the corresponding sample covariance matrix {\em does not converge} to the
celebrated Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur law. A different and new limit is found and
characterized. The reasons of failure of the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur limit in this
situation are found to be a strong dependence between the $p$-coordinates of
the mixture. Next, we address the problem of testing whether the mixture has a
spherical covariance matrix. To analize the traditional John's type test we
establish a novel and general CLT for linear statistics of eigenvalues of the
sample covariance matrix. It is shown that the John's test and its recent
high-dimensional extensions both fail for high-dimensional mixtures, precisely
due to the different spectral limit above. As a remedy, a new test procedure is
constructed afterwards for the sphericity hypothesis. This test is then applied
to identify the covariance structure in model-based clustering. It is shown
that the test has much higher power than the widely used ICL and BIC criteria
in detecting non spherical component covariance matrices of a high-dimensional
mixture.

emphasize the role of charge conjugation symmetry in these anomalies; for
example, we obtain nontrivial constraints on the degrees of freedom that live
on a domain wall in the VBS phase of the Abelian Higgs model in 2+1 dimensions.

Abelian Higgs model is dual to the Ising model. We also study variations of the
Abelian Higgs model in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions where there is no dynamical
particle of unit charge. These models have a center symmetry and additional
discrete anomalies. In the absence of a dynamical unit charge particle, the
Ising transition in the 1+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs model is removed. These
models without a unit charge particle exhibit a remarkably persistent order: we
prove that the system cannot be disordered by either quantum or thermal
fluctuations. Equivalently, when these theories are studied on a circle, no
matter how small or large the circle is, the ground state is non-trivial.

associated with the photoassisted escape of electrons from the GLs into the
continuum states in the conduction band of the barrier layers due to the
interband photon absorption, the propagation of these electrons and the
electrons injected from the emitter across the heterostructure and their
collection by the collector contact. The space charge of the holes trapped in
the GLs provides a relatively strong injection and large photoelectric gain. We
calculate the GLIP responsivity and dark current detectivity as functions of
the energy of incident infrared photons and the structural parameters. It is
shown that both the periodic selective doping of the inter-GL barrier layers
and the GL doping lead to a pronounced variation of the GLIP spectral
characteristics, particularly near the interband absorption threshold, while
the doping of GLs solely results in a substantial increase in the GLIP
detectivity. The doping ""engineering"" opens wide opportunities for the

applications, including data compression, plagiarism detection and sequence

of SA is not amenable to the current large-scale data processing frameworks
anymore due to its intrinsic proliferation of suffixes during the construction.
That is, ameliorating the performance by just adding the resources to the
frameworks becomes less cost- effective, even having the severe diminishing
returns. At issue now is whether we can permit SA construction to be more
scalable and efficient for the everlasting accretion of data by creating a
radical shift in perspective. Regarding TeraSort [1] as our baseline, we first
demonstrate the fragile scalability of TeraSort and investigate what causes it
through the experiments on the sequence alignment of a grouper (i.e., the SA
construc- tion used in bioinformatics). As such, we propose a scheme that
amalgamates the distributed key-value store system into MapReduce to leverage
the in-memory queries about suffixes. Rather than handling the communication of
suffixes, MapReduce is in charge of the communication of their indexes, which
means better capacity for more data. It significantly abates the required disk
space for constructing SA and better utilizes the memory, which in turn
improves the scalability radically. We also examine the efficiency of our
scheme in terms of memory and show it outperforms TeraSort. At last, our scheme
can complete the pair- end sequencing and alignment with two input files
without any degradation on scalability, and can accommodate the suffixes of
nearly 6.7 TB in a small cluster composed of 16 nodes and Gigabit Ethernet

monolayer phosphorene nanorings (PNR). Atomistic quantum transport simulations
of PNR are employed to investigate the impact of multiple modulation sources on
the sample conductance. In presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, we find
that the conductance of both armchair and zigzag PNR oscillate periodically in
a low-energy window as a manifestation of the AB effect. Our numerical results
have revealed a giant magnetoresistance (MR) in zigzag PNR (with a maximum
magnitude approaching two thousand percent). It is attributed to the AB effect
induced destructive interference phase in a wide energy range below the bottom
of the second subband. We also demonstrate that PNR conductance is highly
anisotropic, offering an additional way to modulate MR. The giant MR in PNR is
maintained at room temperature in the presence of thermal broadening effect.

successful inflation, the two right-handed neutrinos, i.e., the inflaton and

flavor symmetry structure becomes less manifest in the light neutrino masses in
the seesaw mechanism, and this tendency becomes most prominent when
right-handed neutrinos are degenerate. Secondly, the Dirac CP phase turns out
to be sensitive to whether the shift symmetry breaking depends on the lepton
flavor symmetry. When the flavor symmetry is imposed only on the stabilizer
Yukawa couplings, distributions of the CP phases are peaked at $\delta \simeq
\pm \pi/4, \pm 3\pi/4$ and $\alpha = 0$, while the vanishing and maximal Dirac
CP phases are disfavored. On the other hand, when the flavor symmetry is

difficult to explain the observed neutrino data, and those parameters

for frequency conversion as an alternative to nonlinear techniques. A key issue
with plasma mirrors is the need for a high carrier concentration, of order
10^21 cm^-3, to achieve an appreciable reflectivity. To generate such high
carrier concentrations, short laser pulses with extreme power densities of the
order >10^15 W/cm^2 are required. Here, we introduce a novel waveguide-based
method for generating relativistically moving plasma mirrors that requires much
lower pump powers and much less carrier concentration. Specifically, we achieve
an experimental demonstration of 35% reflection for a carrier concentration of
5*10^17/cm^3 generated by a power density of only 1.2*10^9 W/cm^2. Both the
plasma mirror and the signal are confined and propagating within a solid state
silicon slow light photonic crystal waveguide. This extraordinary effect only
becomes possible because we exploit an indirect intraband optical transition in
a dispersion engineered slow light waveguide, where the incident light cannot
couple to other states beyond the moving front and has to reflect from it. The
moving free carrier (FC) plasma mirror is generated by two photon absorption of
6 ps long pump pulse with a peak power of 6.2 W. The reflection was
demonstrated by the interaction of a continuous wave (CW) probe wave
co-propagating with the relativistic FC plasma mirror inside a 400 micro-meter
long slow light waveguide. Upon interaction with the FC plasma mirror, the
probe wave packets, which initially propagate slower than the plasma mirror,
are bounced and accelerated, finally escaping from the front in forward
direction. The forward reflection of the probe wave packets are accompanied by
a frequency upshift. The reflection efficiency is estimated for the part of the
CW probe interacting with the pump pulse.

of vegetation structures as well as of SEL dynamics that is more regular and
predictable after the burning and less chaotic. However grassland evolution
could be more predictable than forest considering the effect of fire
disturbance on successional cycles and stages of the two land-cover types. In
particular, we applied recurrence analysis with sliding temporal windows

grasslands and forests behaved similarly in correspondence with the burning,

subsumes the linear SIPS model. The dynamics of the generic SIPS model is
studied comprehensively. In particular, a set of criteria for the final

Some conditions for the linear SIPS model to accurately capture the average

large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations of a filament on 2015 May 3. Located
next to active region 12335, the sigmoidal filament was observed by the
ground-based H$\alpha$ telescopes from GONG and by AIA aboard SDO. The filament
oscillations were most probably triggered by the magnetic reconnection in the
filament channel. The directions of oscillations have angles of
4$^\circ$-36$^\circ$ with respect to the filament axis. The whole filament did
not oscillate in phase as a rigid body. Meanwhile, the periods (3100$-$4400 s)
of oscillations have a spatial dependence. The values of $R$ are estimated to
be 69.4$-$133.9 Mm, and the minimum transverse magnetic field of the dips is
estimated to be 15 G. The amplitudes of S5-S8 grew with time, while the
amplitudes of S9-S14 damped with time. The amplitudes of oscillations range
from a few to ten Mm, and the maximal velocity can reach 30 km s$^{-1}$.
Interestingly, the filament experienced mass drainage southwards at a speed of
$\sim$27 km s$^{-1}$. The oscillations continued after the mass drainage and
lasted for more than 11 hr. After the mass drainage, the phases of oscillations
did not change a lot. The periods of S5-S8 decreased, while the periods of
S9-S14 increased. The amplitudes of S5$-$S8 damped with time, while the
amplitudes of S9-S14 grew. Most of the damping (growing) ratios are between -9
and 14. We propose a schematic cartoon to explain the complex behaviors of
oscillations by introducing thread-thread interaction.

regions easier to analyze. Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in
many practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden
Markov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image
segmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process.
This modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function. Conjugate
Gradient algorithm (CG) is one of the best known optimization techniques. This
paper proposes the use of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) for image
segmentation, based on the Hidden Markov Random Field. Since derivatives are
not available for this expression, finite differences are used in the CG
algorithm to approximate the first derivative. The approach is evaluated using
a number of publicly available images, where ground truth is known. The Dice
Coefficient is used as an objective criterion to measure the quality of
segmentation. The results show that the proposed CG approach compares favorably
with other variants of Hidden Markov Random Field segmentation algorithms.

also plays an important role in urban planning and environmental management.
With the rapidly technical development of remote sensing, monitoring urban
impervious surface via high spatial resolution (HSR) images has attracted
unprecedented attention recently. Traditional multi-classes models are
inefficient for impervious surface extraction because it requires labeling all
needed and unneeded classes that occur in the image exhaustively. Therefore, we
need to find a reliable one-class model to classify one specific land cover
type without labeling other classes. In this study, we investigate several
one-class classifiers, such as Presence and Background Learning (PBL), Positive
Unlabeled Learning (PUL), OCSVM, BSVM and MAXENT, to extract urban impervious
surface area using high spatial resolution imagery of GF-1, China's new
generation of high spatial remote sensing satellite, and evaluate the
classification accuracy based on artificial interpretation results. Compared to
traditional multi-classes classifiers (ANN and SVM), the experimental results
indicate that PBL and PUL provide higher classification accuracy, which is
similar to the accuracy provided by ANN model. Meanwhile, PBL and PUL
outperforms OCSVM, BSVM, MAXENT and SVM models. Hence, the one-class
classifiers only need a small set of specific samples to train models without
losing predictive accuracy, which is supposed to gain more attention on urban
impervious surface extraction or other one specific land cover type.

abstraction, called $k$-BO-Broadcast, which restricts the disagreement on the

beings to recognize, understand and react to emotions, attitudes and beliefs of
others. The lack of an operational definition of empathy makes it difficult to
measure it. In this paper, we address two related problems in automatic
affective behavior analysis: the design of the annotation protocol and the
automatic recognition of empathy from spoken conversations. We propose and
evaluate an annotation scheme for empathy inspired by the modal model of
emotions. The annotation scheme was evaluated on a corpus of real-life, dyadic
spoken conversations. In the context of behavioral analysis, we designed an
automatic segmentation and classification system for empathy. Given the
different speech and language levels of representation where empathy may be
communicated, we investigated features derived from the lexical and acoustic
spaces. The feature development process was designed to support both the fusion
and automatic selection of relevant features from high dimensional space. The
automatic classification system was evaluated on call center conversations
where it showed significantly better performance than the baseline.

problems of $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ distributed algorithms. In a recent enlightening
revelation, Chang and Pettie [arXiv 1704.06297] showed that any LCL (on bounded
degree graphs) that has an $o(\log n)$-round randomized algorithm can be solved
in $T_{LLL}(n)$ rounds, which is the randomized complexity of solving (a
relaxed variant of) the Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) on bounded degree $n$-node
graphs. Currently, the best known upper bound on $T_{LLL}(n)$ is $O(\log n)$,
by Chung, Pettie, and Su [PODC'14], while the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(\log\log n)$, by Brandt et al. [STOC'16]. Chang and Pettie conjectured
that there should be an $O(\log\log n)$-round algorithm.
  Making the first step of progress towards this conjecture, and providing a
significant improvement on the algorithm of Chung et al. [PODC'14], we prove
that $T_{LLL}(n)= 2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$. Thus, any $o(\log n)$-round
randomized distributed algorithm for any LCL problem on bounded degree graphs
can be automatically sped up to run in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$ rounds.
  Using this improvement and a number of other ideas, we also improve the
complexity of a number of graph coloring problems (in arbitrary degree graphs)
from the $O(\log n)$-round results of Chung, Pettie and Su [PODC'14] to
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$. These problems include defective coloring, frugal
coloring, and list vertex-coloring.

curvature equal to $K \geq 0$. This question generated a considerable amount of
remarkable results in the last few decades. Motivated by these developments
here we study the question of determining a $K$-surface when only part of its
boundary is fixed, and in addition the surface hits a given manifold at some
fixed angle. While this general setting is out of reach for us at the present,
we settle a model case of the problem, which in its analytic formulation
reduces to a Bernoulli type free boundary problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere
equation. We study both the cases of 0-curvature and of positive curvature. The
formulation of the free boundary condition and its regularity are the most
delicate and challenging questions addressed in this work. In this regard we
introduce a notion of a Blaschke extension of a solution which might be of
independent interest.
  The problem we study can also be interpreted as the Alt-Caffarelli problem
for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. Moreover, it also relates to the problem of
isometric embedding of a positive metric on the annulus with partially

simple analytical functions is of fundamental importance for understanding and
modeling their optical properties. Quite generally, the permittivity can be
treated in the complex frequency plane as an analytic function having a
countable number of simple poles which determine the dispersion of the
permittivity, with the pole weights corresponding to generalized conductivities
of the medium at these resonances. The resulting Drude-Lorentz model separates
the poles at frequencies with zero real part (Ohm's law and Drude poles) from
poles with finite real part (Lorentz poles). To find the parameters of such an
analytic function, we minimize the error weighted deviation between the model
and measured values of the permittivity. We show examples of such optimizations
for various semiconductors (Si, GaAs and Ge), for different frequency ranges
and up to five pairs of Lorentz poles accounted for in the model.

used by aggregators that aim at selling the aggregated surplus of production of
the prosumers they control. We rely on real weather data sampled across

geographical correlations among the agents while preserving the diversity due

proposed graph based algorithm takes the underlying correlation structure of
the agents into account and outputs coalitions with both high productivity and

more functionality per area becomes more and more challenging. Here we propose
a novel strategy to increase the functionality-per-area by exploiting the modal
properties of a waveguide system. With such approach the design of a
mode-multiplexed nanophotonic modulator relying on the mode-selective
absorption of a patterned Indium-Tin-Oxide is proposed. Full-wave simulations
of a device operating at the telecom wavelength of 1550nm show that two modes
can be independently modulated, while maintaining performances in line with
conventional single-mode ITO modulators reported in the recent literature. The
proposed design principles can pave the way to a novel class of
mode-multiplexed compact photonic devices able to effectively multiply the
functionality-per-area in integrated photonic systems.

generator and a microwave power receiver separated by some distance. To realize
efficient power transfer, the system is typically brought to resonance, and the
coupled-antenna mode is optimized to reduce radiation into the surrounding
space. In this scheme, any modification of the receiver position or of its
electromagnetic properties results in the necessity of dynamically tuning the
whole system to restore the resonant matching condition. It implies poor
robustness to the receiver location and load impedance, as well as additional
energy consumption in the control network. In this study, we introduce a new
paradigm for wireless power delivery based on which the whole system, including
transmitter and receiver and the space in between, forms a unified microwave
power generator. In our proposed scenario the load itself becomes part of the
generator. Microwave oscillations are created directly at the receiver
location, eliminating the need for dynamical tuning of the system within the
range of the self-oscillation regime. The proposed concept has relevant
connections with the recent interest in parity-time symmetric systems, in which
balanced loss and gain distributions enable unusual electromagnetic responses.

waves in a two-dimensional elastic hexagonal lattice. The lattice is designed
to feature K point Dirac cones that are well separated from the other numerous
elastic wave modes characterizing this continuous structure. We exploit the
arrangement of localized masses at the nodes to break mirror symmetry at the
unit cell level, which opens a frequency bandgap. This produces a non-trivial
band structure that supports topologically protected edge states along the
interface between two realizations of the lattice obtained through mirror
symmetry. Detailed numerical models support the investigations of the
occurrence of the edge states, while their existence is verified through
full-field experimental measurements. The test results show the confinement of
the topologically protected edge states along pre-defined interfaces and
illustrate the lack of significant backscattering at sharp corners. Experiments
conducted on a trivial waveguide in an otherwise uniformly periodic lattice
reveal the inability of a perturbation to propagate and its sensitivity to
backscattering, which suggests the superior waveguiding performance of the
class of non-trivial interfaces investigated herein.
