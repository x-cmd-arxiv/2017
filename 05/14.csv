$\alpha $ be a continuous action of $G$ on a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$
by trace-preserving automorphisms. We then show that the operators defined by

p<\infty $. Consequently, the sequence $(A_{n}x)_{n\geq 1}$ converges almost
uniformly for $x\in L_{p}(\mathcal{M})$ for $1\leq p<\infty $. Also, we
establish the noncommutative maximal and individual ergodic theorems associated
with more general doubling conditions, and we prove the corresponding results
for general actions on one fixed noncommutative $L_{p}$-space which are beyond
the class of Dunford-Schwartz operators considered previously by Junge and Xu.
As key ingredients, we also obtain the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality on
metric spaces with doubling measures in the operator-valued setting. After the
groundbreaking work of Junge and Xu on the noncommutative Dunford-Schwartz
maximal ergodic inequalities, this is the first time that more general maximal
inequalities are proved beyond Junge and Xu's setting. Our approach is based on
quantum probabilistic methods as well as random walk theory.

characterizing the local environment of a particle with the amplitude of its
short time vibrational motion, as determined by segmenting in cages and jumps
the particle trajectories. Both simulations of supercooled liquids and
experiments on colloidal suspensions show that particles in large cages are
likely to jump after a small time-lag, and that, on average, the cage enlarges
shortly before the particle jumps. At large time-lags, the cage has essentially
a constant value, which is smaller for longer-lasting cages. Finally, we
clarify how this coupling between cage size and duration controls the average

this letter we explore the possibility that a broad spectrum of PBH is formed
in models of Critical Higgs Inflation (CHI), where the near-inflection point is
related to the critical value of the RGE running of both the Higgs
self-coupling $\lambda(\mu)$ and its non-minimal coupling to gravity
$\xi(\mu)$. We show that, for a wide range of model parameters, a
half-domed-shaped peak in the matter spectrum arises at sufficiently small
scales that it passes all the constraints from large scale structure
observations. The predicted cosmic microwave background spectrum at large
scales is in agreement with Planck 2015 data, and has a relatively large
tensor-to-scalar ratio that may soon be detected by B-mode polarization
experiments. Moreover, the wide peak in the power spectrum gives an
approximately lognormal PBH distribution in the range of masses $0.01 -
100\,M_\odot$, which could explain the LIGO merger events, while passing all
present PBH observational constraints. The stochastic background of
gravitational waves coming from the unresolved black-hole-binary mergers could
also be detected by LISA or PTA. Furthermore, the parameters of the CHI model
are consistent, within $2\sigma$, with the measured Higgs parameters at the LHC
and their running. Future measurements of the PBH mass spectrum could allow us
to obtain complementary information about the Higgs couplings at energies well
above the EW scale, and thus constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model.

\delta}, n^{-1/2 + \delta} \right)$, for any $\delta > 0$. As an important
byproduct, our analysis sheds light into the performance of the classical
collaborative filtering algorithm for matrix completion, which has been widely
utilized in practice. Experiments with the MovieLens and Netflix datasets
suggest that our algorithm provides a principled improvement over basic
collaborative filtering and is competitive with matrix factorization methods.
Our algorithm has a natural extension to the setting of tensor completion via
flattening the tensor to matrix. When applied to the setting of image
in-painting, which is a $3$-order tensor, we find that our approach is
competitive with respect to state-of-art tensor completion algorithms across
benchmark images.

  title",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In numerical time-integration with implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods, a
within-step adaptable decomposition called residual balanced decomposition is
introduced. With this decomposition, the requirement of a small enough residual
in the iterative solver can be removed, consequently, this allows to exchange
stability for efficiency. This decomposition transfers any residual occurring
in the implicit equation of the implicit-step into the explicit part of the
decomposition. By balancing the residual, the accuracy of the local truncation
error of the time-stepping method becomes independent from the accuracy by
which the implicit equation is solved. In order to balance the residual, the
original IMEX decomposition is adjusted after the iterative solver has been
stopped. For this to work, the traditional IMEX time-stepping algorithm needs
to be changed. We call this new method the shortcut-IMEX (SIMEX). SIMEX can
gain computational efficiency by exploring the trade-off between the
computational effort placed in solving the implicit equation and the size of
the numerically stable time-step. Typically, increasing the number of solver
iterations increases the largest stable step-size. Both multi-step and
Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are suitable for use with SIMEX. Here, we show the
efficiency of a SIMEX-RK method in overcoming parabolic stiffness by applying
it to a nonlinear reaction-advection-diffusion equation. In order to define a
stability region for SIMEX, a region in the complex plane is depicted by
applying SIMEX to a suitable PDE model containing diffusion and dispersion. A
myriad of stability regions can be reached by changing the RK tableau and the
solver.

that tends to diverge for large membranes. The latter three methods remedy this
infrared problem and give results that are finite in the limit of an infinite

the latter three methods give results that are in good agreement with each

lowest-order golden rule rate. Lastly, we find that the SPR sticking rate
decreases slowly to zero with increasing membrane size, while both the NCA and

the sticking rate can be sensitive to the effects of soft-phonon emission for
large membranes.

ultraviolet and a slow change of the dimension in the infrared. This sole

multifractional correction to lengths with the types of Planckian uncertainty
for distance and time measurements that was reported in studies combining
quantum mechanics and general relativity heuristically. This allows us to fix
two free parameters of the theory and leads, in one of the scenarios we
contemplate, to a value of the ultraviolet dimension which had already found
support in other quantum-gravity analyses. We also formalize a picture such
that fuzziness originates from a fundamental discrete scale invariance at short
scales and corresponds to a stochastic spacetime geometry.

in the CONGEST-model [Censor-Hillel et al. 2016]. We present one-sided error
testing algorithms in the general graph model.
  We first describe a general procedure for converting $\epsilon$-testers with
a number of rounds $f(D)$, where $D$ denotes the diameter of the graph, to
$O((\log n)/\epsilon)+f((\log n)/\epsilon)$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of
processors of the network. We then apply this procedure to obtain an optimal
tester, in terms of $n$, for testing bipartiteness, whose round complexity is
$O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$, which improves over the $poly(\epsilon^{-1} \log
n)$-round algorithm by Censor-Hillel et al. (DISC 2016). Moreover, for
cycle-freeness, we obtain a \emph{corrector} of the graph that locally corrects
the graph so that the corrected graph is acyclic. Note that, unlike a tester, a
corrector needs to mend the graph in many places in the case that the graph is
far from having the property.
  In the second part of the paper we design algorithms for testing whether the
network is $H$-free for any connected $H$ of size up to four with round
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. This improves over the
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$-round algorithms for testing triangle freeness by
Censor-Hillel et al. (DISC 2016) and for testing excluded graphs of size $4$ by
Fraigniaud et al. (DISC 2016).
  In the last part we generalize the global tester by Iwama and Yoshida (ITCS

order $k$. We then show how to simulate this algorithm in the CONGEST-model in
$O(k^{k^2+1}\cdot\epsilon^{-k})$ rounds.

within one sub-virial filamentary clump (the G9.62 clump) in the G9.62+0.19

evolutionary stages, from starless core phase to UC H{\sc ii} region phase.
Three dense cores (MM6, MM7/G, MM8/F) are associated with outflows. The
mass-velocity diagrams of outflows associated with MM7/G and MM8/F can be well
fitted with broken power laws. The mass-velocity diagram of SiO outflow
associated with MM8/F breaks much earlier than other outflow tracers (e.g., CO,
SO, CS, HCN), suggesting that SiO traces newly shocked gas, while the other
molecular lines (e.g., CO, SO, CS, HCN) mainly trace the ambient gas
continuously entrained by outflow jets. Five cores (MM1, MM3, MM5, MM9, MM10)
are massive starless core candidates whose masses are estimated to be larger

the expanding H{\sc ii} regions (""B"" \& ""C"") to the west may have great impact
on the G9.62 clump through compressing it into a filament and inducing core
collapse successively, leading to sequential star formation. Our findings
suggest that stellar feedback from H{\sc ii} regions may enhance the star
formation efficiency and suppress the low-mass star formation in adjacent
pre-existing massive clumps.

attracting attention in various applications. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
is a data-driven algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis, and several variants
with a wide range of applications have been proposed. However, popular
implementations of DMD suffer from observation noise on random dynamical
systems and generate an inaccurate estimation of the spectra of the stochastic
Koopman operator. In this paper, we propose subspace DMD as an algorithm for
the Koopman analysis of random dynamical systems with observation noise.
Subspace DMD first computes the orthogonal projection of future snapshots to
the space of past snapshots and then estimates the spectra of a linear model,
and its output converges to the spectra of the stochastic Koopman operator
under standard assumptions. We investigate the empirical performance of

system with low-resolution ADCs at both the relay and destinations. The channel
state information (CSI) at the relay is obtained via pilot training, which is
then utilized to perform simple maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio
transmission processing by the relay. Also, it is assumed that the destinations
use statistical CSI to decode the transmitted signals. Exact and approximated
closed-form expressions for the achievable sum rate are presented, which enable
the efficient evaluation of the impact of key system parameters on the system
performance. In addition, optimal relay power allocation scheme is studied, and
power scaling law is characterized. It is found that, with only low-resolution
ADCs at the relay, increasing the number of relay antennas is an effective
method to compensate for the rate loss caused by coarse quantization. However,
it becomes ineffective to handle the detrimental effect of low-resolution ADCs
at the destination. Moreover, it is shown that deploying massive relay antenna
arrays can still bring significant power savings, i.e., the transmit power of
each source can be cut down proportional to $1/M$ to maintain a constant rate,
where $M$ is the number of relay antennas.

There are two special coordinate representations of this root system in which

naturally associated infinite reflection group $H^{\infty}$, which we prove is
of index $2$ in the orthogonal group $O(4,\mathcal R)$. The paper makes
extensive use of the quaternions over $\mathcal R$ and leads to highly
structured discretized filtration of $SU(2)$. We use this to offer a simple and

required using the repeated actions of just five fixed reflections, a process

availability of commodity commercial VR products, such as the Head Mounted

applications of virtual reality that has been recently adopted is streaming
sports events. For instance, the last olympics held in Rio De Janeiro was
streamed over the Internet for users to view on VR headsets or using 360 video

bandwidth and the amount of data required to transmit 360 videos. While 360
video demands high bandwidth, at any time instant users are only viewing a
small portion of the video according to the HMD field of view (FOV). Many
approaches have been proposed in the literature such as proposing new
representations (e.g. pyramid and offset-cubemap) and tiling the video and
streaming the tiles currently being viewed. In this paper, we propose a tiled
streaming framework, where we provide a degrading quality model similar to the
state-of-the-art offset-cubemap while minimizing its storage requirements at
the server side. We conduct objective studies showing the effectiveness of our
approach providing smooth degradation of quality from the user FOV to the back
of the 360 space. In addition, we conduct subjective studies showing that users
tend to prefer our proposed scheme over offset-cubemap in low bandwidth
connections, and they don't feel difference for higher bandwidth connections.
That is, we achieve better perceived quality with huge storage savings up to
670%.

recovering 3D structure of a single non-rigid/deforming object. To handle the
real world challenging multiple deforming objects scenarios, existing methods
either pre-segment different objects in the scene or treat multiple non-rigid
objects as a whole to obtain the 3D non-rigid reconstruction. However, these
methods fail to exploit the inherent structure in the problem as the solution
of segmentation and the solution of reconstruction could not benefit each
other. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to jointly segment and
reconstruct multiple non-rigid objects. To compactly represent complex
multi-body non-rigid scenes, we propose to exploit the structure of the scenes
along both temporal direction and spatial direction, thus achieving a
spatio-temporal representation. Specifically, we represent the 3D non-rigid
deformations as lying in a union of subspaces along the temporal direction and
represent the 3D trajectories as lying in the union of subspaces along the
spatial direction. This spatio-temporal representation not only provides
competitive 3D reconstruction but also outputs robust segmentation of multiple
non-rigid objects. The resultant optimization problem is solved efficiently
using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Extensive
experimental results on both synthetic and real multi-body NRSfM datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared with

computer-assisted approaches that examine pre-specified features, whether

In this paper, we have developed a technique for automated pattern analysis
that can fully determine the relationship between brain structure and
observable phenotype without requiring any a priori features. Our technique,
called transport-based morphometry (TBM), is an image transformation that maps
brain images losslessly to a domain where they become much more separable. The
new approach is validated on structural brain images of healthy older adult
subjects where even linear models for discrimination, regression, and blind
source separation enable TBM to independently discover the characteristic
changes of aging and highlight potential mechanisms by which aerobic fitness
may mediate brain health later in life. TBM is a generative approach that can
provide visualization of physically meaningful shifts in tissue distribution
through inverse transformation. The proposed framework is a powerful technique
that can potentially elucidate genotype-structural-behavioral associations in
myriad diseases.

antiferromagnetically below (T_N=) 22 K, shows glassy characteristics at lower
temperatures (<15K), thus characterizing this compound as a re-entrant
spin-glass. The data reveal that glassy phase is quite complex and is of a
cluster type. Since the glassy behavior was not seen for the Gd analogue in the
past literature, this finding for the Tb compound emphasizes that this kagome
family could provide an opportunity to explore the role of higher order (such
as quadrupole) in bringing out magnetic frustration. Additional findings
reported here for this compound are: (i) The temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility and electrical resistivity in the range 12 - 20 K are found to
be hysteretic leading to a magnetic phase in this temperature range, mimicking
disorder-induced first-order magnetic phase-transition. (ii) Features
attributable to an interesting magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in the

to show that the limit points of the sequence generated by APGnc are critical

establish the linear and sub-linear convergence rates of the function value

the K$^0_{\rm S}$ and K$^{\rm \pm}$ particles. The analysis was performed on
the data from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV measured by the
ALICE experiment. The observed femtoscopic correlations are consistent with
final-state interactions proceeding via the $a_0(980)$ resonance. The extracted
kaon source radius and correlation strength parameters for K$^0_{\rm S}$K$^{\rm

K$^0_{\rm S}$K$^{\rm +}$. Comparing the results of the present study with those
from published identical-kaon femtoscopic studies by ALICE, mass and coupling
parameters for the $a_0$ resonance are constrained. Our results are also
compatible with the interpretation of the $a_0$ having a tetraquark structure
over that of a diquark.

from a second image. For example it can perform tasks like ""putting exactly
those eyeglasses from image A on the nose of the person in image B"". Usage of
exemplar images allows more precise specification of desired modifications and
improves the diversity of conditional image generation. However, previous
methods that rely on feature space operations, require paired data and/or
appearance models for training or disentangling objects from background. In
this work, we propose a model that can learn object transfiguration from two
unpaired sets of images: one set containing images that ""have"" that kind of
object, and the other set being the opposite, with the mild constraint that the
objects be located approximately at the same place. For example, the training
data can be one set of reference face images that have eyeglasses, and another
set of images that have not, both of which spatially aligned by face landmarks.
Despite the weak 0/1 labels, our model can learn an ""eyeglasses"" subspace that
contain multiple representatives of different types of glasses. Consequently,
we can perform fine-grained control of generated images, like swapping the
glasses in two images by swapping the projected components in the ""eyeglasses""
subspace, to create novel images of people wearing eyeglasses.
  Overall, our deterministic generative model learns disentangled attribute
subspaces from weakly labeled data by adversarial training. Experiments on
CelebA and Multi-PIE datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model
on real world data, in generating images with specified eyeglasses, smiling,
hair styles, and lighting conditions etc. The code is available online.

individual data plan subscribers to operate as Wi-Fi providers, offering
Internet access. However, the model of a monthly flat service fee charged by
ISP to establishment or individual WFPs offers very little incentives for ISP
to provide additional bandwidth to WFPs customers. Thus, these users may
experience insufficient bandwidth when there is high demand for bandwidth. In
addition, ISP even discourages individual subscribers to provide Internet
access through their smartphone because such practices may cause market
saturation. To address this, in this paper we propose a dynamic pricing scheme

establishment and individual Wi-Fi providers offering Internet access to users.
Our revenue sharing model is based on Shapley value mechanism. Importantly, our
proposed revenue sharing mechanism captures the power negotiation between ISP
and Wi-Fi providers, and how shifts in the power balance between the two
entities influence revenue division. Specifically, the model assures that the
party who contributes more receives a higher portion of the revenue. In
addition to that, the division of revenue eventually converges to a percentage
value.

in the unitary gauge for the $H \to \gamma \gamma$ process via one W loop is
repeated, but without the specific choice of the independent loop momentum for
the Feynman diagrams. This is based on the original 'Dyson scheme' provided in
Dyson's classical paper. I.e., the original integrations on all propagator
momenta are kept, not expressed by the specified independent loop momentum.
Correspondingly, the 4-dimension $\delta$ function at each vertex in which the
4-momentum conservation is embedded, is retained. Together with the Ward
identity of the W-W-photon vertex, the 4-momentum conservation of each vertex
guarantee the cancellation of all divergent integrals worse than logarithmic
without any uncertainty or ambiguity, with any shift of integrated momentum
eschewed. The calculation is in 4-dimension Minkowski phase space and without
any help of regularization. The resulting integrals are to the most
logarithmically divergent, hence is invariant for various setting of the
independent loop momentum and any of its shift. At last the logarithmically
divergent symmetric (tensor) integration is determined by the boundary
condition at infinity in momentum space inherent of the free Feynman
propagator, and the gauge (both $SU(2)\times U_Y(1)$ and $U_{em}(1)$) invariant
finite result can be obtained without the introduction of the 'Dyson
subtraction'. The physical boundary conditions at infinity of phase space can
make sense in many problems.

here, the ICC was greater during the standing protocol, however, it was
significantly greater (Fisher's Z-test) for Mx (p < 0.03), Sx (p<0.003)$ and Dx

flexible hybrid beamforming design that can achieve performance close to
singular value decomposition (SVD) based digital beamforming with single user
case. As a starting point, assuming the use of a codebook with infinite
precision, we apply transposes of antenna array response matrices as analog
beam-formers at the BS and the UE sides. The resulting effective chan-nel

be able to provide a maximal achievable rate very close to SVD based digital

analyzed for practical analog beamformer design. A closed-form derivation is
obtained for mapping rate loss to the number of antennas, code-book sizes and
the received SNR. The analysis shows that in or-der to achieve performance
comparable to analog beamforming with infinite precision, the codebook size
should be at least larger than the number of implemented antennas. Therefore,
the pro-posed analog beamforming approach can be designed inde-pendently
without taking digital beamforming into account. Such an approach can lead to
the development of flexible hybrid beam-forming architectures that could adapt
to a changing propagation environment via agile analog beam selection and
maximize spatial multiplexing gain via proper digital beamformer design.

baseline data communication link is established via traditional analog
beamforming at both the BS and UE. If an extra RF chain is available at the UE,
it can continue to probe the propagation environment at the same frequencies.
In case the environment is favorable and system resources allow, a secondary
data communication link is established to enable multi-stream transmission. In
principle, the secondary link could be served by the same BS and/or one or
several other BS(s). To initialize the secondary data communication link, a
parallel beam search scheme is proposed, which helps the UE/BS to find a
suitable beam pair with given optimization criteria without interrupting the

beamforming becomes an add-on feature that can be easily switched on over an
analog beamforming enabled system without interrupting its operation whenever

the classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and vary

parameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming
the general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the

well-studied subject, spanning several decades of research. However, the
behavior of fields in the black hole interior spacetime, has only relatively
recently begun receiving some attention from the research community. In this
paper, we numerically study the late-time evolution of scalar fields in both
Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, including the black hole interior. We
recover the expected late-time power-law ""tails"" on the exterior (null
infinity, time-like infinity and the horizon). In the interior region, we find
an interesting oscillatory behavior that is characterized by the multipole
index $\ell$ of the scalar field. In addition, we also study the extremal Kerr
case and find strong indications of an instability developing at the horizon.

and with polygonal cross section. We investigate the implications of this
geometry on Majorana states expected in the presence of proximity-induced
superconductivity and an external magnetic field. A typical prismatic nanowire
has a hexagonal profile, but square and triangular shapes can also be obtained.
The low-energy states are localized at the corners of the cross section, i.e.
along the prism edges, and are separated by a gap from higher energy states
localized on the sides. The corner localization depends on the details of the
shell geometry, i.e. thickness, diameter, and sharpness of the corners. We
study systematically the low-energy spectrum of prismatic shells using
numerical methods and derive the topological phase diagram as a function of
magnetic field and chemical potential for triangular, square, and hexagonal
geometries. A strong corner localization enhances the stability of Majorana
modes to various perturbations, including the orbital effect of the magnetic
field, whereas a weaker localization favorizes orbital effects and reduces the
critical magnetic field. The prismatic geometry allows the Majorana zero-energy
modes to be accompanied by low-energy states, which we call pseudo Majorana,
and which converge to real Majoranas in the limit of small shell thickness. We
include the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a phenomenological manner, assuming a
radial electric field across the shell.

of inter-area oscillations which significantly reduces the power transfer
capability. Advances in Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) makes it possible
to use the information from geographical distant location to improve power
system dynamics and performances. A speed deviation based Wide-Area Power
System Stabilizer (WAPSS) is known to be effective in damping inter-area modes.
However, the involvement of wide-area signals gives rise to the problem of
time-delay, which may degrade the system performance. In general, time-stamped
synchronized signals from Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) are used for WAPSS, in
which delays are introduced in both local and remote signals. One can opt for a
feedback of remote signal only from PDC and uses the local signal as it is
available, without time synchronization. This paper utilizes configurations of
time-matched synchronized and nonsychronized feedback and provides the
guidelines to design the controller. The controllers are synthesized using
$H_\infty$ control with regional pole placement for ensuring adequate dynamic
performance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two power
system models have been used for the simulations. It is shown that the
controllers designed based on the nonsynchronized signals are more robust to
time time delay variations than the controllers using synchronized signal.

strong non-sinusoidal variability of its longitudinal magnetic field. This
behaviour was previously interpreted as the signature of an exceptionally
strong, quadrupole-dominated surface magnetic field geometry. We studied the
magnetic field structure and chemical abundance distributions of HR5624 with
the aim to verify the unusual quadrupolar nature of its magnetic field and to
investigate correlations between the field topology and chemical spots. We
analysed high resolution, time series Stokes parameter spectra of HR5624 with
the help of a magnetic Doppler imaging inversion code based on detailed
polarised radiative transfer modelling of the line profiles. Our magnetic
Doppler inversions reveal that the field structure of HR5624 is considerably
simpler and the field strength is much lower than proposed by previous studies.
We find a maximum local field strength of 12 kG and a mean field strength of 4
kG. Our model implies that overall large-scale field topology of HR5624 is
better described as a distorted, asymmetric dipole. The chemical abundance maps
of Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Nd obtained in our study are characterised by
large-scale, high-contrast abundance patterns. These structures correlate
weakly with the magnetic field geometry and show no distinct element
concentrations in the horizontal field regions predicted by theoretical atomic
diffusion calculations. We conclude that the surface magnetic field topology of
HR5624 is not as unusual as previously proposed. Considering these results
together with other recent magnetic mapping analyses of early-type stars
suggests that predominantly quadrupolar magnetic field topologies, invoked to
be present in a significant number of stars, probably do not exist in real
stars.

operation modes - spectral and imaging ones. The key element of such instrument
is a dispersive and filtering unit consisting of two narrowband volume-phase
holographic gratings. Each of them provides high diffraction efficiency in a
relatively narrow spectral range of a few tens of nanometers. Besides, the
position of this working band is highly dependent on the angle of incidence. So
we propose to use a couple of such gratings to implement the two operational
modes. The gratings are mounted in a collimated beam one after another. In the
spectroscopic mode the gratings are turned on such angle that the diffraction
efficiency curves coincide, thus the beams diffracted on the first grating are
diffracted twice on the second one and a high-dispersion spectrum in a narrow
range is formed. If the collimating and camera lenses are corrected for a wide
field it is possible to use a long slit and register the spectra from its
different points separately. In the imaging mode the gratings are turned to
such angle that the efficiency curves intersect in a very narrow wavelength
range. So the beams diffracted on the first grating are filtered out by the
second one except of the spectral component, which forms the image. In this
case the instrument works without slit diaphragm on the entrance. We provide an
example design to illustrate the proposed concept. This optical scheme works in
the region around 656 nm with F/# of 6.3. In the spectroscopic mode it provides
a spectrum for the region from 641 to 671 nm with reciprocal linear dispersion
of 1.4 nm/mm and the spectral resolving power higher than 14000. In the imaging
mode it covers linear 12mm x 12mm field of view with spatial resolution of

these consequences, worldwide mapping of skyglow for all weather conditions is

to be studied, as clouds can extend the reach of skyglow into remote areas not
affected by light pollution on clear nights. Here we use commercial digital
single lens reflex cameras with fisheye lenses for all-sky photometry. We track
the reach of skyglow from a peri-urban into a remote area on a clear and a
partly cloudy night by performing transects from the Spanish town of Balaguer
towards Montsec Astronomical Park. From one single all-sky image, we extract
zenith luminance, horizontal and scalar illuminance. While zenith luminance
reaches near-natural levels at 5km distance from the town on the clear night,
similar levels are only reached at 27km on the partly cloudy night. Our results
show the dramatic increase of the reach of skyglow even for moderate cloud
coverage at this site. The powerful and easy-to-use method promises to be
widely applicable for studies of ecological light pollution on a global scale

promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node
classification and entity retrieval. However, most existing methods focused
only on leveraging network structure. For social networks, besides the network
structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user
profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks. These
rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect,
exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we
explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve
network embedding. We propose a generic Social Network Embedding framework
(SNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by
preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the
structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute
proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we
conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks. Compared to
the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, SNE can learn more
informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link
prediction and node classification. Specifically, SNE significantly outperforms
node2vec with an 8.2% relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a
12.7% gain on the node classification task.

constraints often make the pricing method less effective, because they often
prevent solutions from containing highly evaluated variables together. To
overcome this problem, we develop heuristic algorithms to reduce the size of

2-flip neighborhood local search algorithm that reduces the number of

introduce a path relinking method that generates new solutions by combining two

of promising variables properly and performs quite effectively even for

calculated for various values of ratio of radii (\b{eta}). The effect of the
design parameters including ring radius, electrostatic voltage and quality
factor on the dynamic responses, is discussed. The results of present study can
be used in the design of novel MEMS resonators, RF filters and channelizers.

films deposited on Si (100) substrate using DC reactive magnetron sputtering as
a function of growth temperature (Ts, 35 to 600 C). Evolution of optical
properties with Ts is investigated by Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE)
technique. Thickness and roughness of these films are determined from the
regression analysis of SE data, which are corroborated using TEM and AFM
technique. Highly a-axis oriented AlN film grown at 400 C, exhibits high n and
low k at 210 nm (deep-UV region) with a small birefringence and dichroism near
to band edge, which can be used in isotropic deep UV optoelectronic device
applications. All these AlN films exhibit transparent nature from near-infrared
(NIR) to 354 nm, where optical band gap energies vary between 5.7 to 6.1 eV.

been estimated for computers of different kinds.
  In this paper we show that, when designing new processors, the manufacturers
change the parameters that affect the computer capacity. This allows us to
predict the values of parameters of future processors. As the main example we
use Intel processors, due to the accessibility of detailed description of all
their technical characteristics.

  fields",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interaction of two electrons and two positrons in the field of two strong
pulsed laser waves outside the framework of the dipole approximation (with an
accuracy of relativistic corrections ) has been studied theoretically. The
possibility of significant asymmetry in the interactions of particles and
antiparticles in the external laser fields is shown. This asymmetry of
interactions essentially depends on the magnitude and sign of the phase shifts
of the waves relative to each other, and also on the intensities of the waves.
The ranges of phase shifts and field intensities in which the interaction of
electrons and positrons have qualitatively different character from anomalous
repulsion to attraction are determined.

active area of research over the last two decades. Availability of extremely
fast and parallel architecture of computing and sophisticated algorithms has
made it possible to extract, store, process and analyze high volume stock
market time series data very efficiently. In this paper, we have used time
series data of the two sectors of the Indian economy: Information Technology
and Capital Goods for the period January 2009 till April 2016 and have studied
the relationships of these two time series with the time series of DJIA index,
NIFTY index and the US Dollar to Indian Rupee exchange rate. We establish by
graphical and statistical tests that while the IT sector of India has a strong
association with DJIA index and the Dollar to Rupee exchange rate, the Indian
CG sector exhibits a strong association with the NIFTY index. We contend that
these observations corroborate our hypotheses that the Indian IT sector is
strongly coupled with the world economy whereas the CG sector of India reflects
internal economic growth of India. We also present several models of regression
between the time series which exhibit strong association among them. The
effectiveness of these models have been demonstrated by very low values of
their forecasting errors.

whether the style proclaimed for a mutual fund actually matches with the fund
composition. We have applied our proposed framework on eight well known mutual
funds of varying styles in the Indian financial market to check the consistency
between their fund style and actual fund composition, and have obtained
extensive results from our experiments. A detailed analysis of the results has
shown that while in majority of the cases the actual allocations of funds are
consistent with the corresponding fund styles, there have been some notable
deviations too.

functions by producing an electrical response. We recorded electrical signals
from different plants by exposing them to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Ozone (O3)

pre-processing techniques such as filtering and drift removal, we extracted few
statistical features from the acquired plant electrical signals. Using these
features, combined with different classification algorithms, we used a decision
tree based multi-class classification strategy to identify the three different
external chemical stimuli. We here present our exploration to obtain the
optimum set of ranked feature and classifier combination that can separate a
particular chemical stimulus from the incoming stream of plant electrical
signals. The paper also reports an exhaustive comparison of similar feature
based classification using the filtered and the raw plant signals, containing
the high frequency stochastic part and also the low frequency trends present in
it, as two different cases for feature extraction. The work, presented in this
paper opens up new possibilities for using plant electrical signals to monitor
and detect other environmental stimuli apart from NaCl, O3 and H2SO4 in future.
