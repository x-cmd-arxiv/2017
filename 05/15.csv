system requires at least a unit of energy $k_B T \ln 2$ to be dissipated. In
return, the blank bit may possibly be utilized to extract usable work of the
amount $k_B T \ln 2$, in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics. While
in principle any collection of spins can be utilized as information storage,
work extraction by utilizing this resource in principle requires specialized
engines that are capable of using this resource. In this work, we focus on heat
and charge transport in a quantum spin Hall device in the presence of a spin
bath. We show how a properly initialized nuclear spin subsystem can be used as
a memory resource for a Maxwell's Demon to harvest available heat energy from
the reservoirs to induce charge current that can power an external electrical
load. We also show how to initialize the nuclear spin subsystem using applied
bias currents which necessarily dissipate energy, hence demonstrating
Landauer's principle. This provides an alternative method of ""energy storage""
in an all-electrical device. We finally propose a realistic setup to
experimentally observe a Landauer erasure/work extraction cycle.

designs to mitigate the effects of process variations and aging. Located on
clock paths to flip-flops, these tuning elements can be configured through the
scan chain so that clock skews to these flip-flops can be adjusted after man-

enabled by the clock tuning elements, higher yield and enhanced robustness can
be achieved. These benefits are, nonetheless, attained by increasing die area
due to the inserted clock tuning elements. For balancing performance
improvement and area cost, an efficient timing analysis algorithm is needed to
evaluate the performance of such a circuit. So far this evaluation is only
possible by Monte Carlo simulation which is very timing- consuming. In this
paper, we propose an alternative method using graph transformation, which
computes a parametric minimum clock period and is more than 10 4 times faster

because process variations cause only some chips to be really slow, while other
chips can easily meet given timing specifications. To reduce this pessimism, we
can reserve less timing margin and tune failed chips after manufacturing with
clock buffers to make them meet timing specifications. With this post-silicon
clock tuning, critical paths can be balanced with neighboring paths in each
chip specifically to counter the effect of process variations. Consequently,
chips with timing failures can be rescued and the yield can thus be improved.
This is specially useful in high- performance designs, e.g., high-end CPUs,

In this paper, we propose a method to determine where to insert post-silicon
tuning buffers during the design phase to improve the overall profit with clock

iteratively and reduces the buffer ranges afterwards with tuning concentration
and buffer grouping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method

Homodyne detection is thus the optimal Gaussian measurement to remotely

Microresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode
interactions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as
""avoided mode crossings"". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but
can also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e.g. the formation of
dispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing
temporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied,
but is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the
discovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs
within a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative
solitons are expected. We demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon in two
microresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic
chip-based silicon nitride microresonators), and theoretically describe the
dynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We demonstrate
experimentally that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange
between the soliton and another optical mode family. We further show that
inter-mode interactions can be modeled by a response function acting on
dissipative solitons. The observation of breathing dynamics in the
conventionally stable soliton regime is critical to applications, ranging from
low-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis to spectroscopy. On a
fundamental level, our results provide new understandings of the rich
dissipative soliton dynamics in multimode nonlinear cavities.

functions with polynomial growth of growth order at most $d$. Colding and
Minicozzi proved that $h_{d}(M)$ is finite. Later on, there are many researches
which give better estimates of $h_{d}(M)$. We study the behavior of $h_{d}(M)$
when $d$ is large in this paper. More precisely, suppose that $(M^{n},g)$ has
maximal volume growth and has a unique tangent cone at infinity, then when $d$
is sufficiently large, we obtain some estimates of $h_{d}(M)$ in terms of the
growth order $d$, the dimension $n$ and the the asymptotic volume ratio
$\alpha=\lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\mathrm{Vol}(B_{p}(R))}{R^{n}}$. When
$\alpha=\omega_{n}$, i.e., $(M^{n},g)$ is isometric to the Euclidean space, the
asymptotic behavior obtained in this paper recovers a well-known asymptotic
property of $h_{d}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$.

International Collaboration in China, with the primary goal of addressing the
question of neutrino mass ordering (hierarchy). The main challenge for JUNO is
to achieve a record energy resolution, ~3% at 1MeV of energy released in the
LS, which is required to perform the neutrino mass hierarchy determination.
About 20 000 large 20-inch PMTs with high Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) and
good photocathode uniformity will ensure an approximately 80% surface coverage
of the JUNO detector. The JUNO collaboration is preparing equipment for the
mass tests of all PMTs using 4 dedicated containers. This approach allows us to
test 144 PMTs in parallel. The primary measurement in the container will be the
PMT response to illumination of its photocathode by a low-intensity uniform
light. Each of the 20 000 PMTs will undergo the container test. Additionally, a
dedicated scanning system was constructed for sampled tests of PMTs that allows
us to study the variation of the PDE over the entire PMT photocathode surface.
The core of the scanning station is a rotating frame with 7 LED sources of
calibrated short light flashes that are placed along the photocathode surface
covering zenith angles from the top of a PMT to its equator. The collection
efficiency of a large PMT is known to be very sensitive to the Earth Magnetic
Field (EMF), therefore, understanding the necessary level of EMF suppression is
crucial for the JUNO Experiment. A dark room with Helmholtz coils compensating
the EMF components is available for these tests at a JUNO facility. The
Hamamatsu R12860 20-inch PMT is a candidate for the JUNO experiment. In this
article the container design and mass-testing method, the scanning setup and
scanning method are briefly described and preliminary results for performance
test of this PMT are reported.

Huang-Kirillov-Lepowsky showing that $A$ is a (super)algebra object in

exactly to local modules for the corresponding (super)algebra object. Both

isomorphism of braided monoidal (super)categories. Using this result, we show
that induction from a suitable subcategory of $V$-modules to $A$-modules is a

tree based optimizer that incrementally grows one decision tree per objective.
These trees are then used to select the next best sample. This paper compares
FLASH to state-of-the-art algorithms from search-based SE and machine learning.
This comparison uses multiple SBSE case studies for release planning,
configuration control, process modeling, and sprint planning for agile
development. FLASH was found to be the fastest optimizer (sometimes requiring
less than 1% of the evaluations used by evolutionary algorithms). Also,
measured in terms of model size, FLASH's reasoning was far more succinct and
comprehensible. Further, measured in terms of finding effective optimization,
FLASH's recommendations were highly competitive with other approaches. Finally,
FLASH scaled to more complex models since it always terminated (while
state-of-the-art algorithm did not).

theory by putting a stratification constraint on the comprehension schema; for
example, it proves that there is a universal set $V$. $\mathrm{NFU}$
($\mathrm{NF}$ with atoms) is known to be consistent through its close
connection with models of conventional set theory that admit automorphisms.
  A first-order theory, $\mathrm{ML}_\mathrm{CAT}$, in the language of
categories is introduced and proved to be equiconsistent to $\mathrm{NF}$
(analogous results are obtained for intuitionistic and classical $\mathrm{NF}$
with and without atoms). $\mathrm{ML}_\mathrm{CAT}$ is intended to capture the
categorical content of the predicative class theory of $\mathrm{NF}$.
$\mathrm{NF}$ is interpreted in $\mathrm{ML}_\mathrm{CAT}$ through the
categorical semantics. Thus, the result enables application of category
theoretic techniques to meta-mathematical problems about $\mathrm{NF}$ -style
set theory. For example, an immediate corollary is that $\mathrm{NF}$ is
equiconsistent to $\mathrm{NFU} + |V| = |\mathcal{P}(V)|$. This is already
proved by Crabb\'e, but becomes more transparent in light of the results of
this paper.
  Just like a category of classes has a distinguished subcategory of small
morphisms, a category modelling $\mathrm{ML}_\mathrm{CAT}$ has a distinguished
subcategory of type-level morphisms. This corresponds to the distinction
between sets and proper classes in $\mathrm{NF}$. With this in place, the axiom
of power objects familiar from topos theory can be appropriately formulated for
$\mathrm{NF}$. It turns out that the subcategory of type-level morphisms
contains a topos as a natural subcategory.

ApJ accepted",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa7950",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AGN feedback is now widely believed to play a crucial role in the
co-evolution between the central black hole and its host galaxy. Two feedback
modes have been identified, namely the radiative and kinetic modes, which
correspond to the luminous AGNs and low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), respectively.
In this paper, we investigate the radiative heating in the kinetic mode. This
process is potentially important because: 1) the radiation power of LLAGNs is
higher than the jet power over a wide parameter range, 2) the spectral energy
distribution of LLAGNs is such that the radiative heating is more effective
compared to that of luminous AGNs with the same luminosity, and 3) most of the
time in the lifecycle of an AGN is spent in the LLAGNs phase. In this paper,
adopting the characteristic broad-band spectral energy distributions of LLAGNs,
we calculate the value of ""Compton temperature"" ($T_{\rm c}$), which determines
the radiative heating by Compton scattering. We find that $T_{\rm c}\sim
(5-15)\times 10^7$ K, depending on the spectrum of individual LLAGN and at
which distance from the black hole we evaluate the heating. We also compare
this heating process with other radiative heating and cooling processes such as
photoionization/recombination. Our result can be used for an accurate
calculation of the radiative heating in the study of AGN feedback.

polarimetric observations in terms of cloudiness, rotational velocities and
effective temperatures of brown dwarfs (BDs). An envelope of scatterers like
free-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector of
radiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be
considerably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme
for computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated polarized emission of an
oblate BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous or patchy clouds.
Assuming a uniform grey atmosphere, we theoretically examine the
photopolarimetric sensitivity to its scattering properties like cloud optical
thickness and grain-size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness,
inclination and effective temperature, which are all treated as free
parameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational
darkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated
polarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the
resulting polarization.
  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.
The degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it
potentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our
model assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a
blue-ward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors of BDs --- interesting in view of
the observed J-K brightening in L/T transition. For large cloud grains,
polarization decreases sharply, while transmitted intensity shows a steady
increase. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the
presence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size.

velocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours.
We compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution,
dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite
galaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on
the fraction $f_{\rm BNC}$ of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the

unrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and
correlations between $f_{\rm BNC}$ and the satellite occupation. We find that
$f_{\rm BNC}$ strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy

that one comb in one polarization is generated by an orthogonally polarized
soliton comb and two low-noise, orthogonally polarized combs interact with each
other and exist simultaneously in a single microresonator. The second comb
generation is attributed to the strong cross-phase modulation with the
orthogonally polarized soliton comb and the high peak power of the intracavity
soliton pulse. Experimental results show that a second frequency comb is
excited even when a continuous wave light as a ""seed""-with power as low as 0.1

generation. Moreover, the second comb has a concave envelope, which is
different from the sech2 envelope of the soliton comb. This is due to the
frequency mismatch between the harmonics and the resonant frequency. We also
find that the repetition rates of these two combs coincide, although two

semiconductor nano-structures are crucial ingredients to realize topological
superconductivity. Our approach for topological superconductivity employs a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed by an InAs quantum well, cleanly
interfaced with a superconductor (epitaxial Al). This epi-Al/InAs quantum well
heterostructure is advantageous for fabricating large-scale nano-structures
consisting of multiple Majorana zero modes. Here, we demonstrate building-block
transport studies using a high-quality epi-Al/InAs 2DEG heterostructure, which
could be put together to realize the proposed 1D nanowire-based nano-structures
and 2DEG-based networks that could host multiple Majorana zero modes: 1D
transport using 1) quantum point contacts and 2) gate-defined quasi-1D channels
in the InAs 2DEG as well as induced superconductivity in 3) a ballistic Al-InAs
2DEG-Al Josephson junction. From 1D transport, systematic evolution of
conductance plateaus in half-integer conductance quanta are observed as a
result of strong spin-orbit coupling in the InAs 2DEG. Large IcRn, a product of
critical current and normal state resistance from the Josephson junction,
indicates that the interface between the epitaxial Al and the InAs 2DEG is
highly transparent. Our results of electronic transport studies based on the 2D
approach suggest that the epitaxial superconductor/2D semiconductor system is
suitable for realizing large-scale nano-structures for quantum computing
applications.

provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made
in controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single
transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on
lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light
pulses. However, coherent superposition of many longitudinal and transverse
modes in a laser has received little attention. The multitude of disparate
frequency spacings, strong dispersions, and complex nonlinear interactions
among modes greatly favor decoherence over the emergence of order. Here we
report the locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes in fiber
lasers to generate ultrafast spatiotemporal pulses. We construct multimode
fiber cavities using graded-index multimode fiber (GRIN MMF). This causes
spatial and longitudinal mode dispersions to be comparable. These dispersions
are counteracted by strong intracavity spatial and spectral filtering. Under
these conditions, we achieve spatiotemporal, or multimode (MM), mode-locking. A
variety of other multimode nonlinear dynamical processes can also be observed.
Multimode fiber lasers thus open new directions in studies of three-dimensional
nonlinear wave propagation. Lasers that generate controllable spatiotemporal
fields, with orders-of-magnitude increases in peak power over existing designs,
should be possible. These should increase laser utility in many established
applications and facilitate new ones.

thin film of active particle suspension. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of
chain configurations is the origin of the unidirectional rotation. Long
persistence time, large propelling force and/or small rotating friction are
keys to keeping the broken symmetry and realizing the rotation. In the rotating
state, we find very simple linear relations, e.g. between mean angular speed
and propelling force. The time-evolving asymmetry of chain configurations
reveals that there are two types of non-rotating state. Our findings provide
new insights into the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking in active

of imperfect state prediction and non-stationarity. Based on a novel
distribution-accuracy curve prediction model, we develop the predictive

algorithm that requires zero a-prior system statistical information, and
consists of three key components, namely sequential distribution estimation and
change detection, dual learning, and online queue-based control.
  Specifically, we show that PLC simultaneously achieves good long-term
performance, short-term queue size reduction, accurate change detection, and
fast algorithm convergence. In particular, for stationary networks, PLC
achieves a near-optimal $[O(\epsilon)$, $O(\log(1/\epsilon)^2)]$ utility-delay
tradeoff. For non-stationary networks, \plc{} obtains an $[O(\epsilon),
O(\log^2(1/\epsilon)$ $+ \min(\epsilon^{c/2-1}, e_w/\epsilon))]$

distribution change $O(w)$ slots faster with high probability ($w$ is the
prediction size) and achieves an $O(\min(\epsilon^{-1+c/2},

resulting in a vector $y=Ax+z$, where $z$ denotes the noise; we call this a
single measurement vector (SMV) problem. Sometimes, multiple dependent vectors
$x^{(j)}, j\in \{1,...,J\}$, are measured at the same time, forming the
so-called multi-measurement vector (MMV) problem. Both SMV and MMV are linear
models (LM's), and the process of estimating the underlying vector(s) $x$ from
an LM given the matrices, noisy measurements, and knowledge of the noise
statistics, is called a linear inverse problem. In some scenarios, the matrix A
is stored in a single processor and this processor also records its
measurements $y$; this is called centralized LM. In other scenarios, multiple
sites are measuring the same underlying unknown vector $x$, where each site
only possesses part of the matrix A; we call this multi-processor LM. Recently,
due to an ever-increasing amount of data and ever-growing dimensions in LM's,
it has become more important to study large-scale linear inverse problems. In
this dissertation, we take advantage of tools in statistical physics and
information theory to advance the understanding of large-scale linear inverse
problems. The intuition of the application of statistical physics to our
problem is that statistical physics deals with large-scale problems, and we can
make an analogy between an LM and a thermodynamic system. In terms of
information theory, although it was originally developed to characterize the
theoretic limits of digital communication systems, information theory was later
found to be rather useful in analyzing and understanding other inference
problems. (The full abstract cannot fit in due to the space limit. Please refer

black holes at a given X-ray luminosity. This has made them more difficult to
study as they fade towards quiescence. To explore whether neutron stars power
jets at low accretion rates ($L_{\rm X} \lesssim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), we
investigate the radio and X-ray properties of three accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsars (IGR J17511-3057, SAX J1808.4-3658 and IGR J00291+5934) during their
outbursts in 2015, and of the non-pulsing neutron star Cen X-4 in quiescence
(2015) and in outburst (1979). We did not detect the radio counterpart of IGR
J17511-3057 in outburst or of Cen X-4 in quiescence, but did detect IGR
J00291+5934 and SAX J1808.4-3658, showing that at least some neutron stars
launch jets at low accretion rates. While the radio and X-ray emission in IGR
J00291+5934 seem to be tightly correlated, the relationship in SAX J1808.4-3658
is more complicated. We find that SAX J1808.4-3658 produces jets during the
reflaring tail, and we explore a toy model to ascertain whether the radio
emission could be attributed to the onset of a strong propeller. The lack of a
universal radio/X-ray correlation, with different behaviours in different
neutron star systems (with various radio/X-ray correlations; some being radio
faint and others not), points at distinct disk-jet interactions in individual
sources, while always being fainter in the radio band than black holes at the
same X-ray luminosity.

node centrality) as well as the learnt node embedding (i.e., node
classification uncertainty and node embedding representativeness). Different

clearance, as we illustrate by a simple mathematical model. Taken together,
these results suggest that cholesterol reduction induces neuroserpin
aggregation, even in absence of specific neuroserpin mutations. The new

nm thick in-plane magnetized bias layer (BL) separated by a metallic spacer of
3 nm from the free layer (FL) can be engineered within the MTJ stack to provide
the 50 mT bias magnetic field for switching. By conducting macrospin
simulation, we find that a fast switching in 0.38 ns with energy consumption as
low as 0.3 fJ at a voltage of 1.6 V can be achieved. Furthermore, we study the
phase diagram of switching probability, showing that a pulse duration margin of
0.15 ns is obtained and a low-voltage operation (~ 1 V) is favored. Finally,
the MTJ scalability is considered, and it is found that scaling-down may not be
appealing in terms of both the energy consumption and the switching time for
the precession based VCMA switching.

order to match word queries to a set of candidate images. A system that can
automatically annotate images with meaningful text can be highly beneficial for
such engines. Currently, the approaches to develop such systems try to
establish relationships between keywords and visual features of images. In this
paper, We make three main contributions to this area: (i) We transform this
problem from the low-level keyword space to the high-level semantics space that
we refer to as the ""{\em image theme}"", (ii) Instead of treating each possible
keyword independently, we use latent Dirichlet allocation to learn image themes
from the associated texts in a training phase. Images are then annotated with
image themes rather than keywords, using a modified continuous relevance model,
which takes into account the spatial coherence and the visual continuity among
images of common theme. (iii) To achieve more coherent annotations among images
of common theme, we have integrated ConceptNet in learning the semantics of
images, and hence augment image descriptions beyond annotations provided by
humans. Images are thus further annotated by a few most significant words of
the prominent image theme. Our extensive experiments show that a coherent
theme-based image annotation using high-level semantics results in improved
precision and recall as compared with equivalent classical keyword annotation
systems.

to operate in the original spaces (text or image), which makes it difficult to
visualize the crossmodal function, and do not generalize well to unseen data.
Recently, generative adversarial networks have gained popularity and have been
used for generating realistic synthetic data and for obtaining high-level,
single-modal latent representation spaces. In this work, we evaluate the
feasibility of using GANs to obtain multimodal representations. We show that
GANs can be used for multimodal representation learning and that they provide
multimodal representations that are superior to representations obtained with
multimodal autoencoders. Additionally, we illustrate the ability of visualizing
crossmodal translations that can provide human-interpretable insights on

a far relative of the expected utility theory, where the role of utility is
played by adaptivity to an environment (bath). However, this sort of
utility-adaptivity cannot be represented simply as a numerical function. The
operator representation in Hilbert space is used and adaptivity is described as
in quantum dynamics. We are especially interested in stabilization of solutions
for sufficiently large time. The outputs of this stabilization process,
probabilities for possible choices, are treated in the framework of classical

each corresponds to one subspace. Most existing subspace clustering approaches
assume that input data lie on linear subspaces. In practice, however, this
assumption usually does not hold. To achieve nonlinear subspace clustering, we
propose a novel method, called kernel truncated regression representation. Our
method consists of the following four steps: 1) projecting the input data into
a hidden space, where each data point can be linearly represented by other data
points; 2) calculating the linear representation coefficients of the data
representations in the hidden space; 3) truncating the trivial coefficients to
achieve robustness and block-diagonality; and 4) executing the graph cutting
operation on the coefficient matrix by solving a graph Laplacian problem. Our
method has the advantages of a closed-form solution and the capacity of
clustering data points that lie on nonlinear subspaces. The first advantage
makes our method efficient in handling large-scale datasets, and the second one
enables the proposed method to conquer the nonlinear subspace clustering
challenge. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with
current state-of-the-art approaches.

groups for the period 1749-1996. The reconstruction is based on the active day
fraction (ADF) method, which is slightly updated with respect to the previous
works, and a revised database of sunspot group observations. Stability of some
key solar observers has been evaluated against the composite series. The Royal
Greenwich Observatory dataset appears fairly stable since the 1890s but is
about 10% too low before that. A declining trend of 10-15% in the quality of
Wolfer's observation is found between the 1880s and 1920s, suggesting that
using him as the reference observer may lead to additional uncertainties. Wolf

any obvious trend. The new reconstruction reflects the centennial variability

in Type IIB compactifications, that those vacua admit non-trivial

obtain that local existence of a weak solution is guaranteed as long as the

in $C^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $\nabla u_0(x)$ being uniformly continuous and
bounded on $\mathbb{R}^N$ and that the global existence assertion also holds
true if we assume that ${\bf g}$ is locally Lipschitz and satisfies the growth

$\sup_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u_0|<\infty$, and the norm of $u_0$ in the space

derive the Hilbert space product between eigenstates of energy E and
eigenstates of the dynamical variable B. In these Hilbert space products,
quantum phases and interference effects appear in the form of an action that
relates energy to time in the experimentally observable dynamics of localized
states. Quantum effects emerge in the measurement statistics when the precise
control of energy in quantum state preparation results in a coherent
randomization of the dynamics, such that two different arrival times contribute
to the quantum statistics of the same measurement outcome B. The non-classical
features associated with quantum interference can thus be explained as a
consequence of quantum dynamics and its role in state preparation and

the energy-time uncertainties is not merely a technical problem but rather

heavy-metal nanowires or introducing strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
broken inversion symmetry in flexible materials. Here, based on
first-principles calculations, we propose a pathway to realize the Rashba
spin-split by adsorbing Gd atom on zigzag graphene nanoribbons (Gd-ZGNR) and
further investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Perpendicular MAE and
unconventional MAE contributions in k-space are found in the self-assembled
Gd-ZGNR system, which present a remarkable Rashba effect (the estimated
strength is 1.89 eV {\AA}) attributed to strong SOC (~65.6 meV) and the
asymmetric adsorption site at the nanoribbons edge. Moreover, first-order MAE
is connected to the intrinsic Rashba effect beyond the traditional second-order
MAE, which is confirmed based on the analysis of electronic structures
perturbed with SOC in comparison with metastable Gd-ZGNR at central symmetric
adsorption site. The dependence of first-order MAE as well as Rashba effect of
Gd-ZGNRs on the ribbon width are also examined. This work offers new
perspective to achieve 1D Rashba system and provides fundamental understanding

so-called ""differential radial velocities"". We apply this method to the radial
velocities measured by HARPS, and identify four signals at 18, 89, 147 and 330

significant signal at a period of about 330 d corresponding to a super-Earth or
Neptune in the habitable zone. Since this signal is close to the annual
sampling period and significant periodogram power in some noise proxies are
found close to this signal, further observations and analyses are required to
confirm it. The analyses of the eccentricity and consistency of signals provide
weak evidence for the existence of the previously reported 43 d signal and a
new signal at a period of about 11.9 d with a semi amplitude of 0.4 m/s. We
find that the detection of a number of signals with radial velocity variations

$\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$ are two most popular rank correlation indicators,
which straightforwardly assign uniform weight to all quality levels and assume
each pair of images are sortable. They are successful for measuring the average
accuracy of an IQA metric in ranking multiple processed images. However, two
important perceptual properties are ignored by them as well. Firstly, the
sorting accuracy (SA) of high quality images are usually more important than
the poor quality ones in many real world applications, where only the
top-ranked images would be pushed to the users. Secondly, due to the subjective
uncertainty in making judgement, two perceptually similar images are usually
hardly sortable, whose ranks do not contribute to the evaluation of an IQA
metric. To more accurately compare different IQA algorithms, we explore a
perceptually weighted rank correlation indicator in this paper, which rewards
the capability of correctly ranking high quality images, and suppresses the
attention towards insensitive rank mistakes. More specifically, we focus on
activating `valid' pairwise comparison towards image quality, whose difference
exceeds a given sensory threshold (ST). Meanwhile, each image pair is assigned
an unique weight, which is determined by both the quality level and rank
deviation. By modifying the perception threshold, we can illustrate the sorting
accuracy with a more sophisticated SA-ST curve, rather than a single rank
correlation coefficient. The proposed indicator offers a new insight for
interpreting visual perception behaviors. Furthermore, the applicability of our
indicator is validated in recommending robust IQA metrics for both the degraded

intervening quasar absorbers, mainly those involving neutral and molecular gas.
We have selected quasar absorption systems with high spectral resolution and
good S/N data, with some of their lines falling on quasar emission features. By
investigating the consistency of absorption profiles seen for lines formed
either against the quasar continuum source or on the much more extended
emission line region (ELR), we can probe the extent and structure of the
foreground absorber over the extent of the ELR (0.3-1 pc). The spatial covering
analysis provides constraints on the transverse size of the absorber and thus
is complementary to variability or photoionisation modelling studies. The
methods we used to identify spatial covering or structure effects involve line
profile fitting and curve of growth analysis.We have detected three absorbers
with unambiguous non uniformity effects in neutral gas. For one extreme case,
the FeI absorber at z_abs=0.45206 towards HE 0001-2340, we derive a coverage
factor of the ELR of at most 0.10 and possibly very close to zero; this implies
an absorber overall size no larger than 0.06 pc. For the z_abs=2.41837 CI
absorber towards QSO J1439+1117, absorption is significantly stronger towards
the ELR than towards the continuum source in several CI and CI* velocity
components pointing to factors of about two spatial variations of their column
densities and the presence of structures at the 100 au - 0.1 pc scale. The
other systems with firm or possible effects can be described in terms of
partial covering of the ELR, with coverage factors in the range 0.7 - 1. The
overall results for cold, neutral absorbers imply a transverse extent of about
five times or less the ELR size, which is consistent with other known
constraints.

artificiality, consisting of separated rings and a core, arbitrarily located at
disparate altitudes in the magnetosphere. Diversity of observed profile shapes
clearly exceeds the interpretive capability of such conal model. Moreover,
bifurcated features observed in pulsar profiles imply a system of fan beams
radially extending away from the dipole axis. The bifurcations can be
understood as the imprint of the elementary radiation pattern of the
long-sought radio emission mechanism, thus identifying the latter. Their size,
however, is several times larger than implied by the curvature of magnetic
dipole lines. Here I show that the illusion of disconnected rings and the size
of bifurcated features can be explained through a natural geometry which
combines the properties of both the cone and the fan beam. It is a flaring
spiral which makes several revolutions around the dipole axis on its way to
leave the magnetosphere. Such geometry is consistent with a stream of
outflowing and laterally drifting plasma. The bifurcated components are so
wide, because the curvature on such a spiral is larger than that of the dipolar
magnetic field, hence they are consistent with the extraordinary mode curvature
radiation.

failures to the monitor, which unlike deadlocks and livelocks in conventional
process algebras, propagate globally and aborts the whole system's execution.
Although CSPe has a trace semantics along with an implementation demonstrating
acceptable performance, it lacks an operational semantics. An operational
semantics is not only more accessible than trace semantics but also
indispensable for ensuring the correctness of the implementation. Furthermore,
a process algebra like CSPe admits multiple denotational semantics appropriate
for different purposes, and an operational semantics is the basis for
justifying such semantics' integrity and relevance. In this paper, we develop
an SOS-style operational semantics for CSPe, which properly accounts for

segments feature volumes into regions with respect to their contribution to

boundaries around each volume segment of a feature at the initial time that
correspond to the separated features at the later time. To convey temporal
evolution of the partitioning within the investigated time interval, we
complement our approach with spatio-temporal separation surfaces. For the
application of our approach to multiphase flow, we additionally present a
feature-based corrector method to ensure phase-consistent particle
trajectories. The utility of our technique is demonstrated by application to
two-phase (liquid-gas) and multi-component (liquid-liquid) flows where the

chemisorbed on the defective InSe monolayers. Especially, our calculated

Theory, with dimension six operators built of Standard Model fields (SMEFT). We
discuss how this approach works in case of the transverse momentum spectrum of
the Higgs particle. In our calculation we augmented the Standard Model with
three additional operators describing modifications of the top and bottom
Yukawa couplings, and a point-like Higgs coupling to gluons. Based on recently
presented resummed transverse-momentum spectra including these operators at
NLL+NLO accuracy,which we recently presented in Ref [1], in this note we show
the extension of the calculation to NNLL+NNLO. We find that such modifications,
while affecting the total rate within the current uncertainties, can lead to
significant distortions of the spectrum. Additionally, through significant
reduction of the scale uncertainty we improve the sensitivity to the new
operators.

dissolved Ge becomes re-deposited by a liquid-phase epitaxial process at the
trailing edge of the droplet. Secondary droplets are launched from the rims of
the single-crystalline Ge trails into intact regions of the GeSn film, leading
to an avalanche-like transformation front between the GeSn film and
re-deposited Ge. This process makes phase separation of metastable GeSn layers

reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions,
and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional
in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore,
computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision
making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in
RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML)
researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the
interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can
communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective
modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a
successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory
and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g.,
homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled
in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these
dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning
efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically
compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains
like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides
both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their
RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL
research.

molecule, is continuous and is proportional to the square modulus of the
Fourier transform of that object. When arrayed in a crystal, the coherent sum
of the continuous diffracted wave-fields from all objects gives rise to strong
Bragg peaks that modulate the single-object transform. Wilson statistics
describe the distribution of continuous diffraction intensities to the same
extent that they apply to Bragg diffraction. The continuous diffraction
obtained from translationally-disordered molecular crystals consists of the
incoherent sum of the wave-fields from the individual rigid units (such as
molecules) in the crystal, which is proportional to the incoherent sum of the
diffraction from the rigid units in each of their crystallographic
orientations. This sum over orientations modifies the statistics in a similar
way that crystal twinning modifies the distribution of Bragg intensities. These
statistics are applied to determine parameters of continuous diffraction such
as its scaling, the beam coherence, and the number of independent wave-fields
or object orientations contributing. Continuous diffraction is generally much
weaker than Bragg diffraction and may be accompanied by a background that far
exceeds the strength of the signal. Instead of just relying upon the smallest
measured intensities to guide the subtraction of the background it is shown how
all measured values can be utilised to estimate the background, noise, and
signal, by employing a modified ""noisy Wilson"" distribution that explicitly
includes the background. Parameters relating to the background and signal
quantities can be estimated from the moments of the measured intensities. The
analysis method is demonstrated on previously-published continuous diffraction
data measured from imperfect crystals of photosystem II.

is based on the kinematic and lensing mass profiles derived using the data from
the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (hereafter CLASH) and the
spectroscopic follow-up with the Very Large Telescope (hereafter CLASH-VLT). We
assume a spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW hereafter) profile in order to
obtain a constraint on the fifth force interaction range $\lambda$ for models
in which the dependence of this parameter on the enviroment is negligible at
the scale considered (i.e. $\lambda=const$) and fixing the fifth force strength
to the value predicted in $f(R)$ gravity. We then use information from lensing
analysis to put a prior on the other NFW free parameters. In the case of MACSJ
1206 the joint kinematic+lensing analysis leads to an upper limit on the
effective interaction range $\lambda\le1.61\,\mbox{Mpc}$ at
$\Delta\chi^{2}=2.71$ on the marginalized distribution. For RXJ 2248 instead a
possible tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model appears when adding lensing
information, with a lower limit $\lambda\ge0.14\,\mbox{Mpc}$ at
$\Delta\chi^{2}=2.71$. This is consequence of the slight difference between the
lensing and kinematic data, appearing in GR for this cluster, that could be
explained in terms of modifications of gravity. We discuss the impact of
systematics and the limits of our analysis as well as future improvements of

strength of automatic deep feature learning. Detection is achieved with
performance metrics significantly surpassing those of existing algorithmic
methods, as well as marginally exceeding those attained by individual human

non-linear physical quantities, such as entropies, purity and concurrence. In
particular, in this work the tensorial formulation is used to consider the
dynamical evolution of the symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors and to read off
the corresponding limits as giving rise to a contraction of the initial Jordan

compute the asymptotic probability of getting a simple closed curve on a sphere
by identifying the endpoints of two arc systems (one on each of the two
hemispheres) along the common equator. The new tools we bring to bear are based
on interpretation of meanders as square-tiled surfaces with one horizontal and
one vertical cylinders. The proofs combine recent results on Masur-Veech
volumes of the moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials in genus
zero with our new observation that horizontal and vertical separatrix diagrams
of integer quadratic differentials are asymptotically uncorrelated. The
additional combinatorial constraints we impose in this article yield explicit
polynomial asymptotics.

stability (LDS) method. Whereas gait LDS has been used successfully in many
settings and applications, little is known about its sensitivity to individual
characteristics of healthy adults. Therefore, we reanalyzed a large dataset of
accelerometric data measured for 100 healthy adults from 20 to 70 years of age
performing 10 min. treadmill walking. We sought to assess the extent to which
the variations of age, body mass and height, sex, and preferred walking speed
(PWS) could influence gait LDS. The random forest (RF) and multiple adaptive
regression splines (MARS) algorithms were selected for their good bias-variance
tradeoff and their capabilities to handle nonlinear associations. First,
through variable importance measure (VIM), we used RF to evaluate which
individual characteristics had the highest influence on gait LDS. Second, we
used MARS to detect potential interactions among individual characteristics
that may influence LDS. The VIM and MARS results indicated that PWS and age
correlated with LDS, whereas no associations were found for sex, body height,
and body mass. Further, the MARS model detected an age by PWS interaction: on
one hand, at high PWS, gait stability is constant across age while, on the
other hand, at low PWS, gait instability increases substantially with age. We
conclude that it is advisable to consider the participants' age as well as
their PWS to avoid potential biases in evaluating dynamic balance through LDS.

the spectra of the two bodies differs significantly, then it is likely there
are wavelength regimes where the contrast between the moon and planet is
significantly larger. In principle, this effect could be used to isolate
periodic oscillations in the combined phase curve. Being able to detect the

knowledge, no such ground-truth dataset exists in the literature. In this
paper, we describe a trajectory annotation framework and report our results to
annotate a dataset of personal car trajectories. Our annotation methodology
consists of a crowd-sourcing task followed by a precise process of aggregation.
Our annotation process consists of two granularity levels, one to specify the
annotation (segment border) and the other one to describe the type of the
segment (e.g. speed-up, turn, merge, etc.). The output of our project, Dataset
of Annotated Car Trajectories (DACT), is available online at
https://figshare.com/articles/dact_dataset_of_annotated_car_trajectories/5005289 .

structure of molecules. However the strict spin selection rule has severely
limited its ability to access states of different spin multiplicities. Here we
propose a new strategy to activate spin-forbidden transitions in molecules by
introducing spatially highly inhomogeneous plasmonic field. The giant
enhancement of the magnetic field strength resulted from the curl of the
inhomogeneous vector potential makes the transition between states of different
spin multiplicities naturally feasible. The dramatic effect of the
inhomogeneity of the plasmonic field on the spin and symmetry selection rules
is well illustrated by first principles calculations of C60. Remarkably, the
intensity of singlet-triplet transitions can even be stronger than that of
singlet-singlet transitions when the plasmon spatial distribution is comparable
with the molecular size. This approach offers a powerful means to completely
map out all excited states of molecules and to actively control their
photochemical processes. The same concept can also be applied to study nano and
biological systems.

terms of grid development and expansion planning. An overestimate of long-term
electricity load will result in substantial wasted investment in the
construction of excess power facilities, while an underestimate of future load
will result in insufficient generation and unmet demand. This paper presents
first-of-its-kind approach to use multiplicative error model (MEM) in
forecasting load for long-term horizon. MEM originates from the structure of
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model where conditional
variance is dynamically parameterized and it multiplicatively interacts with an
innovation term of time-series. Historical load data, accessed from a U.S.
regional transmission operator, and recession data for years 1993-2016 is used
in this study. The superiority of considering volatility is proven by
out-of-sample forecast results as well as directional accuracy during the great
economic recession of 2008. To incorporate future volatility, backtesting of
MEM model is performed. Two performance indicators used to assess the proposed
model are mean absolute percentage error (for both in-sample model fit and
out-of-sample forecasts) and directional accuracy.

expressed in linear-temporal logic and referring to global states. We consider
intrinsically independent components whose interactions are partitioned on
distributed controllers. In this context, the problem that arises is that a
global state of the system is not available to the monitor. Instead, we attach
local controllers to schedulers to retrieve the concurrent local traces. Local
traces are sent to a global observer which reconstructs the set of global
traces that are compatible with the local ones, in a concurrency-preserving
fashion. In this context, the reconstruction of the global traces is done
on-the-fly using a lattice of partial states encoding the global traces
compatible with the locally-observed traces. We implemented our monitoring
approach in a prototype tool called RVDIST. RVDIST executes in parallel with
the distributed model and takes as input the events generated from each
scheduler and outputs the evaluated computation lattice. Our experiments show
that, thanks to the optimisation applied in the online monitoring algorithm, i)
the size of the constructed computation lattice is insensitive to the the
number of received events, (ii) the lattice size is kept reasonable and (iii)
the overhead of the monitoring process is cheap.

that CO2 adsorption opens the material band gap, however, while the adsorption
on the TiO2-terminated surface neutralizes surface states at the valence band
(VB) maximum, CO2 on the SrO-terminated surfaces suppresses the conduction band
(CB) minimum. For the TiO2-terminated surface, the effect is explained by the
passivation of dangling bonds, whereas for the SrO-terminated surface, the
suppression is caused by the surface relaxation. Modulation of the VB states
implies a more direct change in charge distribution, and thus the induced
change in band gap is more prominent at the TiO2 termination. Further, we show
that both CO2 adsorption energy and surface band gap are strongly dependent on
CO2 coverage, suggesting that the observed effect can be utilized for sensing
application in a wide range of CO2 concentrations.

logic constraints is proposed to describe the pedestrian flow in the urban
traffic network and its dynamics are captured by the hopping rule, which
depicts the changing capacity of each time interval from one waiting zone to
another. Based on the hopping mechanism, the pedestrian traffic light
scheduling problems are formulated by two different performance standards:
pedestrian delay and pedestrian unhappiness. Then the mathematical technique
and the meta-heuristic approach are both adopted to solve the scheduling
problem: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for pedestrian
delay model and discrete harmony search algorithm (DHS) for both pedestrian
delay model and unhappiness model. Secondly, a mathematical model about the
vehicle traffic network, which captures drivers psychological responses to the
traffic light signals, is introduced. Thirdly, a traffic light scheduling
strategy to minimize the trade-off of the delays between pedestrians and
vehicles is proposed. Finally, we translate this traffic signal scheduling
problem for both pedestrians and vehicles into a MILP problem which can be
solved by several existing tools, e.g., GUROBI. Numerical simulation results
are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our real-time traffic light
scheduling for pedestrian movement and the potential impact to the vehicle
traffic flows by the pedestrian movement.

maximize the weighted sum rate within joint transmission clusters. As the
considered weighted sum rate maximization is a non-convex problem, successive
convex approximation techniques, based on weighted mean-squared error
minimization, are applied to devise algorithms with tractable computational
complexity. Decentralized algorithms are proposed to enable JP even with
limited backhaul connectivity. These algorithms rely provide a variety of
alternatives for signaling overhead, computational complexity and convergence
behavior. Time division duplexing is exploited to design transceiver training
techniques for two scenarios: stream specific estimation and direct estimation.
In the stream specific estimation, the base station and user equipment estimate
all of the stream specific precoded pilots individually and construct the
transmit/receive covariance matrices based on these pilot estimates. With the
direct estimation, only the intended transmission is separately estimated and
the covariance matrices constructed directly from the aggregate system-wide
pilots. The impact of feedback/backhaul signaling quantization is considered,
in order to further reduce the signaling overhead. Also, user admission is
being considered for time-correlated channels. The enhanced transceiver
convergence rate enables periodic beamformer reinitialization, which greatly
improves the achieved system performance in dense networks.

as it is used in the study of renormalization questions in physics. In concrete
cases, this refers to specific Hilbert spaces that arise before and after the
reflection. Our focus is a comparative study of the associated spectral theory,
now referring to the canonical operators in these two Hilbert spaces. Indeed,
the inner product which produces the respective Hilbert spaces of quantum
states changes, and comparisons are subtle.
  We analyze in detail a number of geometric and spectral theoretic properties
connected with axiomatic reflection positivity, as well as their probabilistic
counterparts; especially the role of the Markov property. This view also
suggests two new theorems, which we prove. In rough outline: It is possible to
express OS-positivity purely in terms of a triple of projections in a fixed
Hilbert space, and a reflection operator. For such three projections, there is
a related property, often referred to as the Markov property; and it is well
known that the latter implies the former; i.e., when the reflection is given,
then the Markov property implies O.S.-p., but not conversely. In this paper we
shall prove two theorems which flesh out a much more precise relationship
between the two. We show that for every OS-positive system
$\left(E_{+},\theta\right)$, the operator $E_{+}\theta E_{+}$ has a canonical
and universal factorization.

the direct neural influence and prediction is primarily localized to the

the conditional independence relationships between and among variables for each

provide the rate of convergence for estimating the precision matrices

a periodic confining potential by means of computer simulations, both using
empirical potentials and from first-principles. We propose a periodic confining
potential emulating the atomistic oscillation of the confining walls, which
allows varying the lattice parameter and amplitude of the oscillation. We do it
for a triangular lattice, with several values of the lattice parameter: one
which is ideal for commensuration with layers of Ih ice, and other values that
would correspond to more realistic substrates. For the former, an overall rise
of the melting temperature is observed. The liquid maintains a bi-layer
triangular structure, however, despite the fact that it is not favoured by the
external periodicity. The first-principles liquid is significantly affected by
the modulation in its layering and stacking even at relatively small amplitudes
of the confinement modulation. Beyond some critical modulation amplitude the
hexatic phase present in flat confinement is replaced by a trilayer crystalline
phase unlike any of the phases encountered for flat confinement. For more
realistic lattice parameters, the liquid does not display higher tendency to
freeze, but it clearly shows inhomogeneous behaviour as the strength of the
rugosity increases. In spite of this expected inhomogeneity, the structural and
dynamical response of the liquid is surprisingly insensitive to the external
modulation. Although the first-principles calculations give a more triangular
liquid than the one observed with empirical potentials, both agree remarkably
well for the main conclusions of the study.

tract features to respond to these extended patterns, and use these to identify
areas of the time-frequency plane as tonal, pulsal, and noisy. Where an area is
marked as noisy if it is neither tonal nor pulsal. To investigate whether a
similar separation indeed underlies human perceptual organization we introduce
tract based descriptors: tonality, pulsality, and noisiness. These descriptors
keep track of either the total energy or the cochleagram area marked as

strongly correlated with the first perceptual dimension of human subjects,

is driven to a higher excited state, it radiates multiple photons in a cascade
decay. Atomic and biexciton cascades have been exploited as sources of
polarization-entangled photon pairs. Because the photons are emitted
sequentially, their intensities are strongly correlated in time, as measured in
a double-beam coincidence experiment. Perhaps less intuitively, their phases
can also be correlated, provided a single emitter is deterministically prepared

phase-sensitive manner and with high efficiency. Here we have met these
requirements by using a superconducting artificial atom, coherently driven to
its second-excited state and decaying into a well-defined microwave mode. Our

obviously affected by copper. However, the underlying mechanism is still far
from being understood, especially on the atomic level. Here, we unexpectedly
observed that a decrease in phospholipid (PL) bilayer fluidity caused by Cu2+
was much more significant than those induced by Zn2+ and Ca2+, while a
comparable reduction occurred in the last two ions. This finding clearly
disagrees with the placement in the periodic table of Cu just next to Zn and
far from Ca. The physical nature was revealed to be a special attraction
between Cu+ cations, which can induce a motif forming of two phospholipids
coupled by Cu-Cu bond (PL-diCu-PL). Namely, upon Cu2+ ion binding to a
negatively charged phosphate group of lipid, Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+. The
special attraction of the cations then caused one Cu+ ion simultaneously
binding to two lipids and another Cu+, resulting in the formation of PL-diCu-PL
structure. In contrast, this attraction cannot occur in the cases of Zn and Ca
ions due to their electron structure. Remarkably, besides lipids, the phosphate
group widely exists in other biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, ADP and
ATP, which would also induce the similar structure of Cu ions with the
molecules. Our findings thus provide a new view for understanding the
biological functions of copper and the mechanism underlying copper-related
diseases.

thermalize at scales larger than the forcing scale, similar to an absolute
equilibrium obtained for the spectrally-truncated Euler equation. Using direct
numeric simulations of Taylor-Green flows and general-periodic helical flows,
we present results on the probability density function, energy spectrum,
auto-correlation function and correlation time that compare the two systems. In
the case of highly helical flows, we derive an analytic expression describing
the correlation time for the absolute equilibrium of helical flows that is
different from the $E^{-1/2}k^{-1}$-scaling law of weakly helical flows. This
model predicts a new helicity-based scaling law for the correlation time as
$\tau(k)\sim H^{-1/2}k^{-1/2}$. This scaling law is verified in simulations of
the truncated Euler equation. In simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations the
large scale modes of forced Taylor-Green symmetric flows (with zero total
helicity and large separation of scales) follow the same properties as absolute
equilibrium including a $\tau(k) \sim E^{-1/2}k^{-1}$ scaling for the
correlation time. General-periodic helical flows also show similarities between
the two systems, however the largest scales of the forced flows deviate from
the absolute equilibrium solutions.

coloring the projection according to the discrepancy between original

We compared the bare projection to the interactive coloring of the original

constant as a function of doping concentration. The plot of this generalized

the vicinity of zero doping and a very sharp fall with increase in doping

tendency of the itinerant spins to couple again in the unconventional

depth and then apply a state of the art depth-based 3D hand tracking method.
Unfortunately, this does not work well in practice because the stereo-based,
dense 3D reconstruction of hands is far less accurate than the one obtained by
RGBD cameras. Our approach bypasses 3D reconstruction and follows a completely
different route: 3D hand tracking is formulated as an optimization problem
whose solution is the hand configuration that maximizes the color consistency

method for real time tracking of a single hand, of a hand manipulating an

quantitatively on standard datasets and in comparison to relevant, state of the

loss using the drop in IOI. In order to zoom on a given parameter, we define
the relative residual IOI and the relative drop in IOI. While these two
quantities can provide insights on the parameters that are most responsible for
inconsistencies, we find that the full IOI applied to the whole parameter
spaces is what must be used to correctly reflect the degree of inconsistency
between two experiments. We discuss various properties of IOI, provide its
eigenmode decomposition, and compare it to other measures of discordance.
Finally, we apply IOI to current geometry data sets (i.e. an improved
Supernovae Type Ia compilation, baryon acoustic oscillations from 6dF, SDSS MGS
and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and high-$\ell$ CMB temperature data from
Planck-2015) versus growth data sets (i.e. Redshift Space Distortions from
WiggleZ and SDSS, Weak Lensing from CFHTLenS, CMB Lensing, Sunyav-Zeldovich
effect, and low-$\ell$ CMB temperature and polarization data from Planck-2015).
We find that a persistent inconsistency is present between the two data sets.
This could reflect the presence of systematics in the data or inconsistencies
in the underlying model.

against a stochastic block model in the asymptotic regime where the average
degree of the graph grows with the graph size n. Our primary interest lies in
those cases in which the signal-to-noise ratio is at a constant level. Focusing
on symmetric two block alternatives, we first derive joint central limit
theorems for linear spectral statistics of power functions for properly
rescaled graph adjacency matrices under both the null and local alternative
hypotheses. The powers in the linear spectral statistics are allowed to grow to
infinity together with the graph size. In addition, we show that linear
spectral statistics of Chebyshev polynomials are closely connected to signed
cycles of growing lengths that determine the asymptotic likelihood ratio test
for the hypothesis testing problem of interest. This enables us to construct a
sequence of test statistics that achieves the exact optimal asymptotic power
within $O(n^3 \log n)$ time complexity in the contiguous regime when $n^2
p_{n,av}^3 \to\infty$ where $p_{n,av}$ is the average connection probability.
We further propose a class of adaptive tests that are computationally tractable
and completely data-driven. They achieve nontrivial powers in the contiguous
regime and consistency in the singular regime whenever $n p_{n,av} \to\infty$.
These tests remain powerful when the alternative becomes a more general
stochastic block model with more than two blocks.

halo masses of WISE-selected obscured and unobscured quasars, implying a
distinction between these populations beyond random line-of-sight effects.
However, the significance of this difference in the most up-to-date
measurements is relatively weak, at $\sim$2$\sigma$ for individual measurements
but bolstered by agreement from different techniques, including angular
clustering and cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB)
lensing maps. Here, we expand the footprint of previous work, aiming to improve
the precision of both methods. In this larger area we correct for position
dependent selection effects, in particular fluctuations of the WISE-selected
quasar density as a function of Galactic latitude. We also measure the
cross-correlation of the obscured and unobscured samples and confirm that they
are well-matched in redshift, both centred at $z=1$. Combined with very similar
detection fractions and magnitude distributions in the long-wavelength WISE
bands, this redshift match strongly supports the fact that IR selection
identifies obscured and unobscured quasars of similar bolometric luminosity.
Finally, we perform cross-correlations with confirmed spectroscopic quasars,
again confirming the results from other methods --- obscured quasars reside in
haloes a factor of 3 times more massive than unobscured quasars. This
difference is significant at the $\sim$5$\sigma$ level when the measurements
are combined, strong support for the idea that obscuration in at least some
quasars is tied to the larger environment, and may have an evolutionary
component.

the ability to support distributed control applications, communication plays a
central role in the IEC 61499 specification. In order to enable the deployment
of functionality to distributed platforms, these platforms need to exchange
data in a variety of protocols. IEC 61499 realizes the support of these

smart grids and energy applications, IEC 61499 could play an important role, as
these applications require coordinating several distributed control logics.
Yet, the support of grid-related protocols is a pre-condition for a wide-spread
utilization of IEC 61499. The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
on the other hand is a well-established protocol for messaging, which has
recently been adopted for smart grid communication. Thus, SIFBs for XMPP

Solver for Compressible flow (C-AMS) in heterogeneous porous media. Similar to
the recently developed AMS for incompressible (linear) flows [Wang et al., JCP,
2014], C-AMS operates by defining primal and dual-coarse blocks on top of the
fine-scale grid. These coarse grids facilitate the construction of a
conservative (finite volume) coarse-scale system and the computation of local
basis functions, respectively. However, unlike the incompressible (elliptic)
case, the choice of equations to solve for basis functions in compressible
problems is not trivial. Therefore, several basis function formulations
(incompressible and compressible, with and without accumulation) are considered
in order to construct an efficient multiscale prolongation operator. As for the
restriction operator, C-AMS allows for both multiscale finite volume (MSFV) and
finite element (MSFE) methods. Finally, in order to resolve high-frequency
errors, fine-scale (pre- and post-) smoother stages are employed. In order to
reduce computational expense, the C-AMS operators (prolongation, restriction,
and smoothers) are updated adaptively. In addition to this, the linear system
in the Newton-Raphson loop is infrequently updated. Systematic numerical
experiments are performed to determine the effect of the various options,
outlined above, on the C-AMS convergence behaviour. An efficient C-AMS strategy
for heterogeneous 3D compressible problems is developed based on overall CPU
times. Finally, C-AMS is compared against an industrial-grade Algebraic
MultiGrid (AMG) solver. Results of this comparison illustrate that the C-AMS is
quite efficient as a nonlinear solver, even when iterated to machine accuracy.

multiscale coarse grids are independently constructed for both porous matrix
and fracture networks. Then, a map between coarse- and fine-scale is obtained
by algebraically computing basis functions with local support. In order to
extend the localization assumption to the fractured media, four types of basis
functions are investigated: (1) Decoupled-AMS, in which the two media are
completely decoupled, (2) Frac-AMS and (3) Rock-AMS, which take into account
only one-way transmissibilities, and (4) Coupled-AMS, in which the matrix and
fracture interpolators are fully coupled. In order to ensure scalability, the
F-AMS framework permits full flexibility in terms of the resolution of the
fracture coarse grids. Numerical results are presented for two- and
three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases. During these experiments, the
performance of F-AMS, paired with ILU(0) as second-stage smoother in a
convergent iterative procedure, is studied by monitoring CPU times and
convergence rates. Finally, in order to investigate the scalability of the
method, an extensive benchmark study is conducted, where a commercial algebraic
multigrid solver is used as reference. The results show that, given an
appropriate coarsening strategy, F-AMS is insensitive to severe fracture and
matrix conductivity contrasts, as well as the length of the fracture networks.
Its unique feature is that a fine-scale mass conservative flux field can be
reconstructed after any iteration, providing efficient approximate solutions in
time-dependent simulations.

Popperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical
description of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible
realization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer
principle of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The
different point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs
corresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG
indistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard
2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs
indistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever
angles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the
OR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL
gate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the
self-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according
to the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate
it is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective
AND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally,
by other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible
to obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more
sophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All
this leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device
plus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to

execution of computationally intensive algorithms. Visual sensor networks can
be enabled to perform such tasks by augmenting the sensor network with
processing nodes and distributing the computational burden in a way that the
cameras contend for the processing nodes while trying to minimize their task
completion times. In this paper, we formulate the problem of minimizing the
completion time of all camera sensors as an optimization problem. We propose
algorithms for fully distributed optimization, analyze the existence of
equilibrium allocations, evaluate the effect of the network topology and of the
video characteristics, and the benefits of central coordination. Our results
demonstrate that with sufficient information available, distributed
optimization can provide low completion times, moreover predictable and stable
performance can be achieved with additional, sparse central coordination.

Comments welcome",,,,"math.OC math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lifted Markov chains are Markov chains on graphs with added local ""memory""
and can be used to mix towards a target distribution faster than their
memoryless counterparts. Upper and lower bounds on the achievable performance
have been provided under specific assumptions. In this paper, we analyze which
assumptions and constraints are relevant for mixing, and how changing these
assumptions affects those bounds. Explicitly, we find that requesting mixing on
either the original or the full lifted graph, and allowing for reducible lifted
chains or not, have no essential influence on mixing time bounds. On the other
hand, allowing for suitable initialization of the lifted dynamics and/or
imposing invariance of the target distribution for any initialization do
significantly affect the convergence performance. The achievable convergence
speed for a lifted chain goes from diameter-time to no acceleration over a
standard Markov chain, with conductance bounds limiting the effectiveness of
the intermediate cases. In addition, we show that the relevance of imposing
ergodic flows depends on the other criteria. The presented analysis allows us
to clarify in which scenarios designing lifted dynamics can lead to better
mixing, and provide a flexible framework to compare lifted walks with other
acceleration methods.

  Mortality Rate and Associated Factors among Toronto Neighborhoods",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In public health, various data are rigorously collected and published with
open access. These data reflect the environmental and non-environmental
characteristics of heterogeneous neighborhoods in cities. In the present study,
we aimed to study the relations between these data and disease risks in
heterogeneous neighborhoods. A flexible framework was developed to determine
the key factors correlated with diseases and find the most relevant combination
of factors to explain observations of diseases through nonlinear analyses.
Taking Lung Cancer Premature Mortality Rate (LCPMR) in Toronto as an example,
two environmental factors (green space, and industrial pollution) and two
non-environmental factors (immigrants, and mental health visits) were
identified in the relational analysis of all of the target neighborhoods. To
determine the influence of the heterogeneity of the neighborhoods, they were
clustered into three different classes. In the most severe class, two
additional factors related to dwellings were determined to be involved, which
increased the observation's deviance from 48.1% to 80%. The factors determined
in this study may assist governments in improving public health policies.

properties of polycrystalline metallic sheets. The constituent grain behavior
is modelled using the new single crystal yield criterion developed by Cazacu,
Revil, and Chandola (2017). For ideal texture components, the yield stress and
plastic strain ratios can be obtained analytically. For the case of strongly
textured sheets containing a spread about the ideal texture components, the
polycrystalline response is obtained numerically on the basis of the same
single-crystal criterion. It is shown that for textures with misorientation
scatter width up to 25 degrees, the numerical predictions are very close to
those obtained analytically for an ideal texture. Furthermore, irrespective of
the number of grains in the sample, Lankford coefficients have finite values
for all loading orientations. Illustrative examples for sheets with textures
containing a combination of few ideal texture components are also presented.
The simulations of the predicted polycrystalline behavior based on the new
description of the plastic behavior of the constituent grains capture the
influence of individual texture components on the overall degree of anisotropy.
The polycrystalline simulation results are also compared to analytical
estimates obtained using the closed-form formulas for the ideal components
present in the texture in conjunction with a simple law of mixtures. The
analytical estimates show the same trends as the simulation results. Therefore,
the trends in plastic anisotropy of the macroscopic properties can be
adequately estimated analytically.

analysis using geometric probability, we discuss the observability of these
parameters: which parameters we can estimate and what conditions are required
to estimate them. For a convex target object, its size and perimeter length are
observable, and other parameters are not observable. For a general polygon
target object, convexity in addition to its size and perimeter length is
observable. Parameters related to a concave vertex can be observable when some
conditions are satisfied. We also propose a method for estimating the convexity
of a target object and the perimeter length of the target object.
