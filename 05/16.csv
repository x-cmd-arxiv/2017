be clearly identified in remotely-sensed imagery. The status of individual
bands can be tracked over time, allowing for a detailed remote analysis of how
human populations affect the vital balance of dryland ecosystems. In this
study, we characterize vegetation change in areas of the Horn of Africa where
imagery taken in the early 1950s is available. We find that substantial change
is associated with steep increases in human activity, which we infer primarily
through the extent of road and dirt track development. A seemingly paradoxical
signature of human impact appears as an increase in the widths of the
vegetation bands, which effectively increases the extent of vegetation cover in
many areas. We show that this widening occurs due to altered rates of
vegetation colonization and mortality at the edges of the bands, and conjecture
that such changes are driven by human-induced shifts in plant species
composition. Our findings suggest signatures of human impact that may aid in
identifying and monitoring vulnerable drylands in the Horn of Africa.

exciting and challenging areas of physics research. Emergent phenomena such as
high-temperature superconductivity are linked to the proximity to a QCP.
Although significant progress has been made in understanding quantum critical
behavior in some low dimensional magnetic insulators, the situation in metallic
systems is much less clear. Here we demonstrate that NiCoCrx single crystal
alloys are remarkable model systems for investigating QCP physics in a metallic
environment. For NiCoCrx alloys with x = 0.8, the critical exponents associated
with a ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FQCP) are experimentally
determined from low temperature magnetization and heat capacity measurements.
For the first time, all of the five critical exponents ( gamma-subT =1/2 ,
beta-subT = 1, delta = 3/2, nuz-subm = 2, alpha-bar-subT = 0) are in remarkable
agreement with predictions of Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta (BKV) theory in the
asymptotic limit of high disorder. Using these critical exponents, excellent
scaling of the magnetization data is demonstrated with no adjustable
parameters. We also find a divergence of the magnetic Gruneisen parameter,
consistent with a FQCP. This work therefore demonstrates that entropy
stabilized concentrated solid solutions represent a unique platform to study
quantum critical behavior in a highly tunable class of materials.

by memory cost. MHFs are egalitarian, in the sense that evaluating them on
dedicated hardware (like FPGAs or ASICs) is not much cheaper than on
off-the-shelf hardware (like x86 CPUs). MHFs have interesting cryptographic
applications, most notably to password hashing and securing blockchains.
  Alwen and Serbinenko [STOC'15] define the cumulative memory complexity (cmc)
of a function as the sum (over all time-steps) of the amount of memory required
to compute the function. They advocate that a good MHF must have high cmc.
Unlike previous notions, cmc takes into account that dedicated hardware might
exploit amortization and parallelism. Still, cmc has been critizised as
insufficient, as it fails to capture possible time-memory trade-offs, as memory
cost doesn't scale linearly, functions with the same cmc could still have very
different actual hardware cost.
  In this work we address this problem, and introduce the notion of
sustained-memory complexity, which requires that any algorithm evaluating the
function must use a large amount of memory for many steps. We construct
functions (in the parallel random oracle model) whose sustained-memory
complexity is almost optimal: our function can be evaluated using $n$ steps and
$O(n/\log(n))$ memory, in each step making one query to the (fixed-input
length) random oracle, while any algorithm that can make arbitrary many
parallel queries to the random oracle, still needs $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ memory
for $\Omega(n)$ steps.
  Our main technical contribution is the construction is a family of DAGs on
$n$ nodes with constant indegree with high ""sustained-space complexity"",
meaning that any parallel black-pebbling strategy requires $\Omega(n/\log(n))$
pebbles for at least $\Omega(n)$ steps.

to test the dynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking. Higgs sectors
beyond the Standard Model (SM) can substantially modify this cross section
through novel couplings not present in the SM or the on-shell production of new
heavy Higgs bosons that subsequently decay into Higgs pairs. CP violation in
the Higgs sector is important for the explanation of the observed
matter-antimatter asymmetry through electroweak baryogenesis. In this work we
compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections in the heavy top quark
limit, including the effects of CP violation in the Higgs sector. We choose the
effective theory (EFT) approach, which provides a rather model-independent way
to explore New Physics (NP) effects by adding dimension-6 operators, both
CP-conserving and CP-violating ones, to the SM Lagrangian. Furthermore, we
perform the computation within a specific UV-complete model and choose as
benchmark model the general 2-Higgs-Doublet Model with CP violation, the C2HDM.
Depending on the dimension-6 coefficients, the relative NLO QCD corrections are
affected by several per cent through the new CP-violating operators. This is
also the case for SM-like Higgs pair production in the C2HDM, while the
relative QCD corrections in the production of heavier C2HDM Higgs boson pairs
deviate more strongly from the SM case. The absolute cross sections both in the
EFT and the C2HDM can be modified by more than an order of magnitude. In
particular, in the C2HDM the resonant production of Higgs pairs can by far
exceed the SM cross section.

attention since the early days of CSP research. %because of the strong pruning
they can achieve. However, they have not been widely adopted by CSP solvers.
This is because applying such consistencies can sometimes result in
considerably smaller search tree sizes and therefore in important speed-ups,
but in other cases the search space reduction may be small, causing severe run
time penalties. Taking advantage of recent advances in parallelization, we
propose a novel approach for the application of strong local consistencies
(SLCs) that can improve their performance by largely preserving the speed-ups
they offer in cases where they are successful, and eliminating the run time
penalties in cases where they are unsuccessful. This approach is presented in
the form of two search algorithms. Both algorithms consist of a master search
process, which is a typical CSP solver, and a number of slave processes, with
each one implementing a SLC method. The first algorithm runs the different SLCs
synchronously at each node of the search tree explored in the master process,
while the second one can run them asynchronously at different nodes of the
search tree. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
method.

between a trigger particle with higher $p_{\rm T}$ (1 GeV/c $ < p_{\rm T} < 8$

obtained by the ALICE detector from Pb-Pb and pp collisions are presented. In
Pb-Pb collisions, a significant broadening of the peak in central events at low

conjunction of species-richness and power-law structures in plankton
communities is more than a coincidence. Although the exact allometric scalings

equations and the Dirac equation for a point mass. We used a length scale
$L_{CS}$, dubbed the Compton-Schwarzschild length, to which the Compton
wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are small mass and large mass
approximations, respectively. Here we write down the field equations which
follow from this action. We argue that the large mass limit yields Einstein
equations, provided we assume wave function collapse and localisation for large
masses. The small mass limit yields the Dirac equation. We explain why the
Kerr-Newman black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as the Dirac electron,
both being twice the classical value. The small mass limit also provides
compelling reasons for introducing torsion, which is sourced by the spin
density of the Dirac field. There is thus a symmetry between torsion and
gravity: torsion couples to quantum objects through Planck's constant $\hbar$
(but not $G$) and is important in the microscopic limit. Whereas gravity
couples to classical matter, as usual, through Newton's gravitational constant
$G$ (but not $\hbar$), and is important in the macroscopic limit. We construct
the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations which include the length $L_{CS}$. We find
a potentially significant change in the coupling constant of the torsion driven
cubic non-linear self-interaction term in the Dirac-Hehl-Datta equation. We
speculate on the possibility that gravity is not a fundamental interaction, but
emerges as a consequence of wave function collapse, and that the gravitational
constant maybe expressible in terms of Planck's constant and the parameters of
dynamical collapse models.

the poor scalability. Peer-to-peer (P2P) data sharing can effectively reduce

the sensing data is saved and processed in user devices locally and shared
among users in a P2P manner. To provide necessary incentives for users in such

sense data can sell data to others who request data but not want to sense the
data by themselves. We analyze the user behavior dynamics from the

the game equilibrium. We further propose best response iterative algorithms to
reach the equilibrium with provable convergence. Our simulations show that the

enhance the attractive alkane-water cross interaction to capture this behavior.
Here we revisit the calculation of $\mu^{\rm ex}$ using the polarizable AMOEBA

AMOEBA03 and AMOEBA14 water models; the former has been validated with the
AMOEBA alkane model while the latter is a revision of AMOEBA03 to better
describe liquid water. We calculate $\mu^{\rm ex}$ using the test particle
method. With CGenFF, $\mu^{\rm ex}$ is positive and the error relative to
experiments is about 1.5 $k_{\rm B}T$. With AMOEBA, $\mu^{\rm ex}$ is negative
and deviations relative to experiments are between 0.25 $k_{\rm B}T$ (AMOEBA14)

solvent suggest that zero point effects may account for some of the deviation.
Forcefield limitations notwithstanding, electrostatic and induction effects,
commonly ignored in considerations of water-alkane interactions, appear to be
decisive in the solubility of water in alkanes.

principles. Thus the construction of a proper model, namely effective
Hamiltonian, is essential. Here, we propose a simple scheme of constructing
Hamiltonians from given energy or entanglement spectra with machine learning.
We apply the proposed scheme to the Hubbard model at the half-filling, and
compare the obtained effective low-energy spin-1/2 model with several analytic
results based on the high order perturbation theory which have been
inconsistent with each other. We also show that our approach can be used to
construct the entanglement Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body state from its
entanglement spectrum as well. We exemplify this using the ground states of the
$S=1/2$ two-leg Heisenberg ladders. We observe a qualitative difference between
the entanglement Hamiltonians of the two phases (the Haldane phase and the Rung
Singlet phase) of the model due to the different origin of the entanglement. In
the Haldane phase, we find that the entanglement Hamiltonian is non-local by
nature, and the locality can be restored by introducing the anisotropy and
turning the system into the large-$D$ phase. Possible applications to the study

available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines
how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the
baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid
model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant
fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out
to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model
complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model
selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can
have very different star formation histories. Nevertheless, the average star
formation and accretion rates are in good agreement with models following an
abundance matching strategy. Galaxies that are quenched at $z=0$ typically have
a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts.
The accretion of stars can dominate the total mass of massive galaxies, but is
insignificant for low-mass systems, independent of star-formation activity.
EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and
introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive
galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intra-cluster-mass in
massive haloes can be up to 8 times larger than the mass of the central galaxy.
Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with
observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to
haloes.

However, until now, only the nearby Coma cluster has shown evidence for a
$\gamma$-ray virial ring. We stack Fermi-LAT data for the 112 most massive,
high latitude, extended clusters, enhancing the ring sensitivity by rescaling
clusters to their virial radii and utilizing the expected flat energy spectrum.
In addition to a central unresolved, hard signal (detected at the $\sim

$5.8\sigma$ confidence level) a bright, spectrally-flat $\gamma$-ray ring at
the expected virial shock position. The ring signal implies that the shock
deposits $\sim 0.6\%$ (with an interpretation uncertainty factor $\sim2$) of
the thermal energy in relativistic electrons over a Hubble time. This result,
consistent with the Coma signal, validates and calibrates the virial shock
model, and indicates that the cumulative emission from such shocks
significantly contributes to the diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray and

implement three prescriptions to predict the submillimeter flux densities of
the model galaxies; two depend solely on star formation rate, whereas the other
also depends on the dust mass. By comparing the predictions of the models, we
find that taking into account the dust mass, which affects the dust temperature
and thus influences the far-infrared spectral energy distribution, is crucial
for matching the number counts and redshift distribution of SMGs. Moreover,
despite using a standard IMF, our model can match the observed SMG number
counts and redshift distribution reasonably well, which contradicts the
conclusions of some previous studies that a top-heavy IMF, in addition to
taking into account the effect of dust mass, is needed to match these

collimation toward the bipolar directions. We find that, unlike the spherically
symmetric case, even less massive BHs with $M_{\rm BH} < 10^4~M_{\odot}$ can be
fed by surrounding gas at high accretion rates of $\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$
through the equatorial plane, while ionized regions expand to the polar

$M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 5\times 10^5~M_{\odot}$, neutral gas through the equatorial

motions, and thus the emergent radiation in all directions is blocked. Because
of efficient recombination by hydrogen, the entire flow results in neutral and
warm gas with $T \simeq 8000~{\rm K}$ . The central BH is fed through the
equator at the averaged rate of $\sim 5\times 10^4~L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, which
corresponds to $\sim 50~\%$ of the inflow rate from the Bondi radius. Moreover,
radiation momentum absorbed by neutral hydrogen produces warm outflows toward
the bipolar directions at $\sim 30~\%$ of the BH feeding rate and with a
typical velocity of $\simeq 50~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$.

is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy
distributions, sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We
apply exactly the same analysis to the real data and to the simulated images,

set of $n(z)$ distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the
method by determining $n(z)$ for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the
4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data in the COSMOS field. We also complement this
imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample from the VVDS survey. We
compare our resulting posterior $n(z)$ distributions to the one derived from

good agreement. This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current

Hamiltonian cycle in an edge-weighted graph, where costs are defined on all
pairs of edges such that each edge in the pair is contained in the Hamiltonian
cycle. This is a more general version than the one that appears in the
literature as the QTSP, denoted here as the \emph{adjacent quadratic} TSP,
which only considers costs for pairs of adjacent edges. Major directions of
research work on the linear TSP include exact algorithms, heuristics,
approximation algorithms, polynomially solvable special cases and exponential
neighbourhoods among others. In this paper we explore the complexity of
searching exponential neighbourhoods for QTSP, the fixed-rank QTSP, and the
adjacent quadratic TSP. The fixed-rank QTSP is introduced as a restricted
version of the QTSP where the cost matrix has fixed rank $p$. It is shown that
fixed-rank QTSP is solvable in pseudopolynomial time and admits an FPTAS for
each of the special cases studied, except for the case of matching edge
ejection tours. The adjacent quadratic TSP is shown to be polynomially-solvable
in many of the cases for which the linear TSP is polynomially-solvable.
Interestingly, optimizing over the matching edge ejection tour neighbourhood is
shown to be pseudopolynomial for the rank 1 case without a linear term in the
objective function, but NP-hard for the adjacent quadratic TSP case.
  We also show that the quadratic shortest path problem on an acyclic digraph
can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and by an FPTAS when the rank of the
associated cost matrix is fixed.

enough photons to reionise the Universe. We assess the viability of this
scenario using a semi-numerical framework for modeling reionisation, to which
we add a quasar contribution by constructing a Quasar Halo Occupation
Distribution (QHOD) based on Giallongo et al. observations. Assuming a constant
QHOD, we find that an AGN-only model cannot simultaneously match observations
of the optical depth $\tau_e$, neutral fraction, and ionising emissivity. Such
a model predicts $\tau_e$ too low by $\sim 2\sigma$ relative to Planck
constraints, and reionises the Universe at $z\lesssim 5$. Arbitrarily
increasing the AGN emissivity to match these results yields a strong mismatch
with the observed ionising emissivity at $z\sim 5$. If we instead assume a
redshift-independent AGN luminosity function yielding an emissivity evolution
like that assumed in Madau & Haardt model, then we can match $\tau_e$ albeit
with late reionisation, however such evolution is inconsistent with
observations at $z\sim 4-6$ and poorly motivated physically. These results
arise because AGN are more biased towards massive halos than typical reionising
galaxies, resulting in stronger clustering and later formation times.
AGN-dominated models produce larger ionising bubbles that are reflected in
$\sim\times 2$ more 21cm power on all scales. A model with equal parts galaxies
and AGN contribution is still (barely) consistent with observations, but could
be distinguished using next-generation 21cm experiments HERA and SKA-low. We
conclude that, even with recent claims of more faint AGN than previously
thought, AGN are highly unlikely to dominate the ionising photon budget for
reionisation.

specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new
calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (i.e. UVI
diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on
CANDELS, UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and
redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of
0.2--2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global
$A_V$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti
extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than
stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting $A_V$
profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured
radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching
signatures, except for $M_*>10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, where central declines of
20--25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous
radial sSFR and (continuum) $A_V$ measurements. They are also consistent with
the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas
profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking
findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of
galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low
stellar-mass surface densities there.

answering this question. The chiral effective field theory description of the
nuclear force now makes this possible but requires certain parameters that are
not uniquely determined. Defining the nuclear force needs identification of
observables sensitive to the different parametrizations. From a measurement of
proton elastic scattering on $^{10}$C at TRIUMF and ab initio nuclear reaction

Experimental searches for the CME in relativistic heavy ion collisions via the

coupled with the elliptic anisotropy. We propose differential measurements of
the $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$), by

the length of the TPB is the only reasonable property of a 2D electrode that

earlier proposed simulations of different electrochemical mechanisms. It is
shown that two of the proposed mechanisms (conductivity and a
two-step-two-material kinetic mechanism) can explain the current increase at
$\mathrm{Pb-MnO_2}$ anodes compared to standard lead anodes. The results show
that although $\mathrm{MnO_2}$ has low conductivity, when combined with Pb as
the metal matrix, the behaviour of the composite is not purely ohmic but is
also affected by activation overpotentials, increasing the current density
close to the TPB. Current density is inversely proportional to the radius of
the catalyst particles, matching with earlier experimental results. A
hypothetical two-step-two-material mechanism with intermediate
$\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ that reacts on both the Pb matrix and $\mathrm{MnO_2}$

$\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ followed by its chemical decomposition on $\mathrm{MnO_2}$,
results are obtained that agree with the experiments. It is further emphasised
that both the Pb matrix and $\mathrm{MnO_2}$ catalyst are necessary and their
optimum ratio depends on the used current density. Yet, additional experimental
evidence is needed to support the postulated mechanism.

range of articles in the robotics and the WSN literature that are also relevant
to this new field of research. To connect the dots, we first identify the core

hole magnitudes: halo radius r_h , halo mass M_h, black hole mass M_BH,
velocity dispersion, phase space density, with their realistic astrophysical

naturally in this framework. Our extensive numerical calculations and detailed
analytic resolution show that with SMBH's, both WDM regimes: classical
(Boltzmann dilute) and quantum (compact) do necessarily co-exist in any galaxy:
from the smaller and compact galaxies to the largest ones. The transition from
the quantum to the classical region occurs precisely at the same point r_A
where the chemical potential vanishes. A novel halo structure with three
regions shows up: A small quantum compact core of radius r_A around the SMBH,
followed by a less compact region till the BH influence radius r_i, and then
for r> r_i the known halo galaxy shows up with its astrophysical size. Three
representative families of galaxy plus central SMBH solutions are found and
analyzed:small, medium and large galaxies having SMBH masses of 10^5, 10^7 and
10^9 M_sun respectively. A minimum galaxy size and mass ~ 10^7 M_sun larger
than the one without SMBH is found. Small galaxies in the range 10^4 M_sun <
M_h < 10^7 M_sun cannot harbor central SMBHs. We find novel scaling M_BH - r_h

takes huge values in the SMBH vecinity and then sharply decreases entering the

modified Lieb-Shultz Mattis (LSM) theorem in this setting, which applies even
when the spin in the enlarged magnetic unit cell is integral. There are two
nontrivial outcomes for gapped ground states that preserve all symmetries. In
the first case, one necessarily obtains a symmetry protected topological (SPT)
phase with protected edge states. This allows us to readily construct models of
SPT states by decorating dimer models of Mott insulators to yield SPT phases,
which should be useful in their physical realization. In the second case,
exotic bulk excitations, i.e. topological order, is necessarily present. While
both scenarios require fractional spin in the lattice unit cell, the second
requires that the symmetries protecting the fractional spin is related to that
involved in the magnetic translations. Our discussion encompasses the general
notion of fractional spin (projective symmetry representations) and magnetic
flux (magnetic translations tied to a symmetry generator). The resulting SPTs
display a dyonic character in that they associate charge with symmetry flux,
allowing the flux in the unit cell to screen the projective representation on
the sites. We provide an explicit formula that encapsulates this physics, which
identifies a specific set of allowed SPT phases.

extract accurate information about excited states using the standard ground
state algorithm. The results are spectacular for critical systems, for which
the low-energy conformal tower of states can be obtained very accurately at
essentially no additional cost, as demonstrated by confirming the predictions
of boundary conformal field theory for two simple minimal models - the
transverse-field Ising model and the critical three-state Potts model. This
approach is also very efficient to detect the quasi-degenerate low-energy

The attack is a combination of man-in-the-middle, hacking, and spoofing attacks
that can effectively change both signals going into and coming out of the

scrutinizing the existence of the geometric inconsistency. We show that the

construct intertwining operators. We deform these models in a ${\cal
PT}$-symmetric manner by judicious complex coordinate transformations, which
render the potential less singular. The ${\cal PT}$ deformation does not change
the energy eigenvalues but in some cases adds a previously unphysical tower of
states. For integral couplings the new and old energy levels coincide, which
roughly doubles the previous degeneracy and allows for a conserved nonlinear
supersymmetry charge. We present the details for the generic rank-two ($A_2$,
$G_2$) and all rank-three Coxeter systems ($AD_3$, $BC_3$ and $H_3$), including
a reducible case ($A_1^{\otimes 3}$).

represented by an oscillator in the relative coordinate of two constituent
particles of the object. The center of mass degrees of freedom of the object is
not directly coupled with the radiation field. However, we show that, for the
object with the oscillator in the excited state, dissipation caused by the
radiation field can suppress its quantum tunneling rate in the center of mass
degrees of freedom. In addition, when the initial energy of its center of mass
motion is similar to that of the excited state of the oscillator, a spatial
superposition state of the object prepared by the barrier can decohere due to
the radiation field. The main purpose of this article is to investigate how two
different interplays (i) among the center of mass, the relative coordinate
degrees of freedom and the potential barrier, and (ii) between the relative
coordinate degrees of freedom and the radiation field, can affect the quantum
tunneling and the creation of the spatial superposition state of the object.
Our toy model can give insight into tests of quantum tunneling and quantum

ALMA observationally, but its origin remains uncertain. Dust scattering was
recently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its
basic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the
effects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined
disks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate
semi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer
equation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk
is significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided
that the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to
settle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric
effect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the
far-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the
scattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned
grains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,
it opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence
from dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet
settled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.
This trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing
that younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less
grain settling. If confirmed, the trend would have far-reaching implications
for grain evolution and, ultimately, the formation of planetesimals and
planets.

except for the $K^{\pi}=0^+$ states. Furthermore, the difference between VP and
SP is found small (with exception of peak height in the toroidal mode). In the

$K^{\pi}=1^-$ is shown to dominate over $K^{\pi}=0^-$ one in the range of

respect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the
LOS, as observed in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has
contributions from clustering modes with a range of orientations with respect
to the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty $\sigma_z \geq 0.02(1+z)$ we find
that while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes in
the true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space. Thus,
measuring clustering in terms of the projected separation (regardless of the
LOS) is an efficient and nearly lossless compression of the signal for
$\sigma_z \geq 0.02(1+z)$. For reduced redshift uncertainty, a more careful
consideration is required. We then use more than 1700 realizations (combining
two separate sets) of galaxy simulations mimicking the Dark Energy Survey Year
1 sample to validate our analytic results and optimized analysis procedure. We
find that using the correlation function binned in projected separation, we can
achieve uncertainties that are within 10 per cent of those predicted by Fisher

Approximation by Separation and Hierarchy (SMASH), when the original dense
matrix is associated with a kernel function. Given points in a domain, a tree
structure is first constructed based on an adaptive partitioning of the
computational domain to facilitate subsequent approximation procedures. In
contrast to existing schemes based on either analytic or purely algebraic
approximations, SMASH takes advantage of both approaches and greatly improves
the efficiency. The algorithm follows a bottom-up traversal of the tree and is
able to perform the operations associated with each node on the same level in
parallel. A strong rank-revealing factorization is applied to the initial
analytic approximation in the separation regime so that a special structure is
incorporated into the final nested bases. As a consequence, the storage is
significantly reduced on one hand and a hierarchy of the original grid is
constructed on the other hand. Due to this hierarchy, nested bases at upper
levels can be computed in a similar way as the leaf level operations but on
coarser grids. The main advantages of SMASH include its simplicity of
implementation, its flexibility to construct various hierarchical rank
structures and a low storage cost. Rigorous error analysis and complexity
analysis are conducted to show that this scheme is fast and stable. The
efficiency and robustness of SMASH are demonstrated through various test
problems arising from integral equations, structured matrices, etc.

the carrier density is lowered. We compare the MIT characteristics with those
of known MITs in other materials systems and show that they are distinctly
different in several aspects. We tentatively conclude that both long range
Coulomb interactions and the fixed charge at the polar interface are likely to
play a role in this MIT. The strong dependence on the carrier density makes
this MIT of interest for field-tunable devices.

development continues to evolve, shape and be shaped by communication channels
that are used by developer communities of practice--both by traditional
communication channels (e.g., telephone, in-person interactions), as well as
social features that may be standalone or integrated with other development
tools (e.g., email, chat, and forums). Within a community of practice, software
is a combination of the externalized knowledge (e.g., code, documentation,
history of activities) as well as the tacit knowledge that resides in the
community members' heads (e.g., experience of when to use an API, or design
constraints that are not written down). Communication channels and development
tools support developers in forming and sharing both externalized and tacit
knowledge in a highly collaborative manner.
  However, not much is known about the impact this participatory culture is
having on software development practices nor on the knowledge-building
processes. The research community has been studying the tools and communication
channels used by developers in an effort to broaden our understanding. But,
studying only the tools and channels can only provide a narrow perspective. We
believe that software development has evolved beyond the agile process, into a
Participatory Process--A knowledge building process which is characterized by
the (1) knowledge activities and actions, (2) stakeholder roles, and (3) is
enabled by socially enhanced tools and communication channels. Thus, it is
important to gain an understanding of each one of the components, and the way
these components interact and shape each other.

balanced model, there arises a second-order elliptic equation for the
transverse circulation. Similarly, when studying zonally symmetric meridional
circulations near the equator (the tropical Hadley cells) or the katabatically
forced meridional circulation over Antarctica, there also arises a second order
elliptic equation. These elliptic equations are usually derived in the pressure
coordinate or the potential temperature coordinate, since the thermal wind
equation has simple non-Jacobian forms in these two vertical coordinates.
Because of the large variations in surface pressure that can occur in tropical
cyclones and over the Antarctic ice sheet, there is interest in using other
vertical coordinates, e.g., the height coordinate, the classical
$\sigma$-coordinate, or some type of hybrid coordinate typically used in global
numerical weather prediction or climate models. Because the thermal wind
equation in these coordinates takes a Jacobian form, the derivation of the
elliptic transverse circulation equation is not as simple. Here we present a
method for deriving the elliptic transverse circulation equation in a
generalized vertical coordinate, which allows for many particular vertical
coordinates, such as height, pressure, log-pressure, potential temperature,
classical $\sigma$, and most hybrid cases. Advantages and disadvantages of the
various coordinates are discussed.

ultra-compact objects (with or without an event horizon) admit planar circular
photon orbits. These light rings (LRs) determine several spacetime properties.
For instance, stable LRs trigger instabilities and, in spherical symmetry,
(unstable) LRs completely determine BH shadows. In generic stationary,
axi-symmetric spacetimes, non-planar bound photon orbits may also exist,
regardless of the integrability properties of the photon motion. We suggest a
classification of these fundamental photon orbits (FPOs) and, using Poincar\'e
maps, determine a criterion for their stability. For the Kerr BH, all FPOs are
unstable (similarly to its LRs) and completely determine the Kerr shadow. But
in non-Kerr spacetimes, stable FPOs may also exist, even when all LRs are
unstable, triggering new instabilities. We illustrate this for the case of Kerr
BHs with Proca hair, wherein, moreover, qualitatively novel shadows with a
cuspy edge exist, a feature that can be understood from the interplay between
stable and unstable FPOs. FPOs are the natural generalisation of LRs beyond
spherical symmetry and should generalise the LRs key role in different
spacetime properties.

explore how well the major C- and O-bearing chemical species (CO, CO2, CH4, and
H2O), important for determining atmospheric opacity and radiation balance, can
be constrained by transit measurements as a function of spectral wavelength
coverage. This work features simulations for a notional transit spectroscopy
mission and compares two cases for instrument spectral coverage (wavelength
coverage from 0.5-2.5 ${\mu}$m and 0.5-5 ${\mu}$m. The simulation is conducted
on a grid with a range of stellar magnitudes and incorporates a full retrieval
of atmospheric model parameters. We consider a range of planets from
sub-Neptunes to hot Jupiters and include both low and high mean molecular
weight atmospheres. We find that including the 2.5-5 ${\mu}$m wavelength range
provides a significant improvement in the degree of constraint on the retrieved
molecular abundances: up to ~3 orders of magnitude for a low mean molecular
weight atmosphere (${\mu}$=2.3) and up to a factor of ~6 for a high mean
molecular weight atmosphere (${\mu}$=28). These decreased uncertainties imply
that broad spectral coverage between the visible and the mid-infrared is an
important tool for understanding the chemistry and composition of exoplanet

nonzero Gauss-Bonnet coupling of either sign can lead to a pointwise violation
of the Quantum Focusing Conjecture. This violation is due to the classical
geometric terms appearing in the QFC. Since those geometric terms are properly
understood as expectation values of operators in an effective field theory, we
argue that they are only well-defined when smeared over a region at least as
large as the cutoff scale of the theory (which may be the Planck scale). We
find that this smearing prescription removes the pointwise violation found by

of S2 over the same time span will not be larger than $0.2$ deg, while the
current accuracy in estimating such an orbital element for this star is of the

smaller for S2, amounting to, at most, $0.19~\textrm{km

burst jets, unbound outflows from these disks are an important source of mass
ejection and rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We present the
first three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
simulations of neutrino-cooled accretion disks in neutron star mergers,
including a realistic equation of state valid at low densities and
temperatures, self-consistent evolution of the electron fraction, and neutrino
cooling through an approximate leakage scheme. After initial magnetic field
amplification by magnetic winding, we witness the vigorous onset of turbulence
driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The disk quickly reaches a
balance between heating from MRI-driven turbulence and neutrino cooling, which
regulates the midplane electron fraction to a low equilibrium value $Y_\text{e}
\approx 0.1$. Over the 380 ms duration of the simulation, we find that a
fraction $\approx 20\%$ of the initial torus mass is unbound in powerful
outflows with velocities $v \approx 0.03-0.1\,c$ and electron fractions
$Y_\text{e} \approx 0.1-0.25$. Post-processing the outflows through a nuclear
reaction network shows the production of a robust second and third peak
r-process. Though broadly consistent with the results of previous axisymmetric
hydrodynamical simulations, extrapolation of our results to late times suggests
that the total ejecta mass from GRMHD disks is significantly higher. Our
results provide strong evidence that post-merger disk outflows are an important

extensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra

our approach introducing competition mesh, which is simple to construct, has a

loop. We introduce three vector-like quark multiplets, an $SU(2)_L$ doublet, an
up-type singlet, and a down-type singlet. There are two kinds of loop effects
in the $S$ phenomenology, the mixing with the Higgs boson and the radiative
decays into $hh$, $WW$, $ZZ$, $gg$, and $\gamma\gamma$ through the triangle
loops. We show that the crucial condition for enhancing loop effects including
the longitudinal polarization enhancement is the large mass differences among
vector-like quarks. The current LHC constraints on $S$ from the heavy scalar
searches and the Higgs precision data are shown to be very significant: the
mixing angle with the Higgs boson should be smaller than about 0.1 for $m_S=
750$ GeV.

  Byzantine Gradient Descent",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of distributed statistical machine learning in
adversarial settings, where some unknown and time-varying subset of working
machines may be compromised and behave arbitrarily to prevent an accurate model
from being learned. This setting captures the potential adversarial attacks
faced by Federated Learning -- a modern machine learning paradigm that is
proposed by Google researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring
user privacy. Formally, we focus on a distributed system consisting of a
parameter server and $m$ working machines. Each working machine keeps $N/m$
data samples, where $N$ is the total number of samples. The goal is to
collectively learn the underlying true model parameter of dimension $d$.
  In classical batch gradient descent methods, the gradients reported to the
server by the working machines are aggregated via simple averaging, which is
vulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine
gradient descent method based on the geometric median of means of the
gradients. We show that our method can tolerate $q \le (m-1)/2$ Byzantine
failures, and the parameter estimate converges in $O(\log N)$ rounds with an
estimation error of $\sqrt{d(2q+1)/N}$, hence approaching the optimal error
rate $\sqrt{d/N}$ in the centralized and failure-free setting. The total
computational complexity of our algorithm is of $O((Nd/m) \log N)$ at each
working machine and $O(md + kd \log^3 N)$ at the central server, and the total
communication cost is of $O(m d \log N)$. We further provide an application of
our general results to the linear regression problem.
  A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create
arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated
gradients. We prove that the aggregated gradient converges uniformly to the

probability of error metric and one-dimensional signalling. Although
beamforming by directly minimizing probability of error (MPE) has potential
advantages over classical beamforming methods such as zero-forcing and minimum
mean square error beamforming, MPE beamforming results in a non-convex and a
highly nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, by adding a set of
modulation-based constraints, the MPE beamforming problem is transformed into a
convex programming problem. Then, a simplified version of the MPE beamforming
is proposed which reduces the exponential number of constraints in the MPE
beamforming problem. The simplified problem is also shown to be a convex
programming problem. The complexity of the simplified problem is further
reduced by minimizing a convex function which serves as an upper bound on the
error probability. Minimization of this upper bound results in the introduction
of a new metric, which is termed signal minus interference to noise ratio
(SMINR). It is shown that maximizing SMINR leads to a closed-form expression
for beamforming vectors as well as improved performance over existing
beamforming methods.

astrophysical plasmas, relativistic magnetic reconnection is a leading
explanation for the acceleration of particles to the ultrarelativistic energies
necessary to power nonthermal emission (especially X-rays and gamma-rays) in
pulsar magnetospheres and pulsar wind nebulae, coronae and jets of accreting
black holes, and gamma-ray bursts. An important objective of plasma
astrophysics is therefore the characterization of nonthermal particle
acceleration (NTPA) effected by reconnection. Reconnection-powered NTPA has
been demonstrated over a wide range of physical conditions using large
two-dimensional (2D) kinetic simulations. However, its robustness in realistic
3D reconnection -- in particular, whether the 3D relativistic drift-kink
instability (RDKI) disrupts NTPA -- has not been systematically investigated,
although pioneering 3D simulations have observed NTPA in isolated cases. Here
we present the first comprehensive study of NTPA in 3D relativistic
reconnection in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, characterizing NTPA as
the strength of 3D effects is varied systematically via the length in the third
dimension and the strength of the guide magnetic field. We find that, while the
RDKI prominently perturbs 3D reconnecting current sheets, it does not suppress
particle acceleration, even for zero guide field; fully 3D reconnection
robustly and efficiently produces nonthermal power-law particle spectra closely
resembling those obtained in 2D. This finding provides strong support for
reconnection as the key mechanism powering high-energy flares in various
astrophysical systems. We also show that strong guide fields significantly

The supervisory information is typically considered to come from a human

source of supervision -- a ""peer"" -- i.e. a different machine. We introduce
cooperative learning, where two agents trying to learn the same visual
concepts, but in potentially different environments using different sources of
data (sensors), communicate their current knowledge of these concepts to each
other. Given the distinct sources of data in both agents, the mode of
communication between the two agents is not obvious. We propose the use of
visual attributes -- semantic mid-level visual properties such as furry,
wooden, etc.-- as the mode of communication between the agents. Our experiments
in three domains -- objects, scenes, and animals -- demonstrate that our
proposed cooperative learning approach improves the performance of both agents
as compared to their performance if they were to learn in isolation. Our
approach is particularly applicable in scenarios where privacy, security and/or

of fluid due to viscous flow and the occurrence of viscous flow due to heat
flux, are not explicitly described in those traditional laws. One of the
phenomenologies which describe the causality and interaction of dissipations is
the Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics (EIT). (Israel-Stewart theory of
dissipative hydrodynamics is one approximate form of EIT.) This manuscript
reviews an axiomatic construction of EIT and Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic
theory. Also, we point out that the EIT is also applicable to radiative
transfer in optically \emph{thick} matters. However, radiative transfer in
optically \emph{thin} matters can not be described by EIT, because the
non-self-interacting nature of photons is incompatible with a basic requirement
of EIT, ""the bilinear form of entropy production rate"". The break down of EIT
in optically thin situation is not explicitly recognized in standard references

radiative transfer in optically thin situations is also explained. (This

nuclear energy effectively increases the fraction of unbound ejecta. This
effect is weaker for a heavy WD with 1.2 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, because the
specific orbital energy distribution of the debris is predominantly determined
by the tidal force, rather than by the explosive reactions. The elemental yield
of a TDE depends critically on the initial composition of a WD, while the BH

passage, promoting formation of an accretion disc. We expect that relativistic
jets and/or winds would form in these cases because accretion rates would be

only distinguish particles with limited accuracy. We introduce two illustrative
models of sorting devices which are designed to separate a binary mixture, but
which sometimes make mistakes. In the first model, discrimination between
particle types is passive and sorting is driven, while the second model is
based on an active proofreading network, where both discrimination and sorting
have a tunable active component. We show that the performance of these devices
may be enhanced out of equilibrium, and we further probe how the quality of
particle sorting is maintained by trade-offs between the time taken and the

the similarity between particles gradually increases the work required to sort
them, eliminating the paradox, while preserving the limits imposed by standard

non-volatile memories (NVM) provides a solution to build fault tolerant HPC.
Data in NVM-based main memory are not lost when the system crashes because of
the non-volatility nature of NVM. However, because of volatile caches, data
must be logged and explicitly flushed from caches into NVM to ensure
consistence and correctness before crashes, which can cause large runtime
overhead.
  In this paper, we introduce an algorithm-based method to establish crash
consistence in NVM for HPC applications. We slightly extend application data
structures or sparsely flush cache blocks, which introduce ignorable runtime
overhead. Such extension or cache flushing allows us to use algorithm knowledge
to \textit{reason} data consistence or correct inconsistent data when the
application crashes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for three

Monte-Carlo simulation. Based on comprehensive performance evaluation on a

variables, and (ii) fit a least squares model on the lasso-selected set.
Conventional statistical wisdom tells us that we cannot make use of the

twice: once in running the lasso, and again in fitting the least squares model.

high probability, the set of variables selected by the lasso is identical to
the one selected by the noiseless lasso and is hence deterministic.
Consequently, the na\""{i}ve two-step approach can yield asymptotically valid
inference. We utilize this finding to develop the \emph{na\""ive confidence

This article provides a theoretical discussion of the fundamental physical
ingredients of these extreme phenomena. In the context of weakly magnetized
shocks, in particular, it is shown how the filamentation type instabilities,
which develop in the precursor of pair dominated or electron-ion shocks,
provide the seeds for the scattering of high energy particles as well as the
agent which preheats and slows down the incoming precursor plasma. This
analytical discussion is completed with a mesoscopic, non-linear model of
particle acceleration in relativistic shocks based on Monte Carlo techniques.
This Monte Carlo model uses a semi-phenomenological description of particle
scattering which allows it to calculate the back-reaction of accelerated
particles on the shock structure on length and momentum scales which are
currently beyond the range of microscopic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.

molecular weight inversion created above the hydrogen shell during first
dredge-up when helium-3 burns via 3He(3He,2p)4He. The standard 1D diffusive
mixing scheme cannot simultaneously match carbon and lithium abundances to NGC
6397 red giants. We investigate two modifications to the standard scheme: (1)
an advective two stream mixing algorithm, and (2) modifications to the standard
1D thermohaline mixing formalism. We cannot simultaneously match carbon and
lithium abundances using our two stream mixing approach. However we develop a
modified diffusive scheme with an explicit temperature dependence that can
simultaneously fit carbon and lithium abundances to NGC 6397 stars. Our
modified diffusive scheme induces mixing that is faster than the standard
theory predicts in the hotter part of the thermohaline region and mixing that
is slower in the cooler part. Our results infer that the extra mixing mechanism
needs further investigation and more observations are required, particularly
for stars in different clusters spanning a range in metallicity.

  of ""Thinking"" - ""Exploration"" Grows into ""Thinking"" through Learning -","The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and
  Decision Making (RLDM) 2017, 5 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expectation for the emergence of higher functions is getting larger in the
framework of end-to-end reinforcement learning using a recurrent neural
network. However, the emergence of ""thinking"" that is a typical higher function
is difficult to realize because ""thinking"" needs non fixed-point, flow-type
attractors with both convergence and transition dynamics. Furthermore, in order
to introduce ""inspiration"" or ""discovery"" in ""thinking"", not completely random
but unexpected transition should be also required.
  By analogy to ""chaotic itinerancy"", we have hypothesized that ""exploration""
grows into ""thinking"" through learning by forming flow-type attractors on
chaotic random-like dynamics. It is expected that if rational dynamics are
learned in a chaotic neural network (ChNN), coexistence of rational state
transition, inspiration-like state transition and also random-like exploration
for unknown situation can be realized.
  Based on the above idea, we have proposed new reinforcement learning using a
ChNN as an actor. The positioning of exploration is completely different from
the conventional one. The chaotic dynamics inside the ChNN produces exploration
factors by itself. Since external random numbers for stochastic action
selection are not used, exploration factors cannot be isolated from the output.
Therefore, the learning method is also completely different from the
conventional one.
  At each non-feedback connection, one variable named causality trace takes in
and maintains the input through the connection according to the change in its
output. Using the trace and TD error, the weight is updated.
  In this paper, as the result of a recent simple task to see whether the new
learning works or not, it is shown that a robot with two wheels and two visual
sensors reaches a target while avoiding an obstacle after learning though there
are still many rooms for improvement.

task with many meaningful applications. The challenge of this task mainly comes
from: (1) unavailable bounding boxes for pedestrians and the model needs to
search for the person over the whole gallery images; (2) huge variance of
visual appearance of a particular person owing to varying poses, lighting
conditions, and occlusions. To address these two critical issues in modern
person search applications, we propose a novel Individual Aggregation Network
(IAN) that can accurately localize persons by learning to minimize intra-person
feature variations. IAN is built upon the state-of-the-art object detection
framework, i.e., faster R-CNN, so that high-quality region proposals for
pedestrians can be produced in an online manner. In addition, to relieve the
negative effect caused by varying visual appearances of the same individual,
IAN introduces a novel center loss that can increase the intra-class
compactness of feature representations. The engaged center loss encourages
persons with the same identity to have similar feature characteristics.
Extensive experimental results on two benchmarks, i.e., CUHK-SYSU and PRW, well
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. In particular, IAN achieves
77.23% mAP and 80.45% top-1 accuracy on CUHK-SYSU, which outperform the
state-of-the-art by 1.7% and 1.85%, respectively.

nondegenerate on-site potential and a nonlinear gradient coupling. For a
generic nonlinear coupling, one encounters a special regime of transitions,
characterized by extremely narrow fronts, far supersonic velocities of
propagation and long waves in the oscillatory tail. This regime can be
qualitatively associated with a shock wave. The front propagation can be
described with the help of a simple reduced-order model; the latter delivers a
kinetic law, which is almost not sensitive to fine details of the on-site
potential. Besides, it is possible to predict all main characteristics of the
transition front, including its shape and frequency and amplitude of the
oscillatory tail. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the
analytical predictions. The suggested approach allows one to consider the
effects of an external pre-load and on-site damping. When the damping is
moderate, the analysis remains in the frame of the reduced-order model. It is
possible to consider the solution for the front propagating in the damped chain
as a perturbation of the undamped dynamics. This approach yield reasonable
predictions. When the damping is high, the transition front enters a completely
different asymptotic regime. The gradient nonlinearity generically turns
negligible, and the propagating front converges to the exact solution obtained
from a simple linear continuous model.

near-surface Water-Equivalent Hydrogen (WEH) on Mars that have intriguing
implications for the global distribution of ""excess"" ice, which occurs when the
mass fraction of water ice exceeds the threshold amount needed to saturate the
pore volume in normal soils. We have refined the crossover technique of Feldman
et al. (2011) by using spatial deconvolution and Gaussian weighting to create
the first globally self-consistent map of WEH. At low latitudes, our new maps
indicate that WEH exceeds 15% in several near-equatorial regions, such as
Arabia Terra, which has important implications for the types of hydrated
minerals present at low latitudes. At high latitudes, we demonstrate that the
disparate MONS and Phoenix Robotic Arm (RA) observations of near surface WEH
can be reconciled by a three-layer model incorporating dry soil over fully
saturated pore ice over pure excess ice: such a three-layer model can also
potentially explain the strong anticorrelation of subsurface ice content and
ice table depth observed at high latitudes. At moderate latitudes, we show that
the distribution of recently formed impact craters is also consistent with our
latest MONS results, as both the shallowest ice-exposing crater and deepest
non-ice-exposing crater at each impact site are in good agreement with our
predictions of near-surface WEH. Overall, we find that our new mapping is
consistent with the widespread presence at mid-to-high Martian latitudes of
recently deposited shallow excess ice reservoirs that are not yet in
equilibrium with the atmosphere.

possible to calculate the decline of force-output capability of each muscle
along time. The plug-in is tested on a three-dimensional, 29 degree-of-freedom
human model. Motion data is obtained by motion capturing during an arbitrary
running at a speed of 3.96 m/s. Ten muscles are selected for concrete analysis.
As a result, the force-output capability of these muscles reduced to 60%-70%
after 10 minutes' running, on a general basis. Erector spinae, which loses
39.2% of its maximal capability, is found to be more fatigue-exposed than the
others. The influence of subject attributes (fatigability) is evaluated and

as their sophistication. Worldwide regulation oblige financial institutions to
manage and address model risk with the same severity as any other type of risk,
which besides defines model risk as the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect and misused model outputs and reports. Model risk
quantification is essential not only in meeting these requirements but for
institution's basic internal operative. It is however a complex task as any
comprehensive quantification methodology should at least consider the data used
for building the model, its mathematical foundations, the IT infrastructure,
overall performance and (most importantly) usage. Besides, the current amount
of models and different mathematical modelling techniques is overwhelming.
  Our proposal is to define quantification of model risk as a calculation of
the norm of some appropriate function that belongs to a Banach space, defined
over a weighted Riemannian manifold endowed with the Fisher--Rao metric. The
aim of the present contribution is twofold: Introduce a sufficiently general

programmability and implementation of traditional network functions into
generic hardware, in form of the so-called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).
Today, cloud service providers use Virtual Machines (VMs) for the instantiation
of VNFs in the data center (DC) networks. To instantiate multiple VNFs in a
typical scenario of Service Function Chains (SFCs), many important objectives
need to be met simultaneously, such as server load balancing, energy efficiency
and service execution time. The well-known \emph{VNF placement} problem
requires solutions that often consider \emph{migration} of virtual machines
(VMs) to meet this objectives. Ongoing efforts, for instance, are making a
strong case for migrations to minimize energy consumption, while showing that
attention needs to be paid to the Quality of Service (QoS) due to service
interruptions caused by migrations. To balance the server allocation strategies
and QoS, we propose using \emph{replications} of VNFs to reduce migrations in
DC networks. We propose a Linear Programming (LP) model to study a trade-off
between replications, which while beneficial to QoS require additional server
resources, and migrations, which while beneficial to server load management can
adversely impact the QoS. The results show that, for a given objective, the
replications can reduce the number of migrations and can also enable a better
server and data center network load balancing.

dynamics of stabilizing consensus, hence answering the main open question of
Becchetti et al. [SODA'16].
  Consider a distributed system of n nodes, each initially holding an opinion
in {1, 2, ..., k}. The system should converge to a setting where all
(non-corrupted) nodes hold the same opinion. This consensus opinion should be
\emph{valid}, meaning that it should be among the initially supported opinions,
and the (fast) convergence should happen even in the presence of a malicious
adversary who can corrupt a bounded number of nodes per round and in particular
modify their opinions. A well-studied distributed algorithm for this problem is
the 3-majority dynamics, which works as follows: per round, each node gathers
three opinions --- say by taking its own and two of other nodes sampled at
random --- and then it sets its opinion equal to the majority of this set; ties
are broken arbitrarily, e.g., towards the node's own opinion.
  Becchetti et al. [SODA'16] showed that the 3-majority dynamics converges to
consensus in O((k^2\sqrt{\log n} + k\log n)(k+\log n)) rounds, even in the
presence of a limited adversary. We prove that, even with a stronger adversary,
the convergence happens within O(k\log n) rounds. This bound is known to be
optimal.

training set. The key aspects of our learning method are that the associated
penalty function is constrained to be convex and the convergence of the ADMM
iterations is proven. As a result of these theoretical guarantees, adaptation
of the proposed framework to different levels of measurement noise is extremely
simple and does not require any retraining. We apply our method to estimation
of both sparse and non-sparse models of L\'{e}vy processes for which the
minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators are available. We carry out a
single training session and perform comparisons at various signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) values. Simulations illustrate that the performance of our
algorithm is practically identical to the one of the MMSE estimator
irrespective of the noise power.

because each input in a dataset possess different features. MOGP guided an
initial HFNT population towards Pareto-optimal solutions, where the final
population was used for making an ensemble system. A diversity index measure
along with approximation error and complexity was introduced to maintain
diversity among the candidates in the population. Hence, the ensemble was
created by using accurate, structurally simple, and diverse candidates from
MOGP final population. Differential evolution algorithm was applied to
fine-tune the underlying parameters of the selected candidates. A comprehensive
test over classification, regression, and time-series datasets proved the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm over other available prediction methods.

Unconventional superconductivity refers to superconductors where the Cooper

other kind, e. g. spin fluctuations in a superconductor with magnetic order
either coexistent or nearby in the phase diagram. Such unconventional
superconductivity has been known experimentally since heavy fermion CeCu2Si2,
with its strongly correlated 4f electrons, was discovered to superconduct below
0.6 K in 1979. Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the
layered cuprates in 1986, the study of these materials saw Tc jump to 164 K by
1994. Further progress in high temperature superconductivity would be aided by
understanding the cause of such unconventional pairing. This review compares
the fundamental properties of 9 unconventional superconducting classes of
materials - from 4f-electron heavy fermions to organic superconductors to
classes where only three known members exist to the cuprates with over 200
examples, with the hope that common features will emerge to help theory explain
(and predict!) these phenomena. In addition, three new emerging classes of

We use an edge cache mechanism to reduce the disk I/O overhead, and design a
hybrid strategy to improve the communication performance. GraphH can
efficiently process big graphs in small clusters or even a single commodity

that, for $d$-dimensional signals whose derivatives up to order $L$ are all in

made to go down as $O(h^L)$ when the sampling step $h$ tends to $0$. The
sufficient condition for this decay rate is that the generating kernel belongs

order $L$. We show that the $O(h^L)$ behavior of the error is attainable for
both approximation schemes using projection (when the signal is prefiltered
with the dual kernel) and interpolation (when a prefilter is unavailable). The
requirement on the signal for the interpolation method, however, is slightly
more stringent than that of the projection because we need to increase the
smoothness of the signal by a margin of $d/p+\varepsilon$, for arbitrary
$\varepsilon >0$. This extra amount of derivatives is used to make sure that

$^{22}$Ne($\alpha,n$)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg
reactions. The strengths of these reactions as functions of temperature are one
of the major uncertainties in the $s$-process. Methods: Inelastically scattered
$\alpha$ particles from a $^{26}$Mg target were momentum-analysed in the K600
magnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS, South Africa. The differential cross
sections of states were deduced from the focal-plane trajectory of the
scattered $\alpha$ particles. Based on the differential cross sections, spin
and parity assignments to states are made. Results: A new $0^+$ state was
observed in addition to a number of other states, some of which can be
associated with states observed in other experiments. Some of the deduced
$J^\pi$ values of the states observed in the present study show discrepancies
with those assigned in an experiment performed at RCNP Osaka. Conclusion: The
high level density at this excitation energy in $^{26}$Mg makes assigning
$J^\pi$ values to observed states difficult. Further experimental
investigations with superior experimental energy resolution are required to
clarify the number of levels in $^{26}$Mg, especially between the

  Teleoperation Systems: A Dedicated Case Study","6 pages, 9 figures, conference",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Networked teleoperation with haptic feedback is a prime example for the
emerging Tactile Internet, which requires a careful orchestration of haptic
communication and control. One major challenge in this context is how to
maximize the user's quality-of-experience (QoE) while ensuring at the same time
the stability of the global control loop in the presence of communication
delay. In this paper, we propose a dynamic control scheme switching strategy
for teleoperation systems, which maximizes the QoE for time-varying
communication delay. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed
approach, we perform a dedicated case study for a virtual teleoperation
environment consisting of a one-dimensional spring-damper system, and conduct
extensive subjective tests under various delay conditions for two control
schemes: (1) teleoperation with the time-domain passivity approach (TDPA),
which is highly delay-sensitive but supports highly dynamic interaction between
the operator and a potentially quickly changing remote environment; (2)
model-mediated teleoperation (MMT), which is tolerable to relatively larger
communication delays, but unsuitable for quickly changing, highly dynamic
remote environments. For both schemes, we use recently proposed extensions,
which incorporate perceptual data reduction to reduce the required packet rate
between the operator and the teleoperator. One key contribution of this paper
lies in the exploration of the intrinsic relationship among QoE, communication
delay and the control schemes which provides a fundamental guidance, not only
to this research, but also to the future joint optimization of communication
and control for time-delayed teleoperation systems.

contrasts information from sampled random walks with non-existent edges.
Individually, both of these contributions improve the learned representations,
especially when there are memory constraints on the total size of the

the state-of-the-art by learning more concise representations that better
preserve the graph structure.

proposed method learn representations with error reductions of up to 76% and
55%, on directed and undirected graphs. In addition, we show that the

The presence of aromatic groups on the cation is also favourable for graphene.
No beneficial effect was found between fluorine-containing anions and
fluorographene. We also analysed the ordering of ions in the interfacial layers

seek to understand the morphological properties and formation mechanisms of
small-scale umbral brightenings (SSUBs; analogous to umbral micro-jets) and to
understand whether links between these events and short dynamic fibrils, umbral
flashes, and umbral dots can be established. An SST filtergram time-series
sampling the Ca II H line and a CRISP full-Stokes 15-point Ca II 8542 A line
scan dataset were used. The average lifetime and lengths of 54 SSUBs identified
in the sunspot umbra are found to be 44.2 seconds (sigma=20 seconds) and 0.56""
(sigma=0.14""). The spatial positioning and morphological evolution of these
events was investigated finding no evidence of parabolic or ballistic profiles
nor a preference for co-spatial formation with umbral flashes. The presence of
Stokes V profile reversals provided evidence that these events could form
through the development of shocks in the chromosphere. The application of the
weak-field approximation indicated that changes in the line-of-sight magnetic
field were not responsible for the modifications to the line profile and
suggested that thermodynamic effects are the actual cause of the increased
emission. Finally, a sub-set of SSUBs were observed to form at the foot-points
of short dynamic fibrils. Overall, we found no correlation between the spatial
locations where these events were observed and the occurrence of umbral dots
and umbral flashes. SSUBs, however, have lifetimes and spectral signatures
comparable to umbral flashes and are located at the footpoints of short dynamic
fibrils, during or at the end of the red-shifted stage. It is possible,
therefore, that these features form due to the shocking of fibrilar material in
the lower atmosphere upon its return under gravity.

tested measurement method is targeted at determination of ITR in particulate

thermal conductivity. Method of such measurement is proposed and tested on two
cases of particle-filled polymer composites. Positive verification results were

However, bifurcation theory has been developed mostly for smooth dynamical

understanding the changes of dynamics in some widely used classes of artificial
neural network models. This article is an attempt to fill this gap, through the
introduction of algorithms that perform a semi-analytical bifurcation analysis

means of the state-to-state transition probability matrix. The algorithms
determine how the network parameters affect the degree of multistability, the
emergence and the period of the neural oscillations, and the formation of
symmetry-breaking in the neural populations. While this technique can be
applied to networks with arbitrary (generally asymmetric) connectivity
matrices, in particular we introduce a highly efficient algorithm for the

follows the band-like transport. Beyond the disorder drift time, the charge
decay is not fully exponential, dispersive and it follows the incoherent

mine urban conversion rules in different homogeneous economic development

high spatial resolution (30 meters). Firstly, we clustered several homogeneous
economic development regions among China according to official statistical

conversion rules and carried out simulation of urban expansion and farmland
loss at each homo-region. The proposed model was implemented on Tianhe-1

that the simulation result of proposed RFA-based CA model is more in agreement

farmland loss in China is rapid urbanization from 2000, and the farmland loss
rate is expected to slow down gradually and will stabilize from 2010 to 2030.

conditions in neutron star envelopes. The flux decay of the bursts has been
traditionally modelled with an exponential, even if theoretical considerations
predict power-law-like decays. We have analysed a total of 540 type-I X-ray
bursts from five low-mass X-ray binaries observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. We grouped the bursts according to the source spectral state during
which they were observed (hard or soft), flagging those bursts that showed
signs of photospheric radius expansion (PRE). The decay phase of all the bursts
were then fitted with a dynamic power-law index method. This method provides a
new way of probing the chemical composition of the accreted material. Our
results show that in the hydrogen-rich sources the power-law decay index is
variable during the burst tails and that simple cooling models qualitatively
describe the cooling of presumably helium-rich sources 4U 1728-34 and 3A
1820-303. The cooling in the hydrogen-rich sources 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-536, and
GS 1826-24, instead, is clearly different and depends on the spectral states
and whether PRE occurred or not. Especially the hard state bursts behave
differently than the models predict, exhibiting a peculiar rise in the cooling
index at low burst fluxes, which suggests that the cooling in the tail is much
faster than expected. Our results indicate that the drivers of the bursting
behaviour are not only the accretion rate and chemical composition of the
accreted material, but also the cooling that is somehow linked to the spectral
states. The latter suggests that the properties of the burning layers deep in
the neutron star envelope might be impacted differently depending on the
spectral state.

\textit{super-correlation}, the requirement for a larger dimension of the
preshared randomness to simulate the correlations than that of the quantum
states that generate them. Since unsteerable states form a subset of Bell local
states, it is an interesting question whether certain unsteerable states can be
super-correlated. Here, we answer this question in the affirmative. In
particular, the quantumness of certain unsteerable correlations can be pointed
out by the notion of \textit{super-unsteerability}, the requirement for a
larger dimension of the classical variable that the steering party has to
preshare with the trusted party for simulating the correlations than that of
the quantum states which reproduce them. This provides a generalized approach
to quantify the quantumness of unsteerable correlations in convex operational
theories.

assessing the risk of the portfolio through the ""amount of randomness"" conveyed

the exponential of R\'enyi entropy, an information-theoretic criterion that
precisely quantifies the uncertainty embedded in a distribution, accounting for
higher-order moments. Compared to Shannon entropy, R\'enyi entropy features a
parameter that can be tuned to play around the notion of uncertainty. A
Gram-Charlier expansion shows that it controls the relative contributions of
the central (variance) and tail (kurtosis) parts of the distribution in the
measure. We further rely on a non-parametric estimator of the exponential
R\'enyi entropy that extends a robust sample-spacings estimator initially

heavy $b \to c$ quark current. We first consider a HQET sum rule, which
provides a bound on the slopes of Isgur-Wise functions which we then calculate
in the Bakamjian-Thomas framework which both guaranties covariance in the heavy
quark limit and satisfies a set of HQET sum rules. We observe a remarkable
property that for a large variety of wave functions the transition to the first
radial excitation is very small while the transition matrix element to the
second radial excitation is large and dominant in saturating the HQET sum rule.
This is opposite to what is found in non-relativistic models, where the
transition to the first radial excitation dominates the sum rule. The relative
magnitude of the transition to the second excitation appears to be weakly
dependent on the dynamical scale (radius of the bound states), and the same
holds true for the slope of the elastic transition. These features could be
tested in the heavy mass limit of lattice QCD. This pattern is shown to be
related to the general structure of the Bakamjian-Thomas model, it is
independent of the spin structure of the approach and derives mainly from the
Lorentz transformation of the spatial wave function, a feature often
disregarded in quark models.

self-affine random fields. We present a close relationship between the carrying
dimension of the corresponding self-affine random occupation measure introduced
by U. Z\""ahle and the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of self-affine fields.
In the case of exponential scaling operators, the dimension formula can be
explicitly calculated by means of the singular value function. This also
enables to get a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the range of
general self-affine random fields under mild regularity assumptions.

potential of cloud resources in robotic software is difficult, because it
involves complex code modification and extensive (re)configuration procedures.
Moreover, quality of service (QoS) such as timeliness, which is critical to
robot's behavior, have to be considered. In this paper, we propose a
transparent and QoS-aware software framework called Cloudroid for cloud robotic
applications. This framework supports direct deployment of existing robotic
software packages to the cloud, transparently transforming them into
Internet-accessible cloud services. And with the automatically generated
service stubs, robotic applications can outsource their computation to the
cloud without any code modification. Furthermore, the robot and the cloud can
cooperate to maintain the specific QoS property such as request response time,
even in a highly dynamic and resource-competitive environment. We evaluated
Cloudroid based on a group of typical robotic scenarios and a set of software
packages widely adopted in real-world robot practices. Results show that
robot's capability can be enhanced significantly without code modification and
specific QoS objectives can be guaranteed. In certain tasks, the ""cloud +

agents are looking for a treasure that is placed in one of the boxes indexed by

the expected time until the first agent finds it. Searchers run in parallel
where at each time step each searcher can ""peek"" into a box. A basic family of
algorithms which are inherently robust is \emph{non-coordinating} algorithms.
Such algorithms act independently at each searcher, differing only by their
probabilistic choices. We are interested in the price incurred by employing
such algorithms when compared with the case of full coordination. We first show
that there exists a non-coordination algorithm, that knowing only the relative
likelihood of boxes according to $p$, has expected running time of at most
$10+4(1+\frac{1}{k})^2 T$, where $T$ is the expected running time of the best
fully coordinated algorithm. This result is obtained by applying a refined
version of the main algorithm suggested by Fraigniaud, Korman and Rodeh in
STOC'16, which was designed for the context of linear parallel search.We then
describe an optimal non-coordinating algorithm for the case where the
distribution $p$ is known. The running time of this algorithm is difficult to
analyse in general, but we calculate it for several examples. In the case where
$p$ is uniform over a finite set of boxes, then the algorithm just checks boxes
uniformly at random among all non-checked boxes and is essentially $2$ times
worse than the coordinating algorithm.We also show simple algorithms for Pareto
distributions over $M$ boxes. That is, in the case where $p(x) \sim 1/x^b$ for
$0< b < 1$, we suggest the following algorithm: at step $t$ choose uniformly
from the boxes unchecked in ${1, . . . ,min(M, \lfloor t/\sigma\rfloor)}$,
where $\sigma = b/(b + k - 1)$. It turns out this algorithm is asymptotically
optimal, and runs about $2+b$ times worse than the case of full coordination.

The discrepancy persists despite doubling the model eddy diffusion. While the

presented as a new tool to infer physical properties about GRB emission via
spectral fitting of empirical models. Following the tradition of the
'line-of-death', the spectral width has been used to rule out synchrotron
emission in a majority of GRBs. This claim is investigated via reexamination of
previously reported width measures. Then, a sample of peak-flux GRB spectra are
fit with an idealized, physical synchrotron model. It is found that many
spectra can be adequately fit by this model even when the width measures would
reject it. Thus, the results advocate for fitting a physical model to be the
sole tool for testing that model. Finally, a smoothly-broken power law is fit
to these spectra allowing for the spectral curvature to vary during the fitting
process in order to understand why the previous width measures poorly predict

universe, are excellent test-beds for dark matter theories. Unfortunately, mass
modelling of these systems suffers from the well documented mass-velocity
anisotropy degeneracy. For the case of spherically symmetric systems, we
describe a method for non-parametric modelling of the radial and tangential
velocity moments. The method is a numerical velocity anisotropy ""inversion"",
with parametric mass models, where the radial velocity dispersion profile,
$\sigma_{\mathrm{rr}}^2$ is modeled as a B-spline, and the optimization is a
three step process that consists of: (i) an Evolutionary modelling to determine
the mass model form and the best B-spline basis to represent
$\sigma_{\mathrm{rr}}^2$; (ii) an optimization of the smoothing parameters;
(iii) a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine the physical parameters.
The mass-anisotropy degeneracy is reduced into mass model inference,
irrespective of kinematics. We test our method using synthetic data. Our
algorithm constructs the best kinematic profile and discriminates between
competing dark matter models. We apply our method to the Fornax dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. Using a King brightness profile and testing various dark
matter mass models, our model inference favours a simple mass-follows-light
system. We find that the anisotropy profile of Fornax is tangential ($\beta(r)
< 0$) and we estimate a total mass of $M_{\text{tot}} = 1.613
^{+0.050}_{-0.075} \times 10^8 \, \text{M}_{\odot}$, and a mass-to-light ratio
of $\Upsilon_V = 8.93 ^{+0.32}_{-0.47} \, (\text{M}_{\odot}/\text{L}_{\odot})$.
The algorithm we present is a robust and computationally inexpensive method for
non-parametric modelling of spherical clusters independent of the

a small Lyman $\alpha$ blob (LAB) and to be absorbed by a proximate damped
Ly$\alpha$ (PDLA) system.
  Here, we present the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field
spectroscopy follow-up of this quasi-stellar object (QSO). Our primary goal is
to characterize this LAB in detail by mapping it both spatially and spectrally
using the Ly$\alpha$ line, and by looking for high-ionization lines to
constrain the emission mechanism.
  Combining the high sensitivity of the MUSE integral field spectrograph
mounted on the Yepun telescope at ESO-VLT with the natural coronagraph provided
by the PDLA, we map the LAB down to the QSO position, after robust subtraction
of QSO light in the spectral domain.
  In addition to confirming earlier results for the small bright component of
the LAB, we unveil a faint filamentary emission protruding to the south over
about 80 pkpc (physical kpc); this results in a total size of about 120 pkpc.
We derive the velocity field of the LAB (assuming no transfer effects) and map
the Ly$\alpha$ line width. Upper limits are set to the flux of the N V $\lambda
1238-1242$, C IV $\lambda 1548-1551$, He II $\lambda 1640$, and C III] $\lambda
1548-1551$ lines. We have discovered two probable Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the
same redshift as the LAB and at projected distances of 265 kpc and 207 kpc from
the QSO; their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities might well be enhanced by the QSO
radiation. We also find an emission line galaxy at $z=0.33$ near the line of
sight to the QSO.
  This LAB shares the same general characteristics as the 17 others surrounding
radio-quiet QSOs presented previously. However, there are indications that it
may be centered on the PDLA galaxy rather than on the QSO.

These structures
can exhibit different patterns, namely grand design and flocculent arms, with
easily distinguishable characteristics. However, their origin and the
mechanisms shaping them are unclear. The overall role of spirals in the
chemical evolution of disc galaxies is another unsolved question. In
particular, it has not been fully explored if the \hii\,regions of spiral arms
present different properties from those located in the interarm regions. Here
we analyse the radial oxygen abundance gradient of the arm and interarm star
forming regions of 63 face-on spiral galaxies using CALIFA Integral Field
Spectroscopy data. We focus the analysis on three characteristic parameters of
the profile: slope, zero-point, and scatter. The sample is morphologically
separated into flocculent versus grand design spirals and barred versus
unbarred galaxies. We find subtle but statistically significant differences
between the arm and interarm distributions for flocculent galaxies, suggesting
that the mechanisms generating the spiral structure in these galaxies may be
different to those producing grand design systems, for which no significant
differences are found. We also find small differences in barred galaxies, not
observed in unbarred systems, hinting that bars may affect the chemical
distribution of these galaxies but not strongly enough as to be reflected in
the overall abundance distribution. In light of these results, we propose bars
and flocculent structure as two distinct mechanisms inducing differences in the
abundance distribution between arm and interarm star forming regions.

we study the query complexity of these functions in a variety of settings. We
consider settings that allow for active queries or passive observation of a

is that any comparison-based choice function in one dimension can be inferred

The aim of this paper is to show that the solution of the Rosenau equation, as

conditions, can be implemented using RBF approximation methods. We extend the
fictitious point method and the resampling method to work in combination with
an RBF collocation method. Both approaches are implemented in one and two space

order of convergence can be achieved for the Rosenau equation. The numerical
experiments show that both methods perform well. In the one-dimensional case,
the accuracy of the RBF approaches is compared with that of a pseudospectral
resampling method, showing similar or slightly better accuracy for the RBF
methods. In the two-dimensional case, the Rosenau problem is solved both in a

limited window in the inflationary dynamics. In this essay, we argue that
quantum corrections to the classical dynamics of cosmological fields allow us
to probe much earlier epochs of the inflationary phase and extend this window
by many orders of magnitude. We point out that both the statistics of
cosmological fluctuations at observable scales, and the field displacements
acquired by spectator fields that play an important role in many
post-inflationary processes, are sensitive to a much longer phase of the

resistance) of metal contacts to thermal management of graphene devices, prior
reported thermal conductance of metal/graphene interfaces are all relatively
low, only 20-40 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. One possible route to improve the thermal
conductance ($G$) of metal/graphene interfaces is through additional heat
conduction by electrons, since graphene can be easily doped by metals. In this
paper, we evaluate the electronic heat conduction across metal/graphene
interfaces by measuring the thermal conductance of Pd/transferred graphene
(trG)/Pd interfaces, prepared by either thermal evaporation or radio-frequency
(rf) magnetron sputtering, over a wide temperature range of 80 to 500 K. We
find that for the samples prepared by thermal evaporation, the thermal
conductance of Pd/trG/Pd is 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. The thermal conductance
only weakly depends on temperature, which suggests that heat is predominantly
carried by phonons across the intrinsic Pd/graphene interface. However, for
Pd/trG/Pd samples with the top Pd films deposited by rf magnetron sputtering,
we observe a significant increment of thermal conductance from the intrinsic
value of 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ to 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and $G$ is
roughly proportional to $T$. We attribute the enhancement of thermal
conductance to an additional channel of heat transport by electrons via
atomic-scale pinholes formed in the graphene during the sputtering process. We
thus conclude that electrons play a negligible role in heat conduction across
intrinsic interfaces of metal and pristine graphene, and the contribution of
electrons is only substantial if graphene is damaged.

  arbitrary and network interference",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized experiments on a network often involve interference between
connected units; i.e., a situation in which an individual's treatment can
affect the response of another individual. Current approaches to deal with
interference, in theory and in practice, often make restrictive assumptions on
its structure---for instance, assuming that interference is local---even when
using otherwise nonparametric inference strategies. This reliance on explicit
restrictions on the interference mechanism suggests a shared intuition that
inference is impossible without any assumptions on the interference structure.
In this paper, we begin by formalizing this intuition in the context of a
classical nonparametric approach to inference, referred to as design-based
inference of causal effects. Next, we show how, always in the context of
design-based inference, even parametric structural assumptions that allow the
existence of unbiased estimators, cannot guarantee a decreasing variance even
in the large sample limit. This lack of concentration in large samples is often
observed empirically, in randomized experiments in which interference of some
form is expected to be present. This result has direct consequences for the
design and analysis of large experiments---for instance, in online social
platforms---where the belief is that large sample sizes automatically guarantee
small variance. More broadly, our results suggest that although strategies for
causal inference in the presence of interference borrow their formalism and
main concepts from the traditional causal inference literature, much of the
intuition from the no-interference case do not easily transfer to the
interference setting.

problem. In the k-server problem, we are required to minimize the total
movement of k servers that are serving an online sequence of t requests in a
metric. In the stochastic setting we are given t independent distributions
<P_1, P_2,..., P_t> in advance, and at every time step i a request is drawn
from Pi. Designing the optimal online algorithm in such setting is NP-hard,
therefore the emphasis of our work is on designing an approximately optimal
online algorithm. We first show a structural characterization for a certain
class of non-adaptive online algorithms. We prove that in general metrics, the
best of such algorithms has a cost of no worse than three times that of the
optimal online algorithm. Next, we present an integer program that finds the
optimal algorithm of this class for any arbitrary metric. Finally, by rounding
the solution of the linear relaxation of this program, we present an online
algorithm for the stochastic k-server problem with the approximation factor of
3 in the line and circle metrics and O(log n) in a general metric of size n.
Moreover, we define the Uber problem, in which each demand consists of two
endpoints, a source and a destination. We show that given an a-approximation
algorithm for the k-server problem, we can obtain an (a+2)-approximation
algorithm for the Uber problem. Motivated by the fact that demands are usually
highly correlated with the time we study the stochastic Uber problem.
Furthermore, we extend our results to the correlated setting where the
probability of a request arriving at a certain point depends not only on the
time step but also on the previously arrived requests.

possible k-tuples of variables with decision variable is computed. Then, for
each variable the maximal information gain due to interactions with other
variables is obtained. For non-informative variables this quantity conforms to
the well known statistical distributions. This allows for discerning truly
informative variables from non-informative ones. For demonstration of the
approach, the method is applied to several synthetic datasets that involve
complex multidimensional interactions between variables. It is capable of
identifying most important informative variables, even in the case when the
dimensionality of the analysis is smaller than the true dimensionality of the
problem. What is more, the high sensitivity of the algorithm allows for
detection of the influence of nuisance variables on the response variable.

super-resolution. The non-iterative phase reconstruction relies on the
acquisition of single images at each z-location and thus enables
straightforward 3D phase imaging using a classical microscope. We realized
multi-plane imaging using a customized prism for the simultaneous acquisition
of 8 planes. This allowed us to not only image live cells in 3D at up to 200
Hz, but also to integrate fluorescence super-resolution optical fluctuation
imaging within the same optical instrument. This 4D microscope platform unifies
the sensitivity and high temporal resolution of phase tomography with the
specificity and high spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging.

relation combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) data have provided excellent constraints on the standard
cosmological model. Here, we examine particular classes of alternative
cosmologies, motivated by various physical mechanisms, e.g. scalar fields,
modified gravity and phase transitions to test their consistency with
observations of SNe~Ia and the ratio of the angular diameter distances from the
CMB and BAO. Using a model selection criterion for a relative comparison of the
models (the Bayes Factor), we find moderate to strong evidence that the data
prefer flat $\Lambda$ CDM over models invoking a thawing behaviour of the
quintessence scalar field. However, some exotic models like the growing
neutrino mass cosmology and vacuum metamorphosis still present acceptable
evidence values. The bimetric gravity model with only the linear interaction
term can be ruled out by the combination of SNe~Ia and CMB/BAO datasets whereas
the model with linear and quadratic interaction terms has a comparable evidence
value to standard $\Lambda$ CDM. Thawing models are found to have significantly
poorer evidence compared to flat $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology under the assumption
that the CMB compressed likelihood provides an adequate description for these
non-standard cosmologies. We also present estimates for constraints from future
data and find that geometric probes from oncoming surveys can put severe limits

An
HFIT produces an optimum treelike structure, i.e., a natural hierarchical
structure that accommodates simplicity by combining several low-dimensional
fuzzy inference systems (FISs). Such a natural hierarchical structure provides
a high degree of approximation accuracy. The construction of HFIT takes place
in two phases. Firstly, a nondominated sorting based multiobjective genetic
programming (MOGP) is applied to obtain a simple tree structure (a low
complexity model) with a high accuracy. Secondly, the differential evolution
algorithm is applied to optimize the obtained tree's parameters. In the derived
tree, each node acquires a different input's combination, where the
evolutionary process governs the input's combination. Hence, HFIT nodes are
heterogeneous in nature, which leads to a high diversity among the rules
generated by the HFIT. Additionally, the HFIT provides an automatic feature
selection because it uses MOGP for the tree's structural optimization that
accepts inputs only relevant to the knowledge contained in data. The HFIT was
studied in the context of both type-1 and type-2 FISs, and its performance was
evaluated through six application problems. Moreover, the proposed
multiobjective HFIT was compared both theoretically and empirically with
recently proposed FISs methods from the literature, such as McIT2FIS,
TSCIT2FNN, SIT2FNN, RIT2FNS-WB, eT2FIS, MRIT2NFS, IT2FNN-SVR, etc. From the
obtained results, it was found that the HFIT provided less complex and highly
accurate models compared to the models produced by the most of other methods.
Hence, the proposed HFIT is an efficient and competitive alternative to the
other FISs for function approximation and feature selection.

approximately 100 nC is produced from high-intensity laser interaction with
near-critical-density (NCD) plasma. Such e-beam impinges on a high-Z convertor
and then radiates energetic bremsstrahlung photons with flux approaching
10^{11} per laser shot. Taking long-lived radionuclide ^{126}Sn as an example,
the resulting transmutation reaction yield is the order of 10^{9} per laser
shot, which is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained from previous
studies. It is found that at lower densities, tightly focused laser irradiating
relatively longer NCD plasmas can effectively enhance the transmutation
efficiency. Furthermore, the photo-transmutation is generalized by considering
mixed-nuclide waste samples, which suggests that the laser-accelerated
high-charge e-beam could be an efficient tool to transmute long-lived nuclear

Since the fundamental work of Weibull, the probabilistic description of the

finite elements are used. Using the Lagrangian formalism, the shape gradient
via the adjoint equation is calculated at low computational cost. The
implementation is verified by comparison of it with a finite difference method

  Instantaneous Instruction Execution","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1606.05416",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been great progress recently in formally specifying the memory
model of microprocessors like ARM and POWER. These specifications are, however,
too complicated for reasoning about program behaviors, verifying compilers
etc., because they involve microarchitectural details like the reorder buffer
(ROB), partial and speculative execution, instruction replay on speculation
failure, etc. In this paper we present a new Instantaneous Instruction
Execution (I2E) framework which allows us to specify weak memory models in the
same style as SC and TSO. Each instruction in I2E is executed instantaneously
and in-order such that the state of the processor is always correct. The effect
of instruction reordering is captured by the way data is moved between the
processors and the memory non-deterministically, using three conceptual
devices: invalidation buffers, timestamps and dynamic store buffers. We prove
that I2E models capture the behaviors of modern microarchitectures and
cache-coherent memory systems accurately, thus eliminating the need to think
about microarchitectural details.

  Metal under Free Falling Microgravity Situation","16 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is
molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike
its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors
when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates
the major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand
such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for
space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost
experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was
proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the
test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on
outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution
inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational
activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial
vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test
capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental
procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:
(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from
its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if
initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional
shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of
the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal
immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.
The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space
were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should
be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space
technologies.

the equatorial plane. Now we extend our earlier work by taking into account
another configuration of large-scale magnetic field which is no longer
symmetric. We provide asymmetric field structures with small deviations from
even and odd symmetric $\textbf{B-}$field. Our results show that the disc's
dynamics and appearance become different above and below the equatorial plane.
The set of solutions also predicts that even a small deviation in a symmetric
field causes the disc to compress on one side and expand on the other. In some
cases, our solution represents a very strong outflow from just one side of the
disc. Therefore, the solution may potentially explain the origin of one-sided
jets in radio galaxies.

  Cellular Scenarios","Accepted, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) propagation is known to be severely affected by the
blockage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path. In contrast to microwave systems, at
shorter mmWave wavelengths such blockage can be caused by human bodies, where
their mobility within environment makes wireless channel alternate between the
blocked and non-blocked LoS states. Following the recent 3GPP requirements on
modeling the dynamic blockage as well as the temporal consistency of the
channel at mmWave frequencies, in this paper a new model for predicting the
state of a user in the presence of mobile blockers for representative 3GPP
scenarios is developed: urban micro cell (UMi) street canyon and
park/stadium/square. It is demonstrated that the blockage effects produce an
alternating renewal process with exponentially distributed non-blocked
intervals, and blocked durations that follow the general distribution. The
following metrics are derived (i) the mean and the fraction of time spent in
blocked/non-blocked state, (ii) the residual blocked/non-blocked time, and
(iii) the time-dependent conditional probability of having blockage/no blockage
at time t1 given that there was blockage/no blockage at time t0. The latter is
a function of the arrival rate (intensity), width, and height of moving
blockers, distance to the mmWave access point (AP), as well as the heights of
the AP and the user device. The proposed model can be used for system-level
characterization of mmWave cellular communication systems. For example, the
optimal height and the maximum coverage radius of the mmWave APs are derived,
while satisfying the required mean data rate constraint. The system-level
simulations corroborate that the use of the proposed method considerably
reduces the modeling complexity.

will only have a marginal contribution to a certain estimation task. Involving
all sensors increases the energy budget unnecessarily and decreases the
lifetime of the WASN. Using microphone subset selection, also termed as sensor
selection, the most informative sensors can be chosen from a set of candidate
sensors to achieve a prescribed inference performance. In this paper, we
consider microphone subset selection for minimum variance distortionless
response (MVDR) beamformer based noise reduction. The best subset of sensors is
determined by minimizing the transmission cost while constraining the output
noise power (or signal-to-noise ratio). Assuming the statistical information on
correlation matrices of the sensor measurements is available, the sensor
selection problem for this model-driven scheme is first solved by utilizing
convex optimization techniques. In addition, to avoid estimating the statistics
related to all the candidate sensors beforehand, we also propose a data-driven
approach to select the best subset using a greedy strategy. The performance of
the greedy algorithm converges to that of the model-driven method, while it
displays advantages in dynamic scenarios as well as on computational
complexity. Compared to a sparse MVDR or radius-based beamformer, experiments
show that the proposed methods can guarantee the desired performance with

tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die
filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a
model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose
(MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were
roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into
samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at
different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset
consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as
the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation
(CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate
the predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV
methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was
observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had
a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as
d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed
that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than
that of fine granules.
