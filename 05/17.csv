linear recurrent units allows us to bring more evidence on the intrinsic
hierarchical temporal representation in deep RNNs through frequency analysis
applied to the state signals. The potentiality of our approach is assessed on

powerful tool for machine learning. They serve as a data abstraction that makes
learning easier by capturing regularities in data explicitly. Their benefits
motivated their adaptation to relational learning context. In our previous
work, we introduce an approach that learns relational latent features by means
of clustering instances and their relations. The major drawback of latent
representations is that they are often black-box and difficult to interpret.
This work addresses these issues and shows that (1) latent features created by
clustering are interpretable and capture interesting properties of data; (2)
they identify local regions of instances that match well with the label, which
partially explains their benefit; and (3) although the number of latent
features generated by this approach is large, often many of them are highly
redundant and can be removed without hurting performance much.

challenging in the presence of skilled forgeries, where a forger has access to
a person's signature and deliberately attempt to imitate it. In offline
(static) signature verification, the dynamic information of the signature
writing process is lost, and it is difficult to design good feature extractors
that can distinguish genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. This reflects in
a relatively poor performance, with verification errors around 7% in the best
systems in the literature. To address both the difficulty of obtaining good
features, as well as improve system performance, we propose learning the
representations from signature images, in a Writer-Independent format, using
Convolutional Neural Networks. In particular, we propose a novel formulation of
the problem that includes knowledge of skilled forgeries from a subset of users
in the feature learning process, that aims to capture visual cues that
distinguish genuine signatures and forgeries regardless of the user. Extensive
experiments were conducted on four datasets: GPDS, MCYT, CEDAR and Brazilian
PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-160, we obtained a large improvement in
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 1.72% Equal Error Rate, compared to
6.97% in the literature. We also verified that the features generalize beyond
the GPDS dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance in the other
datasets, without requiring the representation to be fine-tuned to each
particular dataset.

  (2018)","10.1093/mnras/stx2571",,"astro-ph.IM physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recurring question arises when trying to characterize, by means of
measurements or theoretical calculations, the zenithal night sky brightness
throughout a large territory: how many samples per square kilometer are needed?
The optimum sampling distance should allow reconstructing, with sufficient
accuracy, the continuous zenithal brightness map across the whole region,
whilst at the same time avoiding unnecessary and redundant oversampling. This
paper attempts to provide some tentative answers to this issue, using two
complementary tools: the luminance structure function and the Nyquist-Shannon
spatial sampling theorem. The anaysis of several regions of the world, based on
the data from the New world atlas of artificial night sky brightness (Falchi et
al 2016, Sci. Adv. 2, e1600377) suggests that, as a rule of thumb, about one
measurement per square kilometer could be sufficient for determining the
zenithal night sky brightness of artificial origin at any point in a region to
within 0.1 magV/arcsec2 (in the root-mean-square sense) of its true value in
the Johnson-Cousins V band. The exact reconstruction of the zenithal night sky
brightness maps from samples taken at the Nyquist rate seems to be considerably
more demanding.

classes of a generic star flow X on a 3 or 4 manifold are either hyperbolic or
singular hyperbolic (see [MPP] for 3-manifolds and [GLW] on 4-manifolds). As it
is defined, the notion of singular hyperbolicity forces the singularities in

the same chain recurrence class of a star flow. Therefore the usual notion of
singular hyperbolicity is not enough for characterizing the star flows.
  We present a form of hyperbolicity (called multi-singular hyperbolic) which
makes compatible the hyperbolic structure of regular orbits together with the
one of singularities even if they have different indices. We show that
multisingular hyperbolicity implies that the flow is star, and conversely,
there is a C1-open and dense subset of the an open set of star flows which are

meson is reconstructed in the final state $K^{+}\pi^{-}$, which is required to
have an invariant mass within 100$\mathrm{\,MeV}c^2$ of the known

data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 3$\mathrm{\,fb}^{-1}$,
collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and
8$\mathrm{\,TeV}$. The ratio is measured in two regions of the dilepton
invariant mass squared, $q^{2}$, to be \begin{eqnarray*} R_{K^{*0}} =
\begin{cases} 0.66~^{+~0.11}_{-~0.07}\mathrm{\,(stat)} \pm

\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} The corresponding 95.4\% confidence level intervals
are $[0.52, 0.89]$ and $[0.53, 0.94]$. The results, which represent the most
precise measurements of $R_{K^{*0}}$ to date, are compatible with the Standard
Model expectations at the level of 2.1--2.3 and 2.4--2.5 standard deviations in
the two $q^{2}$ regions, respectively.

Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), but has not yet been exploited to the
extent it deserves. We have developed a method to model maps of the Stokes
parameters for shell-like SNRs during their Sedov evolution phase. At first,
3-dimensional structure of a SNR has been computed, by modeling the
distribution of the magnetohydrodynamic parameters and of the accelerated
particles. The generation and dissipation of the turbulent component of
magnetic field everywhere in SNR are also considered taking into account its
interaction with accelerated particles. Then, in order to model the emission,
we have used a generalization of the classical synchrotron theory, valid for
the case in which the magnetic field has ordered and disordered components.
Finally, 2-dimensional projected maps have been derived, for different
orientations of SNR and of interstellar magnetic field with respect to the
observer. An important effect to consider is the Faraday rotation of the
polarization planes inside the SNR interior. In this paper we present details
of the model, and describe general properties of the images.

farther than what a direct global factorization of the data can identify. We
evaluate the efficacy of the resulting factorizations for relative leveraging

factorization on representations learned by popular deep networks, providing
evidence of their ability to infer semantic relationships even when they are
not explicitly trained to do so. We show that this algorithm can be used as an

slowing their movement and inducing transient anomalous subdiffusion. The
presence of obstacles also modifies the kinetics and equilibrium behavior of
tracers. While previous theoretical studies of particle diffusion have
typically assumed either impenetrable obstacles or binding interactions that
immobilize the particle, in many cellular contexts bound particles remain
mobile. Examples include membrane proteins or lipids with some entry and
diffusion within lipid domains and proteins that can enter into membraneless
organelles or compartments such as the nucleolus. Using a lattice model, we
studied the diffusive movement of tracer particles which bind to soft
obstacles, allowing tracers and obstacles to occupy the same lattice site. For
sticky obstacles, bound tracer particles are immobile, while for slippery
obstacles, bound tracers can hop without penalty to adjacent obstacles. In both
models, binding significantly alters tracer motion. The type and degree of
motion while bound is a key determinant of the tracer mobility: slippery
obstacles can allow nearly unhindered diffusion, even at high obstacle filling
fraction. To mimic compartmentalization in a cell, we examined how obstacle
size and a range of bound diffusion coefficients affect tracer dynamics. The
behavior of the model is similar in two and three spatial dimensions. Our work
has implications for protein movement and interactions within cells.

masked by the onset of superconductivity near a quantum critical point. Use of
high magnetic fields to suppress superconductivity has enabled a detailed study
of the ground state in these systems. Yet, the direct effect of strong magnetic
fields on the metallic behavior at low temperatures is poorly understood,
especially near critical doping, $x=0.19$. Here we report a high-field
magnetoresistance study of thin films of \LSCO cuprates in close vicinity to
critical doping, $0.161\leq x\leq0.190$. We find that the metallic state
exposed by suppressing superconductivity is characterized by a
magnetoresistance that is linear in magnetic field up to the highest measured
fields of $80$T. The slope of the linear-in-field resistivity is
temperature-independent at very high fields. It mirrors the magnitude and
doping evolution of the linear-in-temperature resistivity that has been
ascribed to Planckian dissipation near a quantum critical point. This
establishes true scale-invariant conductivity as the signature of the strange
metal state in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates.

by a nonnegative scalar field potential. In the second case, we extended this

indefinitely, they decay over time. Interestingly, it is shown that all such

weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress towards
silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic
waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and
most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. Here, we harness these engineered
nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show
that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters an intriguing regime of

paradigm to detect situations of interest from basic sensor streams, building
an operator graph between sensors and applications. In order to detect event
patterns that correspond to situations of interest, each operator correlates
events on its incoming streams according to a sliding window mechanism. To
increase the throughput of an operator, different windows can be assigned to
different operator instances---i.e., identical operator copies---which process
them in parallel. This implies that events that are part of multiple
overlapping windows are replicated to different operator instances. The
communication overhead of replicating the events can be reduced by assigning
overlapping windows to the same operator instance. However, this imposes a
higher processing load on the single operator instance, possibly overloading
it. In this paper, we address the trade-off between processing load and
communication overhead when assigning overlapping windows to a single operator
instance. Controlling the trade-off is challenging and cannot be solved with
traditional reactive methods. To this end, we propose a model-based batch
scheduling controller building on prediction. Evaluations show that our
approach is able to significantly save bandwidth, while keeping a user-defined
latency bound in the operator instances.

bring about nontrivial changes on the ESR spectrum. Nevertheless, in the

incremental type checkers for object-oriented languages. This yields a novel

replace class tables by the dual concept of class table requirements and class
table operations by dual operations on class table requirements. We prove the

gravitational field profiles in the central $\sim$ 0.5 pc of the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC), the nearest embedded star cluster (or rather, proto-cluster)
hosting massive star formation available for detailed observational scrutiny.
We find that the stellar volume density is well characterized by a Plummer
profile $\rho_{stars}(r) = 5755\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm
pc}^{-3}\,(1+(r/a)^2)^{-5/2}$, where $a = 0.36$ pc. The gas density follows a
cylindrical power law $\rho_{gas}(R) = 25.9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm
pc}^{-3}\,(R/{\rm pc})^{-1.775}$. The stellar density profile dominates over
the gas density profile inside $r\,\sim\,1$ pc. The gravitational field is
gas-dominated at all radii, but the contribution to the total field by the
stars is nearly equal to that of the gas at $r\,\sim\,a$. This fact alone
demonstrates that the proto-cluster cannot be considered a gas-free system or a
virialized system dominated by its own gravity. The stellar proto-cluster core
is dynamically young, with an age of $\sim$ 2-3 Myr, a 1D velocity dispersion
of $\sigma_{\rm obs} = 2.6$ km s$^{-1}$, and a crossing time of $\sim$ 0.55
Myr. This timescale is almost identical to the gas filament oscillation
timescale estimated recently by Stutz & Gould (2016). This provides strong
evidence that the proto-cluster structure is regulated by the gas filament. The
proto-cluster structure may be set by tidal forces due to the oscillating
filamentary gas potential. Such forces could naturally suppress low density
stellar structures on scales $\gtrsim\,a$. The analysis presented here leads to
a new suggestion that clusters form by an analog of the ""slingshot mechanism""
previously proposed for stars.

HIFLUGCS consists of the 64 X-ray brightest clusters in the Universe, building
up a local sample of galaxy clusters. Here we utilize this sample to determine,
for the first time, individual hydrostatic mass estimates for all the clusters

constraints on the two interesting cosmological parameters, OmegaM and sigma8.
In paper I we describe the data analysis procedure and compared the individual
mass estimates with other references. Now we apply the total hydrostatic and
gas mass estimates from the X-ray analysis to a Bayesian cosmological
likelihood analysis and leave several parameters free to be constrained. We
find OmegaM = 0.30+-0.01 and sigma8 = 0.79+-0.03 (statistical uncertainties,
68% credibility level) using our default analysis strategy combining both, a
mass function analysis and the gas mass fraction results. The main sources of
biases that we also correct here are (1) the influence of galaxy groups, (2)
the hydrostatic mass bias, (3) the extrapolation of the total mass, (4) the
theoretical halo mass function and (5) other physical effects. We find that
galaxy groups introduce a strong bias, since their number density seems to be
over predicted by the halo mass function. On the other hand, baryonic effects
as incorporated by recent hydrodynamical simulations do not result in a
significant change in the constraints. The total systematic uncertainties (20%)
clearly dominate the statistical uncertainties on cosmological parameters.

exquisite detail. In the core of the group, the spatial resolution of Chandra
reveals the presence of a leading edge and a complex AGN-induced activity. The
morphology of the stripped gas tail appears straight in the innermost 250 kpc,
suggesting that magnetic draping efficiently shields the gas from its
surroundings. However, beyond $\sim300$ kpc from the core, the tail flares and
the morphology becomes strongly irregular, which could be explained by a
breaking of the drape, e.g. because of turbulent motions. The power spectrum of
surface-brightness fluctuations is relatively flat ($P_{2D}\propto k^{-2.3}$),
which indicates that thermal conduction is strongly inhibited even beyond the
region where magnetic draping is effective. The amplitude of density
fluctuations in the tail is consistent with a mild level of turbulence with a
Mach number $M_{3D}\sim0.1-0.25$. Overall, our results show that the processes
leading to the thermalization and mixing of the infalling gas are slow and
relatively inefficient.

under the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations. The formed haloes consist of a
soliton core supported against gravitational collapse by the quantum pressure
tensor and an asymptotic $r^{-3}$ NFW-like profile. We find a fundamental
relation of the core=to-halo mass with the dimensionless invariant $\Xi \equiv
\lvert E \rvert/M^3/(Gm/\hbar)^2$ or $M_{\rm c}/M \simeq 2.6 \Xi^{1/3}$,
linking the soliton to global halo properties. For $r \geq 3.5 \,r_{\rm c}$
core radii, we find equipartition between potential, classical kinetic, and
quantum gradient energies. The haloes also exhibit a conspicuous turbulent
behavior driven by the continuous reconnection of vortex lines due to wave
interference. We analyse the turbulence 1D velocity power spectrum and find a
$k^{-1.1}$ power-law. This suggests the vorticity in BECDM haloes is
homogeneous, similar to thermally-driven counterflow BEC systems from condensed
matter physics, in contrast to a $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov power-law seen in
mechanically-driven quantum systems. The mode where the power spectrum peaks is
approximately the soliton width, implying the soliton-sized granules carry most
of the turbulent energy in BECDM haloes.

vexing questions facing the exoplanet field. The complex chemistry, multiple
formation pathways, and lack of easily identifiable spectral features
associated with aerosols make it especially challenging to constrain their key
properties. We propose a transmission spectroscopy technique to identify the
primary aerosol formation mechanism for the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters
(HIHJs). The technique is based on the expectation that the two key types of
aerosols -- photochemically generated hazes and equilibrium condensate clouds
-- are expected to form and persist in different regions of a highly irradiated
planet's atmosphere. Haze can only be produced on the permanent daysides of
tidally-locked hot Jupiters, and will be carried downwind by atmospheric
dynamics to the evening terminator (seen as the trailing limb during transit).
Clouds can only form in cooler regions on the night side and morning terminator
of HIHJs (seen as the leading limb during transit). Because opposite limbs are
expected to be impacted by different types of aerosols, ingress and egress
spectra, which primarily probe opposing sides of the planet, will reveal the
dominant aerosol formation mechanism. We show that the benchmark HIHJ,
WASP-121b, has a transmission spectrum consistent with partial aerosol coverage
and that ingress-egress spectroscopy would constrain the location and formation
mechanism of those aerosols. In general, using this diagnostic we find that
observations with JWST and potentially with HST should be able to distinguish
between clouds and haze for currently known HIHJs.

that the eccentricity excitation occurs most efficiently when the nodal
precession timescale of the binary's orbit around the MBH due to the
non-spherical cluster becomes comparable (within a factor of ~10) to the
timescale on which the binary is torqued by the MBH due to the Lidov-Kozai (LK)
mechanism. We show that in this regime the perturbations due to the cluster
increase the fraction of systems that reach extreme eccentricities
($1-e\sim10^{-4}-10^{-6}$) by a factor of ~10-100 compared to the idealized
case of a spherical cluster, increasing the merger rates of compact objects by
a similar factor. We identify two main channels that lead to this extreme
eccentricity excitation: (i) chaotic diffusion of the eccentricities due to
resonance overlap; (ii) cluster-driven variations of the mutual inclinations
between the binary orbit and its center-of-mass orbit around the MBH, which can
intensify the LK oscillations. We estimate that our mechanism can produce black
hole-black hole and black hole-neutron star binary merger rates of up to
$\approx 15$ $\rm{Gpc}^{-3}yr^{-1}$ and $\approx 0.4$ $\rm{Gpc}^{-3}yr^{-1}$,

due to the difficulty of comparing surface brightness profiles with different
depths, photometric corrections and PSF effects (almost always ignored). We aim
to quantify the properties of Type-III (anti-truncated) discs in a sample of S0
galaxies at 0.2<z<0.6. In this paper, we present the sample selection and
describe in detail the methods to robustly trace the structure in their
outskirts and correct for PSF effects. We have selected and classified a sample
of 150 quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.6 in the GOODS-N field. We perform a
quantitative structural analysis of 44 S0-E/S0 galaxies. We corrected their
surface brightness profiles for PSF distortions and analysed the biases in the
structural and photometric parameters when the PSF correction is not applied.
Additionally, we have developed Elbow, an automatic statistical method to
determine whether a possible break is significant - or not - and its type and
made it publicly available. We found 14 anti-truncated S0-E/S0 galaxies in the
range 0.2<z<0.6 (~30% of the final sample). This fraction is similar to the
those reported in the local Universe. In our sample, ~25% of the Type-III
breaks observed in PSF-uncorrected profiles are artifacts, and their profiles
turn into a Type I after PSF correction. PSF effects also soften Type-II
profiles. We found that the profiles of Type-I S0 and E/S0 galaxies of our
sample are compatible with the inner profiles of the Type-III, in contrast with
the outer profiles. We have obtained the first robust and reliable sample of 14
anti-truncated S0--E/S0 galaxies beyond the local Universe, in the range
0.2<z<0.6. PSF effects significantly affect the shape of the surface brightness

molecular gas (ALLSMOG), comprising CO(2-1) emission line observations of 88
nearby, low-mass (10^8.5<M* [M_Sun]<10^10) star-forming galaxies carried out
with the 230 GHz APEX-1 receiver on the APEX telescope. The main goal of
ALLSMOG is to probe the molecular gas content of more typical and lower stellar
mass galaxies than have been studied by previous CO surveys. We also present
IRAM 30m observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines in nine
galaxies aimed at increasing the M*<10^9 M_Sun sample size. In this paper we
describe the observations, data reduction and analysis methods and we present
the final CO spectra together with archival HI 21cm line observations for the
entire sample of 97 galaxies. At the sensitivity limit of ALLSMOG, we register
a total CO detection rate of 47%. Galaxies with higher M*, SFR, nebular
extinction (A_V), gas-phase metallicity (O/H), and HI gas mass have
systematically higher CO detection rates. In particular, the parameter
according to which CO detections and non-detections show the strongest
statistical differences is the gas-phase metallicity, for any of the five
metallicity calibrations examined in this work. We investigate scaling
relations between the CO(1-0) line luminosity and galaxy-averaged properties
using ALLSMOG and a sub-sample of COLD GASS for a total of 185 sources that
probe the local main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and its +-0.3 dex
intrinsic scatter from M* = 10^8.5 M_Sun to M* = 10^11 M_Sun. L'_{CO(1-0)} is
most strongly correlated with the SFR, but the correlation with M* is closer to
linear and almost comparably tight. The relation between L'_{CO(1-0)} and
metallicity is the steepest one, although deeper CO observations of galaxies
with A_V<0.5 mag may reveal an as much steep correlation with A_V. [abridged]

galaxy formation to investigate the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV)
slope, beta, and the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV luminosity (IRX) in
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. We employ dust radiative
transfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate
through the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the
origin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of
simplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the
essential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic
deviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular
populations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that
have young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting
regions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard
Meurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.
Scatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older
stellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local
starbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex
geometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue
UV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction
curves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV
extinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive
a fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the
canonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an
understanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of
galaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z~2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z>5 star
forming galaxies.

temperature of the gas. We derive CO, [OI] and [CI] luminosities to determine
physical conditions of the gas, as well as the dominant cooling mechanism. We
confirm that the Herbig Be stars are surrounded by remnants from their parental
clouds, with an IR excess that mainly originates in a disc. In R Mon we detect
[OI], [CI], [CII], CO (26 transitions), water and OH, while in PDS 27 we only
detect [CI] and CO (8 transitions). We attribute the absence of OH and water in
PDS 27 to UV photo-dissociation and photo-evaporation. From the rotational
diagrams, we find several components for CO: we derive $T_{rot}$ 949$\pm$90 K,
358$\pm$20 K & 77$\pm$12 K for R Mon, 96$\pm$12 K & 31$\pm$4 K for PDS 27 and

feature at 69$\mu$m was not detected in either of the sources, probably due to
the lack of (warm) crystalline dust in a flat disc. We find that cooling by
molecules is dominant in the Herbig Be stars, while this is not the case in
Herbig Ae stars where cooling by [OI] dominates. Moreover, we show that in the
Herbig Be star R Mon, outflow shocks are the dominant gas heating mechanism,
while in Herbig Ae stars this is stellar. The outflow of R Mon contributes to
the observed line emission by heating the gas, both in the central spaxel/beam
covering the disc and the immediate surroundings, as well as in those
spaxels/beams covering the parabolic shell around it. PDS 27, a B2 star, has
dispersed a large part of its gas content and/or destroyed molecules; this is
likely given its intense UV field.

(EPIC 201283111), first noted in the SDSS survey (SDSS 120515.80-024222.7). We
have found that this hot white dwarf (Teff = 22,640 K) is in a very close orbit
(P = 71 min) with a star of near brown-dwarf mass ~ 0.061 Msun. This period is
very close to, or somewhat below, the minimum orbital period of cataclysmic
variables with H-rich donor stars. However, we find no evidence that this
binary is currently, or ever was, transferring mass from the low-mass companion
to the white dwarf. We therefore tentatively conclude that this system is still
in the pre-cataclysmic variable phase, having emerged from a common envelope
some 50 +/- 20 Myr ago. Because of the 29-minute integration time of K2, we use
follow-up ground-based photometry to better evaluate the eclipsing light curve.
We also utilize the original SDSS spectra, in approximately 15-min segments, to
estimate the radial velocity of the white dwarf in its orbit. An analysis of
the light curve, with supplementary constraints, leads to the following system
parameters: Mwd = 0.415 +/- 0.028 Msun, Rwd = 0.021 +/- 0.001 Rsun, Mcom =
0.061 +\- 0.010 Msun, and Rcom = 0.088 +\- 0.005 Rsun where the subscripts 'wd'

exocometary gas released within Kuiper belt analogues around nearby main
sequence stars. This represents a unique opportunity to study their ice
reservoir at the younger ages when volatile delivery to planets is most likely
to occur. We here present the detection of CO J=2-1 emission co-located with
dust emission from the cometary belt in the 440 Myr-old Fomalhaut system.
Through spectro-spatial filtering, we achieve a 5.4$\sigma$ detection and
determine that the ring's sky-projected rotation axis matches that of the star.
The CO mass derived ($0.65-42 \times10^{-7}$ M$_{\oplus}$) is the lowest of any
circumstellar disk detected to date, and must be of exocometary origin. Using a
steady state model, we estimate the CO+CO$_2$ mass fraction of exocomets around
Fomalhaut to be between 4.6-76%, consistent with Solar System comets and the
two other belts known to host exocometary gas. This is the first indication of
a similarity in cometary compositions across planetary systems that may be
linked to their formation scenario and is consistent with direct ISM
inheritance. In addition, we find tentative evidence that $(49\pm 27)$% of the
detected flux originates from a region near the eccentric belt's pericentre. If
confirmed, the latter may be explained through a recent impact event or CO
pericentre glow due to exocometary release within a steady state collisional
cascade. In the latter scenario, we show how the azimuthal dependence of the CO
release rate leads to asymmetries in gas observations of eccentric exocometary
belts.

simulations (LES) of two reference cases, one representing conditions over the
tropical ocean, and another one representing mid-latitude conditions over land.
To examine what sets the difference between the two distributions, nine
additional LES cases are set up as variations of the two reference cases. We
find that the total surface heat flux and its changes over the diurnal cycle do
not influence the distribution shape. The latter is also not determined by the
level of organization in the cloud field. It is instead determined by the ratio
of the surface sensible heat flux to the latent heat flux, the Bowen ratio $B$.
$B$ sets the thermodynamic efficiency of the moist convective heat cycle, which
determines the portion of the total surface heat flux that can be transformed
into mechanical work of convection against mechanical dissipation. The
thermodynamic moist heat cycle sets the average mass flux per cloud $\langle m
\rangle$, and through $\langle m \rangle$ it also controls the shape of the
distribution. An expression for $\langle m \rangle$ is derived based on the
moist convective heat cycle and is evaluated against LES. This expression can
be used in shallow cumulus parameterizations as a physical constraint on the
mass flux distribution. The similarity between the mass flux and the cloud area
distributions indicate that $B$ also has a role in shaping the cloud area
distribution, which could explain its different shapes and slopes observed in
previous studies.

pair events have no subluminal counterparts. Common examples of superluminal

illumination fronts from variable light sources, and rotating beams. The
minimally simple case of pair events from a single massive object is explored

subluminal. Emission from the pair creation event will reach the observer
before emission from either of the two images created. Potentially observable
image pair events are described for sonic booms and Cherenkov light. To date,
no detection of discrete images following a projectile pair event have ever

beliefs that followed Harrison-Kreps, investors are risk-neutral, short-selling

The resulting resale option guarantees that the price exceeds the price of the

field galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the
dearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has
effectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster
galaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to
the ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption. Despite the high
signal-to-noise of our data, we do not detect O VI in any cluster, and we only
detect BLA features in the QSO spectrum probing one cluster. We estimate that
the total column density of warm-hot gas along this line of sight totals to ~3%
of that contained in the hot T > 10^7 K X-ray emitting phase. Residing at high
relative velocities, these features may trace pre-shocked material outside the

generalisation of a word over an alphabet in that letters may be partially

  We prove that every valid universal equality over pomset languages using

commutative-regular languages (in which sequential multiplication and iteration
are undefined). We also show that the class of $\textit{rational}$ pomset

bi-Kleene operations) is closed under all Boolean operations.
  An $ \textit{ideal}$ of a pomset $p$ is a pomset using the letters of $p$,
but having an ordering at least as strict as $p$. A bi-Kleene term $t$ thus
defines the set $ \textbf{Id} (\mathopen{[\![ } t \mathclose{]\!] }) $ of

$t,t'$ define the same ideal language, then $t'=t$ is provable from the Kleene

Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of
LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands
per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks,
which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and
the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by
relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This work uses a different
approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex
baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The
error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that
enables to study multi channel, multi spreading factor, multi gateway,
bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the
lorawan ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental
impact of downstream traffic on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream
traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but
not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways
continue to limit downstream opportunities.

a certain loading condition, is usually associated with a local minimum of the
underlying potential energy. However, in the nonlinear context, there may be
other equilibria present, and this brings with it the possibility of a
transition to an alternative (remote) minimum. That is, given a sufficient
disturbance, the structure might buckle, perhaps suddenly, to another shape.
This paper considers the dynamic mechanisms under which such transitions
(typically via saddle points) occur. A two-mode Hamiltonian is developed for a
shallow arch/buckled beam. The resulting form of the potential energy---two
stable wells connected by rank-1 saddle points---shows an analogy with
resonance transitions in celestial mechanics or molecular reconfigurations in
chemistry, whereas here the transition corresponds to switching between two
stable structural configurations. Then, from Hamilton's equations, the
analytical equilibria are determined and linearization of the equations of
motion about the saddle is obtained. After computing the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix associated with the linearization, a
symplectic transformation is given which puts the Hamiltonian into normal form
and simplifies the equations, allowing us to use the conceptual framework known
as tube dynamics. The flow in the equilibrium region of phase space as well as
the invariant manifold tubes in position space are discussed. Also, we account
for the addition of damping in the tube dynamics framework, which leads to a
richer set of behaviors in transition dynamics than previously explored.

the present work, we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular
infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for
vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects -- typically neglected by
conventional quantum chemistry approaches -- we base our machine learning
strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations
are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome
these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning
techniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude,
but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this
end, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent
neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potentials of
Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are
able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of
infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference
points. This is made possible through the introduction of a fully automated
sampling scheme and the use of molecular forces during neural network potential
training. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying
it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing
up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide, which at the same time
represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the
dynamics of a peptide. In all these case studies we find excellent agreement
between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the

set of collective quantum phases of matter. A central question is how the order
parameters of phases near a QCP interact and determine the fundamental
character of the critical dynamics which drive the quantum critical behavior.
One of the most interesting proposals for the quantum critical behavior that
occurs in correlated electron systems is that the behavior may arise from
local, as opposed to long wavelength, critical fluctuations of the order
parameter. The local criticality is believed to give rise to energy over
temperature ($E/T$) scaling of the dynamic susceptibility with a fractional
exponent near the quantum critical point (QCP). Here we show that $E/T$ scaling
is indeed observed for CeCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_x$ but on closer inspection, the
fluctuations can be separated into two components, implying that multiple order
parameters play an important role in the unconventional critical behavior.
Additionally, when the fluctuations corresponding to the magnetically ordered
side of the phase diagram are separated, they are found to be three dimensional
and to obey the scaling behavior expected for long wavelength fluctuations near
an itinerant antiferromagnetic QCP.

vanishes. We present some arguments why this might be plausible. One might
think that such a radical assumption would contradict lattice Monte Carlo data
on QCD as function of $N_c$. We show that the linear sigma model gives a fair
description of the data of DeGrand and Liu both for $N_c = 3$, and for variable
$N_c$. The values of quark masses considered by DeGrand and Liu, and by Bali
et. al. turn out to be too large to resolve the case we consider from that of
the conventional large $N_c$ limit. We argue that for quark masses $m_{q} \ll
\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/N_c^{3/2}$, both the baryon mass and nucleon size scale as
$\sqrt{N_c}$. For $m_{q} \gg \Lambda_{\rm QCD}/N_c^{3/2}$ the conventional
large-$N_c$ counting holds. The physical values of quark masses for QCD
correspond to the small quark mass limit. We find pion-nucleon coupling
strengths are reduced to order ${\cal O}(1)$ rather than ${\cal O}(N_c)$. Under
the assumption that in the large $N_c$ limit the sigma meson mass is larger
than that of the omega, and that the omega-nucleon coupling constant is larger
than that of the sigma, we argue that the nucleon-nucleon large range potential
is weakly attractive and admits an interaction energy of order $\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}/N_c^{5/2} \sim 10$ MeV. With these assumptions on coupling and masses,
there is no strong long range attractive channel for nucleon-nucleon
interactions, so that nuclear matter at densities much smaller than that where
nucleons strongly interact is a weakly interacting configuration of nucleons
with strongly interacting localized cores.

any stationary, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black hole emits
in the eikonal regime are determined by the parameters of the circular null

the frequency and instability timescale of the circular null geodesics

Einstein-Lovelock theory, find analytical expressions for gravitational

formulate its actual limits.

provides prior knowledge of potential pointing directions for reliable beam
alignment. The approach is the inverse of fingerprinting localization, where
the measured multipath signature is compared to the fingerprint database to
retrieve the most likely position. The power loss probability is introduced as
a metric to quantify misalignment accuracy and is used for optimizing candidate
beam selection. Two candidate beam selection methods are developed, where one
is a heuristic while the other minimizes the misalignment probability. The
proposed beam alignment is evaluated using realistic channels generated from a
commercial ray-tracing simulator. Using the generated channels, an extensive
investigation is provided, which includes the required measurement sample size
to build an effective fingerprint, the impact of measurement noise, the
sensitivity to changes in traffic density, and beam alignment overhead

coherence time, which is the duration between two consecutive beam alignments,
and parameters of IEEE 802.11ad, the overhead is compared in the mobility

rates with larger antenna arrays, IEEE 802.11ad has decreasing rates due to the
larger beam training overhead that eats up a large portion of the beam

recast as a generalized linear multiplicative programming problem, for which a
globally optimal solution is obtained via employing the branch-and-bound
approach. The optimal resource allocation policy serves as a system performance
benchmark due to its high computational complexity. To strike a balance between
system performance and computational complexity, we propose a suboptimal
iterative resource allocation algorithm based on difference of convex
programming. Simulation results demonstrate that the suboptimal scheme achieves
a close-to-optimal performance. Also, both proposed schemes provide significant
transmit power savings than that of conventional orthogonal multiple access

demonstrate the rare emergence of bulk elastic effects working in-tandem with
the more common-place hydrodynamic interactions. Three collision regimes are
observable: (a) drop piercing through the film, (b) it coalescing with the
flow, and (c) it bouncing off the film surface. During impact, the drop deforms
along with a bulk elastic deformation of the film. For impacts that are
close-to-tangential, the bounce-off regime predominates. We outline a reduced
order analytical framework assuming a deformable drop and a deformable
three-dimensional film, and the idealization invokes a phase-based parametric
study. Angular inclination of the film and the ratio of post and pre impact
drop sizes entail the phase parameters. We also perform experiments with
vertically descending droplets impacting against an inclined soap film, flowing
under constant pressure head. Model predicted phase domain for bounce-off
compares well to our experimental findings. Additionally, the experiments
exhibit momentum transfer to the film in the form of shed vortex dipole, along
with propagation of free surface waves. On consulting prior published work, we
note that for locomotion of water-walking insects using an impulsive action,
the momentum distribution to the shed vortices and waves are both significant,
taking up respectively 2/3-rd and 1/3-rd of the imparted streamwise momentum.
In view of the potentially similar impulse actions, this theory is applied to
the bounce-off examples in our experiments, and the resultant shed vortex
dipole momenta are compared to the momenta computed from particle imaging
velocimetry data. The magnitudes reveal identical order ($10^{-7}$ N$\cdot$s),
suggesting that the bounce-off regime can be tapped as a simple analogue for
interfacial bio-locomotion relying on impulse reactions.

and formally prove the density mode isolation bias in kernel K-means for a
common class of kernels. We call it Breiman's bias due to its similarity to the
histogram mode isolation previously discovered by Breiman in decision tree
learning with Gini impurity. We also extend our analysis to other popular

density biases can take different forms. For example, splitting isolated points
by cut-based criteria is essentially the sparsest subset bias, which is the
opposite of the density mode bias. Our findings suggest that a principled
solution for density biases in kernel clustering should directly address data
inhomogeneity. We show that density equalization can be implicitly achieved
using either locally adaptive weights or locally adaptive kernels. Moreover,
density equalization makes many popular kernel clustering objectives
equivalent. Our synthetic and real data experiments illustrate density biases

solving flow equations in heterogeneous porous media. The media properties (the
permeability) contain multiple scales and high contrast. The proposed method
solves the flow equation in a mixed formulation on a coarse grid by
constructing multiscale basis functions. The resulting velocity field is mass
conservative on the fine grid. Our main goal is to obtain first-order
convergence in terms of the mesh size which is independent of local contrast.
This is achieved, first, by constructing some auxiliary spaces, which contain
global information that can not be localized, in general. This is built on our
previous work on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In
the auxiliary space, multiscale basis functions corresponding to small
(contrast-dependent) eigenvalues are selected. These basis functions represent
the high-conductivity channels (which connect the boundaries of a coarse
block). Next, we solve local problems to construct multiscale basis functions
for the velocity field. These local problems are formulated in the oversampled
domain taking into account some constraints with respect to auxiliary spaces.
The latter allows fast spatial decay of local solutions and, thus, allows
taking smaller oversampled regions. The number of basis functions depends on
small eigenvalues of the local spectral problems. Moreover, multiscale pressure
basis functions are needed in constructing the velocity space. Our multiscale
spaces have a minimal dimension, which is needed to avoid contrast-dependence
in the convergence. The method's convergence requires an oversampling of
several layers. We present an analysis of our approach. Our numerical results
confirm that the convergence rate is first order with respect to the mesh size
and independent of the contrast.

incompatibility between quantum correlations and the classical theory of
causality, applied to relativistic causal structure. Contextuality, on the
other hand, is on a more controversial foundation. In this work, I provide a
common conceptual ground between nonlocality and contextuality as violations of
classical causality. First, I show that Bell inequalities can be derived solely
from the assumptions of no-signalling and no-fine-tuning of the causal model.
This removes two extra assumptions from a recent result from Wood and Spekkens,
and remarkably, does not require any assumption related to independence of
measurement settings -- unlike all other derivations of Bell inequalities. I
then introduce a formalism to represent contextuality scenarios within causal
models and show that all classical causal models for violations of a
Kochen-Specker inequality require fine-tuning. Thus the quantum violation of
classical causality goes beyond the case of space-like separated systems, and
manifests already in scenarios involving single systems.

ammonium, hydroxylamine, nitrite and N2O additions under aerobic and anaerobic
conditions were tracked with continuous measurement of dissolved oxygen (DO)
and N2O. The sequential addition of substrate pulses allowed the isolation of
oxygen-consuming processes. The parameters to be estimated were determined by
the information content of the datasets using identifiability analysis. Dynamic
DO profiles were used to calibrate five parameters corresponding to endogenous,
nitrite oxidation and ammonium oxidation processes. The subsequent N2O
calibration was not significantly affected by the uncertainty propagated from
the DO calibration because of the high accuracy of the estimates. Five
parameters describing the individual contribution of three biological N2O
pathways were estimated accurately (variance/mean < 10% for all estimated
parameters). The NDHA model response was evaluated with statistical metrics
(F-test, autocorrelation function). The 95% confidence intervals of DO and N2O
predictions based on the uncertainty obtained during calibration are studied

pressures of 30-60 torr, to develop and validate a model of the directional
response and performance of such detectors as a function of recoil energy.
Using our model as a benchmark, we formulate the necessary specifications for a
scalable directional detector with sensitivity comparable to that of
current-generation counting (non-directional) experiments, which measure only
recoil energy. Assuming the performance of existing DMTPC detectors, as well as
current limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleus cross section, we find that a
10-20 kg scale direction-sensitive detector is capable of correlating the
measured direction of nuclear recoils with the predicted direction of incident
dark matter particles and providing decisive (3$\sigma$) confirmation that a
candidate signal from a non-directional experiment was indeed induced by
elastic scattering of dark matter particles off of target nuclei.

that the effect of a weak classical noise can be captured analytically by
treating it as a perturbation in the Schroedinger equation. This allows us to
study the dependence of the noise-induced correction to P_{LZ} on the

into multiple bit polarized channels by using a three-stage channel transform,

channel transform, we design two schemes, namely sequential user partition
(SUP) and parallel user partition (PUP). For the SUP, a joint successive

is proposed to schedule the NOMA detecting order which improves the system
performance by enhanced polarization among the user synthesized channels. The
""worst-goes-first"" idea is employed in the scheduling strategy, and its
theoretic performance is analyzed by using the polarization principle. For the
PUP, a corresponding parallel detecting scheme is exploited to reduce the

with lattice paths with unit steps north, east, and south that start at the
origin, end on the $x$-axis, and stay strictly above the $x$-axis everywhere

to model polymers in statistical physics, have been enumerated in the
literature by semiperimeter and by several other statistics, using different

  In this paper we describe an unusual bijection between bargraphs and Dyck

bargraphs where the semiperimeter minus the number of peaks is fixed.

conform to the norm. Outlier detection is highly sensitive to the choice of the
detection algorithm and the feature subspace used by the algorithm. Extracting
domain-relevant insights from outliers needs systematic exploration of these
choices since diverse outlier sets could lead to complementary insights. This
challenge is especially acute in an interactive setting, where the choices must
be explored in a time-constrained manner. In this work, we present REMIX, the
first system to address the problem of outlier detection in an interactive
setting. REMIX uses a novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for
automatically selecting and executing a diverse set of outlier detectors within
a time limit. This formulation incorporates multiple aspects such as (i) an
upper limit on the total execution time of detectors (ii) diversity in the
space of algorithms and features, and (iii) meta-learning for evaluating the
cost and utility of detectors. REMIX provides two distinct ways for the analyst
to consume its results: (i) a partitioning of the detectors explored by REMIX
into perspectives through low-rank non-negative matrix factorization; each
perspective can be easily visualized as an intuitive heatmap of experiments
versus outliers, and (ii) an ensembled set of outliers which combines outlier
scores from all detectors. We demonstrate the benefits of REMIX through
extensive empirical validation on real-world data.

an active field of research for several decades, with a plethora of planning
methods. Planners can be generally categorised as either trajectory optimisers
or sampling-based planners. The latter is the predominant planning paradigm for
occupancy maps. Trajectory optimisation entails major algorithmic changes to
tackle contextual information gaps caused by incomplete sensor coverage of the
map. However, the benefits are substantial, as trajectory optimisers can reason
on the trade-off between path safety and efficiency.
  In this work, we improve our previous work on stochastic functional gradient
planners. We introduce a novel expressive path representation based on kernel
approximation, that allows cost effective model updates based on stochastic
samples. The main drawback of the previous stochastic functional gradient
planner was the cubic cost, stemming from its non-parametric path
representation. Our novel approximate kernel based model, on the other hand,
has a fixed linear cost that depends solely on the number of features used to
represent the path. We show that the stochasticity of the samples is crucial
for the planner and present comparisons to other state-of-the-art planning
methods in both simulation and with real occupancy data. The experiments
demonstrate the advantages of the stochastic approximate kernel method for path
planning in occupancy maps.

important role in many clinical tasks, including pathological diagnosis,
surgical planning and postoperative assessment. However, the unusual conditions
of pathological cases, such as the abnormal spine curvature, bright visual
imaging artifacts caused by metal implants, and the limited field of view,
increase the difficulties of accurate localization. In this paper, we propose
an automatic and fast algorithm to localize and label the vertebra centroids in
3D CT volumes. First, we deploy a deep image-to-image network (DI2IN) to
initialize vertebra locations, employing the convolutional encoder-decoder
architecture together with multi-level feature concatenation and deep
supervision. Next, the centroid probability maps from DI2IN are iteratively
evolved with the message passing schemes based on the mutual relation of
vertebra centroids. Finally, the localization results are refined with sparsity
regularization. The proposed method is evaluated on a public dataset of 302
spine CT volumes with various pathologies. Our method outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy. The run time is
around 3 seconds on average per case. To further boost the performance, we
retrain the DI2IN on additional 1000+ 3D CT volumes from different patients. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first time more than 1000 3D CT volumes

decomposed optical variations into two components: a highly-variable, and a

gauge-invariant optical Bloch equations, in which the gauge structure in the
superconductivity is explicitly retained. By using the gauge transformation,
not only can the microscopic description for the quasiparticle dynamics be
realized, but also the dynamics of the condensate is included, with the
superfluid velocity and the effective chemical potential naturally
incorporated. We reveal that the superfluid velocity itself can contribute to
the pump of quasiparticles (pump effect), with its rate of change acting as the
drive field to drive the quasiparticles (drive effect). Specifically, the drive
effect can contribute to the formation of the blocking region for the
quasiparticle, which directly suppresses the anomalous correlation of the
Cooper pairs. We find that both the pump and drive effects contribute to the
oscillations of the Higgs mode with twice the frequency of the optical field.
However, it is shown that the contribution from the drive effect to the
excitation of Higgs mode is dominant as long as the driven superconducting
momentum is less than the Fermi momentum. This is in contrast to the conclusion
from the Liouville or Bloch equations in the literature, in which the drive
effect on the anomalous correlation is overlooked with only the pump effect
considered.Furthermore, in the gauge-invariant optical Bloch equations, the
charge neutrality condition is {\em consistently} considered based on the
two-component model for the charge, in which the charge imbalance of
quasiparticles can cause the fluctuation of the effective chemical potential.

the size of accreted planetesimals or pebbles, to infer the possibility of
growing the cores of giant planets, and giant planets themselves. We compute
the internal structure of the gas envelope of planetary embryos, to determine
the core mass that is necessary to bind an envelope large enough to destroy
planetesimals or pebbles while they are gravitationally captured. We also
consider the effect of the advection wind originating from the protoplanetary
disk, following the results of Ormel et al. (2015). We show that for low mass
pebbles, once the planetary embryo is larger than ~1 Mearth, the envelope is
large enough to destroy and vaporize pebbles completely before they can reach
the core. The material constituting pebbles is therefore released in the
planetary envelope, and later on dispersed in the protoplanetary disk, if the
advection wind is strong enough. As a consequence the growth of the planetary
embryo is stopped at a mass that is so small that Kelvin-Helmholtz accretion
cannot lead to the accretion of significant amounts of gas. For larger
planetesimals, a similar process occurs but at much larger mass, of the order
of ten Earth masses, and is followed by rapid accretion of gas. If the effect
of the advection is as efficient as described in Ormel al. (2015), the combined
effect of the vaporization of accreted solids in the envelope of forming
planetary embryos, and of this advection wind, prevents the growth of the
planets at masses smaller or similar to the Earth mass in the case of formation
by pebble accretion, up to a distance of the order of 10 AU. In the case of
formation by accretion of large mass planetesimals, the growth of the planetary
core is limited at masses ~10 Mearth but further growth of the planet can
proceed by gas accretion.

disordered protein conformations from single-molecule F\""orster resonance
energy transfer (smFRET). Conformational dimensions inferred by conventional
approaches that presume a homogeneous conformational ensemble can be
unphysical. When all possible---heterogeneous as well as
homogeneous---conformational distributions are taken into account without
prejudgement, a single value of average transfer efficiency $\langle E\rangle$
between dyes at two chain ends is generally consistent with highly diverse,
multiple values of the average radius of gyration $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$.
Here we utilize unbiased conformational statistics from a coarse-grained
explicit-chain model to establish a general logical framework to quantify this
fundamental ambiguity in smFRET inference. As an application, we address the
long-standing controversy regarding the denaturant dependence of $\langle
R_{\rm g}\rangle$ of unfolded proteins, focusing on Protein L as an example.
Conventional smFRET inference concluded that $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$ of
unfolded Protein L is highly sensitive to [GuHCl], but data from small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) suggested a near-constant $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$
irrespective of [GuHCl]. Strikingly, the present analysis indicates that
although the reported $\langle E\rangle$ values for Protein L at [GuHCl] = 1 M
and 7 M are very different at 0.75 and 0.45, respectively, the Bayesian
$R^2_{\rm g}$ distributions consistent with these two $\langle E\rangle$ values
overlap by as much as $75\%$. Our findings suggest, in general, that the
smFRET-SAXS discrepancy regarding unfolded protein dimensions likely arise from
highly heterogeneous conformational ensembles at low or zero denaturant, and
that additional experimental probes are needed to ascertain the nature of this
heterogeneity.

deviates from the multi-color black body spectra in the middle power-law part.

demand-aware datacenter interconnects which can be reconfigured depending on
the workload.
  Motivated by these trends, this paper initiates the algorithmic study of
demand-aware networks (DANs) designs, and in particular the design of
bounded-degree networks. The inputs to the network design problem are a
discrete communication request distribution, D, defined over communicating
pairs from the node set V , and a bound, d, on the maximum degree. In turn, our
objective is to design an (undirected) demand-aware network N = (V,E) of
bounded-degree d, which provides short routing paths between frequently
communicating nodes distributed across N. In particular, the designed network
should minimize the expected path length on N (with respect to D), which is a
basic measure of the efficiency of the network.
  We show that this fundamental network design problem exhibits interesting
connections to several classic combinatorial problems and to information
theory. We derive a general lower bound based on the entropy of the
communication pattern D, and present asymptotically optimal network-aware
design algorithms for important distribution families, such as sparse
distributions and distributions of locally bounded doubling dimensions.

promising indoor positioning solution to meet the growing interests for indoor
location-based services (e.g., indoor way finding or geo-fencing). FWIPS is
preferred because it requires no additional infrastructure for deploying an
FWIPS and achieving the position estimation by reusing the available WLAN and
mobile devices, and capable of providing absolute position estimation. For
fingerprinting based positioning (FbP), a model is created to provide reference
values of observable features (e.g., signal strength from access point (AP)) as
a function of location during offline stage. One widely applied method to build
a complete and an accurate reference database (i.e. radio map (RM)) for FWIPS
is carrying out a site survey throughout the region of interest (RoI). Along
the site survey, the readings of received signal strength (RSS) from all
visible APs at each reference point (RP) are collected. This site survey,
however, is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in the case that the
RoI is large (e.g., an airport or a big mall). This bottleneck hinders the wide
commercial applications of FWIPS (e.g., proximity promotions in a shopping
center). To diminish the cost of site survey, we propose a probabilistic model,
which combines fingerprinting based positioning (FbP) and RM generation based
on stochastic variational Bayesian inference (SVBI). This SVBI based position
and RSS estimation has three properties: i) being able to predict the
distribution of the estimated position and RSS, ii) treating each observation
of RSS at each RP as an example to learn for FbP and RM generation instead of
using the whole RM as an example, and iii) requiring only one time training of
the SVBI model for both localization and RSS estimation. These benefits make it
outperforms the previous proposed approaches.

makes the topological structures of a chain with open boundary totally

used to quantify the strength of attractors as a function of coordinates in the
parameter spacedefining their zone of existence, the so-called Arnold tongue.
In the nonlinear regime, the choice of the operational point in the Arnold
tongue is shown to have a significant impact on the scenario of the onset of
triadic instability, most notably on the influence of confinement on secondary
waves. The onset of triadic resonance instability may occur as a spatially
localized event similar to Scolan, Ermanyuk and Dauxois (2013) in the case of
strong focusing or in form of growing normal modes as in McEwan (1971) for the
limiting case of rectangular domain. In the present paper, we describe also a
new intermediate scenario for the case of weak focusing. We explore the
long-term behaviour of cascades of triadic instabilities in wave attractors and
show a persistent trend toward formation of standing-wave patterns
corresponding to some discrete peaks of the frequency spectrum. At sufficiently
high level of energy injection the system exhibits a ""mixing box"" regime which
has certain qualitatively universal properties regardless to the choiceof the
operating point in the Arnold tongue. In particular, for this regime, we
observe a statisticsof events with high horizontal vorticity, which serve as

the inclination angles of 19 variable brown dwarfs.
  The results obtained show that all objects in the sample with mid-IR
variability detections are inclined at an angle $>20^{\circ}$, while all
objects in the sample displaying $J$-band variability have an inclination angle
$>35^{\circ}$. $J$-band variability appears to be more affected by inclination
than \textit{Spitzer} [$3.6~\mu$m] variability, and is strongly attenuated at
lower inclinations. Since $J$-band observations probe deeper into the
atmosphere than mid-IR observations, this effect may be due to the increased
atmospheric path length of $J$-band flux at lower inclinations.
  We find a statistically significant correlation between the colour anomaly
and inclination of our sample, where field objects viewed equator-on appear
redder than objects viewed at lower inclinations. Considering the full sample
of known variable L, T and Y spectral type objects in the literature, we find
that the variability properties of the two bands display notably different
trends, due to both intrinsic differences between bands and the sensitivity of
ground-based versus space-based searches. However, in both bands we find that
variability amplitude may reach a maximum at $\sim7-9~$hr periods. Finally, we
find a strong correlation between colour anomaly and variability amplitude for
both the $J$-band and mid-IR variability detections, where redder objects
display higher variability amplitudes.

good fits for 7 events ($\chi^2$/d.o.f = $0.24-0.96$) and good fits for other 7
events ($\chi^2$/d.o.f = $1.37-3.13$). We find that the initial periods

these SLSNe are in the range of $\sim 1.2-8.3$ ms and $\sim (0.2-8.8)\times
10^{14}\,$G, respectively; the inferred masses of the ejecta of these SLSNe are
between 1 and 27.6 $M_{\odot }$, and the values of the gamma-ray opacity
$\kappa_{\gamma }$ are between 0.01 and 0.82 cm$^2$ ~g$^{-1}$. We also
calculate the fraction of the initial rotational energy of the magnetars
harbored in the centers of the remnants of these SLSNe that is converted to the
kinetic energy of the ejecta and find that the fraction is $\sim 19-97$ for
different values of $P_{0}$ and $B_{p}$, indicating that the acceleration

wiggles. No two spectra are alike. We interpret the variations as interstellar
scintillation of a radio source that is compact, but not point-like. Under this

high magnification conditions, or from interference between waves that have
been scattered by small-scale density fluctuations (diffractive scintillation).
Both effects may be playing a role in J1106-3647, and we tentatively identify
kinks with the former, and wiggles with the latter. Diffractive scintillation
of AGN is uncommon, as the fringe visibility is low for all but the most
compact radio sources. Refractive interpretation of the kink implies that the
source has a sharp, concave boundary. Our data are consistent with a mildly
boosted synchrotron source, provided the scattering material is at a distance
~50 pc from us.

kinetic reaction-transport equation, in the regime of sharp interface. With a
non-linear reaction term of KPP-type, a phenomenon of front propagation has
been proved in [9]. This behavior can be highlighted by considering a suitable
hyperbolic limit of the kinetic equation, using a Hopf-Cole transform. It has
been proved in [6, 8, 11] that the logarithm of the distribution function then
converges to the viscosity solution of a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
The hyperbolic scaling and the Hopf-Cole transform make the kinetic equation
stiff. Thus, the numerical resolution of the problem is challenging, since the
standard numerical methods usually lead to high computational costs in these
regimes. The Asymptotic Preserving (AP) schemes have been typically introduced
to deal with this difficulty, since they are designed to be stable along the
transition to the macroscopic regime. The scheme we propose is adapted to the
non-linearity of the problem, enjoys a discrete maximum principle and solves
the limit equation in the sense of viscosity. It is based on a dedicated
micro-macro decomposition, attached to the Hopf-Cole transform. As it is well
adapted to the singular limit, our scheme is able to cope with singular
behaviors in space (sharp interface), and possibly in velocity (concentration
in the velocity distribution). Various numerical tests are proposed, to
illustrate the properties and the efficiency of our scheme.

ESO-Athena Synergy Team (EAST) has been tasked to single out the potential
scientific synergies between Athena and optical/near-infrared (NIR) and sub/mm
ground based facilities, in particular those of ESO (i.e., the VLT and ELT,
ALMA and APEX), by producing a White Paper to identify and develop the: 1.
needs to access ESO ground-based facilities to achieve the formulated Athena
science objectives; 2. needs to access Athena to achieve the formulated science
objectives of ESO facilities contemporary to Athena; 3. science areas where the
synergetic use of Athena and ESO facilities in the late 2020s will result in
scientific added value. Community input to the process happened primarily via a
dedicated ESO - Athena Synergy Workshop that took place on Sept. 14 - 16, 2016
at ESO, Garching. This White Paper presents the results of the EAST's work,
sorted by synergy area, and deals with the following topics: 1. the Hot
Universe: Early groups and clusters and their evolution, Physics of the
Intracluster medium, Missing baryons in cosmic filaments; 2. the Energetic
Universe: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) history, SMBH accretion disks, Active
Galactic Nuclei feedback - Molecular outflows, Ultra-fast outflows, Accretion

then discusses the optical-NIR-sub-mm perspective by providing details on
VLT/MOONS, the E-ELT instruments, in particular the MOS, VISTA/4MOST, the ESO

transition metal nanoparticles is important to improve their application in a
variety of chemical processes. In nanocatalysis the nanoparticles can undergo
oxidation or reduction in situ, and thus the redox species are not what are
observed before and after reactions. We have used the novel environmental
scanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) with 0.1 nm resolution in
systematic studies of complex dynamic oxidation and reduction mechanisms of
copper nanoparticles. The oxidation of copper has previously been reported to
be dependent on its crystallography and its interaction with the substrate. By
following the dynamic oxidation process in situ, in real time, with high-angle
annular dark-field imaging in the ESTEM, we use conditions ideal to track the
oxidation front as it progresses across a copper nanoparticle by following the
changes in the atomic number (z) contrast with time. The oxidation occurs via
the nucleation of the oxide phase (Cu2O) from one area of the nanoparticle
which then progresses unidirectionally across the particle, with the Cu-to-Cu2O
interface having a relationship of Cu{111} parallel to Cu2O{111}. The oxidation
kinetics are related to the temperature and oxygen pressure. When the process
is reversed in hydrogen, the reduction process is observed to be similar to the
oxidation, with the same crystallographic relationship between the two phases.
The dynamic observations provide unique insights into redox mechanisms which
are important to understanding and controlling the oxidation and reduction of
copper-based nanoparticles.

these massive amounts of data generated by the MUSER, in this paper, a novel
data management technique called the negative database (ND) is proposed and
used to implement a data management system for the MUSER. Based on the
key-value database, the ND technique makes complete utilization of the
complement set of observational data to derive the requisite information.
Experimental results showed that the proposed ND can significantly reduce
storage volume in comparison with a relational database management system

absent, its overall performance, including querying and deriving the data of
the ND, is comparable with that of an RDBMS. The ND technique effectively
solves the problem of massive data storage for the MUSER, and is a valuable
reference for the massive data management required in next-generation

limiting their practical applicability in cases with large dimensions. To
alleviate this issue, we propose a low-complexity method for line spectral

revealing new characteristics distinct from earlier reports. This event is
associated with a footpoint-occulted X1.3-class flare (25 April 2014, starting
at 00:17 UT) and a coronal mass ejection that are likely triggered by the
magnetic breakout process, with the lower source extending upward from the top
of the partially-occulted flare loops and the upper source co-incident with
rapidly squeezing-in side lobes (at a speed of ~250 km/s on both sides). The
upper source can be identified at energies as high as 70-100 keV. The X-ray
upper source is characterized by flux curves different from the lower source, a
weak energy dependence of projected centroid altitude above 20 keV, a shorter
duration and a HXR photon spectrum slightly-harder than those of the lower
source. In addition, the microwave emission at 34 GHz also exhibits a similar
double source structure and the microwave spectra at both sources are in line
with gyro-synchrotron emission given by non- thermal energetic electrons. These
observations, especially the co-incidence of the very-fast squeezing-in motion
of side lobes and the upper source, indicate that the upper source is
associated with (possibly caused by) this fast motion of arcades. This sheds
new lights on the origin of the corona double-source structure observed in both
HXRs and microwaves.

hardness, and charge density of superconducting ScRhP and ScIrP phosphides. The
optimized cell parameters show fair agreement with experimental results. The
elastic constants and moduli, Poisson's as well as Pugh's ratio and elastic
anisotropy factors have also been calculated to understand the mechanical
behavior of these ternary compounds. Their mechanical stability is confirmed
via the calculated elastic constants. The calculated values for Poisson's and
Pugh's ratio indicate the ductile nature of these compounds. ScIrP is expected
to be elastically more anisotropic than ScRhP. The estimated value of Debye
temperature predicts that ScRhP is thermally more conductive than ScIrP and the
phonon frequency in ScRhP is higher than that in ScIrP. The hardness of ScRhP
is lower due to the presence of anti-bonding Rh-Rh in ScRhP. The investigated
electronic structure predict that the metallic conductivity of ScRhP reduces
significantly when Rh is replaced with Ir. The main contribution to the total
density of states (TDOS) at Fermi-level (EF) comes from the d-electrons of Sc
and Rh/Ir in both compounds. These two ternary compounds are characterized
mainly by metallic and covalent bonding with little ionic contribution. As far
as superconductivity is concerned, the matrix elements of electron-phonon
interaction are noticeably enhanced in ScIrP compared to that in ScRhP.

new TQFT $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{A}}$ by decorating the Poincar\'e duals of
triangulated bordisms with certain algebraic data $\mathcal{A}$ and then
evaluating with $\mathcal{Z}$. The orbifold datum $\mathcal{A}$ is constrained
by demanding invariance under $n$-dimensional Pachner moves. This procedure
generalises both state sum models and gauging of finite symmetry groups, for

microscopic scratches caused by manufacturing and/or wear. A closer look onto
such scratches reveals iridescent colors with a complex dependency on viewing
and lighting conditions. The physics behind this phenomenon is well understood;
it is caused by diffraction of the incident light by surface features on the
order of the optical wavelength. Existing analytic models are able to reproduce
spatially unresolved microstructure such as the iridescent appearance of
compact disks and similar materials. Spatially resolved scratches, on the other
hand, have proven elusive due to the highly complex wave-optical light
transport simulations needed to account for their appearance. In this paper, we
propose a wave-optical shading model based on non-paraxial scalar diffraction
theory to render this class of effects. Our model expresses surface roughness
as a collection of line segments. To shade a point on the surface, the
individual diffraction patterns for contributing scratch segments are computed
analytically and superimposed coherently. This provides natural transitions
from localized glint-like iridescence to smooth BRDFs representing the
superposition of many reflections at large viewing distances. We demonstrate
that our model is capable of recreating the overall appearance as well as
characteristic detail effects observed on real-world examples.

clues about their formation process. With this goal in mind we studied, with
the help of standard statistical tests, the mass distribution of giant planets
using data from the exoplanet.eu catalog and the SWEET-Cat database of stellar
parameters for stars with planets. We show that the mass distribution of giant

metal poor and more massive and have [Fe/H] distributions that are
statistically similar to those observed in field stars of similar mass. On the

metallicity-giant planet frequency correlation. We discuss these results in
light of various planet formation models and explore the implications they may
have on our understanding of the formation of giant planets. In particular, we
discuss the possibility that the existence of two separate populations of giant
planets indicates that two different processes of formation are at play.

astronomer. This paper will analyse the various innovative methods that he
developed to represent the visual aspect of the Milky Way and the statistical
distribution of stars in the galaxy through a framework of epistemic virtues.
Doing so will not emphasize the unique aspects of his astronomical research,
but also reveal its connections to his left radical brand of Marxism. A crucial
feature of Pannekoek's astronomical method was the active role ascribed to
astronomers. They were expected to use their intuitive ability to organize data
according to the appearance of the Milky Way, while at the same time they had
to avoid the influence of personal experience and theoretical presuppositions
about the shape of the system. With this method, he produced results that went
against the Kapteyn Universe and instead made him the first astronomer in the
Netherlands to find supporting evidence for Harlow Shapley's extended galaxy.
After exploring Pannekoek's Marxist philosophy, it is argued that both his
astronomical method and his interpretation of historical materialism can be
seen as strategies developed to make optical use of his particular conception
of the human mind.

lattices occurs for increasing mutual interaction strength in one dimension
($1D$) and is of second order at $T=0$, turning into a crossover at nonzero
temperatures. Yet, real incommensurate lattices come into contact in two
dimensions ($2D$), at finite temperature, generally developing a mutual
Novaco-McTague misalignment, conditions in which the existence of a sharp
transition is not clear. Using a model inspired by colloid monolayers in an
optical lattice as a test $2D$ case, simulations show a sharp Aubry transition
between an unpinned and a pinned phase as a function of corrugation. Unlike
$1D$, the $2D$ transition is now of first order, and, importantly, remains well
defined at $T>0$. It is heavily structural, with a local rotation of moir\'e
pattern domains from the nonzero initial Novaco-McTague equilibrium angle to
nearly zero. In the temperature ($T$) -- corrugation strength ($W_0$) plane,
the thermodynamical coexistence line between the unpinned and the pinned phases
is strongly oblique, showing that the former has the largest entropy. This
first-order Aubry line terminates with a novel critical point $T=T_c$, marked
by a susceptibility peak. The expected static sliding friction upswing between
the unpinned and the pinned phase decreases and disappears upon heating from
$T=0$ to $T=T_c$. The experimental pursuit of this novel scenario is proposed.

with, other types of electronic order. However, these orders are sometimes
invisible because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of
superfluid charge stripes in the normal state of single layer cuprates cannot
be validated with infrared optics, because interlayer tunneling fluctuations
vanish on average. Similarly, it is not easy to establish if charge orders are
responsible for dynamical decoupling of the superconducting layers over broad
ranges of doping and temperatures. Here, we show that TeraHertz pulses can
excite nonlinear tunneling currents between linearly de-coupled charge-ordered
planes. A giant TeraHertz third harmonic signal is observed in
La1.885Ba0.115CuO4 far above Tc=13 K and up to the charge ordering temperature
TCO = 55 K. We model these results by considering large order-parameter-phase
oscillations in a pair density wave condensate, and show how nonlinear mixing
of optically silent tunneling modes can drive large dipole-carrying
super-current oscillations. Our results provide compelling experimental support
for the presence of hidden superfluid order in the normal state of cuprates.
These experiments also underscore the power of nonlinear TeraHertz optics as a

state started to unveil. Here we address the problem of the high-temperature
phase through precise measurements and detailed analysis of the optical
response of 1T-TiSe2 single crystals. The separate responses of electron and
hole subsystems are identified and followed in temperature. We show that
neither semiconductor nor semimetal pictures can be applied in their generic
forms as the scattering for both types of carriers is in the vicinity of the
Ioffe-Regel limit with decay rates being comparable to or larger than the
offsets of band extrema. The nonmetallic temperature dependence of transport
properties comes from the anomalous temperature dependence of scattering rates.
Near the transition temperature the heavy electrons and the light holes
contribute equally to the conductivity. This surprising coincidence is regarded
as the consequence of dominant intervalley scattering that precedes the
transition. The low-frequency peak in the optical spectra is identified and
attributed to the critical softening of the L-point collective mode.

elevation distributions. Two of these regions show a high probability of having
an exceptionally low precipitable water vapor column. We compared our results

(KG) nonlinear lattices, a central open question is whether the motion
continues to be chaotic despite decreasing densities, or tends to become
quasi-periodic as nonlinear terms become negligible. In a recent study of such
KG particle chains with quartic (4th order) anharmonicity in the on-site
potential, it was shown that $q-$Gaussian probability distribution functions of
sums of position observables with $q > 1$ always approach pure Gaussians
($q=1$) in the long time limit and hence the motion of the full system is
ultimately ""strongly chaotic"". In the present paper, we show that these results
continue to hold even when a sextic (6th order) term is gradually added to the
potential and ultimately prevails over the 4th order anharmonicity, despite
expectations that the dynamics is more ""regular"", at least in the regime of
small oscillations. Analyzing this system in the subdiffusive energy domain
using $q$-statistics, we demonstrate that groups of oscillators centered around
the initially excited one (as well as the full chain) possess strongly chaotic
dynamics and are thus far from any quasi-periodic torus, for times as long as
$t=10^9$.

data from more than one data source. Optimizing queries in such scenarios is
particularly challenging not only because of (i) the large variety of possible
query execution plans that correctly answer the query but also because (ii)
there is only limited access to statistics about schema and instance data of
remote sources. To overcome these challenges, most federated query engines rely
on heuristics to reduce the space of possible query execution plans or on
dynamic programming strategies to produce optimal plans. Nevertheless, these
plans may still exhibit a high number of intermediate results or high execution
times because of heuristics and inaccurate cost estimations. In this paper, we
present Odyssey, an approach that uses statistics that allow for a more
accurate cost estimation for federated queries and therefore enables Odyssey to
produce better query execution plans. Our experimental results show that
Odyssey produces query execution plans that are better in terms of data

physical system is crucial in order to obtain important information about its
evolution. However, by using estimation theory, it is possible to obtain, under
certain limitations, some information on its dynamics. The quantum-speed-limit
(QSL) theory was originally used to estimate the shortest time in which a
Hamiltonian drives an initial state to a final one for a given fidelity. Using
the QSL theory in a slightly different way, we are able to estimate the running
time of a given quantum process. For that purpose, we impose the saturation of
the Anandan-Aharonov bound in a rotating frame of reference where the state of
the system travels slower than in the original frame (laboratory frame).
Through this procedure it is possible to estimate the actual evolution time in
the laboratory frame of reference with good accuracy when compared to previous
methods. Our method is tested successfully to predict the time spent in the
evolution of nuclear spins 1/2 and 3/2 in NMR systems. We find that the
estimated time according to our method is better than previous approaches by up
to four orders of magnitude. One disadvantage of our method is that we need to
solve a number of transcendental equations, which increases with the system
dimension and parameter discretization used to solve such equations
numerically.

over permutations. Common scalable methods for approximating solutions of these
NP-hard problems are the spectral relaxation for non-convex energies and the
doubly stochastic (DS) relaxation for convex energies. Lately, it has been
demonstrated that semidefinite programming relaxations can have considerably
improved accuracy at the price of a much higher computational cost. We present
a convex quadratic programming relaxation which is provably stronger than both
DS and spectral relaxations, with the same scalability as the DS relaxation.
The derivation of the relaxation also naturally suggests a projection method
for achieving meaningful integer solutions which improves upon the standard
closest-permutation projection. Our method can be easily extended to
optimization over doubly stochastic matrices, partial or injective matching,
and problems with additional linear constraints. We employ recent advances in
optimization of linear-assignment type problems to achieve an efficient
algorithm for solving the convex relaxation.
  We present experiments indicating that our method is more accurate than local
minimization or competing relaxations for non-convex problems. We successfully
apply our algorithm to shape matching and to the problem of ordering images in

neutron star (NS) accretor. We perform a suite of evolutionary calculations
which show that, in fact, NSs are the dominant type of ULX accretor. Although
black holes (BH) dominate early epochs after the star-formation burst, NSs
outweigh them after a few 100 Myr and may appear as late as a few Gyr after the
end of the star formation episode. If star formation is a prolonged and
continuous event (i.e., not a relatively short burst), NS accretors dominate
ULX population at any time in solar metallicity environment, whereas BH
accretors dominate when the metallicity is sub-solar. Our results show a very
clear (and testable) relation between the companion/donor evolutionary stage
and the age of the system. A typical NS ULX consists of a $\sim1.3\,M_\odot$ NS
and $\sim1.0\,M_\odot$ Red Giant. A typical BH ULX consist of a
$\sim8\,M_\odot$ BH and $\sim6\,M_\odot$ main-sequence star. Additionally, we
find that the very luminous ULXs ($L_X\gtrsim10^{41}$ erg/s) are predominantly
BH systems ($\sim9\,M_\odot$) with Hertzsprung gap donors ($\sim2\,M_\odot$).
Nevertheless, some NS ULX systems may also reach extremely high X-ray

which minimizes the sum of three convex functions $f(x)+g(x)+h(Bx)$, where
$f(x)$ is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient, $g(x)$ and
$h(x)$ have a closed-form expression of their proximity operators and $B$ is a
bounded linear operator. This type of optimization problem has wide application
in signal recovery and image processing. To make full use of the
differentiability function in the optimization problem, we take advantage of
two operator splitting methods: the forward-backward splitting method and the
three operator splitting method. In the iteration scheme derived from the two
operator splitting methods, we need to compute the proximity operator of $g+h
\circ B$ and $h \circ B$, respectively. Although these proximity operators do
not have a closed-form solution in general, they can be solved very
efficiently. We mainly employ two different approaches to solve these proximity
operators: one is dual and the other is primal-dual. Following this way, we
fortunately find that three existing iterative algorithms including Condat and
Vu algorithm, primal-dual fixed point (PDFP) algorithm and primal-dual three
operator (PD3O) algorithm are a special case of our proposed iterative
algorithms. Moreover, we discover a new kind of iterative algorithm to solve
the considered optimization problem, which is not covered by the existing ones.
Under mild conditions, we prove the convergence of the proposed iterative
algorithms. Numerical experiments applied on fused Lasso problem, constrained
total variation regularization in computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction
and low-rank total variation image super-resolution problem demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iterative algorithms.

  appeared in DISC 2017",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We give fault-tolerant algorithms for establishing synchrony in distributed
systems in which each of the $n$ nodes has its own clock. Our algorithms
operate in a very strong fault model: we require self-stabilisation, i.e., the
initial state of the system may be arbitrary, and there can be up to $f<n/3$
ongoing Byzantine faults, i.e., nodes that deviate from the protocol in an
arbitrary manner. Furthermore, we assume that the local clocks of the nodes may
progress at different speeds (clock drift) and communication has bounded delay.
In this model, we study the pulse synchronisation problem, where the task is to
guarantee that eventually all correct nodes generate well-separated local pulse
events (i.e., unlabelled logical clock ticks) in a synchronised manner.
  Compared to prior work, we achieve exponential improvements in stabilisation
time and the number of communicated bits, and give the first sublinear-time
algorithm for the problem:
  - In the deterministic setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in
time $\Theta(f)$ and have each node broadcast $\Theta(f \log f)$ bits per time
unit. We exponentially reduce the number of bits broadcasted per time unit to
$\Theta(\log f)$ while retaining the same stabilisation time.
  - In the randomised setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in time
$\Theta(f)$ and have each node broadcast $O(1)$ bits per time unit. We
exponentially reduce the stabilisation time to $\log^{O(1)} f$ while each node
broadcasts $\log^{O(1)} f$ bits per time unit.
  These results are obtained by means of a recursive approach reducing the
above task of self-stabilising pulse synchronisation in the bounded-delay model
to non-self-stabilising binary consensus in the synchronous model. In general,
our approach introduces at most logarithmic overheads in terms of stabilisation
time and broadcasted bits over the underlying consensus routine.

the main sequence of star formation (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1})<-8.05) or in a
starburst cloud (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1}) >-7.60). The latter contains ~15% of

subsets $R = \{R_1, R_2, ... , R_n\} : R_i \subseteq X$, the goal is to devise
an ordering of the regions, $\sigma_R$, that the tour will visit such that when
a single point is chosen from each region, the induced tour over those points
in the ordering prescribed by $\sigma_R$ is as short as possible. Unlike the
classical locational-uncertainty-TSP problem, which focuses on minimizing the
expected length of such a tour when the point within each region is chosen
according to some probability distribution, here, we focus on the {\em
adversarial model} in which once the choice of $\sigma_R$ is announced, an
adversary selects a point from each region in order to make the resulting tour
as long as possible. In other words, we consider an offline problem in which
the goal is to determine an ordering of the regions $R$ that is optimal with
respect to the ""worst"" point possible within each region being chosen by an
adversary, who knows the chosen ordering. We give a $3$-approximation when $R$
is a set of arbitrary regions/sets of points in a metric space. We show how
geometry leads to improved constant factor approximations when regions are
parallel line segments of the same lengths, and a polynomial-time approximation
scheme (PTAS) for the important special case in which $R$ is a set of disjoint

source reached its peak $\gamma$-ray flux of $(1.9\pm0.2)\times\,10^{-05} \;
{\rm ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ on 22 August. The time averaged broadband spectral
energy distribution (SED) is obtained for three time periods, namely ""flaring
state""; covering the peak $\gamma$-ray flux, ""post flaring state""; immediately
following the peak flare and ""quiescent state""; separated from the flaring
event and following the post flaring state. The SED corresponding to the
flaring state is investigated using different emission models involving
synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC)
mechanisms. Our study suggests that the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission from
3C\,454.3 cannot be attributed to a single emission mechanism and instead, one
needs to consider both SSC and EC mechanisms. Moreover, the target photon
energy responsible for the EC process corresponds to an equivalent temperature
of 564 K, suggesting that the flare location lies beyond the broad line
emitting region of the FSRQ. SED fitting of the other two flux states further
supports these inferences.

among crowds not only safely but also in a socially compliant fashion. This is
a challenging problem because humans tend to navigate by implicitly cooperating
with one another to avoid collisions, while heading toward their respective
destinations. Previous approaches have used hand-crafted functions based on
proximity to model human-human and human-robot interactions. However, these
approaches can only model simple interactions and fail to generalize for
complex crowded settings. In this paper, we develop an approach that models the
joint distribution over future trajectories of all interacting agents in the
crowd, through a local interaction model that we train using real human
trajectory data. The interaction model infers the velocity of each agent based
on the spatial orientation of other agents in his vicinity. During prediction,
our approach infers the goal of the agent from its past trajectory and uses the
learned model to predict its future trajectory. We demonstrate the performance
of our method against a state-of-the-art approach on a public dataset and show
that our model outperforms when predicting future trajectories for longer

an exactly solvable spin-boson model which is particularly relevant for
trapped-ion arrays. Using TWA and its BBGKY extension we accurately reproduce

individual standard rulers, combined with the newest BAO and CMB observation
from Planck results acting as statistical rulers. The results obtained from the

Information Criteria show that: (1) Compared with the current standard candle
data and standard clock data, the intermediate-luminosity radio quasar standard
rulers , probing much higher redshifts, could provide comparable constraints on
different IDE scenarios. (2) The interaction between dark energy and dark
matter seems to be vanishing or slightly smaller than zero. At the 68.3\%
confidence level, the energy is seen transferred from dark matter to dark
energy, which implies that those IDE models can not alleviate the coincidence
problem or even more sever. However, the strong degeneracies between the
interaction term and Hubble constant may contribute to alleviate the tension of
$H_0$ between the recent Planck and HST measurements. (3) Concerning the
ranking of competing dark energy models, IDE with more free parameters are
substantially penalized by the BIC criterion, which agrees very well with the

multiplicative bursts over the neighbouring nodes, which leads to a balanced
growth of interconnections among them. While not exclusive to Stanley, such a
behaviour is not a rule, however. Networks of other outstanding scholars
studied here more often develop a star-like form and the central hubs
constitute the outliers. This study is complemented by a spectral analysis of

the performance of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in its planned
efforts to detect and catalog near-Earth objects (NEOs). The baseline LSST
survey approach is designed to make only two visits to a given field in a given
night, leading to two possible NEO detections per night. These nightly pairs
must be linked across nights to derive orbits of moving objects. However, the
presence of false detections in the data stream leads to the possibility of
high rates of false tracklets, and the ensuing risk that the resulting orbit
catalog may be contaminated by false orbits. To understand the challenges
stemming from a two-visit-per-night cadence, we conducted high-fidelity linkage
tests on a full-density simulated LSST detection stream. We also sought to
quantify the overall performance of LSST as an NEO discovery system under the
hypothesis that detections from the baseline cadence can be successfully
linked. Our simulations revealed that in 10 years LSST would catalog ~60% of
NEOs with absolute magnitude H<22, which is a proxy for 140m and larger
objects. This results neglects linking losses and the contribution of any other
NEO surveys. Including our worst-case linking efficiency we reach a overall
performance assessment of 55% completeness of NEOs with H<22. We estimate that
survey mis-modeling could account for systematic errors of up to 5%. We find
that restricting the evaluation metric to so-called Potentially Hazardous
Asteroids (PHAs) increases the completeness by 3-4%, and that including the
benefits of past and expected future NEO survey activity increases completeness
at the end of the baseline LSST survey by 15-20%. Assembling these results
leads to a projection that by the end of the baseline LSST survey the NEO
catalog will be 80+/-5% complete for PHAs with H < 22.

Studies on compact galaxy groups have led to the conclusion that a
plenitude of phenomena take place in between galaxies that form them. However,
radio data on these objects are extremely scarce and not much is known
concerning the existence and role of the magnetic field in intergalactic space.
Aims. We aim to study a small sample of galaxy groups that look promising as
possible sources of intergalactic magnetic fields; for example data from radio
surveys suggest that most of the radio emission is due to extended, diffuse
structures in and out of the galaxies. Methods. We used the Effelsberg 100 m
radio telescope at 4.85 GHz and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data at 1.40 GHz.
After subtraction of compact sources we analysed the maps searching for
diffuse, intergalactic radio emission. Spectral index and magnetic field
properties were derived. Results. Intergalactic magnetic fields exist in groups
HCG 15 and HCG 60, whereas there are no signs of them in HCG 68. There are also
hints of an intergalactic bridge in HCG 44 at 4.85 GHz. Conclusions.
Intergalactic magnetic fields exist in galaxy groups and their energy density
may be comparable to the thermal (X-ray) density, suggesting an important role
of the magnetic field in the intra-group medium, wherever it is detected.

actions on hyperbolic spaces and quasigeodesic stability. We study these
properties for the class of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, which is a
general framework for studying many important families of groups, including
mapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, most 3-manifold
groups, and many others. A group that admits an acylindrical action on a
hyperbolic space may admit many such actions on different hyperbolic spaces, so
it is natural to search for a ""best"" one. The set of all cobounded acylindrical
actions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure; in this paper we
prove that all hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is
the largest in this poset. The action we construct is also universal in the
sense that every element which acts loxodromically in some acylindrical action
on a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases of this result are
themselves new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that
right-angled Coxeter groups admit universal acylindrical actions. The notion of
quasigeodesic stability of subgroups provides a natural analogue of
quasiconvexity outside the context of hyperbolic groups. We provide a complete
classification of stable subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups,
generalizing and extending results that are known for mapping class groups and
right-angled Artin groups. We also provide a characterization of contracting
quasigeodesics; interestingly, in this generality the proof is much simpler
than in the special cases where it was already known. In the appendix, it is
verified that any space satisfying the a priori weaker property of being an
""almost hierarchically hyperbolic space"" is actually a hierarchically
hyperbolic space. The results of the appendix are used to streamline the proofs

scenario is characterised by two consequent inflation eras, usually separated
by a period where the slow-roll approximation fails. At large field values the
dynamics of the inflaton is dominated by the interplay between its non-minimal
coupling to gravity and the radiative corrections to the inflaton
self-coupling. For small field values the potential is, instead, dominated by a
polynomial that results in a hilltop inflation. Without relying on the
slow-roll approximation, which is invalidated by the appearance of the
intermediate stage, we propose a concrete model that matches the current
measurements of inflationary observables and employs the freedom granted by the
framework on small cosmological scales to give rise to a sizeable population of
primordial black holes generated by large curvature fluctuations. We find that
these features generally require a potential with a local minimum. We show that

noise) in acquired images. Thus, it has become essential tool in high
resolution imaging in many applications, e.g., astronomy, microscopy or
computational photography. In applications such as astronomy and satellite
imaging, the size of acquired images can be extremely large (up to gigapixels)
covering wide field-of-view suffering from shift-variant blur. Most of the
existing image deblurring techniques are designed and implemented to work
efficiently on centralized computing system having multiple processors and a
shared memory. Thus, the largest image that can be handle is limited by the
size of the physical memory available on the system. In this paper, we propose
a distributed nonblind image deblurring algorithm in which several connected
processing nodes (with reasonable computational resources) process
simultaneously different portions of a large image while maintaining certain
coherency among them to finally obtain a single crisp image. Unlike the
existing centralized techniques, image deblurring in distributed fashion raises

trade-offs between the quality of deblurred image and the computational

techniques while allowing distribution, and thus being cost effective for

This paper is devoted to assessing the effectiveness of the truth-spreading

are presented. These criteria capture the influence of the network structures
on the effectiveness of the truth-spreading strategy. Extensive simulations
show that, when the rumor or the truth terminates, the dynamics of a simplified

the minima of the CF_3^+ and F^- ion densities (between the density peaks in
the bulk) are comparable and independent of other external parameters. However,
the ion density maxima generally increase as a function of the pressure or RF
voltage, leading to the enhanced spatial modulation of plasma parameters. The
striation gap (defined as the distance between two ion density peaks) is
approximately inversely proportional to the pressure, while it exhibits a weak
dependence on the RF voltage and the electrode gap. A transition between the
striated and non-striated modes can be observed by changing either the pressure
or the RF voltage; for 13.56 MHz and 18 MHz driving frequencies we present a

good quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a
new design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of

better than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its
fabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good
tolerance to radiations [1], its high light absorption [2, 3] and its
Indium-composition-tuned bandgap [4, 5], the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN)
ternary alloy is a good candidate for high-efficiency-high-reliability solar
cells able to operate in harsh environments. Unfortunately, InGaN p-doping is
still a challenge, owing to InGaN residual n-doping [6], the lack of dedicated

drawbacks can be added the uneasy fabrication of ohmic contacts [4] and the
difficulty to grow the high-quality-high-Indium-content thin films [10] which
would be needed to cover the whole solar spectrum. These drawbacks still
prevent InGaN solar cells to be competitive with other well established III-V

unavailability of full channel state information (CSI), etc. Specifically, we
aim to jointly optimize the remote radio head (RRH) selection, user equipment
(UE)-RRH associations and beam-vectors to minimize the total network power
consumption (NPC) for dense multi-channel downlink C-RAN with incomplete CSI
subject to per-RRH power constraints, each UE's total rate requirement, and
fronthaul link capacity constraints. This optimization problem is NP-hard. In
addition, due to the incomplete CSI, the exact expression of UEs' rate
expression is intractable. We first conservatively replace UEs' rate expression
with its lower-bound. Then, based on the successive convex approximation (SCA)
technique and the relationship between the data rate and the mean square error
(MSE), we propose a single-layer iterative algorithm to solve the NPC
minimization problem with convergence guarantee. In each iteration of the
algorithm, the Lagrange dual decomposition method is used to derive the
structure of the optimal beam-vectors, which facilitates the parallel
computations at the Baseband unit (BBU) pool. Furthermore, a bisection UE
selection algorithm is proposed to guarantee the feasibility of the problem.
Simulation results show the benefits of the proposed algorithms and the fact
