Sphere-valued functional data, which are encountered for example as movement
trajectories on the surface of the earth, are an important special case. We
consider an intrinsic principal component analysis for smooth Riemannian
manifold-valued functional data and study its asymptotic properties. Riemannian
functional principal component analysis (RFPCA) is carried out by first mapping
the manifold-valued data through Riemannian logarithm maps to tangent spaces
around the time-varying Fr\'echet mean function, and then performing a
classical multivariate functional principal component analysis on the linear
tangent spaces. Representations of the Riemannian manifold-valued functions and
the eigenfunctions on the original manifold are then obtained with exponential
maps. The tangent-space approximation through functional principal component
analysis is shown to be well-behaved in terms of controlling the residual
variation if the Riemannian manifold has nonnegative curvature. Specifically,
we derive a central limit theorem for the mean function, as well as root-$n$
uniform convergence rates for other model components, including the covariance
function, eigenfunctions, and functional principal component scores. Our
applications include a novel framework for the analysis of longitudinal
compositional data, achieved by mapping longitudinal compositional data to
trajectories on the sphere, illustrated with longitudinal fruit fly behavior
patterns. RFPCA is shown to be superior in terms of trajectory recovery in
comparison to an unrestricted functional principal component analysis in
applications and simulations and is also found to produce principal component
scores that are better predictors for classification compared to traditional
functional functional principal component scores.

there is a clear difference between the dust and gas radial extents. The origin
of this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and
optical depth effects suggested in the literature. In this work, the feedback
of realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular
emissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The
radial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models
that include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code
DALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence
the disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference
of dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth
of CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.
The effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the
continuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission
can easily differ by a factor of $\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent
$\alpha$ ranging between typical values. Grain growth and settling concur in
thermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate
with large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at
intermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for
low turbulence values. Also, due to disk mid-plane shadowing, a second CO
thermal desorption (rather than photodesorption) front can occur in the warmer
outer mid-plane disk. The models are compared to ALMA observations of HD 163296
as a test case. In order to reproduce the observed CO snowline of the system, a
binding energy for CO typical of ice mixtures needs to be used rather than the
lower pure CO value.

solutions that are only slightly better than differentiable in Eulerian

elucidate the mechanisms in fluid dynamics systems that give rise to this
automatic Lagrangian analyticity, as well as mechanisms in some particular
fluids systems which prevent it from occurring.
  We give a conceptual argument for a general fluids model which shows that the
fulfillment of a basic set of criteria results in the analyticity of the
trajectory maps in time. We then apply this to the incompressible Euler
equations to prove analyticity of trajectories for vortex patch solutions. We
also use the method to prove the Lagrangian trajectories are analytic for
solutions to the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations, for initial data with
moderate regularity.
  We then examine the compressible Euler equations, and find that the finite
speed of propagation in the system is incompatible with the Lagrangian
analyticity property. By taking advantage of this finite speed we are able to
construct smooth initial data with the property that some corresponding
Lagrangian trajectory is not analytic in time. We also study the Vlasov-Poisson
system, uncovering another mechanism that deters the analyticity of
trajectories. In this instance, we find that a key nonlocal operator does not
preserve analytic dependence in time. For this system we can also construct
smooth initial data for which the corresponding solution has some non-analytic
Lagrangian trajectory. This provides a counterexample to Lagrangian analyticity
for a system in which there is an infinite speed of propagation, unlike the
compressible Euler equations.

conclude that the continuum emission is from two hypercompact HII regions

common rotating envelope indicating a bound high-mass binary system. In
addition to this, the thermal CH3OH data show two separate velocity gradients

breathers) in two-dimensional array of coupled finite one-dimensional chains of
oscillators. Localization patterns with both single and multiple localization
sites (multibreathers) are considered. The model is scalar, i.e. each particle
can move only parallel to the axis of the chain it belongs to. The model
involves symmetric parabolic on-site potential with rigid constraints (the
displacement domain of each particle is finite) and a linear nearest-neighbor
coupling in the chain, and also between the neighbors in adjacent chains. When
the particle approaches the constraint, it undergoes an elastic Newtonian
impact. The rigid impact constraints are the only source of nonlinearity in the
system. The model allows easy computation of highly accurate approximate
solutions for the breathers and multibreathers with an arbitrary set of
localization sites in conservative setting. The vibro-impact nonlinearity
permits explicit derivation of a monodromy matrix for the breather and
multi-breather solutions. Consequently, the stability of the derived breather
and multibreather solutions can be studied in the framework of simple methods
of linear algebra, without additional approximations. It is shown that due to
the coupling of the chains, the breather solutions can undergo the symmetry
breaking.

reproduce the FDA of the 11D Supergravity due to non-trivial contributions to
the 4-form cohomology in superspace, while the second one does not contribute
to the 4-form cohomology, being a closed 3-form in the vacuum, defining however
a one parameter family of trilinear forms invariant under a symmetry algebra
related to osp(1|32) by redefining the spin connection and adding a new
Maurer-Cartan equation. We further discuss about the crucial role played by the

propagating negative leaders in lightning flashes by the Telescope Array
Surface Detector (TASD). The TASD is a 700~square kilometer cosmic ray
observatory located in southwestern Utah, U.S.A. In data collected between 2014
and 2016, correlated observations showing the structure and temporal
development of three shower-producing flashes were obtained with a 3D lightning
mapping array, and electric field change measurements were obtained for an
additional seven flashes, in both cases co-located with the TASD. National
Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) information was also used throughout. The
showers arrived in a sequence of 2--5 short-duration ($\le$10~$\mu$s) bursts
over time intervals of several hundred microseconds, and originated at an
altitude of $\simeq$3--5 kilometers above ground level during the first 1--2 ms
of downward negative leader breakdown at the beginning of cloud-to-ground
lightning flashes. The shower footprints, associated waveforms and the effect
of atmospheric propagation indicate that the showers consist primarily of
downward-beamed gamma radiation. This has been supported by GEANT simulation
studies, which indicate primary source fluxes of $\simeq$$10^{12}$--$10^{14}$
photons for $16^{\circ}$ half-angle beams. We conclude that the showers are
terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), similar to those observed by satellites,
but that the ground-based observations are more representative of the temporal
source activity and are also more sensitive than satellite observations, which
detect only the most powerful TGFs.

generates net line-of-sight velocity dispersions ~100-200 km/s, bracketing the

with the cluster pair separation to the 0.25-0.6 power, and that the maximum
size over which star formation is physically correlated ranges from ~200 pc to
~1 kpc. The observed trends between age difference and separation suggest that
cluster formation is hierarchical both in space and time: clusters that are
close to each other are more similar in age than clusters born further apart.
The temporal correlations between stellar aggregates have slopes that are
consistent with turbulence acting as the primary driver of star formation. The
velocity associated with the maximum size is proportional to the galaxy's
shear, suggesting that the galactic environment influences the maximum size of
the star-forming structures.

are consistent with an m=0 slow magneto-acoustic mode, which are excited by
trapped sub-photospheric acoustic (p-mode) waves. However, the spectrum of
umbral waves is broad, suggesting that the observed signatures represent the
superposition of numerous frequencies and/or modes. We apply Fourier filtering,
in both spatial and temporal domains, to extract chromospheric umbral wave
characteristics consistent with an m=1 slow magneto-acoustic mode. This

solved, with corresponding eigenfunctions computed, which allows the density
perturbations to be investigated and compared with our observations. Such

holographic theory of quantum gravity. In general, classicalization of a
quantum system involves amplification of information at the cost of
exponentially reducing the number of observables. In quantum gravity, the
geometry of spacetime must be the analogously amplified information. Bulk local
semiclassical operators probe this information without disturbing it; these
correspond to logical operators acting on code subspaces of the holographic
theory. From this viewpoint, we study how bulk local operators may be realized
in a holographic theory of general spacetimes, which includes AdS/CFT as a
special case, and deduce its consequences. In the first half of the paper, we
ask what description of the bulk physics is provided by a holographic state
dual to a semiclassical spacetime. In particular, we analyze what portion of
the bulk can be reconstructed as spacetime in the holographic theory. The
analysis indicates that when a spacetime contains a quasi-static black hole
inside a holographic screen, the theory provides a description of physics as
viewed from the exterior (though the interior information is not absent). In
the second half, we study how and when a semiclassical description emerges in
the holographic theory. We find that states representing semiclassical
spacetimes are non-generic in the holographic Hilbert space. If there are a
maximal number of independent microstates, semiclassical operators must be
given state-dependently; we elucidate this point using the stabilizer formalism
and tensor network models. We also discuss possible implications of the present
picture for the black hole interior.

applied to any order polyspectra, such as the trispectrum, with the cost of
only a handful of FFTs. All lower order statistics can also be calculated
simultaneously for little extra cost. To test the estimator we make use of a
non-linear density field, and for a more strongly non-Gaussian test case we use
a toy-model of reionization in which ionized bubbles at a given redshift are
all of equal size and are randomly distributed. Our tests find that the FFT
estimator remains accurate over a wide range of k, and so should be extremely
useful for analysis of 21-cm observations. The speed of the FFT bispectrum
estimator makes it suitable for sampling applications, such as Bayesian
inference. The algorithm we describe should prove valuable in the analysis of
simulations and observations, and whilst we apply it within the field of
cosmology, this estimator is useful in any field that deals with non-Gaussian

galaxies, run with the N-body + SPH code, ChaNGA, at a high resolution of 60
pc. For M$_{halo} > 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$, the simulated SMHM relationship agrees
with literature determinations, including exhibiting a small scatter. However,
the scatter in the SMHM relation increases dramatically for lower-mass halos.
We find that some of this scatter is due to {\em dark dwarfs}, halos devoid of
stars. However, even when only considering well-resolved halos that contain a
stellar population, the scatter in stellar mass reaches nearly 1 dex for
M$_{halo}$($z=0$) 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$. Much of this scatter is due to including
satellites of the dwarf galaxies that have had their halo masses reduced
through tidal stripping. The fraction of dark dwarfs (those that contain no
stars) increases substantially with decreasing halo mass. When these dark halos
are considered, the true scatter in the SMHM at low masses is even larger. At
the faintest end of the SMHM relation probed by our simulations, a galaxy
cannot be assigned a unique halo mass based solely on its luminosity. We
provide a formula to stochastically populate low-mass halos following our
results. Our predicted large scatter at low halo masses increases the slope of

of the most compelling scientific opportunities of our time. Nevertheless, the
high cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen
public interest in the results of such research requires the rigorous
development of experiments that can deliver a definitive advance in our
understanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a ""systems
science"" approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for
individual planets to make statements about their habitability and the
possibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the
diversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited
information that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here we propose
a complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary
characteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader
questions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental
principle of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be
learned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than
requiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single
object. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet
atmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable
zone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of
habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be
developed to test other foundational hypotheses is this area.

by dust in the interstellar medium. In the nearby galaxy M31, we measure a
strong radial variation of [CII]/TIR that we rule out as being due to an
intrinsic variation in $\epsilon_{\rm PE}$. [CII]/TIR fails as a proxy for
$\epsilon_{\rm PE}$, because the TIR measures all dust heating, not just the
contribution from FUV photons capable of ejecting electrons from dust grains.
Using extensive multiwavelength coverage from the FUV to far-infrared (FIR), we
infer the attenuated FUV emission ($\rm UV_{att}$), and the total attenuated
flux ($\rm TOT_{att}$). We find [CII]/TIR to be strongly correlated with $\rm
UV_{att}$/$\rm TOT_{att}$, indicating that, in M31 at least, one of the
dominant drivers for [CII]/TIR variation is the relative hardness of the
absorbed stellar radiation field. We define $\rm{ \epsilon_{PE}^{UV}}$,
[CII]/$\rm{ UV_{att}}$ which should be more closely related to the actual PE
efficiency, which we find to be essentially constant ($1.85 \pm 0.8 \%$) in all
explored fields in M31. This suggests that part of the observed variation of
[CII]/TIR in other galaxies is likely due to a change in the relative hardness
of the absorbed stellar radiation field, caused by a combination of variations
in the stellar population, dust opacity and galaxy metallicity, although PE
efficiency may also vary across a wider range of environments.

the case of standard and normal (SANE) disks, we find that, in the reconnection
sites, the plasma beta ranges from $0.1$ to $1000$, the magnetization ranges
from $10^{-4}$ to $1$, and the guide fields are weak compared to the

values for plasma beta from $10^{-2}$ to $10^3$, magnetizations from $10^{-3}$

greater than the reconnecting fields. These are critical parameters that govern
the electron energy distribution resulting from magnetic reconnection and can
be used in the context of plasma simulations to provide microphysics inputs to

galaxy. Observations have shown that gravitational and magnetic energy are
comparable in its integral shaped filament (ISF) on a scale of ~1 pc, and that
the population of pre-main sequence stars appears dynamically heated compared
to the protostars. These results have been attributed to a slingshot mechanism
resulting from the oscillation of the filament (Stutz & Gould 2016). In this
paper, we show that radially contracting filaments naturally evolve toward a
state where gravitational, magnetic, and rotational energy are comparable.
While the contraction of the filament will preferentially amplify the axial
component of the magnetic field, the presence of rotation leads to a helical
field structure. We show how magnetic tension can give rise to a filament
oscillation, and estimate a typical timescale of 0.7 million years for the
motion of the filament to the position of maximum displacement, consistent with
the characteristic timescale of the ejected stars. Furthermore, the presence of
helical magnetic fields is expected to give rise to magneto-hydrodynamical
instabilities. We show here that the presence of a magnetic field significantly
enhances the overall instability, which operates on a characteristic scale of
about 1 pc. We expect the physics discussed here to be generally relevant in
massive star forming regions, and encourage further investigations in the
future.

meteorites of known composition. The HEDs enabled us to determine formulas
relating Band 1 and Band 2 centers to pyroxene ferrosilite (Fs) compositions.
Using these formulas we present the most comprehensive compositional analysis
to date of middle and outer belt basaltic asteroids. We also conduct a careful
error analysis of the MGM-derived band centers for implementation in future
analyses. The six outer belt V- and R-type asteroids show more dispersion in
parameter space than the Vestoids, reflecting greater compositional diversity
than Vesta and its associated bodies. The objects analyzed have Fs numbers
which are, on average, between five and ten molar percent lower than those of
the Vestoids; however, identification and compositional analysis of additional
outer belt basaltic asteroids would help to confirm or refute this result.

indexes with $M\log M=o(m)$, the optimal constants are contractive. For
instance, we can consider% \[ M=\left\lfloor \frac{m}{\left( \log m\right)

x\rfloor:=\max\{n\in\mathbb{N}:n\leq x\}.$ In particular, if $\varepsilon>0$
and $M:=M(m)\leq m^{1-\varepsilon},$ then the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality
restricted to sums over $M$ indexes is contractive.

specifying and reasoning about structure by means of patterns and pattern
matching. Its sentences, the patterns, are constructed using variables,
symbols, connectives and quantifiers, but no difference is made between
function and predicate symbols. In models, a pattern evaluates into a power-set
domain (the set of values that match it), in contrast to FOL where functions
and predicates map into a regular domain. Matching logic uniformly generalizes
several logical frameworks important for program analysis, such as:
propositional logic, algebraic specification, FOL with equality, modal logic,
and separation logic. Patterns can specify separation requirements at any level
in any program configuration, not only in the heaps or stores, without any
special logical constructs for that: the very nature of pattern matching is
that if two structures are matched as part of a pattern, then they can only be
spatially separated. Like FOL, matching logic can also be translated into pure
predicate logic with equality, at the same time admitting its own sound and
complete proof system. A practical aspect of matching logic is that FOL
reasoning with equality remains sound, so off-the-shelf provers and SMT solvers
can be used for matching logic reasoning. Matching logic is particularly
well-suited for reasoning about programs in programming languages that have an
operational semantics, but it is not limited to this.

multi-dimensional Euclidean space, moving so that the velocity of the rear end
is always aligned with the segment. If the front track is prescribed, the
trajectory of the rear wheel is uniquely determined via a certain first order
differential equation -- the bicycle equation. The same model, in dimension
two, describes another mechanical device, the hatchet planimeter.
  Here is a sampler of our results. We express the linearized flow of the
bicycle equation in terms of the geometry of the rear track; in dimension
three, for closed front and rear tracks, this is a version of the Berry phase
formula. We show that in all dimensions a sufficiently long bicycle also serves
as a planimeter: it measures, approximately, the area bivector defined by the
closed front track. We prove that the bicycle equation also describes rolling,
without slipping and twisting, of hyperbolic space along Euclidean space. We
relate the bicycle problem with two completely integrable systems: the AKNS
(Ablowitz, Kaup, Newell and Segur) system and the vortex filament equation. We
show that ""bicycle correspondence"" of space curves (front tracks sharing a
common back track) is a special case of a Darboux transformation associated
with the AKNS system. We show that the filament hierarchy, encoded as a single
generating equation, describes a 3-dimensional bike of imaginary length. We
show that a series of examples of ""ambiguous"" closed bicycle curves (front
tracks admitting self bicycle correspondence), found recently F. Wegner, are
buckled rings, or solitons of the planar filament equation. As a case study, we
give a detailed analysis of such curves, arising from bicycle correspondence

bypasses the need for density estimation by using the error rates of k-NN

overcome this limitation, we develop an ensemble method for estimating the

vacuum in a fermion-free version of a theory, such as gravity or QCD, suffices
to conclude the following: Once N massless fermion flavors are added to the
theory, they break the chiral flavor symmetry dynamically, down to a subgroup
that would be anomaly-free under gauging; In both theories, the
pseudo-Goldstone corresponding to axial U(1)-symmetry becomes massive; In QCD
as well as in gravity the massless fermions are eliminated from the low energy
spectrum of the theory. All the above conclusions are reached without making an
assumption about confinement. Some key methods of our approach are:
Reformulation of topological susceptibility in the language of a three-form
gauge theory; Utilization of gravity in the role of a spectator interaction for
the chiral anomaly-matching in QCD; Gauging chiral symmetries and matching
their anomalies using the spectator Green-Schwarz type axions. Our observations
suggest that breaking of chiral symmetries in QCD and in gravity can be
described in unified topological language, and seemingly-disconnected
phenomena, such as, the generation of eta'-meson mass in QCD and breaking of
global chiral symmetry by gravity may share a secret analogy. The described
phenomenon may shed a new light - via contribution of micro black holes into
the gravitational topological susceptibility of the vacuum - on incompatibility
between black holes and global symmetries. It appears that explicit breaking is
not the sole possibility, and like QCD, gravity may break global symmetries
dynamically. As an useful byproduct, matching of gravitational anomalies
provides a selection tool for compositeness, eliminating possibility of
massless composite fermions where standard gauge anomaly matching would allow
for their existence.

use them to generate magnetic currents. In the present work, we address the
issue of generating magnetic currents and magnetic thermal currents in
electrically-insulating low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets by invoking
the (broken) electricity-magnetism duality symmetry. The ground state of these
materials is a spin-liquid state that can be described well via~the
Jordan--Wigner fermions, which permit an easy definition of the magnetic
particle and thermal currents. The magnetic and magnetic thermal conductivities
are calculated in the present work using the bond--mean field theory. The
spin-liquid states in these antiferromagnets are either gapless or gapped
liquids of spinless fermions whose flow defines a current just as the one
defined for electrons in a Fermi liquid. The driving force for the magnetic
current is a magnetic field with a gradient along the magnetic conductor. We
predict the generation of a magneto-motive force and realization of magnetic
circuits using low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets. The present work is
also about claiming that what the experiments in spintronics attempt to do is
trying to treat the magnetic degrees of freedoms on the same footing as the

consequence of this breaking, the reactor and atmospheric angle are deviate
from $0^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$, respectively. Such deviations can be
enhanced or suppressed by the CP parities in the Majorana phases, so that an
analytic study is carried out to remark their importance to constrain the free
parameters that accommodate the mixing angles. The normal hierarchy is
completely discarded in this model, the inverted hierarchy is less favored than
the degenerate one where the reactor and atmospheric angles are in good
agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the model predicts defined

\propto R_{e} \sigma^{2}$, with $R_{e}$ the effective radius and $\sigma$ their
velocity dispersion. When both of the above quantities are available, the
resulting masses are compared to observed stellar luminosities to derive
Newtonian mass to light ratios, given a physically motivated proportionality
constant in the above expression. For local dSphs and the growing sample of
ultrafaint such systems, the above results in the largest mass to light ratios
of any galactic systems known, with values in the hundreds and even thousands
being common. The standard interpretation is for a dominant presence of an as
yet undetected dark matter component. If however, reality is closer to a
MONDian theory at the extremely low accelerations relevant to such systems,
$\sigma$ will scale with { stellar mass} $M_{*}^{1/4}$. This yields an
expression for the mass to light ratio which will be obtained under Newtonian
assumptions of $(M/L)_{N}=120 R_{e}(\Upsilon_{*}/L)^{1/2}$. Here we compare
$(M/L)_{N}$ values from this expression to Newtonian inferences for this ratios
for the actual $(R_{e}, \sigma, L)$ observed values for a sample of recently
observed ultrafaint dSphs, obtaining good agreement. Then, for systems where no
$\sigma$ values have been reported, we give predictions for the $(M/L)_{N}$
values which under a MONDian scheme are expected once kinematical observations
become available. For the recently studied Dragonfly 44 { and Crater II

because these vectors act as the base for building em- beddings for customers

customers. We have used exponential family embeddings as the tool to construct
two basic vectors - product embeddings and context vectors. Using the basic
vectors, we build combined embeddings, trip embeddings and customer embeddings.
Combined embeddings mix linguistic properties of product names with their
shopping patterns. The customer embeddings establish an understand- ing of the
buying pattern of customers in a group and help in building customer profile.
For example a customer profile can represent customers frequently buying
pet-food. Identifying such profiles can help us bring out offers and discounts.
Similarly, trip embeddings are used to build trip profiles. People happen to
buy similar set of products in a trip and hence their trip embeddings can be
used to predict the next product they would like to buy. This is a novel
technique and the first of its kind to make recommendation using product, trip

sub-halo abundance matching (SHAM) models that populate (sub-)haloes with
galaxies based on peak halo mass, $M_{\rm peak}$. SHAM models based on the peak
maximum circular velocity, $V_{\rm peak}$, have had much better success. The
primary reason $M_{\rm peak}$ based models fail is the relatively low abundance
of satellite galaxies produced in these models compared to those based on
$V_{\rm peak}$. Despite success in predicting clustering, a simple $V_{\rm
peak}$ based SHAM model results in predictions for galaxy growth that are at
odds with observations. We evaluate three possible remedies that could ""save""
mass-based SHAM: (1) SHAM models require a significant population of ""orphan""
galaxies as a result of artificial disruption/merging of sub-haloes in modern
high resolution dark matter simulations; (2) satellites must grow significantly
after their accretion; and (3) stellar mass is significantly affected by halo
assembly history. No solution is entirely satisfactory. However, regardless of
the particulars, we show that popular SHAM models based on $M_{\rm peak}$
cannot be complete physical models as presented. Either $V_{\rm peak}$ truly is
a better predictor of stellar mass at $z\sim 0$ and it remains to be seen how
the correlation between stellar mass and $V_{\rm peak}$ comes about, or SHAM
models are missing vital component(s) that significantly affect galaxy
clustering.

scalar field that couples non-minimally to the metric tensor, while satisfying
the weak-equivalence principle. These theories are interesting because they
have the potential to simultaneously suppress modifications to Einstein's
theory on Solar System scales, while introducing large deviations in the strong
field of neutron stars. Scalar-tensor theories can be classified through the
choice of conformal factor, a scalar that regulates the coupling between matter
and the metric in the Einstein frame. The class defined by a Gaussian conformal
factor with negative exponent has been studied the most because it leads to
spontaneous scalarization (i.e. the sudden activation of the scalar field in
neutron stars), which consequently leads to large deviations from General
Relativity in the strong field. This class, however, has recently been shown to
be in conflict with Solar System observations when accounting for the
cosmological evolution of the scalar field. We study whether this remains the
case when the exponent of the conformal factor is positive, as well as in
another class of theories defined by a hyperbolic conformal factor. We find
that in both of these scalar-tensor theories, Solar System tests are passed
only in a very small subset of parameter space, for a large set of initial
conditions compatible with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, while we find
that it is possible for neutron stars to scalarize, one must carefully select
the coupling parameter to do so, and even then, the scalar charge is typically
two orders of magnitude smaller than in the negative exponent case. Our study
suggests that future work on scalar-tensor gravity, for example in the context
of tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves from neutron star
binaries, should be carried out within the positive coupling parameter class.

We study here in detail a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold
reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to
capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and
characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that
our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field

analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction
dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we
find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the
reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion
properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous
experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic
reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a
simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the
molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed
single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates
at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Our work
sheds light on the physical mechanisms and principles linking the collective

lensed photons at galactic scales within the context of General Relativity

component. The onset of these gravitational anomalies, where the Schwarzschild
solution no longer describes observations, closely corresponds to regions where
accelerations drop below the characteristic $a_{0}$ acceleration of MOND, which
occur at a well established mass-dependent radial distance, $R_{c}\propto
(GM/a_{0})^{1/2}$. At cosmological scales, inferred dynamics are also
inconsistent with GR and the observed distribution of mass. The current
accelerated expansion rate requires the introduction of a hypothetical dark
energy dominant component. We here show that for a Schwarzschild metric at
galactic scales, the scalar curvature, K, multiplied by $(r^{4}/M)$ at the
critical MOND transition radius, $r=R_{c}$, has an invariant value of
$\kappa_{B}=K(r^{4}/M)=28Ga_{0}/c^{4}$. Further, assuming this condition holds
for $r>R_{c}$, is consistent with the full spacetime which under GR corresponds
to a dominant isothermal dark matter halo, to within observational precision at
galactic level. For a FLRW metric, this same constant bounding curvature
condition yields for a spatially flat spacetime a cosmic expansion history
which agrees with the $\Lambda$CDM empirical fit for recent epochs, and which
similarly tends asymptotically to a de Sitter solution. Thus, a simple
covariant purely geometric condition identifies the low acceleration regime of
observed gravitational anomalies, and can be used to guide the development of {
extended} gravity theories at both galactic and cosmological scales.

represent their meaning as real-valued vectors. However, it is not clear how
much information such representations retain about the polarity of sentences.
To study this question, we decode sentiment from unsupervised sentence
representations learned with different architectures (sensitive to the order of
words, the order of sentences, or none) in 9 typologically diverse languages.
Sentiment results from the (recursive) composition of lexical items and
grammatical strategies such as negation and concession. The results are
manifold: we show that there is no `one-size-fits-all' representation
architecture outperforming the others across the board. Rather, the top-ranking
architectures depend on the language and data at hand. Moreover, we find that
in several cases the additive composition model based on skip-gram word vectors
may surpass supervised state-of-art architectures such as bidirectional LSTMs.
Finally, we provide a possible explanation of the observed variation based on
the type of negative constructions in each language.

graph of dependencies. Since the advent of high-throughput data acquisition
technologies in fields such as genomics, metabolomics, and neuroscience, the
automated inference and reconstruction of such interaction networks directly
from large sets of activation data, commonly known as reverse-engineering, has
become a routine procedure. Whereas early attempts at network
reverse-engineering focused predominantly on producing maps of system

instrumental roles in answering questions about the statistics and dynamics of
the underlying systems they represent. Many of these predictions have clinical
relevance, suggesting novel paradigms for drug discovery and disease treatment.
While other reviews focus predominantly on the details and effectiveness of
individual network inference algorithms, here we examine the emerging field as
a whole. We first summarize several key application areas in which inferred
networks have made successful predictions. We then outline the two major
classes of reverse-engineering methodologies, emphasizing that the type of
prediction that one aims to make dictates the algorithms one should employ. We
conclude by discussing whether recent breakthroughs justify the computational
costs of large-scale reverse-engineering sufficiently to admit it as a mainstay

reduction technique, widely used in predictive modeling. A key factor in its
widespread use in this domain is the fact that the projection of a dataset onto
its first $K$ principal components minimizes the sum of squared errors between
the original data and the projected data over all possible rank $K$
projections. Thus, PCA provides optimal low-rank representations of data for
least-squares linear regression under standard modeling assumptions. On the
other hand, when the loss function for a prediction problem is not the
least-squares error, PCA is typically a heuristic choice of dimensionality
reduction -- in particular for classification problems under the zero-one loss.
In this paper we target classification problems by proposing a straightforward
alternative to PCA that aims to minimize the difference in margin distribution
between the original and the projected data. Extensive experiments show that
our simple approach typically outperforms PCA on any particular dataset, in
terms of classification error, though this difference is not always
statistically significant, and despite being a filter method is frequently
competitive with Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Lasso on a wide range of
datasets.

obtained by extrapolating the Planck flat $\Lambda$CDM best-fit cosmology. All
of our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory,
confirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point
for numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We
combine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to
construct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and

exhibit complex preparation-dependent mechanical response to applied shear. We
perform numerical simulations to investigate the mechanical response of binary
Lennard-Jones glasses undergoing athermal, quasistatic pure shear as a function
of the cooling rate $R$ used to prepare them. The ensemble-averaged stress
versus strain curve $\langle\sigma(\gamma)\rangle$ resembles the spatial
average in the large size limit, which appears smooth and displays a putative
elastic regime at small strains, a yielding-related peak at intermediate
strain, and a plastic flow regime at large strains. In contrast, for each glass
configuration in the ensemble, the stress-strain curve consists of many short
nearly linear segments that are punctuated by particle-rearrangement-induced
rapid stress drops. We quantify the shape of the small stress-strain segments,
as well as the frequency and size of the stress drops in each glass
configuration. We decompose the stress loss into the loss from particle
rearrangements and from softening i.e., the reduction of the slopes of the
linear segments in $\sigma(\gamma)$), and then compare the two contributions as
a function of $R$ and $\gamma$. For the current studies, the
rearrangement-induced stress loss is larger than the softening-induced stress
loss, however, softening stress losses increase with decreasing cooling rate.
We also characterize the structure of the potential energy landscape along the
strain direction for glasses prepared with different $R$, and observe a
dramatic change of the properties of the landscape near the yielding
transition. We then show that the rearrangement-induced energy loss per strain
can serve as an order parameter for the yielding transition, which sharpens for
slow cooling rates and in the large system-size limit.

simultaneous appearance of a crystalline density order and a spin-wave order.
The latter spontaneously breaks the discrete $\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry between
even and odd sites of the cavity optical potential. Moreover, in the
superradiant state the continuous $U(1)$ symmetry of the relative phase of the
two condensate wavefunctions is explicitly broken by the cavity-induced
position-dependent Raman coupling with a zero spatial average. Thus, the
spatially-averaged relative condensate phase is locked at either $\pi/2$ or
$-\pi/2$. This continuous symmetry breaking and relative condensate phase
locking by a zero-average Raman field can be considered as a generic
order-by-disorder process similar to the random-field-induced order in the
two-dimensional classical ferromagnetic $XY$ spin model. However, the seed of
the random field in our model stems from quantum fluctuations in the cavity

developed for small sample size. We introduce a data-driven statistical physics
approach to model inference based on minimizing a free energy of data and show
superior model recovery for small sample sizes. We demonstrate coupling
strength inference in non-equilibrium kinetic Ising models, including in the
difficult large coupling variability regime, and show scaling to systems of
arbitrary size. As applications, we infer a functional connectivity network in
the salamander retina and a currency exchange rate network from time-series
data of neuronal spiking and currency exchange rates, respectively. Accurate
small sample size inference is critical for devising a profitable currency
hedging strategy.

fluctuations in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas is necessary for a more
complete characterization of the behavior of a variety of space and
astrophysical plasmas. Such a determination is complicated by the complex
nature of the turbulence as well as observational constraints, chiefly that in
situ measurements of such plasmas are typically only available at a single
point in space. Recent work has shown that correlations between electric fields
and particle velocity distributions constructed from single-point measurements
produce a velocity-dependent signature of the collisionless damping mechanism.
We extend this work by constructing field-particle correlations using data sets
drawn from single points in strongly driven, turbulent, electromagnetic
gyrokinetic simulations to demonstrate that this technique can identify the
collisionless mechanisms operating in such systems. The correlation's
velocity-space structure agrees with expectations of resonant mechanisms
transferring energy collisionlessly in turbulent systems. This work motivates
the eventual application of field-particle correlations to spacecraft
measurements in the solar wind, with the ultimate goal to determine the
physical mechanisms that dissipate magnetized plasma turbulence.

an amount, $\alpha$, as photons propagate through free space. Such an effect

the Chern-Simons term common in axion models, quintessence models, or
Lorentz-violating extensions to the standard model. Most studies consider the

a novel pixel-based method to extract the spherical harmonics for $L \le 30$

a simple power-law model with photon index of $\Gamma = 2.30^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$,

  In this paper, we propose an async-parallel method based on block coordinate

Running on a single node, the method becomes a novel randomized primal-dual BCU

convergence. On the contrary, merely assuming convexity, we show that the
objective value sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges in
probability to the optimal value and also the constraint residual to zero. In
addition, we establish an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence result, where $k$ is the
number of iterations. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed method and significantly better speed-up performance
than its sync-parallel counterpart.

there has been a large body of research in this area, most approaches that

approximately preserves the Euclidean geometry of the data with high

\mathbf{R}^n$, from magnitude-only measurements $y_i =
|\left\langle\mathbf{a}_i,\mathbf{x}^*\right\rangle|$ for $i=[m]$. Also called
the phase retrieval, this is a fundamental challenge in bio-,astronomical
imaging and speech processing. The problem above is ill-posed; additional
assumptions on the signal and/or the measurements are necessary. In this paper
we first study the case where the signal $\mathbf{x}^*$ is $s$-sparse. We
develop a novel algorithm that we call Compressive Phase Retrieval with
Alternating Minimization, or CoPRAM. Our algorithm is simple; it combines the
classical alternating minimization approach for phase retrieval with the CoSaMP
algorithm for sparse recovery. Despite its simplicity, we prove that CoPRAM
achieves a sample complexity of $O(s^2\log n)$ with Gaussian measurements
$\mathbf{a}_i$, matching the best known existing results; moreover, it
demonstrates linear convergence in theory and practice. Additionally, it
requires no extra tuning parameters other than signal sparsity $s$ and is
robust to noise. When the sorted coefficients of the sparse signal exhibit a
power law decay, we show that CoPRAM achieves a sample complexity of $O(s\log
n)$, which is close to the information-theoretic limit. We also consider the
case where the signal $\mathbf{x}^*$ arises from structured sparsity models. We
specifically examine the case of block-sparse signals with uniform block size
of $b$ and block sparsity $k=s/b$. For this problem, we design a recovery
algorithm Block CoPRAM that further reduces the sample complexity to $O(ks\log
n)$. For sufficiently large block lengths of $b=\Theta(s)$, this bound equates
to $O(s\log n)$. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first end-to-end
algorithm for phase retrieval where the Gaussian sample complexity has a
sub-quadratic dependence on the signal sparsity level.

which a mechanical oscillator that is parametrically coupled to an
electromagnetic mode can experience a change in its rigidity and its damping
rate. The finite cavity electromagnetic decay rate can lead to either
amplification or cooling of the mechanical oscillator, and lead in particular
to a parametric oscillatory instability, associated with regenerative
oscillations of the mechanical oscillator, an effect limiting the circulating
power in laser gravitational wave interferometers. These effects implicitly
rely on an electromagnetic cavity whose dissipation rate vastly exceeds that of
the mechanical oscillator, a condition naturally satisfied in most
optomechanical systems. Here we consider the opposite limit, where the
mechanical dissipation is engineered to dominate over the electromagnetic one,
essentially reversing role of electromagnetic and mechanical degree of freedom.
As a result, the electromagnetic field is now subject to dynamical backaction:
the mechanical oscillator provides a feedback mechanism which modifies the
damping rate of the electromagnetic cavity. We describe this phenomenon in the
spirit of Braginsky's original description, invoking finite cavity delay and
highlighting the role of dissipation. Building on previous experimental work,
we demonstrate this dynamical backaction on light in a superconducting
microwave optomechanical circuit. In particular, we drive the system above the
parametric instability threshold of the microwave mode, leading to maser action
and demonstrate injection locking of the maser, which stabilizes its frequency
and reduces its noise.

connected dominating set respectively of minimum cardinalities. MVC, CVC, MDS,
and CDS on a general graph are known to be NP-complete. On certain classes of
graphs they can be computed in polynomial time. Such algorithms are known for
bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, cycle graphs, comparability graphs, claw-free
graphs, interval graphs and circular arc graphs for some of these problems. In
this article we introduce a new class of graphs called a layered graph and show
that if the number of vertices in a layer is $O(\log \mid V \mid)$ then MIS,
MVC, CVC, MDS and CDC can be computed in polynomial time. The restrictions that
are employed on graph classes that admit polynomial time solutions for hard
problems, e.g. lack of cycles, bipartiteness, planarity etc. are not applicable
for this class. \\ Key words: Independent set, vertex cover, dominating set,
dynamic programming, complexity, polynomial time algorithms.

effective area in access of about 6000 cm2 at 15 keV. The large detection
volume of the LAXPC detectors, filled with xenon gas at about 2 atmosphere
pressure, results in detection efficiency greater than 50%, above 30 keV. In
this article, we present salient features of the LAXPC detectors, their testing
and characterization in the laboratory prior to launch and calibration in the
orbit. Some preliminary results on timing and spectral characteristics of a few
X-ray binaries and other type of sources, are briefly discussed to demonstrate
that the LAXPC instrument is performing as planned in the orbit.

predicting and managing climate change effects on wild plants and crops. Here,
we combined crop modeling and quantitative genetics to study the genetic
control of oil yield plasticity for multiple abiotic stresses in sunflower.
  First we developed stress indicators to characterize 14 environments for
three abiotic stresses (cold, drought and nitrogen) using the SUNFLO crop model
and phenotypic variations of three commercial varieties. The computed plant
stress indicators better explain yield variation than descriptors at the
climatic or crop levels. In those environments, we observed oil yield of 317
sunflower hybrids and regressed it with three selected stress indicators. The
slopes of cold stress norm reaction were used as plasticity phenotypes in the
following genome-wide association study.
  Among the 65,534 tested SNP, we identified nine QTL controlling oil yield
plasticity to cold stress. Associated SNP are localized in genes previously
shown to be involved in cold stress responses: oligopeptide transporters, LTP,
cystatin, alternative oxidase, or root development. This novel approach opens
new perspectives to identify genomic regions involved in
genotype-by-environment interaction of a complex traits to multiple stresses in
realistic natural or agronomical conditions.

observed in Galactic halo stars. Oxygen abundances deviate substantially from
the observed abundances in the Galactic halo stars for [Fe/H] values larger
than -2 dex, while they overlap for lower metallicities. On the other hand, for
the [Ba/Fe] ratio the discrepancy is extended at all [Fe/H] values, suggesting
that the majority of stars in the halo are likely to have been formed in situ.
Therefore, we suggest that [Ba/Fe] ratios are a better diagnostic than [O/Fe]
ratios. Moreover, we show the effects of an enriched infall of gas with the
same chemical abundances as the matter ejected and/or stripped from dwarf

of these steps as a function of the drive frequency is directly related to the

this hypothesis is tested with a corpus of 17th century German funeral sermons.
For each referent in the relative clauses and their matrix clauses, the
attention state was determined (first calculation). In a second calculation,
for each word the surprisal values were determined, using a bi-gram language
model. In a third calculation, the surprisal values were accommodated as to
whether it is the first occurrence of the word in question or not. All three
calculations pointed in the same direction: With in-situ relative clauses, the
rate of new referents was lower and the average surprisal values were lower,
especially the accommodated surprisal values, than with extraposed relative
clauses. This indicated that in-formation density is a factor governing the
choice between in-situ and extraposed relative clauses. The study also sheds

various extensions of ensemble learning for mining non-stationary data streams
can be found in the literature, most of them are crafted under a static base
classifier and revisits preceding samples in the sliding window for a
retraining step. This feature causes computationally prohibitive complexity and
is not flexible enough to cope with rapidly changing environments. Their
complexities are often demanding because it involves a large collection of
offline classifiers due to the absence of structural complexities reduction
mechanisms and lack of an online feature selection mechanism. A novel evolving
ensemble classifier, namely Parsimonious Ensemble pENsemble, is proposed in
this paper. pENsemble differs from existing architectures in the fact that it
is built upon an evolving classifier from data streams, termed Parsimonious
Classifier pClass. pENsemble is equipped by an ensemble pruning mechanism,
which estimates a localized generalization error of a base classifier. A
dynamic online feature selection scenario is integrated into the pENsemble.
This method allows for dynamic selection and deselection of input features on
the fly. pENsemble adopts a dynamic ensemble structure to output a final
classification decision where it features a novel drift detection scenario to
grow the ensemble structure. The efficacy of the pENsemble has been numerically
demonstrated through rigorous numerical studies with dynamic and evolving data
streams where it delivers the most encouraging performance in attaining a
tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

expression of the corresponding MI lacks a closed-form formulation. Hence, a
lower bound is proposed to quantify the MI of the SM-NOMA system. Furthermore,
its asymptotic property is also theoretically investigated in both low and high

agreement with the Hillier stellar-wind model. This provides direct
confirmation that the physical wind parameters of that model are roughly
correct, including the mass-loss rate of 10^-3 M_sun/yr, plus the clumping
factor, and the terminal velocity. Comparison of the H-alpha images

  Approach",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The reliability and transmission distance are generally limited for the
wireless communications due to the severe channel fading. As an effective way
to resist the channel fading, cooperative relaying is usually adopted in
wireless networks where neighbouring nodes act as relays to help the
transmission between the source and the destination. Most research works simply
regard these cooperative nodes trustworthy, which may be not practical in some
cases especially when transmitting confidential information. In this paper, we
consider the issue of untrusted relays in cooperative communications and
propose an information self-encrypted approach to protect against these relays.
Specifically, the original packets of the information are used to encrypt each
other as the secret keys such that the information cannot be recovered before
all of the encrypted packets have been received. The information is intercepted
only when the relays obtain all of these encrypted packets. It is proved that
the intercept probability is reduced to zero exponentially with the number of
the original packets. However, the security performance is still not
satisfactory for a large number of relays. Therefore, the combination of
destination-based jamming is further adopted to confuse the relays, which makes
the security performance acceptable even for a large number of relays. Finally,
the simulation results are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis and the
superiority of the proposed scheme.

genetic regulation system, when the synthesis reaction rate is under additive
and multiplicative asymmetric stable L\'evy fluctuations. By focusing on the
impact of skewness (i.e., non-symmetry) in the probability distributions of
noise, we find that via examining the mean first exit time (MFET) and the first
escape probability (FEP), the asymmetric fluctuations, interacting with
nonlinearity in the system, lead to peculiar likelihood for transcription. This
includes, in the additive noise case, realizing higher likelihood of
transcription for larger positive skewness (i.e., asymmetry) index $\beta$,
causing a stochastic bifurcation at the non-Gaussianity index value $\alpha=1$
(i.e., it is a separating point or line for the likelihood for transcription),
and achieving a turning point at the threshold value $\beta \approx -0.5$
(i.e., beyond which the likelihood for transcription suddenly reversed for
$\alpha$ values). The stochastic bifurcation and turning point phenomena do not
occur in the symmetric noise case ($\beta =0$). While in the multiplicative
noise case, non-Gaussianity index value $\alpha=1$ is a separating point or
line for both the mean first exit time (MFET) and the first escape probability
(FEP). We also investigate the noise enhanced stability phenomenon.
Additionally, we are able to specify the regions in the whole parameter space
for the asymmetric noise, in which we attain desired likelihood for
transcription. We have conducted a series of numerical experiments in
`regulating' the likelihood of gene transcription by tuning asymmetric stable
L\'evy noise indexes. This work offers insights for possible ways of achieving
gene regulation in experimental research.

provides a general and powerful framework to study these networks and their

have been widely applied to investigate the modular structure of many natural
networks, including brain functional connectivity networks. Sparsification
procedures are often applied to remove the weakest edges, which are the most
affected by experimental noise, and to reduce the density of the graph, thus
making it theoretically and computationally more tractable. However, weak links
may also contain significant structural information, and procedures to identify
the optimal tradeoff are the subject of active research. Here, we explore the
use of percolation analysis, a method grounded in statistical physics, to
identify the optimal sparsification threshold for community detection in brain
connectivity networks. By using synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth
modular structure and realistic topological features typical of human brain
functional connectivity networks, we show that percolation analysis can be
applied to identify the optimal sparsification threshold that maximizes
information on the networks' community structure. We validate this approach
using three different community detection methods widely applied to the
analysis of brain connectivity networks: Newman's modularity, InfoMap and
Asymptotical Surprise. Importantly, we test the effects of noise and data
variability, which are critical factors to determine the optimal threshold.
This data-driven method should prove particularly useful in the analysis of the
community structure of brain networks in populations characterized by different
connectivity strengths, such as patients and controls.

consistently with the characteristics of their surface rotation law. We develop
a model to determine the distribution of the effective temperature and gravity,
which depend on the surface differential rotation law and on the stellar
external geometry. The basic assumptions are: a) the atmosphric layers are in
radiative equilibrium; b) the bolometric flux is anti-parallel with the
effective gravity; c) the angular velocity in the surface is
Omega=Omega(theta,alpha,k)] where (alpha,k) are free parameters. The effective
temperature varies with co-latitude `theta' and on the differential-rotation
law through the effective gravity and the gravity-darkening function (GDF).
Although the derived expressions can be treated numerically, for some low
integer values of k, analytical forms of the `integral ofcharacteristic
curves', on which the determination of the GDF relies, are obtained. The
effects of the quantities (eta,alpha,k) (eta=ratio between centrifugal and
gravitational accelerations at the equator) on the determination of the Vsini
parameter and on the `gravity-darkening exponent' are studied. Depending on the
values of (eta,alpha,k) the velocity V in the derived Vsini may strongly
deviate from the equatorial rotational velocity. It is shown that the von
Zeipel's-like gravity-darkening exponent $\beta_1$ depends on all parameters
$(\eta,\alpha,k)$ and that its value also depends on the viewing-angle i.
Hence, there no unique interpretation of this exponent determined empirically
in terms of (i,alpha). The data on rotating stars should be analyzed by taking
into account the rotational effects through the GDF, by assuming k=2 as a first
approximation. Instead of the classical pair (eta,beta1), it would be more
useful to determine the quantities (eta,alpha,i) to characterize stellar
rotation.

Tikhonov regularization seeks to alleviate this difficulty by replacing the

round-off errors introduced during the computations. This paper discusses the
construction of penalty terms that are determined by solving a matrix-nearness

represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The

lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To
estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we
apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived
as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss.
Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based
on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the cross-dependence
measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which can handle finite non-gyrotropy of a pressure
tensor. Although a fully kinetic simulation predicted a more efficient
angular-momentum transport in collisionless disks than in the standard MHD
regime, the enhanced transport has not been observed in past kinetic MHD
approaches to gyrotropic pressure anisotropy. For the purpose of investigating
this missing link between the fully kinetic and MHD treatments, this paper pays
attention to the role of non-gyrotropic pressure, and makes a first attempt to
incorporate certain collisionless effects into disk-scale, stratified disk
simulations. When the timescale of gyrotropization was longer than, or
comparable to, the disk rotation frequency of the orbit, we found that the
finite non-gyrotropy selectively remaining in the vicinity of current sheets
contributes to suppressing magnetic reconnection in the shearing-box system.
This leads to increases both in the saturated amplitude of the MHD turbulence
driven by magnetorotational instabilities and in the resultant efficiency of
angular-momentum transport. Our results seem favorable for fast advection of
magnetic fields toward the rotation axis of a central object, which is required
to launch an ultra-relativistic jet from a black-hole accretion system in, for
example, a magnetically arrested disk state.

where the thermodynamic advantage of quantum superposition is characterized in
terms of quantum thermodynamics. We investigate thermodynamic effects of
quantum coherent driving in the context of the fluctuation theorem. We adopt a
quantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback
control. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process
plays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum
measurement and post-selection must be considered in the backward process in
sharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with
quantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space
of quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong
irreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute
irreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down.
In the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute
irreversibility because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region
compatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems,
absolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective
measurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically
forbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of
absolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum
coherent driving. Absolute irreversibility is shown to emerge in the absence of
coherent driving after the measurement, especially in systems under
time-delayed feedback control. We show that absolute irreversibility is
mitigated by increasing the duration of quantum coherent driving or decreasing
the delay time of feedback control.

constitutes a nonlinear coupling between the magma and stress fields considered
by this model, which affects the statistical distributions of eruptions
obtained. The extended model retains a power law relation between eruption size
and frequency for most events, as expected from the self organised criticality
inspiring this model; but the power law now applies for a reduced range of
size, and there are new peaks of relatively more frequent eruptions of
intermediate and large size. The cumulative frequency of repose time between
events remains well modelled by a stretched exponential function of repose time
(approaching a pure exponential distribution only for the longest repose
times), but the time scales of this behaviour are slightly longer, reflecting
the increased preference for larger events. The eruptions are relatively more
likely to have high volatile (water) content, so would generally be more
explosive. The new model also naturally favours a central `axial' transport
conduit, as found in many volcano systems, but which otherwise must be
artificially imposed within such models.

entities, called robots, moving in a specified space. The robots are anonymous,
oblivious, and have neither any access to the global coordinate system nor any
explicit communication medium. Each robot observes the positions of other
robots and moves in terms of its local coordinate system. To investigate the
self-organization power of robot systems, formation problems in the two
dimensional space (2D-space) have been extensively studied. Yamauchi et al.
(DISC 2015) introduced robot systems in the three dimensional space (3D-space).
While existing results for 3D-space assume that the robots agree on the
handedness of their local coordinate systems, we remove the assumption and
consider the robots without chirality. One of the most fundamental agreement
problems in 3D-space is the plane formation problem that requires the robots to
land on a common plane, that is not predefined. It has been shown that the
solvability of the plane formation problem by robots with chirality is
determined by the rotation symmetry of their initial local coordinate systems
because the robots cannot break it. We show that when the robots lack
chirality, the combination of rotation symmetry and reflection symmetry
determines the solvability of the plane formation problem because a set of
symmetric local coordinate systems without chirality is obtained by rotations
and reflections. This richer symmetry results in the increase of unsolvable
instances compared with robots with chirality and a flaw of existing plane
formation algorithm. In this paper, we give a characterization of initial
configurations from which the robots without chirality can form a plane and a
new plane formation algorithm for solvable instances.

proposed. Coordinate of an electron (or a positron) in a focusing magnetic
spectrometer built in a circular accelerator depends on its energy, two
spectrometer parameters, and the circulating beam energy. The spectrometer
parameters can be defined using minimum electron energies from Compton
backscattering with two laser wavelengths, and an additional photon coordinate
detector. The photon detector is calibrated at once at well-known beam energy.
The VEPP-4M collider has appropriate equipment for the method implementation:
built-in focusing magnetic spectrometer, Compton calibration system with two
lasers and a photon coordinate detector. Thus, the proposed technique could be
implemented with minimum efforts; tests and further upgrade are planned. The
beam energy can be defined with expected uncertainty better than $10^{-4}$.

usual formulation of Z-invariance, by requiring the introduction of oriented

proteins is an example of such collective behavior. We derive a deterministic
compartmental model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a
one-dimensional lattice of sites with nearest-neighbor interactions between the

exclusion principle and by attracting or repelling forces between neighboring
particles. Using tools from contraction theory, we prove that the model admits
a unique steady-state and that every trajectory converges to this steady-state.
Analysis and simulations of the effect of the attracting and repelling forces
on this steady-state highlight the crucial role that these forces may play in
increasing the steady-state flow, and reveal that this increase stems from the
alleviation of traffic jams along the lattice. Our theoretical analysis

2016) allowed to derive the cluster temperatures by using the relativistic
corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the temperatures
of high-temperature clusters, as derived from this analysis, resulted to be
basically higher than the temperatures derived from X-ray measurements, at a
moderate statistical significance of $1.5\sigma$. This discrepancy has been
attributed by Hurier (2016) to calibration issues. In this paper we discuss an
alternative explanation for this discrepancy in terms of a non-thermal SZE
astrophysical component. We find that this explanation can work if non-thermal
electrons in galaxy clusters have a low value of their minimum momentum
($p_1\sim0.5-1$), and if their pressure is of the order of $20-30\%$ of the
thermal gas pressure. Both these conditions are hard to obtain if the
non-thermal electrons are mixed with the hot gas in the intra cluster medium,
but can be possibly obtained if the non-thermal electrons are mainly confined
in bubbles with high content of non-thermal plasma and low content of thermal
plasma, or in giant radio lobes/relics located in the outskirts of clusters. In
order to derive more precise results on the properties of non-thermal electrons
in clusters, and in view of more solid detections of a discrepancy between
X-rays and SZE derived clusters temperatures that cannot be explained in other
ways, it would be necessary to reproduce the full analysis done by Hurier
(2016) by adding systematically the non-thermal component of the SZE.

specifically to suppression of the intensity of a peak around Q = 1.04

temperature, the water content in both the pores decreases above 450 K and
vanishes around 600 K. Analysis of the powder diffraction data reveals that the
hexagonal structure with the pores persist up to 1273 K, and transforms to
another structure at 1323 K. The high temperature phase is not found to have
the zircon or the monazite type structure, but a monoclinic structure (space

has about 14 % smaller volume than the hexagonal structure which essentially
reflects the collapse of the pores. The phase transition and the change in the
volume are also confirmed by x-ray diffraction measurements. The hexagonal to

Galaxies residing in void shells show infall towards the closest

direction to the superstructure. This effect is produced by void expansion and
therefore is stronger for R-types. We also find that galaxies in void shells

which will combine a Kubo-Greenwood approach with a DFT based tight-binding
linear muffin-tin orbitals (TB-LMTO) basis and augmented space recursion (ASR)

chemical disorder has a large impact on optical response of Ni-Pt systems. In
ordered Ni-Pt alloys, the optical conductivity peaks are sharp. But as we
switch on chemical disorder, the UV peak becomes broadened and its position as
a function of composition and disorder carries the signature of a phase
transition from NiPt to Ni$_3$Pt with decreasing Pt concentration.
Quantitatively this agrees well with Massalski's Ni-Pt phase diagram
\cite{massal}. Both ordered NiPt and Ni$_3$Pt have an optical conductivity
transition at 4.12 eV. But disordered NiPt has an optical conductivity
transition at 3.93 eV. If we decrease the Pt content, it results a chemical
phase transition from NiPt to Ni$_3$Pt and shifts the peak position by 1.67 eV
to the ultraviolet range at 5.6 eV. There is a significant broadening of UV
peak with increasing Pt content due to enhancement of 3d(Ni)-5d(Pt) bonding.
Chemical disorder enhances the optical response of NiPt alloys nearly one order
of magnitude. Our study also shows the fragile magnetic effect on optical
response of disordered Ni$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$ (0.4$<$ x $<$0.6) binary alloys. Our
theoretical predictions agree more than reasonably well with both earlier

junctions (JJ) with singlet and triplet Josephson coupling. In singlet
Josephson weak links, two singlet superconductors S are connected with each
other by a normal film (N) or wire. Triplet JJs, which we denote
S$_{\text{m}}$/N(F)/S$_{\text{m}}$, are formed by two singlet BCS
superconductors covered by a thin layer of a weak ferromagnet F$_{\text{w}}$.
These superconductors S$_{\text{m}}$ are separated from the N (or F) layer by
spin filters, which pass electrons with only one spin orientation. The triplet
Cooper pairs propagating from the left (right) superconductors S$_{\text{m}}$
differ from each other not only by polarizations, but also by chiralities. The
latter is determined by the magnetization orientation in weak ferromagnets
F$_{\text{w}}$. We obtain analytical formulas for the critical Josephson
current in both types of the JJs. If chiralities of the triplet Cooper pairs
penetrating into the N film in S$_{\text{m}}$/N(F)/S$_{\text{m}}$ JJs from the
left and right S$_{\text{m}}$ are different, the Josephson current is not zero
in the absence of the phase difference (spontaneous Josephson current). We also
calculate the admittance $Y(\Omega)$ for arbitrary frequencies $\Omega$ in the
case of singlet JJs and for low frequencies in the case of triplet JJs. At low
temperatures $T$, the real part of the admittance $Y^{\prime}(\Omega)$ in
singlet JJs starts to increase from zero at ${\hbar \Omega \geq
\Delta_{\text{sg}}}$, but at ${T \geq \Delta_{\text{sg}}}$, it has a peak at
low frequencies the magnitude of which is determined by inelastic processes.
The subgap $\Delta_{\text{sg}}$ depends on transparencies of the S/N interfaces
and on the phase difference $2 \chi_{0}$. The low-frequency peak in
$Y^{\prime}(\Omega)$ in triplet JJs disappears.

allows for debugging answer-set programs and is based on the stepwise
application of rules. Similar to debugging in imperative languages, where the
behaviour of a program is observed during a step-by-step execution, stepping
for ASP allows for observing the effects that rule applications have in the
computation of an answer set. While the approach is inspired from debugging in
imperative programming, it is conceptually different to stepping in other
paradigms due to non-determinism and declarativity that are inherent to ASP. In
particular, unlike statements in an imperative program that are executed
following a strict control flow, there is no predetermined order in which to
consider rules in ASP during a computation. In our approach, the user is free
to decide which rule to consider active in the next step following his or her
intuition. This way, one can focus on interesting parts of the debugging search
space. Bugs are detected during stepping by revealing differences between the
actual semantics of the program and the expectations of the user. As a solid
formal basis for stepping, we develop a framework of computations for
answer-set programs. For fully supporting different solver languages, we build
our framework on an abstract ASP language that is sufficiently general to
capture different solver languages. To this end, we make use of abstract
constraints as an established abstraction for popular language constructs such
as aggregates. Stepping has been implemented in SeaLion, an integrated
development environment for ASP. We illustrate stepping using an example
scenario and discuss the stepping plugin of SeaLion. Moreover, we elaborate on
methodological aspects and the embedding of stepping in the ASP development

equations with additive spatial white noise on bounded domains in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is considered. The differential operator is given by the
fractional power $L^\beta$, $\beta\in(0,1)$, of an integer order elliptic
differential operator $L$ and is therefore non-local. Its inverse $L^{-\beta}$
is represented by a Bochner integral from the Dunford-Taylor functional
calculus. By applying a quadrature formula to this integral representation, the
inverse fractional power operator $L^{-\beta}$ is approximated by a weighted
sum of non-fractional resolvents $(I + t_j^2 L)^{-1}$ at certain quadrature
nodes $t_j>0$. The resolvents are then discretized in space by a standard
finite element method.
  This approach is combined with an approximation of the white noise, which is
based only on the mass matrix of the finite element discretization. In this
way, an efficient numerical algorithm for computing samples of the approximate
solution is obtained. For the resulting approximation, the strong mean-square
error is analyzed and an explicit rate of convergence is derived. Numerical
experiments for $L=\kappa^2-\Delta$, $\kappa > 0$, with homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the unit cube $(0,1)^d$ in $d=1,2,3$ spatial dimensions
for varying $\beta\in(0,1)$ attest the theoretical results.

of the art in texture synthesis. First, we can learn multiple textures from
datasets of one or more complex large images. Second, we show that the image
generation with PSGANs has properties of a texture manifold: we can smoothly
interpolate between samples in the structured noise space and generate novel
samples, which lie perceptually between the textures of the original dataset.
In addition, we can also accurately learn periodical textures. We make multiple
experiments which show that PSGANs can flexibly handle diverse texture and

Instead, the change in the torsion is related to the introduction of a global

perturbative regime to the tunneling ionization regime. We have applied this
new method, called resolvent operator method (ROM), to a 1+1D model of the

regimes and we have compared with previous results in the literature. We show

in DNA repair and structure in the regulation and function of telomere size
homeostasis. In this study, we characterize yeast telomere chromatin structure,
phenotypic heritability, and chromatin segregation in both wild-type [MRE11]

subtelomeric DNA is embedded in a telosome: an MNase-resistant non-nucleosomal

Telosomes containing the Mre11A470T protein confer a greater resistance to
MNase digestion than wild-type telosomes. The integration of a wild-type MRE11
allele into an ectopic locus in the genome of a mre11A470T mutant and the
introduction of a mre11A470T allele at an ectopic site in a wild-type strain
lead to unexpectedly differing results. In each case, the replicated sister
chromatids inherit telosomes containing only the protein encoded by the genomic
mre11 locus, even in the presence of protein encoded by the opposing ectopic
allele. We hypothesize that the telosome segregates by a conservative
mechanism. These data support a mechanism for the linkage between sister
chromatid replication and maintenance of either identical mutant or identical

This paper addresses the question: when does the skew polynomial ring $S =

$S$-module $V$ the injective hull $E_S(V)$ of $V$ has all its finitely
generated submodules Artinian. The question is largely reduced to the special
case where $S$ is primitive, for which necessary and sufficient conditions are
found, which however do not between them cover all possibilities. Nevertheless
a complete characterisation is found when $R$ is an affine algebra over a field

holds if and only if all simple $S$-modules are finite dimensional over $k$.
This leads to a discussion, involving close study of some families of examples,
of when this latter condition holds for affine $k$-algebras $S =

  In this article I proceed in presenting the scenario which discloses a
possible hidden connection between massive neutron stars (MANSs), dark matter
and dark energy in cosmology. Accordingly, when the curved spacetime embedding
MANSs compresses the nuclear matter to beyond a critical supranuclear density
$n_{cr},$ mesons, generally transmitting the residual nuclear forces between
neutrons, could gain energy by frequently interacting with a scalar field
$\phi$ at the background. When the effective energy of mesons becomes
comparable to the bag energy enclosing the quarks, the neutrons merge together
and form a super-baryon (SB), whose interior is made of incompressible
gluon-quark superfluid. It turns out that the process has a runaway-character:
it enables the super-baryon to grow in mass and volume from inside-to-outside
to finally metamorphose the entire object into a completely invisible dark
gluon-quark object, practically indistinguishable from isolated stellar black
holes. The inability of these objects to merge with other objects whilst
agglomerating in clusters makes them excellent candidates both for black holes
and for dark matter halos in cosmology.

CH3CN, CH2NH, HNCO, H13-2CO, and HC3N (in decreasing order of abundance). For
each species, the large number of detected lines allowed us to accurately
constrain their rotational temperatures (Trot) and column densities (N). Owing
to subthermal excitation and intricate spectroscopy of some COMs (symmetric-
and asymmetric-top molecules such as CH3CN and H2CO, respectively), a correct
determination of N and Trot requires building rotational population diagrams of
their rotational ladders separately. We also provide accurate upper limit
abundances for chemically related molecules that might have been expected, but
are not conclusively detected at the edge of the PDR (HDCO, CH3O, CH3NC,
CH3CCH, CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2CN, and CH2CHCN). A non-LTE LVG
excitation analysis for molecules with known collisional rate coefficients,
suggests that some COMs arise from different PDR layers but we cannot resolve
them spatially. In particular, H2CO and CH3CN survive in the extended gas
directly exposed to the strong FUV flux (Tk = 150-250 K and Td > 60 K), whereas
CH3OH only arises from denser and cooler gas clumps in the more shielded PDR

extending the applicability of SC methods to complex systems while retaining
their ability to accurately describe quantum coherence effects. Here, we
address questions regarding the effectiveness of the MFF scheme in combination
with SC dynamics. Previous work showed that this filtering scheme is of limited
utility in the context of semiclassical wavepacket propagation, but we find the
MFF is extraordinarily powerful in the context of correlation functions. By
examining trajectory phase and amplitude contributions to the real-time SC
correlation function in a model system, we clearly demonstrate that the MFF
serves to reduce noise by damping amplitude only in regions of highly
oscillatory phase leading to a reduction in computational effort while
retaining accuracy. Further, we introduce a novel and efficient MQC-IVR
formulation that allows for linear scaling in computational cost with the total
simulation length, a significant improvement over the more-than quadratic
scaling exhibited by the original method.

z_l$, (P2) $\gamma(z_l)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 z_l/(1+z_l)$ and (P3)
$\gamma(z_l)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 \ln(1+z_l)$, where $z_l$ corresponds to lens

is recovered. Our method is performed on SGL sub-samples defined by different
lens redshifts and velocity dispersions. For the former case, the results are
in full agreement with each other, while a 1$\sigma$ tension between the
sub-samples with low ($\leq 250$ km/s) and high ($>250$ km/s) velocity
dispersions was obtained on the ($\gamma_0$-$\gamma_1$) plane. By considering
the complete SGL sample, we obtain $\gamma_0 \approx 2$ and $ \gamma_1 \approx

the following best fit values of $\gamma_1$: $-0.085$, $-0.16$ and $-0.12$ for

of fundamentally novel physical phenomena, making steady headway in the
development of magnetic and spintronics devices. The dynamics can be induced
and detected electrically, offering new functionalities in advanced electronics
at the nanoscale. However, its scattering mechanism is still disputed.
Understanding the mechanism in thin films is especially important, because most
spintronics devices are made from stacks of multilayers with nanometer
thickness. The stacks are known to possess interfacial magnetic anisotropy, a
central property for applications, whose influence on the dynamics remains
unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of interfacial anisotropy by adopting
CoFeB/MgO as a model system. Through systematic and complementary measurements
of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), on a series of thin films, we identify
narrower FMR linewidths at higher temperatures. We explicitly rule out the
temperature dependence of intrinsic damping as a possible cause, and it is also
not expected from existing extrinsic scattering mechanisms for ferromagnets. We

outperform Niedermayer's algorithm for low enough temperatures and high enough

domain-wall with a low-temperature expansion presented in this paper and show
agreement with results from our simulations. The effects of temperature,

the strength of an external magnetic field. We show that, at zero surface

survive at low electron surface dopings ($\sim 10^{10} cm^{-2} $). Then, we
point out that the plasmon excitations are sensitive to the Berry phase gap
closure when an external magnetic field close to half quantum flux is
introduced. Indeed, a well-defined magneto-plasmon peak is observed at lower
energies upon the application of the magnetic field. Finally, the increase of
the surface doping induces a crossover from damped inter-band to sharp
intra-band magneto-plasmons which, as expected for large radii and dopings

state, in particular the position of the disc inner edge, has been a subject of

study of simultaneous observations of Cyg X-1 in the hard state by NuSTAR and
Suzaku. The same data were analysed before, and modelled by a lamppost
containing hybrid electrons and located very close to the horizon, which
emission was incident on a surrounding disc extending almost to the innermost
stable circular orbit. We re-analyse the incident continuum model and show that
it suffers from the lack of physical self-consistency. Still, the good fit to
the data provided by this model indicates that the real continuum has a similar
shape. We find it features a strong soft X-ray excess below a few keV, which we
model as a soft thermal-Comptonization component, in addition to the main hard
thermal-Compton component. This continuum model with reflection of both
components yields the overall lowest $\chi^2$ and has a geometry with a hot
inner accretion flow and a disc truncated at $\simeq$13--20 gravitational
radii. On the other hand, we have also found spectral solution with a lamppost
at a large height and a disc that can extend to the innnermost stable circular
orbit, though somewhat statistically worse. Overall, we find the fitted
truncation radius depends on the assumed continuum and geometry.

high-dimensional multipartite quantum states and Graph Theory. In these setups,
the paths of photons are identified such that the photon-source information is
never created. We find that each of these setups corresponds to an undirected
graph, and every undirected graph corresponds to an experimental setup. Every
term in the emerging quantum superposition corresponds to a perfect matching in
the graph. Calculating the final quantum state is in the complexity class
#P-complete, thus cannot be done efficiently. To strengthen the link further,
theorems from Graph Theory -- such as Hall's marriage problem -- are rephrased
in the language of pair creation in quantum experiments. We show explicitly how
this link allows to answer questions about quantum experiments (such as which
classes of entangled states can be created) with graph theoretical methods, and
potentially simulate properties of Graphs and Networks with quantum experiments
(such as critical exponents and phase transitions).

different diameters, VLi will gradually rise with the increase of CNT diameter
due to lithium irons migration resistance decreasing; as the port of CNT is
successively modified to hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2) and
carboxyl (-COOH), the corresponding migration resistance of lithium ions is
enhanced resulting in the dropping of VLi; in comparison to the effect strength
of four types of functional groups on VLi, -COOH shows strongest, -NH2 and -OH
perform relatively weaker, and the effect difference between -NH2 and -OH is
very small, -H displays weakest; When the number of a given non-hydrogen

lithium ion migration resistance gradually increases which makes VLi decreases
in turn. The more influential the functional group, the greater the impact of
functional group number changes on VLi. The results of this paper have some

accordance with this criterion, only QSOs with redshifts between 0.3 and 1.2

than the typical QSOs do. We noted that the number ratios of the red QSOs to
the typical QSOs decrease with increasing redshifts, although the number of the
typical QSOs increase with redshifts. Furthermore, at high redshifts, the
luminosity distributions of the typical QSOs and the red QSOs seem to have
similar luminosity distribution peaks; however, at low redshifts, the
luminosities of the red QSOs seem to be lower than those of the typical QSOs.
These findings suggest that there might be at least two types of red QSOs in

bottlenecks in the non-orthogonally spin-adapted forms of the quantum chemistry
methods CCSDT and CCSDTQ, and their approximate forms---including CCSD(T) and
CCSDT(Q)---are spin summations. At a first sight, spin summations are
operations similar to tensor transpositions; a closer look instead reveals
additional challenges to high-performance calculations, including temporal
locality as well as scattered memory accesses. This publication explores a
sequence of algorithmic solutions for spin summations, each exploiting
individual properties of either the underlying hardware (e.g. caches,
vectorization), or the problem itself (e.g. factorizability). The final
algorithm combines the advantages of all the solutions, while avoiding their
drawbacks; this algorithm, achieves high-performance through parallelization,
vectorization, and by exploiting the temporal locality inherent to spin
summations. Combined, these optimizations result in speedups between 2.4x and
5.5x over the NCC quantum chemistry software package. In addition to such a
performance boost, our algorithm can perform the spin summations in-place, thus
reducing the memory footprint by 2x over an out-of-place variant.

  to space reasons)",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most attractive features of untyped languages is the flexibility
in term creation and manipulation. However, with such power comes the
responsibility of ensuring the correctness of these operations. A solution is
adding run-time checks to the program via assertions, but this can introduce
overheads that are in many cases impractical. While static analysis can greatly
reduce such overheads, the gains depend strongly on the quality of the
information inferred. Reusable libraries, i.e., library modules that are
pre-compiled independently of the client, pose special challenges in this
context. We propose a technique which takes advantage of module systems which
can hide a selected set of functor symbols to significantly enrich the shape
information that can be inferred for reusable libraries, as well as an improved
run-time checking approach that leverages the proposed mechanisms to achieve
large reductions in overhead, closer to those of static languages, even in the
reusable-library context. While the approach is general and system-independent,
we present it for concreteness in the context of the Ciao assertion language
and combined static/dynamic checking framework. Our method maintains the full
expressiveness of the assertion language in this context. In contrast to other
approaches it does not introduce the need to switch the language to a (static)
type system, which is known to change the semantics in languages like Prolog.

utilized in the next generation (5G) mobile networks to support sustainable

inherently random and intermittent, which could lead to energy outage, energy
overflow, quality of service (QoS) degradation, etc. Accordingly, how to
enhance renewable energy sustainability is a critical issue for green
networking. To this end, an energy-sustainable traffic steering framework is
proposed in this article, where the traffic load is dynamically adjusted to
match with energy distributions in both spatial and temporal domains by means
of inter- and intra-tier steering, caching and pushing. Case studies are
carried out, which demonstrate the proposed framework can reduce on-grid energy
demand while satisfying QoS requirements. Research topics and challenges of
energy-sustainable traffic steering are also discussed.

Traditional NR calculation generates 2 event pairs if 2 events happened within

calculation is time consuming and how these pairs are organized are not yet
explored. In this paper, we designed a new approach to calculate clusters of NR
events efficiently. To begin with, R-tree is utilized to index crime events, a
single event is represented by a vertex whereas edges are constructed by range
querying the vertex in R-tree, and a graph is formed. Cohesive subgraph
approaches are applied to identify the event chains. k-clique, k-truss, k-core
plus DBSCAN algorithms are implemented in sequence with respect to their varied
range of ability to find cohesive subgraphs. Real world crime data in Chicago,
New York and Washington DC are utilized to conduct experiments. The experiment
confirmed that near repeat is a solid effect in real big crime data by
conducting Mapreduce empowered knox tests. The performance of 4 different
algorithms are validated, while the quality of the algorithms are gauged by the
distribution of number of cohesive subgraphs and their clustering coefficients.
The proposed framework is the first to process the real crime data of million

graphene p-n junctions (GPNJs). Klein tunneling creates a collimation of
electrons across each GPNJ, so that the lack of substantial overlap between
transmission lobes across successive junctions creates a gate-tunable transport
gap without significantly compromising the on-current. Electron scattering at
the device edge tends to bleed parasitic states into the gap, but the resulting
pseudogap is still sufficient to create a saturated output ($I_D-V_D$)
characteristic and a high output resistance. The modulated density of states
generates a higher transconductance ($g_m$) and unity current gain cut-off

makes the unity power gain cut-off frequency ($f_{max}$) of GKTFETs
considerably larger than GFETs, making analog GKTFET potentially useful for RF

environment. We show that arbitrary coupling between sensory signals and the
internal state of a system -- or those between its action and external
(environmental) states -- do not guarantee synchronous dynamics between
external and internal states: the spatial structure and the temporal dynamics
of sensory signals and action (that comprise the system's Markov blanket) have
to be pruned to produce synchrony. This synchrony is necessary for an agent to
infer environmental states -- a pre-requisite for survival. Therefore, such
sentient dynamics, relies primarily on approximate synchronization between the
agent and its niche.

  overlap with arXiv:1704.08657",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform has a huge number of
applications in image-processing techniques. Until now, several papers compared
the performance of such transform on graphics processing units (GPUs). However,
all of them only dealt with lifting and convolution computation schemes. In
this paper, we show that corresponding horizontal and vertical lifting parts of
the lifting scheme can be merged into non-separable lifting units, which halves
the number of steps. We also discuss an optimization strategy leading to a
reduction in the number of arithmetic operations. The schemes were assessed
using the OpenCL and pixel shaders. The proposed non-separable lifting scheme
outperforms the existing schemes in many cases, irrespective of its higher
complexity.

form of an elastic plate augmented by an array of resonators forming a
metasurface, that is, a surface structured with sub-wavelength resonators. Such
surfaces have had considerable recent success for the control of wave
propagation in electromagnetism and acoustics, by combining the vision of
sub-wavelength wave manipulation, with the design, fabrication and size
advantages associated with surface excitation. We explore one aspect of recent
interest in this field: graded metasurfaces, but within the context of
fluid-loaded structures.
  Graded metasurfaces allow for selective spatial frequency separation and are
often referred to as exhibiting rainbow trapping. Experiments, and theory, have
been developed for acoustic, electromagnetic, and even elastic, rainbow devices
but this has not been approached for fluid-loaded structures that support
surface waves coupled with the acoustic field in a bulk fluid. This surface
wave, coupled with the fluid, can be used to create an additional effect by
designing a metasurface to mode convert from surface to bulk waves. We
demonstrate that sub-wavelength control is possible and that one can create
both rainbow trapping and mode conversion phenomena for a fluid-loaded elastic
plate model.

computation. I first establish interpretations of Piaget's and Vygotsky's
theories of child development with the language of theoretical computer
science. Using these interpretations, I argue that the two different possible
routes to Piagetian disequilibrium -- a tendency to overaccommodate, and a
tendency to overassimilate -- are equivalent to the two distinct cultural
tendencies, collectivistism and individualism. I argue that this simple
characterization of overaccommodation versus overassimilation provides a
satisfying explanation as to why the two cultural tendencies differ in the way
they empirically do. All such notions are grounded on a firm mathematical
framework for those who prefer the computable, and grounded on my personal

entities which have internal spin-like terms. Their motion in an external
Schwarzschild metric is discussed. The internal spin motion contributes to the
centrifugal force along with the usual orbital angular momentum term and can
severely limit the distance of closest approach to the attractor. An
energy-momentum tensor associated with an aggregate of them is shown to have
primarily pressure-like components. A model of the spiral galaxy halos is
developed which can match the observed `flat' rotation curves of some galaxies.
The halo dark matter `missing mass' results from the pressure term's
contribution to the metric tensor. A possible rationale for the presence of the
cosmological constant is discussed. An addendum to the standard cosmology
picture allows an estimate of the amount of dark matter; this is in reasonable
agreement with that observed. It is possible that the adopted representation of
the internal spin motion could be replaced by a boson string Lagrangian.

local interactions and describes surface-like waves of Investment and Profits.
We regard macro-finance as ensemble of economic agents and use their risk
ratings as coordinates on economic space. Aggregations of agent's financial
variables with risk coordinates x on economic space define macro financial
variables as function of x. We describe evolution and interactions between
macro financial variables alike to financial fluids by hydrodynamic-like
equations. Minimum and maximum risk grades define most secure and most risky
agents respectively. That determines borders of macro-finance domain that is
filled by economic agents. Perturbations of agent's risk coordinates near risk
borders of macro domain cause disturbances of macro financial variables like
Investment and Profits. Such disturbances can generate waves that propagate
along risk borders. These waves may exponentially amplify perturbations inside
of macro domain and impact financial sustainability. We study simple model
Investment and Profits and describe linear approximation of steady state
distributions of Investment and Profits on macro-finance domain that fulfill
dreams of Investors: ""more risks-more Profits"". We describe Investment and
Profits waves on risk border of economic space alike to surface waves in
fluids. We present simple examples that specify waves as possible origin of
time fluctuations of macro financial variables. Description of possible steady
state distributions of macro financial variables and financial risk waves on
economic space could help for better policy-making and managing sustainable
macro-finance.

overcome if self-producing chemical organizations are to transition from
non-life to life. This barrier prevents un-managed, self-organizing,
autocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex,
cooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that
could otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an
organization will often not be supported within the organization, and because
side reactions and other free-riding processes will undermine cooperation. As a
result, the barrier seriously limits the possibility space that can be explored
by un-managed organizations, impeding individuation, complex functionality and
the transition to life. The barrier can be overcome comprehensively by
appropriate management which implements a system of evolvable constraints. The
constraints support beneficial co-operators and suppress free riders. In this
way management can manipulate the chemical processes of an autocatalytic
organization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the
organization as a whole and that could not arise and persist spontaneously in
an un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is
able to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its management of
an autocatalytic organization promotes beneficial cooperation. Selection
therefore favours the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical
organizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism
hypothesis shows that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier
comprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the
hypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a
digitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.

information from multiple (heterogeneous) sources. In many cases, the
information that needs to be fused has security classification. The result of
the fusion process is then by necessity restricted with the strictest
information security classification of the inputs. This has severe drawbacks
and limits the possible dissemination of the fusion results. It leads to
decreased situational awareness: the organization knows information that would
enable a better situation picture, but since parts of the information is
restricted, it is not possible to distribute the most correct situational
information. In this paper, we take steps towards defining fusion and data
mining processes that can be used even when all the underlying data that was
used cannot be disseminated. The method we propose here could be used to
produce a classifier where all the sensitive information has been removed and
where it can be shown that an antagonist cannot even in principle obtain
knowledge about the classified information by using the classifier or situation
