  Developers: A Computational Thinking Approach","Tutorial, 43 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing software systems for Geometric Computing applications can be a
challenging task. Software engineers typically use software abstractions to
hide and manage the high complexity of such systems. Without the presence of a
unifying algebraic system to describe geometric models, the use of software
abstractions alone can result in many design and maintenance problems.
Geometric Algebra (GA) can be a universal abstract algebraic language for
software engineering geometric computing applications. Few sources, however,
provide enough information about GA-based software implementations targeting
the software engineering community. In particular, successfully introducing GA
to software engineers requires quite different approaches from introducing GA
to mathematicians or physicists. This article provides a high-level
introduction to the abstract concepts and algebraic representations behind the
elegant GA mathematical structure. The article focuses on the conceptual and
representational abstraction levels behind GA mathematics with sufficient
references for more details. In addition, the article strongly recommends
applying the methods of Computational Thinking in both introducing GA to
software engineers, and in using GA as a mathematical language for developing
Geometric Computing software systems.

nuclear K-band properties of nearby AGN. We find that the luminosities of the
unresolved Seyfert 1 sources at 2.1 microns are correlated with the hard X-ray
luminosities, implying that the majority of the emission is non-stellar. The
best-fit correlation is logLK = 0.9logL2-10 keV + 4 over 3 orders of magnitude

presence of nuclear star formation and attenuating material (gas and dust),
which in some cases is compact and in some galaxies extended. We detect
coronal-line emission in 36 galaxies and for the first time in five galaxies.

broad emission lines in the near-IR, and one galaxy (NGC 7465) shows evidence

However, most existing VB algorithms are restricted to cases where the

where the likelihood is intractable but can be estimated unbiasedly, and name
the method Variational Bayes with Intractable Likelihood (VBIL). This paper
presents a version of VBIL, named Variational Bayes with Intractable
Log-Likelihood (VBILL), that is useful for cases as Big Data and Big Panel Data
models, where unbiased estimators of the gradient of the log-likelihood are
available. We demonstrate that such estimators can be easily obtained in many

from an extra Monte Carlo error which can be controlled, it is able to produce
estimators as if the true likelihood, or full-data likelihood, is used. In
particular, we develop a computationally efficient approach, based on data
subsampling and the MapReduce programming technique, for analyzing massive

predict sharp dispersive branches at higher energy, a striking discrepancy with

is attributable to enhanced quantum fluctuations due to phase competition
between the $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_5$ states that border each other within a
classically predicted phase diagram.

LZ77 code compression. The pre-LZ77 gains are achieved by trimming stop codes.
The post-LZ77 gains are due to the highly unequal distributions of 0/1 codes
from the SCT architectures. With these code compressions, the SCT architecture
maintains or exceeds the image quality at all compression rates compared to
JPEG and to RNN auto-encoders across the Kodak dataset. In addition, the SCT
coding results in lower variance in image quality across the extent of the

the existing CLUMPFIND method, which is based on an ordered search over all
particles in gravitational potential energy. Using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics, we carry out 9 simulations of a $0.25$ M$_{\odot}$ disc around a
1 M$_{\odot}$ star, all of which fragment to form at least 2 bound objects. We
find that when using all particles ordered in gravitational potential space,
only fragments that survive the duration of the simulation are detected. When
we use the density derivative method, all fragments are detected, so the two
methods are complementary, as using the two methods together allows us to
identify all fragments, and to then determine those that are likely to be
destroyed. We find a tentative empirical relationship between the dominant
azimuthal wavenumber in the disc $m$ and the maximum semi-major axis a fragment
may achieve in a simulation, such that $a_{\mathrm{max}}\propto\frac{1}{m}$. We
find the fragment destruction rate to be around half that predicted from
population synthesis models. This is due to fragment-fragment interactions in
the early gas phase of the disc, which can cause scattering and eccentricity
pumping on short timescales, and affects the fragment's internal structure. We
therefore caution that measurements of eccentricity as a function of semi-major
axis may not necessarily constrain the formation mechanism of giant planets and
brown dwarfs.

order to trigger the potential run-time malicious behaviours. Most existing
dynamic analysis systems employ random-based input generation methods usually
built using the Android Monkey tool. Random-based input generation has several
shortcomings including limited code coverage, which motivates us to explore
combining it with a state-based method in order to improve efficiency. Hence,
in this paper, we present a novel hybrid test input generation approach
designed to improve dynamic analysis on real devices. We implemented the hybrid
system by integrating a random based tool (Monkey) with a state based tool
(DroidBot) in order to improve code coverage and potentially uncover more

the first method of choice in most works on the subject. However, such a
technique finds strong practical and conceptual complications when one tries to
apply it to situations in which the classical long-time solution is time

Here we introduce a linearization scheme adapted to such situations, using the
driven Van der Pol oscillator as a testbed for the method, which allows us to
compare it with full numerical simulations. On a conceptual level, the scheme
relies on the connection between the emergence of limit cycles and the
spontaneous breaking of the symmetry under temporal translations. On the
practical side, the method keeps the simplicity and linear scaling with the
size of the problem (number of modes) characteristic of standard linearization,
making it applicable to large (many-body) systems.

(MS). For these systems there are observational estimates regarding the rate of
change of the orbital period. We also investigate Kepler-91 which contains an
evolved giant star. We adopt the formalism of Ivanov et al. for calculating the
orbital evolution.
  For the MS stars we determine expected rates of orbital evolution under
different assumptions about the amount of dissipation acting on the tides,
estimate the effect of stellar rotation for the two most rapidly rotating stars
and compare results with observations. All cases apart from possibly WASP-43
are consistent with a regime in which gravity waves are damped during their
propagation over the star. However, at present this is not definitive as
observational errors are large. We find that although it is expected to apply
to Kepler-91, linear radiative damping cannot explain this dis- sipation regime
applying to MS stars. Thus, a nonlinear mechanism may be needed.
  Kepler-91 is found to be such that the time scale for evolution of the star
is comparable to that for the orbit. This implies that significant orbital
circularisation may have occurred through tides acting on the star.
Quasi-static tides, stellar winds, hydrodynamic drag and tides acting on the
planet have likely played a minor role.

heat and salt content of a two-box ocean. Variability in the heat and salt
content and in the thermohaline circulation between the boxes is driven by fast
Gaussian atmospheric forcing and by ocean-intrinsic, eddy-driven variability.
The eddy forcing of the slow dynamics takes the form of a colored, non-Gaussian
noise. The qualitative effects of this non-Gaussianity are investigated by
comparing to two approximate models: one that includes only the mean eddy
effects (the `averaged model'), and one that includes an additional Gaussian
white-noise approximation of the eddy effects (the `Gaussian model'). Both of
these approximate models are derived using the methods of fast averaging and
homogenization.
  In the parameter regime where the dynamics has a single stable equilibrium
the averaged model has too little variability. The Gaussian model has accurate
second-order statistics, but incorrect skew and rare-event probabilities. In

we estimated four parameters, the generalized fractal dimensions $D_0$ and

$D_{\mathrm{div}}$. We found distinct average values of the parameters measured
on ARs that have hosted flares of different class. However, the dispersion of
values measured on ARs that have produced same class events is such that the
parameters deduced from distinct classes of flaring regions can also largely
overlap. Based on the results of our measurements, C- and M-class flaring ARs
are practically indistinguishable, as well as M- and X-class flaring ARs. We
found consistent changes on the time series of the measured parameters only on

are studied in the long wavelength limit using a well-known continuum model.
Several main results are obtained by parameterizing the solitary waves in terms
of their wave speed and their asymptotic amplitude. First, the asymptotic
amplitude is shown to be directly related to the continuum sound speed, and the
ratio of asymptotic amplitude to peak amplitude is shown to describe the degree
of dynamical nonlinearity in the underlying discrete system. Second, an
algebraic relation is derived that determines the dynamical nonlinearity ratio
in terms of the ratio of the solitary wave speed to the sound speed. In
particular, highly supersonic solitary waves correspond to highly nonlinear
propagating pulses in weakly compressed systems, and slightly supersonic
solitary waves correspond to weakly nonlinear propagating pulses in strongly
compressed systems. Third, explicit formulas for the physical height, width,
impulse and energy of the solitary waves are obtained in both the strongly
nonlinear regime and the weakly nonlinear regime. Asymptotic expansions are
used to show that in the strongly nonlinear regime, solitary waves are
well-approximated by Nesterenko's compacton (having the same wave speed), while
in the weakly nonlinear regime, solitary waves coincide with solitons of the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, with the same wave speed. All of these
results are illustrated by means of exact solitary wave solutions, including
the physically important case that models a chain of spherical particles.

dispute on the precise value of $H_0$, which is the first ever parameter of

and on after over half a century of measurements. Recently the dispute came to
the spotlight with renewed strength owing to the significant tension (at
$>3\sigma$ c.l.) between the latest Planck determination obtained from the CMB
anisotropies and the local (distance ladder) measurement from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), based on Cepheids. In this work, we investigate the impact of
the running vacuum model (RVM) and related models on such a controversy. For
the RVM, the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\Lambda}$ carries a mild dependence
on the cosmic expansion rate, i.e. $\rho_{\Lambda}(H)$, which allows to
ameliorate the fit quality to the overall $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ cosmological
observations as compared to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. By letting the
RVM to deviate from the vacuum option, the equation of state $w=-1$ continues
to be favored by the overall fit. Vacuum dynamics also predicts the following:
i) the CMB range of values for $H_0$ is more favored than the local ones, and
ii) smaller values for $\sigma_8(0)$. As a result, a better account for the LSS
structure formation data is achieved as compared to the $\Lambda$CDM, which is
based on a rigid (i.e. non-dynamical) $\Lambda$ term.

Cancellation of the anomaly by heavy fermions results, in the low-energy

heavy sector preserves the SM gauge groups, and lead to (energy / vector

certain anomalous non-on-site $G$ symmetry along the boundary becomes on-site

K\to H\to G\to1$. Namely, a non-perturbative global (gauge/gravitational)
anomaly in $G$ becomes anomaly-free in $H$. This guides us to construct exactly
soluble lattice path integral and Hamiltonian of symmetric gapped boundaries,
always existent for any SPT state in any spacetime dimension $d \geq 2$ of any
finite symmetry group, including on-site unitary and anti-unitary time-reversal
symmetries. The resulting symmetric gapped boundary can be described either by
an $H$-symmetry extended boundary of bulk $d \geq 2$, or more naturally by a
topological emergent $K$-gauge theory with a global symmetry $G$ on a 3+1D bulk
or above. The excitations on such a symmetric topologically ordered boundary
can carry fractional quantum numbers of the symmetry $G$, described by
representations of $H$. (Apply our approach to a 1+1D boundary of 2+1D bulk, we
find that a deconfined gauge boundary indeed has spontaneous symmetry breaking
with long-range order. The deconfined symmetry-breaking phase crosses over
smoothly to a confined phase without a phase transition.) In contrast to known
gapped interfaces obtained via symmetry breaking (either global symmetry
breaking or Anderson-Higgs mechanism for gauge theory), our approach is based
on symmetry extension. More generally, applying our approach to SPT,
topologically ordered gauge theories and symmetry enriched topologically
ordered (SET) states, leads to generic boundaries/interfaces constructed with a
mixture of symmetry breaking, symmetry extension, and dynamical gauging.

branes required for the consistency of the theory, but, in many cases, the
exact spectrum of particle physics occurs at low energy. However, such theories
have the additional constraint that they must be $N=1$ supersymmetric. This
motivates us to compute the worldvolume actions of $N=1$ supersymmetric

define a Milky Way analog based on $K$-band luminosity and local environment.
Here, we present satellite luminosity functions for 8 Milky Way analog galaxies

of candidate satellites within the projected host virial radius down to $ r_o <

around our complete host systems, plus 11 additional satellites in either
incompletely surveyed hosts or below our formal magnitude limit. Combined with
13 previously known satellites, there are a total of 27 satellites around 8
complete Milky Way analog hosts. We find a wide distribution in the number of
satellites per host, from 1 to 9, in the luminosity range for which there are
five Milky Way satellites. Standard abundance matching extrapolated from higher
luminosities predicts less scatter between hosts and a steeper luminosity
function slope than observed. We find that the majority of satellites (26 of
27) are star-forming. These early results indicate that the Milky Way has a
different satellite population than typical in our sample, potentially changing
the physical interpretation of measurements based only on the Milky Way's

hotter and significantly less luminous than the S16 mean intrinsic AGN SED. The
differences are mostly due to our normalization of the individual SEDs, that
properly accounts for a small number of very FIR-luminous quasars. Our median,
PAH-based SED represents ~ 6% increase on the 1-243 micron luminosity of the

optically thin and heated by the AGN, would be outside the host galaxy. (II) We
also explore the black hole and stellar mass growths, using L_SF estimates from
fitting Herschel/PACS observations after subtracting the EM12 torus
contribution. We use rough estimates of stellar mass, based on scaling
relations, to divide our sample into groups: on, below and above the star
formation main sequence (SFMS). Objects on the SFMS show a strong correlation

reconstruction, it suffices that the conditional mutual information
$I(A:C|B)_{\rho}$ is small, as shown recently. Here we ask what conditions are
necessary for approximate state reconstruction. This is answered by a lower
bound on the relative entropy between $\rho_{ABC}$ and the recovered state

be amongst the most powerful cosmological tools for ongoing and upcoming CMB
experiments. In this work, we investigate a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction
from temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)
effect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering
off moving electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own
intrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero cross-correlation with the CMB
lensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure). This
kSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its
cross-correlation with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed
by multifrequency foreground separation techniques because the kSZ effect
preserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically negligible for
current datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and
failure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino
masses or the properties of dark energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias
can be as large as $\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation with LSST galaxy
lensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum
temperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\ell_{\rm max} = 4000$,
and about half of that when $\ell_{\rm max} = 3000$. Similarly, we find that
the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum can be biased by up to several percent.
These biases are many times larger than the expected statistical errors.
Reducing $\ell_{\rm max}$ can significantly mitigate the bias at the cost of a
decrease in the overall lensing reconstruction signal-to-noise.
Polarization-only reconstruction may be the most robust mitigation strategy.

ejecta with the circumstellar medium gives rise to a shock wave propagating in
the dense SN environment, which may accelerate protons to multi-PeV energies.
Inelastic proton-proton collisions between the shock-accelerated protons and
those of the circumstellar medium lead to multi-messenger signatures. Here, we
evaluate the possible neutrino signal of type IIn SNe and compare with IceCube
observations. We employ a Monte Carlo method for the calculation of the diffuse
neutrino emission from the SN IIn class to account for the spread in their
properties. The cumulative neutrino emission is found to be ~ 10 per cent of
the observed IceCube neutrino flux above 60 TeV. Type IIn SNe would be the
dominant component of the diffuse astrophysical flux, only if 4 per cent of all
core collapse SNe were of this type and 20 to 30 per cent of the shock energy
was channeled to accelerated protons. Lower values of the acceleration
efficiency are accessible by the observation of a single type IIn SN as a
neutrino point source with IceCube using up-going muon neutrinos. Such an
identification is possible in the first year following the SN shock breakout

discovering the relations between the resulting clusters. We propose a new

The proposed method has a set of parameters that can be tuned in order to

structure information, the concept of low-rank tensor factorization (LRTF) has
been applied for the recovery of a low dimensional subspace from high
dimensional visual data. The low-rank tensor recovery is generally achieved by
minimizing the loss function between the observed data and the factorization
representation. The loss function is designed in various forms under different
noise distribution assumptions, like $L_1$ norm for Laplacian distribution and
$L_2$ norm for Gaussian distribution. However, they often fail to tackle the
real data which are corrupted by the noise with unknown distribution. In this
paper, we propose a generalized weighted low-rank tensor factorization method
(GWLRTF) integrated with the idea of noise modelling. This procedure treats the
target data as high-order tensor directly and models the noise by a Mixture of
Gaussians, which is called MoG GWLRTF. The parameters in the model are
estimated under the EM framework and through a new developed algorithm of
weighted low-rank tensor factorization. We provide two versions of the
algorithm with different tensor factorization operations, i.e., CP
factorization and Tucker factorization. Extensive experiments indicate the
respective advantages of this two versions in different applications and also
demonstrate the effectiveness of MoG GWLRTF compared with other competing
methods.

planetary systems and systems for which the stability is not granted and needs
further investigations. AMD-stability is based on the conservation of the
Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD) in the averaged system at all orders of
averaging. While the AMD criterion is rigorous, the conservation of the AMD is
only granted in absence of mean-motion resonances (MMR). Here we extend the
AMD-stability criterion to take into account mean-motion resonances, and more
specifically the overlap of first order MMR. If the MMR islands overlap, the
system will experience generalized chaos leading to instability. The
Hamiltonian of two massive planets on coplanar quasi-circular orbits can be
reduced to an integrable one degree of freedom problem for period ratios close
to a first order MMR. We use the reduced Hamiltonian to derive a new overlap
criterion for first order MMR. This stability criterion unifies the previous
criteria proposed in the literature and admits the criteria obtained for
initially circular and eccentric orbits as limit cases. We then improve the
definition of AMD-stability to take into account the short term chaos generated
by MMR overlap. We analyze the outcome of this improved definition of
AMD-stability on selected multi-planet systems from the Extrasolar Planets

profiles. The heat flux reduction exhibits a saturation with a favorable
isotopic trend. A significant part of the heat flux can be convective even in
pure plasmas, unlike in the plasma core, and it is sensitive to how momentum
sources are distributed between the various species. In particular, if only ion
momentum sources are allowed, in global simulations of pure plasmas the ion
particle flux remains close to its local value, while this may not be the case

the topological transition between these two regions can be tuned by an
external magnetic field. The winding number that characterizes the topology of

contemporary reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
tackles this problem by using a set of temporally-extended actions, or options,
each of which has its own subgoal. These subgoals are normally handcrafted for
specific tasks. Here, though, we introduce a generic class of subgoals with
broad applicability in the visual domain. Underlying our approach (in common
with work using ""auxiliary tasks"") is the hypothesis that the ability to
control aspects of the environment is an inherently useful skill to have. We
incorporate such subgoals in an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning
system and test two variants of our algorithm on a number of games from the
Atari suite. We highlight the advantage of our approach in one of the hardest
games -- Montezuma's revenge -- for which the ability to handle sparse rewards
is key. Our agent learns several times faster than the current state-of-the-art
HRL agent in this game, reaching a similar level of performance. UPDATE
22/11/17: We found that a standard A3C agent with a simple shaped reward, i.e.
extrinsic reward + feature control intrinsic reward, has comparable performance
to our agent in Montezuma Revenge. In light of the new experiments performed,
the advantage of our HRL approach can be attributed more to its ability to
learn useful features from intrinsic rewards rather than its ability to explore
and reuse abstracted skills with hierarchical components. This has led us to a

elasticity for a dilute suspension of spheres in a viscoelastic medium. Our
perturbation theory is valid to $O(\phi\mathrm{Wi}^2)$ in the Weissenberg
number $\mathrm{Wi}=\dot\gamma \lambda$, where $\dot\gamma$ is the typical
magnitude of the suspension velocity gradient, and $\lambda$ is the relaxation
time of the viscoelastic fluid. For shear flow we find that the suspension
shear-thickens due to elastic stretching in strain hot spots near the particle,
despite the fact that the stress inside the particles decreases relative to the
Newtonian case. We thus argue that it is crucial to correctly model the
extensional rheology of the suspending medium to predict the shear rheology of
the suspension. For uniaxial extensional flow we correct existing results at
$O(\phi\mathrm{Wi})$, and find dramatic strain-rate thickening at
$O(\phi\mathrm{Wi}^2)$. We validate our theory with fully resolved numerical
simulations.

recommendation (initiation, removal, increase, or decrease) for asthma
sufferers. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in both adults and
children, affecting 8% of the US population and costing $37-63 billion/year in
the US. Asthma is a complex disease, whose symptoms may wax and wane, making it
difficult for clinicians to predict outcomes and prognosis. Improved ability to
predict prognosis can inform decision making and may promote conversations
between clinician and provider around optimizing medication therapy. Data from
the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) years 2000-2010 were used to fit
a longitudinal model for a multivariate response of adverse events (Emergency
Department or In-patient visits, excessive rescue inhaler use, and oral steroid
use). To reduce bias in the estimation of medication effects, medication level
was treated as a latent process which was restricted to be consistent with
prescription refill data. This approach is demonstrated to be effective in the
MEPS cohort via predictions on a validation hold out set and a synthetic data
simulation study. This framework can be easily generalized to medication
decisions for other conditions as well.

We find that they arise by imposing a simple restriction on the RSOS
quasiparticle states of the unitary models $M(p,p+1)$. In fact, four fermionic
expressions are obtained for each generating function of half-lattice paths of
finite length $L$, and these lead to four distinct expressions for most

$q$-trinomial coefficients. Taking the $L\to\infty$ limit shows that the

that an effective theory of the inflaton and goldstino superfields should
satisfy in order to be faithfully described by a sgoldstino-less model.
Enlarging the scope of previous studies, we investigate the case where the
effective field theory cut-off, and hence also the sgoldstino mass, are
inflaton-dependent. We then introduce a UV complete model where one can realize
successfully sgoldstino-less inflation and gauge mediation of supersymmetry
breaking, combining the alpha-attractor mechanism and a weakly coupled model of
spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. In this class of models we find that,
given current limits on superpartner masses, the gravitino mass has a lower
bound of the order of the MeV, i.e. we cannot reach very low supersymmetry
breaking scales. On the plus side, we recognize that in this framework, one can
derive the complete superpartner spectrum as well as compute inflation
observables, the reheating temperature, and address the gravitino overabundance
problem. We then show that further constraints come from collider results and
inflation observables. Their non trivial interplay seems a staple feature of

cascaded dynamical systems. If each component subsystem is asymptotically
stable, the matrix norms of the linear parts of the component subsystems are
strictly increasing, and the component subsystems have disjoint spectrums,
there exist perturbation functions for the initial conditions of each component
subsystem such that the orbits of the cascaded system and the decoupled
component subsystems have zero asymptotic relative error. This implies that the
evolutions are asymptotically equivalent; cascaded compositions of stable
systems are stable. These results hold for both cascaded systems with linear
component subsystem dynamics and linear coupling terms and nonlinear cascades
topologically conjugate to the linear case. We further show that the Koopman
principal eigenvalues of each component subsystem are also Koopman eigenvalues
of the cascaded system. The corresponding Koopman eigenfunctions of the
cascaded system are formed by extending the domain of definition of the
component systems' principal eigenfunctions and then composing them with the
perturbation function.

transmitted signals and retained idlers to obtain significant quantum
enhancements in simultaneous measurement of these parameters. The first
entanglement-enhanced lidar circumvents the Arthurs-Kelly uncertainty relation
for simultaneous measurement of range and radial velocity from detection of a
single photon returned from the target. This performance presumes there is no
extraneous (background) light, but is robust to the roundtrip loss incurred by
the signal photons. The second entanglement-enhanced lidar---which requires a
lossless, noiseless environment---realizes Heisenberg-limited accuracies for
both its range and radial-velocity measurements, i.e., their root-mean-square
estimation errors are both proportional to $1/M$ when $M$ signal photons are
transmitted. These two lidars derive their entanglement-based enhancements from
use of a unitary transformation that takes a signal-idler photon pair with
frequencies $\omega_S$ and $\omega_I$ and converts it to a signal-idler photon
pair whose frequencies are $(\omega_S + \omega_I)/2$ and $\omega_S-\omega_I$.
Insight into how this transformation provides its benefits is provided through
an analogy to superdense coding.

before being quenched by more than an order of magnitude during the soft X-ray
state ($19 \pm 4 \mu$Jy). The source then was undetected in radio (< $13
\mu$Jy) as it faded to quiescence. In NS-LMXBs, possible jet quenching has been
observed in only three sources and the J1804 jet quenching we show here is the
deepest and clearest example to date. Radio observations when the source was
fading towards quiescence ($L_X = 10^{34-35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) show that J1804
must follow a steep track in the radio/X-ray luminosity plane with $\beta >
0.7$ (where $L_R \propto L_X^{\beta}$). Few other sources have been studied in

study joint uplink and downlink coverage of cellular-based ambient RF energy
harvesting IoT where the cellular network is assumed to be the only source of
RF energy. We consider a time division-based approach for power and information
transmission where each time-slot is partitioned into three sub-slots: (i)
charging sub-slot during which the cellular base stations (BSs) act as RF
chargers for the IoT devices, which then use the energy harvested in this
sub-slot for information transmission and/or reception during the remaining two
sub-slots, (ii) downlink sub-slot during which the IoT device receives
information from the associated BS, and (iii) uplink sub-slot during which the
IoT device transmits information to the associated BS. For this setup, we
characterize the joint coverage probability, which is the joint probability of
the events that the typical device harvests sufficient energy in the given time
slot and is under both uplink and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) coverage with respect to its associated BS. This metric
significantly generalizes the prior art on energy harvesting communications,
which usually focused on downlink or uplink coverage separately. The key
technical challenge is in handling the correlation between the amount of energy
harvested in the charging sub-slot and the information signal quality (SINR) in
the downlink and uplink sub-slots. Dominant BS-based approach is developed to
derive tight approximation for this joint coverage probability. Several system

of elemental abundances, one has to ensure that the correct amount of magnetic
flux is present in the simulations. The presence of magnetic flux modifies the
thermal structure of the solar photosphere, which affects abundance
determinations and the solar spectral irradiance. We compare the polarization
signals in disk-center observations of the solar photosphere in quiet-Sun
regions with those in Stokes spectra computed on the basis of 3D MHD
simulations having average magnetic flux densities of about 20, 56, 112 and 224
G. This approach allows us to find the simulation run that best matches the
observations. The observations were taken with the Hinode SP, TIP, POLIS and
the GFPI, respectively. We determine characteristic quantities of full Stokes
profiles in a few photospheric spectral lines in the visible (630 nm) and
near-infrared (1083 and 1565 nm). We find that the appearance of abnormal
granulation in intensity maps of degraded simulations can be traced back to an
initially regular granulation pattern with numerous bright points in the
intergranular lanes before the spatial degradation. The linear polarization
signals in the simulations are almost exclusively related to canopies of strong
magnetic flux concentrations and not to transient events of magnetic flux
emergence. We find that the average vertical magnetic flux density in the
simulation should be less than 50 G to reproduce the observed polarization
signals in the quiet Sun internetwork. A value of about 35 G gives the best
match across the SP, TIP, POLIS and GFPI observations.

up-sampling, including encoder-decoder networks for semantic segmentation and
deep generative models for unsupervised learning. One of the key limitations of
deconvolutional operations is that they result in the so-called checkerboard
problem. This is caused by the fact that no direct relationship exists among
adjacent pixels on the output feature map. To address this problem, we propose
the pixel deconvolutional layer (PixelDCL) to establish direct relationships
among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. Our method is based on a
fresh interpretation of the regular deconvolution operation. The resulting
PixelDCL can be used to replace any deconvolutional layer in a plug-and-play
manner without compromising the fully trainable capabilities of original
models. The proposed PixelDCL may result in slight decrease in efficiency, but
this can be overcome by an implementation trick. Experimental results on
semantic segmentation demonstrate that PixelDCL can consider spatial features
such as edges and shapes and yields more accurate segmentation outputs than
deconvolutional layers. When used in image generation tasks, our PixelDCL can
largely overcome the checkerboard problem suffered by regular deconvolution
operations.

Such representations can only convey spatial information implicitly when
coupled with powerful decoders. In this work, we propose spatial VAEs that use
feature maps of larger size as latent variables to explicitly capture spatial
information. This is achieved by allowing the latent variables to be sampled
from matrix-variate normal (MVN) distributions whose parameters are computed
from the encoder network. To increase dependencies among locations on latent
feature maps and reduce the number of parameters, we further propose spatial
VAEs via low-rank MVN distributions. Experimental results show that the
proposed spatial VAEs outperform original VAEs in capturing rich structural and
spatial information.

question answering is more complicated and comprehensive than that in
conventional natural language processing tasks, making it a better task to
evaluate textual representation methods. Shallow models like fastText, which
can obtain comparable results with deep learning models in tasks like text

in the nucleon state using large scale simulations of lattice QCD. The
calculations were done using eight ensembles of gauge configurations generated
by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors.
These ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \approx 0.06, 0.09$ and $0.12$
fm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_\pi \approx 135,
225$ and $310$ MeV. High-statistics estimates allow us to quantify systematic
uncertainties in the extraction of $G_A(Q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form
factor $\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$. We perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the
lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses of the axial charge
radius $r_A$ data to obtain physical estimates. Using the dipole ansatz to fit
the $Q^2$ behavior we obtain $r_A|_{\rm dipole} = 0.49(3)$ fm, which
corresponds to ${\cal M}_A = 1.39(9)$ GeV, and is consistent with ${\cal M}_A =
1.35(17)$ GeV obtained by the miniBooNE collaboration. The estimate obtained
using the $z$-expansion is $r_A|_{z-{\rm expansion}} = 0.46(6)$ fm, and the
combined result is $r_A|_{\rm combined} = 0.48(4)$ fm. Analysis of the induced
pseudoscalar form factor $\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$ yields low estimates for $g_P^\ast$
and $g_{\pi {\rm NN}}$ compared to their phenomenological values. To understand
these, we analyze the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation by also
calculating the pseudoscalar form factor. We find that these low values are due
to large deviations in the PCAC relation between the three form factors and
from the pion-pole dominance hypothesis.

and Keck/NIRC2, and a reanalysis of the discovery data obtained with
VLT/SPHERE, we derive colors, spectra, and astrometry for HD 131399 Ab. The
broader wavelength coverage and higher data quality allow us to re-investigate
its status. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution excludes spectral
types later than L0 and is consistent with a K or M dwarf, which are the most
likely candidates for a background object in this direction at the apparent
magnitude observed. If it were a physically associated object, the projected
velocity of HD 131399 Ab would exceed escape velocity given the mass and
distance to HD 131399 A. We show that HD 131399 Ab is also not following the
expected track for a stationary background star at infinite distance. Solving
for the proper motion and parallax required to explain the relative motion of
HD 131399 Ab, we find a proper motion of 12.3 mas/yr. When compared to
predicted background objects drawn from a galactic model, we find this proper
motion to be high, but consistent with the top 4% fastest-moving background
stars. From our analysis we conclude that HD 131399 Ab is a background K or M
dwarf.

luminous galaxy clusters selected from the MCXC (Meta-Catalog of X-Ray Detected
Clusters of Galaxies) cluster catalog in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC-SSP) survey field with S16A data, As a pilot study of our planned
series papers, we measure hydrostatic equilibrium (H.E.) masses using
XMM-Newton data for four clusters in the current coverage area out of a sample
of 22 MCXC clusters. We additionally analyze a non-MCXC cluster associated with
one MCXC cluster. We show that H.E. masses for the MCXC clusters are correlated
with cluster richness from the CAMIRA catalog (Oguri et al. 2017), while that
for the non-MCXC cluster deviates from the scaling relation. The mass
normalization of the relationship between the cluster richness and H.E. mass is
compatible with one inferred by matching CAMIRA cluster abundance with a
theoretical halo mass function. The mean gas mass fraction based on H.E. masses
for the MCXC clusters is $\langle f_{\rm gas} \rangle = 0.125\pm0.012$ at
spherical overdensity $\Delta=500$, which is $\sim80-90$ percent of the cosmic
mean baryon fraction, $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$, measured by cosmic microwave
background experiments. We find that the mean baryon fraction estimated from
X-ray and HSC-SSP optical data is comparable to $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$. A
weak-lensing shear catalog of background galaxies, combined with photometric
redshifts, is currently available only for three clusters in our sample.
Hydrostatic equilibrium masses roughly agree with weak-lensing masses, albeit
with large uncertainty. This study demonstrates that further multiwavelength
study for a large sample of clusters using X-ray, HSC-SSP optical and weak
lensing data will enable us to understand cluster physics and utilize
cluster-based cosmology.

are deployed as a large intelligent surface (LIS), which is a newly proposed
concept beyond massive-MIMO where future man-made structures are electronically
active with integrated electronics and wireless communication making the entire

Fisher-information and Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) in closed-form for
positioning a terminal located perpendicular to the center of the LIS, whose
location we refer to as being on the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the
LIS. For a terminal that is not on the CPL, closed-form expressions of the
Fisher-information and CRLB seem out of reach, and we alternatively find
approximations of them which are shown to be accurate. Under mild conditions,
we show that the CRLB for all three Cartesian dimensions ($x$, $y$ and $z$)
decreases quadratically in the surface-area of the LIS, except for a terminal
exactly on the CPL where the CRLB for the $z$-dimension (distance from the LIS)
decreases linearly in the same. In a second step, we analyze the CRLB for
positioning when there is an unknown phase $\varphi$ presented in the analog
circuits of the LIS. We then show that the CRLBs are dramatically increased for
all three dimensions but decrease in the third-order of the surface-area.
Moreover, with an infinitely large LIS the CRLB for the $z$-dimension with an
unknown $\varphi$ is 6 dB higher than the case without phase uncertainty, and
the CRLB for estimating $\varphi$ converges to a constant that is independent
of the wavelength $\lambda$. At last, we extensively discuss the impact of
centralized and distributed deployments of LIS, and show that a distributed
deployment of LIS can enlarge the coverage for terminal-positioning and improve
the overall positioning performance.

but recent developments in the treatment of conduct risk (the risk of loss due
to the relationship between a financial institution and its customers) have
cast doubt on 'standard' procedures. Regulations require that operational risk
losses should be aggregated by originating event. The effect is that a large
number of small and medium-sized losses are aggregated into a small number of
very large losses, such that a risk capital calculation produces a hugely
inflated result. To solve this problem, a novel distribution based on a
one-parameter probability density with an exponential of a fourth power is
proposed, where the parameter is to be estimated. Symbolic computation is used
to derive the necessary analytical expressions with which to formulate the
problem, and is followed by numeric calculations in R. Goodness-of-fit and
parameter estimation are both determined by using a novel method developed
specifically for use with probability distribution functions. The results
compare favourably with an existing model that used a LogGamma Mixture density,

Because the number of FOs in a voxel is usually small, dictionary-based sparse
reconstruction has been used to estimate FOs with a relatively small number of
diffusion gradients. However, accurate FO estimation in regions with complex FO
configurations in the presence of noise can still be challenging. In this work
we explore the use of a deep network for FO estimation in a dictionary-based
framework and propose an algorithm named Fiber Orientation Reconstruction
guided by a Deep Network (FORDN). FORDN consists of two steps. First, we use a
smaller dictionary encoding coarse basis FOs to represent the diffusion
signals. To estimate the mixture fractions of the dictionary atoms (and thus
coarse FOs), a deep network is designed specifically for solving the sparse
reconstruction problem. Here, the smaller dictionary is used to reduce the
computational cost of training. Second, the coarse FOs inform the final FO
estimation, where a larger dictionary encoding dense basis FOs is used and a
weighted l1-norm regularized least squares problem is solved to encourage FOs
that are consistent with the network output. FORDN was evaluated and compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate FOs using sparse reconstruction
on simulated and real dMRI data, and the results demonstrate the benefit of
using a deep network for FO estimation.

investigating the later stages of stellar evolution, the properties of the
ambient interstellar medium, and the physics of particle acceleration and
shocks. For a fraction of SNRs, multi-wavelength coverage from radio to ultra
high-energies has been provided, constraining their contributions to the
production of Galactic cosmic rays. Although radio emission is the most common
identifier of SNRs and a prime probe for refining models, high-resolution
images at frequencies above 5 GHz are surprisingly lacking, even for bright and
well-known SNRs such as IC443 and W44. In the frameworks of the Astronomical
Validation and Early Science Program with the 64-m single-dish Sardinia Radio
Telescope, we provided, for the first time, single-dish deep imaging at 7 GHz
of the IC443 and W44 complexes coupled with spatially-resolved spectra in the
1.5-7 GHz frequency range. Our images were obtained through on-the-fly mapping
techniques, providing antenna beam oversampling and resulting in accurate
continuum flux density measurements. The integrated flux densities associated
with IC443 are S_1.5GHz = 134 +/- 4 Jy and S_7GHz = 67 +/- 3 Jy. For W44, we
measured total flux densities of S_1.5GHz = 214 +/- 6 Jy and S_7GHz = 94 +/- 4
Jy. Spectral index maps provide evidence of a wide physical parameter scatter
among different SNR regions: a flat spectrum is observed from the brightest SNR
regions at the shock, while steeper spectral indices (up to 0.7) are observed
in fainter cooling regions, disentangling in this way different populations and
spectra of radio/gamma-ray-emitting electrons in these SNRs.

dust-free region with gas temperature in the optically thin limit, optically
thin dust halo, optically thick condensation front and the classical optically
thick region in order from the inside. We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio
profile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation
regulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust
halo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available
silicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is
determined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal
to the characteristic temperature $\sim 1200{\,\rm K}$. We derive the mid-plane
temperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation with the
additional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a
result, the overall temperature profile is step-like with steep gradients at
the borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet
traps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction
with the gas disk stops. The temperature at the border between the two
outermost regions coincides with the temperature needed to activate
magnetorotational instability, suggesting that the inner edge of the dead zone
must lie at this border. The radius of the dead-zone inner edge predicted from
our solution is $\sim$ 2-3 times larger than that expected from the classical
optically thick temperature.

such as preferences, opinions and beliefs is an open challenge. Trait formation
is intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a
variety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have emphasized the
importance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that
are empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources,
it has been suggested that culture has properties that are universally present,
and that empirical cultural states differ systematically from randomized
counterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the
observed patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural
model for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical
properties. One ingredient of the model, already used in previous work, assumes
that every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several,
universal ""rationalities"", informally postulated by several social science
theories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that,
apart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure
to the other rationalities. It is shown that both ingredients are required for
reproducing the empirical regularities. This key result suggests that the
effects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an interplay
of multiple, mixing rationalities, and thus provides indirect evidence for the
class of social science theories postulating such mixing. The model should be
seen as a static, effective description of culture, while a dynamical, more
fundamental description is left for future research.

this letter, we investigate the problem of ultra-reliable and low-latency
communication (URLLC) in millimeter wave (mmWave)-enabled massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. The problem is cast as a
network utility maximization subject to probabilistic latency and reliability
constraints. To solve this problem, we resort to the Lyapunov technique whereby
a utility-delay control approach is proposed, which adapts to channel
variations and queue dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed
approach ensures reliable communication with a guaranteed probability of
99.99%, and reduces latency by 28.41% and 77.11% as compared to baselines with
and without probabilistic latency constraints, respectively.

of estimating the pseudo inverse $X^+$ based on the pseudo inverse of a sampled
subset of columns (of size at least the number of rows). We show that this is
possible if the subset of columns is chosen proportional to the squared volume
spanned by the rows of the chosen submatrix (ie, volume sampling). The
resulting estimator is unbiased and surprisingly the covariance of the
estimator also has a closed form: It equals a specific factor times
$X^{+\top}X^+$. Pseudo inverse plays an important part in solving the linear
least squares problem, where we try to predict a label for each column of $X$.
We assume labels are expensive and we are only given the labels for the small
subset of columns we sample from $X$. Using our methods we show that the weight
vector of the solution for the sub problem is an unbiased estimator of the
optimal solution for the whole problem based on all column labels. We believe
that these new formulas establish a fundamental connection between linear least
squares and volume sampling. We use our methods to obtain an algorithm for
volume sampling that is faster than state-of-the-art and for obtaining bounds
for the total loss of the estimated least-squares solution on all labeled
columns.

debated. In the realm of highly-controllable quantum gases, a roton mode has
been predicted to emerge due to magnetic dipole-dipole interactions despite of

  Classification and Normalized Radial Basis Function Network",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral graph theory has been widely applied in unsupervised and
semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we find for the first time, to our
knowledge, that it also plays a concrete role in supervised classification. It
turns out that two classifiers are inherently related to the theory: linear
regression for classification (LRC) and normalized radial basis function
network (nRBFN), corresponding to linear and nonlinear kernel respectively. The
spectral graph theory provides us with a new insight into a fundamental aspect
of classification: the tradeoff between fitting error and overfitting risk.
With the theory, ideal working conditions for LRC and nRBFN are presented,
which ensure not only zero fitting error but also low overfitting risk. For
quantitative analysis, two concepts, the fitting error and the spectral risk
(indicating overfitting), have been defined. Their bounds for nRBFN and LRC are
derived. A special result shows that the spectral risk of nRBFN is lower
bounded by the number of classes and upper bounded by the size of radial basis.
When the conditions are not met exactly, the classifiers will pursue the
minimum fitting error, running into the risk of overfitting. It turns out that
$\ell_2$-norm regularization can be applied to control overfitting. Its effect
is explored under the spectral context. It is found that the two terms in the
$\ell_2$-regularized objective are one-one correspondent to the fitting error
and the spectral risk, revealing a tradeoff between the two quantities.
Concerning practical performance, we devise a basis selection strategy to
address the main problem hindering the applications of (n)RBFN. With the
strategy, nRBFN is easy to implement yet flexible. Experiments on 14 benchmark
data sets show the performance of nRBFN is comparable to that of SVM, whereas
the parameter tuning of nRBFN is much easier, leading to reduction of model
selection time.

energetic with respective peak X-ray luminosities of $\sim$$10^{32.2}$ and
$\sim$$10^{31.8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 0.3--50 keV energy band, which are larger
than any other flares previously observed on CC Eri. The time-resolved spectral

nested-grid initial conditions, adaptive mesh refinement, radiative cooling of

microscopic viscosity on the basis of various theoretical assumptions and
estimating the Kolmogorov length from the turbulent dissipation rate computed
with a subgrid-scale model, we are able to demonstrate that most of the
warm-hot intergalactic medium can sustain a fully turbulent state only if the
magnetic suppression of the viscosity is considerable. Accepting this as
premise, it turns out that ratios of turbulent and thermal quantities change
only little in the course of the merger. This confirms the tight correlations
between the mean thermal and non-thermal energy content for large samples of
clusters in earlier studies, which can be interpreted as second self-similarity
on top of the self-similarity for different halo masses. Another long-standing
question is how and to which extent turbulence contributes to the support of
the gas against gravity. From a global perspective, the ratio of turbulent and
thermal pressures is significant for the clusters in our simulation. On the
other hand, a local measure is provided by the compression rate, i.e. the
growth rate of the divergence of the flow. Particularly for the intracluster
medium, we find that the dominant contribution against gravity comes from
thermal pressure, while compressible turbulence effectively counteracts the
support. For this reason it appears to be too simplistic to consider turbulence
merely as an effective enhancement of thermal energy.

so-called solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). The SEI is generally assumed to
act like an Ohmic resistor despite its complex chemical composition and
porosity distribution. Here, one reports that this assumption does not hold for
alkali-ion batteries. The SEI possesses a non-linear overpotential
characteristic which saturates already at low current density of 0.1 mAcm-2
giving only 3.3$\pm$1 mV for Li-metal electrodes in different electrolytes. For
Na- and K-metal electrodes, these SEI overpotentials become dominating with 31
mV and 72 mV at the same low current densities giving significant disadvantages
over Li-ion batteries for commercial applications. With the introduction of a
new term, one achieves agreement between the parameters from galvanostatic
cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the first time. The
discovery of the non-linear SEI overpotential disrupts the general believes
about the role of the SEI for today's batteries as it is basically negligible

domain wall motion induced by magneto-electric effect. Due to a strong elastic
pinning between the ferro-magnetic domain wall (FM-DW) and the underlying
ferro-electric domain wall (FE-DW), the FM-DW gets dragged by the FE-DW on
application of a voltage pulse. The fact that FE materials are insulators
allows for pure voltage-driven FM-DW motion, which in turn can be used to mimic
the behaviors of biological spiking neurons and synapses. The voltage driven
nature of the proposed devices allows energy-efficient operation. A detailed
device to system level simulation framework based on micromagnetic simulations

Gelation is induced independently on the addition of cations, while the final
rheological properties are highly influenced by the type, the concentration as
well as on the sequence of the operations since salts must be added before
sonication to produce stiff gels. Cations with various charge and dimension
have been associated to ultrasounds to induce gelation and the gel elastic
modulus increase proportionally with the charge over the ion size ratio. SAXS
analysis of the Na+ hydrogel and Ca2+ hydrogel to which the ion was added after

opportunity for ""alternative"" sources of information to emerge. Using large
social networks like Twitter and Facebook, misleading, false, or agenda-driven
information can quickly and seamlessly spread online, deceiving people or
influencing their opinions. Also, the increased engagement of tightly knit
communities, such as Reddit and 4chan, further compounds the problem, as their
users initiate and propagate alternative information, not only within their own
communities, but also to different ones as well as various social media. In
fact, these platforms have become an important piece of the modern information
ecosystem, which, thus far, has not been studied as a whole.
  In this paper, we begin to fill this gap by studying mainstream and
alternative news shared on Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. By analyzing millions of
posts around several axes, we measure how mainstream and alternative news flows
between these platforms. Our results indicate that alt-right communities within
4chan and Reddit can have a surprising level of influence on Twitter, providing
evidence that ""fringe"" communities often succeed in spreading alternative news
to mainstream social networks and the greater Web.

reasonable ordering semantics for GPU system calls across these hierarchy of

multiple parameters are exposed to the user with the objective of allowing them
to shape the algorithms to their specific needs. Parameter selection,
therefore, becomes an intrinsic problem of every heuristic algorithm. Selecting
good parameter values relies not only on knowledge related to the problem at
hand, but to the algorithms themselves. This research explores the usage of
self-organized criticality to reduce user interaction in the process of
selecting suitable parameters for particle swarm optimization (PSO) heuristics.
A particle swarm variant (named Adaptive PSO) with self-organized criticality
is developed and benchmarked against the standard PSO. Criticality is observed
in the dynamic behaviour of this swarm and excellent results are observed in
the long run. In contrast with the standard PSO, the Adaptive PSO does not
stagnate at any point in time, balancing the concepts of exploration and
exploitation better. A software platform for experimenting with particle
swarms, called PSO Laboratory, is also developed. This software is used to test
the standard PSO as well as all other PSO variants developed in the process of
creating the Adaptive PSO. As the software is intended to be of aid to future
and related research, special attention has been put in the development of a
friendly graphical user interface. Particle swarms are executed in real time,

observed in the seismo field of the CoRoT satellite, in order to determine its
physical and pulsation characteristics. Classical Be stars are main-sequence
objects of mainly B-type, whose spectra show, or had shown at some epoch,
Balmer lines in emission and an infrared excess. Both characteristics are
attributed to an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk fed by
non-periodic mass-loss episodes (outbursts). Be stars often show nonradial
pulsation gravity modes and, as more recently discovered, stochastically
excited oscillations. Applying the CLEANEST algorithm to the high-cadence and
highly photometrically precise measurements of the HD 171219 light curve led us
to perform an unprecedented detailed analysis of its nonradial pulsations. Tens
of frequencies have been detected in the object compatible with nonradial
g-modes. Additional high-resolution ground-based spectroscopic observations

equator-on. We also found in the ground data the same frequencies as in CoRoT
data. Additionally, we analyzed the circumstellar activity through the
traditional method of V/R emission H{\alpha} line variation. A quintuplet was
identified at approximately 1.113 c/d (12.88 {\mu}Hz) with a separation of
0.017 c/d that can be attributed to a pulsation degree l~2. The light curve
shows six small- to medium-scale outbursts during the CoRoT observations. The
intensity of the main frequencies varies after each outburst, suggesting a
possible correlation between the nonradial pulsations regime and the feeding of
the envelope.

outcomes from social and strategic interactions between individuals. The
incentives are usually modeled by payoffs in evolutionary games, such as the
prisoner's dilemma or the harmony game, with imitation dynamics. Adjusting the
incentives by changing the payoff parameters can favor cooperation, as found in
the harmony game, over defection, which prevails in the prisoner's dilemma.
Here, we show that this is not always the case if individuals engage in
strategic interactions in multiple domains. In particular, we investigate
evolutionary games on multiplex networks where individuals obtain an aggregate
payoff. We explicitly control the strength of degree correlations between nodes
in the different layers of the multiplex. We find that if the multiplex is
composed of many layers and degree correlations are strong, the topology of the
system enslaves the dynamics and the final outcome, cooperation or defection,
becomes independent of the payoff parameters. The fate of the system is then
determined by the initial conditions.

solution of large-scale rational eigenvalue problems, which is based on a
linearization and on a compact decomposition of the rational Krylov subspaces
corresponding to this linearization. R-CORK is an extension of the compact
rational Krylov method (CORK) introduced very recently by Van Beeumen et al. to
solve a family of non-linear eigenvalue problems that can be expressed and
linearized in certain particular ways and which include arbitrary polynomial
eigenvalue problems, but not arbitrary rational eigenvalue problems. The R-CORK
method exploits the structure of the linearized problem by representing the
Krylov vectors in a compact form in order to reduce the cost of storage,
resulting in a method with two levels of orthogonalization. The first level of
orthogonalization works with vectors of the same size that the original
problem, and the second level works with vectors of size much smaller than the
original problem. Since vectors of the size of the linearization are never
stored or orthogonalized, R-CORK is more efficient from the point of views of
memory and orthogonalization than the classical rational Krylov method applied
directly to the linearization. Taking into account that the R-CORK method is
based on a classical rational Krylov method, to implement implicit restarting
is also possible and we show how to do it in a memory efficient way. Finally,
some numerical examples are included in order to show that the R-CORK method
performs satisfactorily in practice.

neutron stars in alternative theories of gravity, focusing mainly on the
fundamental $f$-modes. We concentrated on a particular class of alternative
theories - the (massive) scalar-tensor theories. The generalization to rapid
rotation is important because on one hand the rapid rotation can magnify the
deviations from general relativity compared to the static case and on the other
hand some of the most efficient emitters of gravitational radiation, such as
the binary neutron star merger remnants, are supposed to be rotating close to
their Kepler (mass-shedding) limits shortly after their formation. We have
constructed several sequences of models starting from the nonrotating case and
reaching up to the Kepler limit, with different values of the scalar-tensor
theory coupling constant and the scalar field mass. The results show that the
deviations from pure Einstein's theory can be significant especially in the
case of nonzero scalar field mass. An important property of the oscillation
modes of rapidly rotating stars is that they can become secularly unstable due
to the emission of gravitational radiation, that is so-called
Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability. Such unstable modes are efficient
emitters of gravitational radiation. Our studies show that the inclusion of
nonzero scalar field would decrease the threshold value of the normalized
angular momentum where this instability stars to operate, but the growth time
of the instability seems to be increased compared to pure general relativity.

channels such as Nakagami-m channel and Rice channel, or generalized fading
channels such as \k{appa}-{\mu} fading distribution and {\eta}-{\mu} fading

the envelope p.d.f. to evaluate energy efficiency for sensing systems. Next,
the probability of detection model with Marcum-Q function has been derived and
the close-form detective expressions with moment generating function (MGF)

average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve also have been

to a differential system $\Sigma(X)$ that governs $d$-dimensional submanifolds
of $V$ whose Gaussian image is contained in $X$. We investigate a special case
of this construction where $X$ is a sixfold in $Gr(4, 6)$. The corresponding
system $\Sigma(X)$ reduces to a pair of first-order PDEs for 2 functions of 4
independent variables. Equations of this type arise in self-dual Ricci-flat
geometry. Our main result is a complete description of integrable systems
$\Sigma(X)$. These naturally fall into two subclasses.
  (1) Systems of Monge-Amp\`ere type. The corresponding sixfolds $X$ are
codimension 2 linear sections of the Pl\""ucker embedding
$Gr(4,6)\subset\mathbb{P}^{14}$.
  (2) General linearly degenerate systems. The corresponding sixfolds $X$ are
the images of quadratic maps $\mathbb{P}^6- Gr(4, 6)$ given by a version of the
classical construction of Chasles.
  We prove that integrability is equivalent to the requirement that the
characteristic variety of system $\Sigma(X)$ gives rise to a conformal
structure which is self-dual on every solution. In fact, all solutions carry
hyper-Hermitian geometry.

the velocity of the edge states, and predict structures with high edge state

corresponding to the case where a binary code is used in combination with a
higher-order modulation using the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)
paradigm and to the case where a nonbinary code over a field matched to the
constellation size is used, respectively. In particular, we consider hard
decision decoding, which is the preferable option for fiber-optic communication
systems where decoding complexity is a concern. Recently, Liga \emph{et al.}
analyzed the AIRs for bit-wise and symbol-wise decoders considering what the
authors called \emph{hard decision decoder} which, however, exploits \emph{soft
information} of the transition probabilities of discrete-input discrete-output
channel resulting from the hard detection. As such, the complexity of the
decoder is essentially the same as the complexity of a soft decision decoder.
In this paper, we analyze instead the AIRs for the standard hard decision
decoder, commonly used in practice, where the decoding is based on the Hamming
distance metric. We show that if standard hard decision decoding is used,
bit-wise decoders yield significantly higher AIRs than symbol-wise decoders. As
a result, contrary to the conclusion by Liga \emph{et al.}, binary decoders
together with the BICM paradigm are preferable for spectrally-efficient
fiber-optic systems. We also design binary and nonbinary staircase codes and
show that, in agreement with the AIRs, binary codes yield better performance.

ultrasound images of lymph nodes, the intensity distribution of lymph node
parenchyma and fat varies spatially because of acoustic attenuation and
focusing effects. Thus, the intensity contrast between two object regions

  Algorithms (WAOA 2017)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Packet Scheduling with Adversarial Jamming packets of arbitrary sizes
arrive over time to be transmitted over a channel in which instantaneous
jamming errors occur at times chosen by the adversary and not known to the
algorithm. The transmission taking place at the time of jamming is corrupt, and
the algorithm learns this fact immediately. An online algorithm maximizes the
total size of packets it successfully transmits and the goal is to develop an
algorithm with the lowest possible asymptotic competitive ratio, where the
additive constant may depend on packet sizes.
  Our main contribution is a universal algorithm that works for any speedup and
packet sizes and, unlike previous algorithms for the problem, it does not need
to know these properties in advance. We show that this algorithm guarantees
1-competitiveness with speedup 4, making it the first known algorithm to
maintain 1-competitiveness with a moderate speedup in the general setting of
arbitrary packet sizes. We also prove a lower bound of $\phi+1\approx 2.618$ on
the speedup of any 1-competitive deterministic algorithm, showing that our
algorithm is close to the optimum.
  Additionally, we formulate a general framework for analyzing our algorithm
locally and use it to show upper bounds on its competitive ratio for speedups
in $[1,4)$ and for several special cases, recovering some previously known
results, each of which had a dedicated proof. In particular, our algorithm is
3-competitive without speedup, matching both the (worst-case) performance of
the algorithm by Jurdzinski et al. and the lower bound by Anta et al.

emerging field of superconducting spintronics [1,2]. Usually the focus of
research is on the spin polarization of the triplets, potentially enabling
low-dissipation magnetization switching and domain wall motion. However, the
fundamental mechanism for generating triplet pairs [3,4] also permits control
over a parameter which has not been addressed before, namely the spatial
distribution of the supercurrent. Here we demonstrate this control by tailoring
distinct supercurrent pathways in the ferromagnetic weak link of a Josephson
junction. Combining micromagnetic simulations with three-dimensional critical
current calculations, based on the Usadel description of mesoscopic
superconductivity [5], we designed a disk-shaped structure with a magnetic
vortex, which induces two distinct supercurrent channels across the junction.
The design was successfully tested with superconducting quantum interferometry
(SQI). Moreover, we show how the position of the pathways can be controlled by
moving the vortex with a magnetic field. This novel approach allows adaptable
supercurrent paths to be dynamically reconfigured to switch between different
functionalities in the same device.

using them to predict clinical events with machine learning models is
challenging. They are very high dimensional, sparse and have complex structure.
Furthermore, training data is often scarce because it is expensive to obtain
reliable labels for many clinical events. These difficulties have traditionally
been addressed by manual feature engineering encoding task specific domain
knowledge. We explored the use of neural networks and transfer learning to
learn representations of clinical notes that are useful for predicting future
clinical events of interest, such as all causes mortality, inpatient
admissions, and emergency room visits. Our data comprised 2.7 million notes and
115 thousand patients at Stanford Hospital. We used the learned
representations, along with commonly used bag of words and topic model
representations, as features for predictive models of clinical events. We
evaluated the effectiveness of these representations with respect to the
performance of the models trained on small datasets. Models using the neural
network derived representations performed significantly better than models
using the baseline representations with small ($N < 1000$) training datasets.
The learned representations offer significant performance gains over commonly
used baseline representations for a range of predictive modeling tasks and
cohort sizes, offering an effective alternative to task specific feature
engineering when plentiful labeled training data is not available.

the PeV region, highly performing calorimeters with large geometrical
acceptance and high energy resolution are required. Within the constraint of
the total mass of the apparatus, crucial for a space mission, the calorimeters
must be optimized with respect to their geometrical acceptance, granularity and
absorption depth. CaloCube is a homogeneous calorimeter with cubic geometry, to
maximise the acceptance being sensitive to particles from every direction in
space; granularity is obtained by relying on small cubic scintillating crystals
as active elements. Different scintillating materials have been studied. The
crystal sizes and spacing among them have been optimized with respect to the
energy resolution. A prototype, based on CsI(Tl) cubic crystals, has been
constructed and tested with particle beams. Some results of tests with
different beams at CERN are presented.

presence of considerable imperfections at the interface of the PTI, the
efficiency of the SPP-assisted energy transport is almost unaffected by

over considerably much larger distances than in the reciprocal case, and we
point out a particularly simple way to tune the transport. Finally, we analyze

the usual decoupling of one heavy mass at a time no longer holds, since the
ratio of the respective masses, $\eta = m_c^2/m_b^2 \sim 1/10$, is not small
enough. Therefore, the usual variable flavor number scheme (VFNS) has to be
generalized. The renormalization procedure in the two--mass case is different
from the single mass case derived in \cite{Bierenbaum:2009mv}. We present the
moments $N=2,4$ and $6$ for all contributing operator matrix elements,
expanding in the ratio $\eta$. We calculate the analytic results for general
values of the Mellin variable $N$ in the flavor non-singlet case, as well as
for transversity and the matrix element $A_{gq}^{(3)}$. We also calculate the
two-mass scalar integrals of all topologies contributing to the gluonic
operator matrix element $A_{gg}$. As it turns out, the expansion in $\eta$ is
usually inapplicable for general values of $N$. We therefore derive the result
for general values of the mass ratio. From the single pole terms we derive, now
in a two-mass calculation, the corresponding contributions to the 3-loop
anomalous dimensions. We introduce a new general class of iterated integrals

orbits prior to merger. By fitting the results of these simulations, we
accurately model the peak luminosity, peak waveform frequency and amplitude,

verify the accuracy of these new models and compare them to previously existing
empirical formulas. These new fits provide a basis for a hierarchical approach
to produce more accurate remnant formulas in the generic precessing case. They

transferring energy from large scales driven by violent events or
instabilities, to smaller scales where turbulent energy is ultimately converted
into plasma heat by dissipative mechanisms. The nonlinear interaction between
counterpropagating Alfven waves, denoted Alfven wave collisions, drives this
turbulent energy cascade, as recognized by early work with incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. Recent work employing analytical
calculations and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of Alfven wave collisions in
an idealized periodic initial state have demonstrated the key properties that
strong Alfven wave collisions mediate effectively the transfer of energy to
smaller perpendicular scales and self-consistently generate current sheets. For
the more realistic case of the collision between two initially separated Alfven
wavepackets, we use a nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation to show here that these
key properties persist: strong Alfven wavepacket collisions indeed facilitate
the perpendicular cascade of energy and give rise to current sheets.
Furthermore, the evolution shows that nonlinear interactions occur only while
the wavepackets overlap, followed by a clean separation of the wavepackets with
straight uniform magnetic fields and the cessation of nonlinear evolution in
between collisions, even in the gyrokinetic simulation presented here which
resolves dispersive and kinetic effects beyond the reach of the MHD theory.

phase or direction needs to be established to certify the quantum state. When
taking the size of such a classical reference frame into account, we show that
to reliably distinguish a quantum superposition state from an incoherent
mixture requires a measurement device that is quadratically bigger than the
superposition state. Whereas for moderate system sizes such as generated in
previous experiments this is not a stringent restriction, for macroscopic
superpositions of the size of a cat the required effort quickly becomes
intractable, requiring measurement devices of the size of the Earth. We
illustrate our results using macroscopic superposition states of photons,

character, becomes an overdamped Lorentzian mode in the orbitally ordered phase
below the Jahn-Teller transition, and finally appears as well-defined phonon
excitation in the antiferromagnetic state. Abrupt changes in real and imaginary
parts of the complex dielectric permittivity show that orbital ordering appears
via a structural phase transition with strong first-order character and that
the onset of antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by significant structural
changes, which are of first-order character, too. Dielectric spectroscopy
documents that, at low frequencies, significant dipolar relaxations are present
in the orbitally ordered, paramagnetic phase only. In contrast to the closely
related GaV4S8, this relaxation dynamics that most likely mirrors coupled
orbital and polar fluctuations does not seem to be related to the dynamic
processes detected in the THz regime.

unfortunately, this solid is only stable at impractically high pressures and/or

longer alkanes (methane is the shortest alkane) also form stable structures

automatic 3-D registration is implemented and validated for small animal image

localization of lesion that is currently in high demand in the study of tumor
of cancer (oncology) and its corresponding preparation of pharmaceutical drugs.
Though many registration algorithms are developed and applied on human brain
volumes, these methods may not be as efficient on small animal datasets due to
lack of intensity information and often the high anisotropy in voxel
dimensions. Therefore, a fully automatic registration algorithm which can
register not only assumably rigid small animal volumes such as brain but also
deformable organs such as kidney, cardiac and chest is developed using a
combination of global affine and local B-spline transformation models in which
mutual information is used as a similarity criterion. The global affine
registration uses a multi-resolution pyramid on image volumes of 3 levels
whereas in local B-spline registration, a multi-resolution scheme is applied on
the B-spline grid of 2 levels on the finest resolution of the image volumes in
which only the transform itself is affected rather than the image volumes.
Since mutual information lacks sufficient spatial information, PCA is used to
inject it by estimating initial translation and rotation parameters. It is
computationally efficient since it is implemented using C++ and ITK library,
and is qualitatively and quantitatively shown that this PCA-initialized global
registration followed by local registration is in close agreement with expert
manual registration and outperforms the one without PCA initialization tested
on small animal brain and kidney.

non-equilibrium local temperature baths e.g. ion and electron baths. Uncoupling
of the two partial differential equations leads to a higher-ordered diffusion
equation, solutions of which could be obtained in terms of classical diffusion

adding a vital element in the ILG structure, that of stochasticity, that takes

considerable amount of power. New hardware platforms using lower precision
arithmetic achieve drastic reductions in power consumption. More recently,
brain-inspired spiking neuromorphic chips have achieved even lower power
consumption, on the order of milliwatts, while still offering real-time
processing.
  However, for deploying DNNs to energy efficient neuromorphic chips the
incompatibility between continuous neurons and synaptic weights of traditional
DNNs, discrete spiking neurons and synapses of neuromorphic chips need to be
overcome. Previous work has achieved this by training a network to learn
continuous probabilities, before it is deployed to a neuromorphic architecture,
such as IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, by random sampling these
probabilities.
  The main contribution of this paper is a new learning algorithm that learns a
TrueNorth configuration ready for deployment. We achieve this by training
directly a binary hardware crossbar that accommodates the TrueNorth axon
configuration constrains and we propose a different neuron model.
  Results of our approach trained on electroencephalogram (EEG) data show a
significant improvement with previous work (76% vs 86% accuracy) while

plasmas, the macroscopic evolution of the heliosphere is strongly affected by
the kinetic plasma physics governing fundamental microphysical mechanisms.
Kinetic turbulence, collision less magnetic reconnection, particle
acceleration, and kinetic instabilities are four poorly understood,
grand-challenge problems that lie at the new frontier of kinetic heliophysics.
The increasing availability of high cadence and high phase-space resolution
measurements of particle velocity distributions by current and upcoming
spacecraft missions and of massively parallel nonlinear kinetic simulations of
weakly collisional heliospheric plasmas provides the opportunity to transform
our understanding of these kinetic mechanisms through the full utilization of
the information contained in the particle velocity distributions. Several major
considerations for future investigations of kinetic heliophysics are examined.
Turbulent dissipation followed by particle heating is highlighted as an
inherently two-step process in weakly collisional plasmas, distinct from the
more familiar case in fluid theory. Concerted efforts must be made to tackle
the big-data challenge of visualizing the high-dimensional (3D-3V) phase space
of kinetic plasma theory through physics-based reductions. Furthermore, the
development of innovative analysis methods that utilize full velocity-space
measurements, such as the field-particle correlation technique, will enable us
to gain deeper insight into these four grand-challenge problems of kinetic
heliophysics. A systems approach to tackle the multi-scale problem of
heliophysics through a rigorous connection between the kinetic physics at
microscales and the self-consistent evolution of the heliosphere at macro
scales will propel the field of kinetic heliophysics into the future.

has been intensively studied with various methods ranging from macroscopic to

leading to economic losses, but also causes environment damages. Without
understanding of jams spatio-temporal propagation behavior in a city, it is
impossible to develop efficient mitigation strategies to control and improve
city traffic. Although some progress has been made in recent studies based on
available traffic data regarding general features of traffic, the understanding
of the spatio-temporal propagation of traffic jams in urban traffic is still
unclear. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation behavior of traffic jams
based on collected empirical traffic data in big cities. We developed a method
to identify influential jam centers and find that jams spread radially from
multiple jam centers with a range of velocities. Our findings may help to
predict and even control the traffic jam propagation, which could be helpful
for the development of future autonomous driving technology and intelligent
transportation system.

setting $dy/dt=0$, where $y$ denotes the concentration of a short-lived
intermediate subject to first-order decay with a rate constant $k$. The sole
reason for enforcing SSA is to convert the rate equation for $y$ into an
algebraic equation. The conditions under which SSA becomes trustworthy are now
well understood, but a firm grasp of the physical content of the approximation
requires more maturity than few teachers, let alone their students, may be
expected to possess. Furthermore, there is no simple way to gauge the accuracy
of the results derived by imposing SSA. The purpose of this note is to
demonstrate that a better, but equally simple, approximation results if,
instead of setting $dy/dt$ to zero, one substitutes $y(t+\tau)$ for $y+\tau
dy/dt$, where $\tau=1/k$; SSA is a cruder approximation because it neglects the
second term. For systems modelled as damped harmonic oscillators, the ""reverse
Taylor approximation"" can be extended by retaining one more term in the Taylor
expansion. The utility of the approximation (or its extension) is demonstrated
by examining the following systems: radioactive equilibria, Brownian motion,
dynamic response of linear first- and second-order systems.
