to the design of Oblivious RAM. The task of K-Oblivious Shuffling is to
obliviously shuffle N encrypted blocks that have been randomly allocated on the
server in such a way that an adversary learns nothing about the new allocation
of blocks. The security guarantee should hold also with respect to an adversary
that has learned the initial position of K touched blocks out of the N blocks.
The classical notion of Oblivious Shuffling is obtained for K = N.
  We present a family of algorithms for Oblivious Shuffling. Our first
construction, CacheShuffleRoot, is tailored for clients with $O(\sqrt{N})$
blocks of memory and uses $(4+\epsilon)N$ blocks of bandwidth, for every
$\epsilon > 0$. CacheShuffleRoot is a 4.5x improvement over previous best known
results on practical sizes of N. We also present CacheShuffle that obliviously
shuffles using O(S) blocks of client memory with $O(N\log_S N)$ blocks of
bandwidth.
  We then turn to K-Oblivious Shuffling and give algorithms that require 2N +
f(K) blocks of bandwidth, for some function f. That is, any extra bandwidth
above the 2N lower bound depends solely on K. We present KCacheShuffleBasic
that uses O(K) client storage and exactly 2N blocks of bandwidth. For smaller
client storage requirements, we show KCacheShuffle, which uses O(S) client
storage and requires $2N+(1+\epsilon)O(K\log_S K)$ blocks of bandwidth.
  Finally, we consider the case in which, in addition to the N blocks, the
server stores D dummy blocks whose content is is irrelevant but still their
positions must be hidden by the shuffling. For this case, we design algorithm
KCacheShuffleDummy that, for N + D blocks and K touched blocks, uses O(K)
client storage and $D+(2+\epsilon)N$ blocks of bandwidth.

observe two surface-resonance states above the Fermi level coexisting with a

one at $\sim$0.8 eV inside a projected bulk band gap. At the onset of the

the transient Dirac bands, in agreement with our one-step photoemission

relaxation within $\sim$0.5 ps, a process that triggers the subsequent spin
dynamics of both the Dirac cone and the low-energy state, which behave as two
dynamically-locked electron populations. We discuss the origin of this behavior
by comparing the relaxation times observed for electrons with opposite spins to
the ones obtained from a microscopic Boltzmann model of ultrafast band cooling
introduced into the photoemission calculations. Our results demonstrate that
the nonequilibrium surface dynamics is governed by electron-electron rather

of ejecta morphologies. The radioactive power of the resulting macronova is
calculated with the detailed input of decay products. We assess the detection
prospects for our most complex models, based on the portion of viewing angles
that are sufficiently bright, at different cosmological redshifts ($z$). The
brighter emission from the wind is unobscured by the lanthanides (or actinides)
in some of the models, permitting non-zero detection probabilities for
redshifts up to $z=0.07$. We also find the nuclear mass model and the resulting
radioactive heating rate are crucial for the detectability. While for the most
pessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the
ejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light
curves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic
heating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement. We conclude
that future reliable macronova observations would constrain nuclear heating
rates, and consequently help constrain nuclear mass models.

requiring days to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter

different source parameters, a fast and accurate model is essential. We present
the first surrogate model for GWs from the coalescence of BBHs including all

largest NRSur7dq2 errors to be comparable to the largest errors in the
numerical relativity simulations, and more than an order of magnitude smaller
than the errors of other waveform models. Our model, and more broadly the

radio AGN (L_1.4GHz ~ 10^{22}-10^{27} W/Hz) out to z~5. We constrained the

GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking uncertainties of the scaling
relation used into account. We thereby derived the cosmic evolution of the
kinetic luminosity density provided by the AGN and compared this luminosity
density to the radio-mode AGN feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy
Evolution (SAGE) model, i.e., to the redshift evolution of the central
supermassive black hole accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source
of heating that offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and
thereby limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that
the kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to balance
the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since z~5. However,
although our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN feedback as a
cosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy formation, many
simplifications in both the observational and semi-analytic approaches still

interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field in an external constant

provides therefore quantum corrections of any order in powers of the

expansion for the photon number is also analyzed and a law describing the
photon number time evolution is written down involving the radiation field
polarization. Since the quantum photon state Hilbert space (radiation field) is
infinite dimensional we are thus concerned in this article with the issue of

practice transcribing polyphonic music. We demonstrate that rather than
encourage dependency between activations, what is relevant for improving pitch
detection is to learnt priors that fit the frequency content of the sound
events to detect.

nonparametric estimation of conditional probability densities using neural
networks. We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear
combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training

trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular
quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with
square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on
two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling.
In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to
filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The
resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax
filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally,
our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture,
the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less
overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the

Chebyshev polynomial approximation (CPA). Many signal processing problems
require iterative application of singular value decomposition (SVD) for
minimizing the rank of a given data matrix with other cost functions and/or
constraints, which is called matrix rank minimization. In matrix rank
minimization, singular values of a matrix are shrunk by hard-thresholding,
soft-thresholding, or weighted soft-thresholding. However, the computational
cost of SVD is generally too expensive to handle high dimensional signals such
as images; hence, in this case, matrix rank minimization requires enormous
computation time. In this paper, we leverage CPA to (approximately) manipulate
singular values without computing singular values and vectors. The thresholding
of singular values is expressed by a multiplication of certain matrices, which
is derived from a characteristic of CPA. The multiplication is also efficiently
computed using the sparsity of signals. As a result, the computational cost is
significantly reduced. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our
method through several image processing applications based on matrix rank
minimization with nuclear norm relaxation in terms of computation time and
approximation precision.

service-level agreements (SLAs) are two critical factors of dynamic controller
design. In this paper, we compare two dynamic learning strategies based on a
fuzzy logic system, which learns and modifies fuzzy scaling rules at runtime. A
self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller is combined with two reinforcement
learning (RL) approaches: (i) Fuzzy SARSA learning (FSL) and (ii) Fuzzy
Q-learning (FQL). As an off-policy approach, Q-learning learns independent of
the policy currently followed, whereas SARSA as an on-policy always
incorporates the actual agent's behavior and leads to faster learning. Both
approaches are implemented and compared in their advantages and disadvantages,
here in the OpenStack cloud platform. We demonstrate that both auto-scaling
approaches can handle various load traffic situations, sudden and periodic, and
delivering resources on demand while reducing operating costs and preventing
SLA violations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSL and FQL have
acceptable performance in terms of adjusted number of virtual machine targeted

higher. We find Ly-alpha emission out to ~250 kpc in projection from the active
galactic nucleus (AGN). The emission shows arc-like morphologies arising at
150-250 kpc from the nucleus in projection with the connected filamentary
structures reaching down into the circum-nuclear region. The most distant arc
is offset by 700 km/s relative to circum-nuclear HeII 1640 emission, which we

range from 300-700 km/s. From UV line ratios, the emission on scales of 10s of
kpc from the nucleus along a wide angle in the direction of the radio jets is
clearly excited by the radio jets and ionizing radiation of the AGN. Assuming
ionization equilibrium, the more extended emission outside of the axis of the

annihilate only if their net charge vanishes, a property we refer to as
robustness. While nodal loops are usually not robust in this sense, it has
recently been shown using homotopy arguments that in the centrosymmetric
extension of the $\textrm{AI}$ symmetry class they nevertheless develop a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge analogous to the Chern number. Nodal loops carrying a
non-trivial value of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge are robust, i.e. they can be
gapped out only by a pairwise annihilation and not on their own. As this is an
additional charge independent of the Berry $\pi$-phase flowing along the band
degeneracy, such nodal loops are, in fact, doubly charged. In this manuscript,
we generalize the homotopy discussion to the centrosymmetric extensions of all
Atland-Zirnbauer classes. We develop a taylored mathematical framework dubbed
the AZ+$\mathcal{I}$ classification and show that in three spatial dimensions
such robust and multiply charged nodes appear in four of such centrosymmetric
extensions, namely AZ+$\mathcal{I}$ classes $\textrm{CI}$ and $\textrm{AI}$
lead to doubly charged nodal lines, while $\textrm{D}$ and $\textrm{BDI}$
support doubly charged nodal surfaces. We remark that no further crystalline
symmetries apart from the spatial inversion are necessary for their stability.
We provide a description of the corresponding topological charges, and develop
simple tight-binding models of various semimetallic and superconducting phases
that exhibit these nodes. We also indicate how the concept of robust and
multiply charged nodes generalizes to other spatial dimensions.

dust in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has a granular structure at
size scales from sub-um up to several hundreds of um, indicating hierarchical
growth took place across these size scales. However, these dust particles may
have been modified during their collection by the spacecraft instruments. Here
we present the results of laboratory experiments that simulate the impact of
dust on the collection surfaces of COSIMA and MIDAS, instruments onboard the
Rosetta spacecraft. We map the size and structure of the footprints left by the
dust particles as a function of their initial size (up to several hundred um)
and velocity (up to 6 m/s). We find that in most collisions, only part of the
dust particle is left on the target; velocity is the main driver of the
appearance of these deposits. A boundary between sticking/bouncing and
fragmentation as an outcome of the particle-target collision is found at v ~ 2
m/s. For velocities below this value, particles either stick and leave a single
deposit on the target plate, or bounce, leaving a shallow footprint of
monomers. At velocities > 2 m/s and sizes > 80 um, particles fragment upon
collision, transferring up to 50 per cent of their mass in a rubble-pile-like
deposit on the target plate. The amount of mass transferred increases with the
impact velocity. The morphologies of the deposits are qualitatively similar to
those found by the COSIMA instrument.

subhalos induce density gaps and distortions in on-sky path along the streams.
Accordingly, observing disrupted streams in the Galactic halo would
substantiate the hypothesis that dark matter substructure exists there, while
in contrast, observing collimated streams with smoothly varying density
profiles would place strong upper limits on the number density and mass
spectrum of subhalos. Here, we examine several measures of stream ""disruption""
and their power to distinguish between halo potentials with and without
substructure and with different global shapes. We create and evolve a
population of 1280 streams on a range of orbits in the Via Lactea II simulation
of a Milky Way-like halo, replete with a full mass range of {\Lambda}CDM
subhalos, and compare it to two control stream populations evolved in smooth
spherical and smooth triaxial potentials, respectively. We find that the number
of gaps observed in a stellar stream is a poor indicator of the halo potential,
but that (i) the thinness of the stream on-sky, (ii) the symmetry of the
leading and trailing tails, and (iii) the deviation of the tails from a
low-order polynomial path on-sky (""path regularity"") distinguish between the
three potentials more effectively. We find that globular cluster streams on
low-eccentricity orbits far from the galactic center (apocentric radius ~ 30-80
kpc) are most powerful in distinguishing between the three potentials. If they
exist, such streams will shortly be discoverable and mapped in high dimensions

$\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim(\omega^2+\pi^2T^2)^a$ with $a=1$ in the overdoped
Fermi-liquid state and $a<0.5$ in the optimal to underdoped regime. We show
that this non-Fermi-liquid scaling behavior can naturally be explained by the
presence of a scale-invariant state of matter known as unparticles. We evaluate
analytically the electron self-energy due to interactions with fermionic
unparticles. We find that, in agreement with experiments, the imaginary part of
the self-energy scales with respect to temperature and energy as
$\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim T^{2+2\alpha}$ and $\omega^{2+2\alpha}$, where
$\alpha$ is the anomalous dimension of the unparticle propagator. In addition,
the calculated occupancy and susceptibility of fermionic unparticles, unlike
those of normal fermions, have significant spectral weights even at high
energies. This unconventional behavior is attributed to the branch cut in the
unparticle propagator which broadens the unparticle spectral function over a
wide energy range and non-trivially alters the scattering phase space by
enhancing (suppressing) the intrinsic susceptibility at low energies for
negative (positive) $\alpha$. Our work presents new evidence suggesting that
unparticles might be important low-energy degrees of freedom in strongly
coupled systems such as the cuprate superconductors.

framework to directly optimize towards the reward function in structured
prediction tasks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes. RAML
incorporates task-specific reward by performing maximum-likelihood updates on
candidate outputs sampled according to an exponentiated payoff distribution,
which gives higher probabilities to candidates that are close to the reference
output. While RAML is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and its
impressive empirical successes, the theoretical properties of RAML, especially
the behavior of the exponentiated payoff distribution, has not been examined
thoroughly. In this work, we introduce softmax Q-distribution estimation, a
novel theoretical interpretation of RAML, which reveals the relation between
RAML and Bayesian decision theory. The softmax Q-distribution can be regarded
as a smooth approximation of the Bayes decision boundary, and the Bayes
decision rule is achieved by decoding with this Q-distribution. We further show
that RAML is equivalent to approximately estimating the softmax Q-distribution,
with the temperature $\tau$ controlling approximation error. We perform two
experiments, one on synthetic data of multi-class classification and one on
real data of image captioning, to demonstrate the relationship between RAML and
the proposed softmax Q-distribution estimation method, verifying our
theoretical analysis. Additional experiments on three structured prediction
tasks with rewards defined on sequential (named entity recognition), tree-based
(dependency parsing) and irregular (machine translation) structures show
notable improvements over maximum likelihood baselines.

applications in order to reduce the scanning cost and improve the patient

the motion artefacts and contrast washout. However, once an image field of view
and the desired resolution are chosen, the minimum scanning time is normally
determined by the requirement of acquiring sufficient raw data to meet the
Nyquist-Shannon sampling criteria. Compressive Sensing (CS) theory has been
perfectly matched to the MRI scanning sequence design with much less required
raw data for the image reconstruction. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning for solving various inverse problems, we propose a conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks-based deep learning framework for de-aliasing
and reconstructing MRI images from highly undersampled data with great promise
to accelerate the data acquisition process. By coupling an innovative content
loss with the adversarial loss our de-aliasing results are more realistic.
Furthermore, we propose a refinement learning procedure for training the
generator network, which can stabilise the training with fast convergence and
less parameter tuning. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods, in terms of reconstruction error and
perceptual image quality. In addition, our method can reconstruct each image in
0.22ms--0.37ms, which is promising for real-time applications.

propose a Deep Learning based approach for segmentation of the surfaces in
volumetric medical images, by learning the essential features and
transformations from training data, without any human expert intervention. We
employ a regional approach to learn the local surface profiles. The proposed
approach was evaluated on simultaneous intraretinal layer segmentation of
optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of normal retinas and retinas
affected by age related macular degeneration (AMD). The proposed approach was
validated on 40 retina OCT volumes including 20 normal and 20 AMD subjects. The
experiments showed statistically significant improvement in accuracy for our

mutual Coulomb attraction, can to great extent be understood in the framework
of the quantum-mechanical hydrogen model. This model has recently been
challenged by spectroscopic measurements on two-dimensional transition-metal
dichalchogenides that unveil strong deviations from a hydrogenic spectrum.
Here, we show that this deviation is due to the particular relativistic
character of electrons in this class of materials. Indeed, their electrons are
no longer described in terms of a Schroedinger but a massive Dirac equation
that intimately links electrons to holes. Dirac excitons therefore inherit a
relativistic quantum spin-1/2 that contributes to the angular momentum and thus
the exciton spectrum. Most saliently, the level spacing is strongly reduced as
compared to the hydrogen model, in agreement with spectroscopic measurements
and ab-initio calculations.

takes a beyond worst-case approach to the analysis of algorithms. The typical
idea is to design a clustering algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution,
provided the data satisfy a natural stability notion. For example, Bilu and
Linial (2010) and Awasthi et al. (2012) presented algorithms that output
near-optimal solutions, assuming the optimal solution is preserved under small
perturbations to the input distances. A drawback to this approach is that the
algorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and
give no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output
arbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not
satisfy the given stability notion.
  In this work, we address this concern in two ways. First, we provide
algorithms that inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation
algorithms, while simultaneously guaranteeing near-optimal solutions when the
data is stable. Our algorithms are natural modifications to existing
state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Second, we initiate the study of
local stability, which is a property of a single optimal cluster rather than an
entire optimal solution. We show our algorithms output all optimal clusters
which satisfy stability locally. Specifically, we achieve strong positive
results in our local framework under recent stability notions including metric
perturbation resilience (Angelidakis et al. 2017) and robust perturbation
resilience (Balcan and Liang 2012) for the $k$-median, $k$-means, and
symmetric/asymmetric $k$-center objectives.

that conditioning spatio-temporal interdependency on `atmospheric modes' can
further improve forecast performance. The modes are defined from the
atmospheric classification of wind and pressure fields at the surface level,
and the geopotential height field at the 500hPa level. The data fields are
extracted from the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset with an hourly temporal

self-organising maps and then clustered to optimise forecast performance. In a
case study based on 6 years of measurements from 23 weather stations in the UK,
a set of three atmospheric modes are found to be optimal for forecast
performance. The skill in the one- to six-hour-ahead forecasts is improved at
all sites compared to persistence and competitive benchmarks. Across the 23

formidable challenge. Recent research in social science indicates that it is
important to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the
interactions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium
statistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of
collective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has
proven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary
outcomes. By studying models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a
physicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However,
unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state
physics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions,
and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most
simplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often
surpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and
theoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation,
focusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of
observed solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder

scanning-and-fusion system with a commodity RGBD sensor. Our method is
learning-based, with an inference time of less than 90ms per scene and a model

HemiCNN and Grouplet, to deal with the unstructured input data from multiple

resolve the color-constancy and scale ambiguity. In addition, we have created a
large synthetic dataset, SynBRDF, which comprises a total of $500$K RGBD images
rendered with a physically-based ray tracer under a variety of natural
illumination, covering $5000$ materials and $5000$ shapes. SynBRDF is the first

problem. In this paper, we resort to Nestrov's acceleration technique to
improve the convergence performance of a class of second-order methods called
approximate Newton. We give a theoretical analysis that Nestrov's acceleration
technique can improve the convergence performance for approximate Newton just
like for first-order methods. We accordingly propose an accelerated regularized
sub-sampled Newton. Our accelerated algorithm performs much better than the
original regularized sub-sampled Newton in experiments, which validates our
theory empirically. Besides, the accelerated regularized sub-sampled Newton has
good performance comparable to or even better than state-of-art algorithms.

sharp peaks in spin structure factor at $\mathbf{Q}$s are produced by the

in-plane magnetic field cants the impurity moments toward the $ab$ plane, which
suppress the droplets of SDW order. At high fields, the long-range SDW inside

fulfill this gap by using large system analysis. Considering a system model

provides a notion of fairness under MN. Numerical results are used to validate
the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis and to show that in Massive MIMO,
non-coherent interference and noise, rather than pilot contamination, are often

to PCA the global galaxy parameters (like HI, H2, and dynamical mass, star
formation rate (SFR), near-infrared luminosity, size, and rotational velocity)
are all mutually correlated and can be reduced to a single principal component.
Further PCA performed for global and intensive (not size related) properties of
galaxies (such as gas density, and surface density of the star formation rate,
SSFR), indicates that magnetic field strength B is connected mainly to the
intensive parameters, while the global parameters have only weak relationships
with B. We find that the tightest relationship of B is with SSFR, which is
described by a power-law with an index of 0.33+-0.03. The observed weaker
associations of B with galaxy dynamical mass and the rotational velocity we
interpret as indirect ones, resulting from the observed connection of the
global SFR with the available total H2 mass in galaxies. Using our sample we
constructed a diagram of B across the Hubble sequence which reveals that high
values of B are not restricted by the Hubble type. However, weaker fields
appear exclusively in later Hubble types and B as low as about 5muG is not seen

reduction, where discriminant vectors are sought to project data to a lower
dimensional space for optimal separability of classes. Several recent papers
have outlined strategies for exploiting sparsity for using LDA with
high-dimensional data. However, many lack scalable methods for solution of the
underlying optimization problems. We propose three new numerical optimization
schemes for solving the sparse optimal scoring formulation of LDA based on
block coordinate descent, the proximal gradient method, and the alternating
direction method of multipliers. We show that the per-iteration cost of these
methods scales linearly in the dimension of the data provided restricted
regularization terms are employed, and cubically in the dimension of the data
in the worst case. Furthermore, we establish that if our block coordinate
descent framework generates convergent subsequences of iterates, then these
subsequences converge to the stationary points of the sparse optimal scoring
problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methods with empirical
results for classification of Gaussian data and data sets drawn from
benchmarking repositories, including time-series and multispectral X-ray data,
and provide Matlab and R implementations of our optimization schemes.

when the lensing galaxy has an axisymmetric lensing potential and the source
galaxy is aligned with its symmetry centre along the line of sight. Using a
Taylor expansion around the Einstein radius and eliminating the unknown source,
I derive a set of analytic equations that determine differences of the
deflection angle of the perturber weighted by the convergence of the
axisymmetric lens and ratios of the convergences at the positions of the arcs
from the measurable thickness of the arcs. In the same manner, asymmetries in
the brightness distributions along an arc determine differences in the
deflection angle of the perturber if the source has a symmetric brightness
profile and is oriented parallel to or orthogonal to the caustic. These
equations are the only model-independent information retrievable from
observations to leading order in the Taylor expansion. General constraints on
the derivatives of the perturbing lens are derived such that the perturbation
does not change the number of critical curves. To infer physical properties
such as the mass of the perturber or its position, models need to be inserted.
The same conclusions about the scale of detectable masses and model-dependent
degeneracies as in other approaches are then found and supported by analysing
B1938 as an example. Yet, the model-independent equations show that there is a
fundamental degeneracy between the main lens and the perturber that can only be
broken if their relative position is known. This explains the degeneracies
between lens models already found in simulations from a more general viewpoint.
Depending on the properties of the pertuber, this degeneracy can be broken by
characterising the surrounding of the lens or by measuring the time delay
between quasar images embedded in the perturbed Einstein ring of the host
galaxy.

the inputs follow a distribution. For the one-sided matching problem,
\citet{FFZ:14} show that, amongst all truthful mechanisms, \emph{random

We prove that, despite of this worst-case bound, random priority has a
\emph{constant smoothed approximation ratio}. This is, to our limited
knowledge, the first work that asymptotically differentiates the smoothed
approximation ratio from the worst-case approximation ratio for mechanism
design problems. For the average-case, we show that our approximation ratio can
be improved to $1+e$. These results partially explain why random priority has
been successfully used in practice, although in the worst case the optimal

high quality images by VAE, we increase the capacity of decoder network by
employing residual blocks and skip connections, which also enable efficient
optimization. To overcome the limitation of L2 loss, we propose to generate
images in a multi-stage manner from coarse to fine. In the simplest case, the
proposed multi-stage VAE divides the decoder into two components in which the
second component generates refined images based on the course images generated
by the first component. Since the second component is independent of the VAE
model, it can employ other loss functions beyond the L2 loss and different
model architectures. The proposed framework can be easily generalized to
contain more than two components. Experiment results on the MNIST and CelebA
datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage VAE can generate sharper

to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data
points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to
generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a
result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box
attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well
as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity
of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble
Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with

method allows transitioning between non-convex and convex losses by the choice

becomes smaller than the temperature $t_2$ of the exponential, the surrogate
loss becomes ''quasi convex''. Various tunings of the temperatures recover
previous methods and tuning the degree of non-convexity is crucial in the
experiments. In particular, quasi-convexity and boundedness of the loss provide
significant robustness to the outliers. We explain this by showing that $t_1 <

on deep neural networks misclassify every adversarially modified test example.
The design of general defense strategies against a wide range of such attacks
still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we draw inspiration from
the fields of cybersecurity and multi-agent systems and propose to leverage the
concept of Moving Target Defense (MTD) in designing a meta-defense for
'boosting' the robustness of an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs) for
visual classification tasks against such adversarial attacks. To classify an
input image, a trained network is picked randomly from this set of networks by
formulating the interaction between a Defender (who hosts the classification
networks) and their (Legitimate and Malicious) users as a Bayesian Stackelberg
Game (BSG). We empirically show that this approach, MTDeep, reduces
misclassification on perturbed images in various datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, and ImageNet while maintaining high classification accuracy on
legitimate test images. We then demonstrate that our framework, being the first
meta-defense technique, can be used in conjunction with any existing defense
mechanism to provide more resilience against adversarial attacks that can be
afforded by these defense mechanisms. Lastly, to quantify the increase in
robustness of an ensemble-based classification system when we use MTDeep, we
analyze the properties of a set of DNNs and introduce the concept of
differential immunity that formalizes the notion of attack transferability.

commons that is at the center of many theories on the evolution of cooperation.
We establish the tragedy in the context of a general chemostat model with two
species, the cooperator and the cheater. Both species have the same growth rate
function and yield constant, but the cooperator allocates a portion of the
nutrient uptake towards the production of a public good -the ""Commons"" in the
Tragedy- which is needed to digest the externally supplied nutrient. The
cheater on the other hand does not produce this enzyme, and allocates all
nutrient uptake towards its own growth. We prove that when the cheater is
present initially, both the cooperator and the cheater will eventually go
extinct, hereby confirming the occurrence of the tragedy. We also show that
without the cheater, the cooperator can survive indefinitely, provided that at
least a low level of public good or processed nutrient is available initially.
Our results provide a predictive framework for the analysis of
cooperator-cheater dynamics in a powerful model system of experimental
evolution.

non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these
local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function

that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer

attention, recently, because of the nonsaturating extremely large

predictions of likely type-II Weyl semimetals. Contrary to the topological
insulators or Dirac semimetals where XMR is linearly dependent on the field, in
WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ the XMR is nonlinearly dependent on the field, suggesting
an entirely different mechanism. Electron-hole compensation has been proposed
as a mechanism of this nonsaturating XMR in WTe$_2$, while it is yet to be
clear in the case of MoTe$_2$ which has an identical crystal structure of
WTe$_2$ at low temperatures. In this paper, we report low-energy electronic
structure and Fermi surface topology of MoTe$_2$ using angle-resolved
photoemission spectrometry (ARPES) technique and first-principle calculations,
and compare them with that of WTe$_2$ to understand the mechanism of XMR. Our
measurements demonstrate that MoTe$_2$ is an uncompensated semimetal, contrary
to WTe$_2$ in which compensated electron-hole pockets have been identified,
ruling out the applicability of charge compensation theory for the

applicability of the existing other conjectures on the XMR of these compounds.

frequencies and include logarithmic perturbations of the power-law profiles.
The bath and the correlation energy alternately increase or decrease,
monotonically, over long times, according to the value of the ohmicity
parameter, following logarithmic and power laws. Consider initial conditions
such that the environment is in a thermal state, factorized from the state of
the qubit. In the super-ohmic regime the long-time features of the information
flow are transferred to the bath and correlation energy, by changing the
initial condition from the factorized to the specially correlated, even with
different temperatures. In fact, the low-frequency structures of the spectral
density that provide information backflow with the factorized initial

specially correlated initial configuration. By performing the same change of
initial conditions, the spectral properties providing information loss, produce
decrease (increase) of the bath (correlation) energy.

training data for binary classification. The graph may be given or constructed
using similarity measures among nodal features. Leveraging the graph for
classification builds on the premise that labels across neighboring nodes are
correlated according to a categorical Markov random field (MRF). This model is
further relaxed to a Gaussian (G)MRF with labels taking continuous values - an
approximation that not only mitigates the combinatorial complexity of the
categorical model, but also offers optimal unbiased soft predictors of the
unlabeled nodes. The proposed sampling strategy is based on querying the node
whose label disclosure is expected to inflict the largest change on the GMRF,
and in this sense it is the most informative on average. Such a strategy
subsumes several measures of expected model change, including uncertainty
sampling, variance minimization, and sampling based on the $\Sigma-$optimality
criterion. A simple yet effective heuristic is also introduced for increasing
the exploration capabilities of the sampler, and reducing bias of the resultant
classifier, by taking into account the confidence on the model label
predictions. The novel sampling strategies are based on quantities that are
readily available without the need for model retraining, rendering them
computationally efficient and scalable to large graphs. Numerical tests using
synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve accuracy
that is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art even at reduced runtime.

positive and negative inputs of triplet loss from each multi-tuple. We show
that this scheme improves the training performance. Furthermore, we introduce a
new weight layer to automatically select suitable combination weights, which
will avoid the conflict between triplet and pair loss leading to worse

introduces the auxiliary inference divergence estimator (AIDE), an algorithm

on the observation that inference algorithms can be treated as probabilistic

viewed as auxiliary variables. This view leads to a new estimator for the
symmetric KL divergence between the approximating distributions of two
inference algorithms. The paper illustrates application of AIDE to algorithms
for inference in regression, hidden Markov, and Dirichlet process mixture

broad class of inference algorithms and can detect failure modes of inference
algorithms that are missed by standard heuristics.

network) overlaid with an ambient RF energy harvesting IoT network (secondary
network). The nodes in the secondary network are assumed to be solely powered
by ambient RF energy harvested from the transmissions of the primary network.
We assume that the secondary nodes can eavesdrop on the primary transmissions
due to which the primary network uses secrecy guard zones. The primary
transmitter goes silent if any secondary receiver is detected within its guard
zone. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of
successful connection of the primary network as well as the probability of
secure communication. Two conditions must be jointly satisfied in order to
ensure successful connection: (i) the SINR at the primary receiver is above a
predefined threshold, and (ii) the primary transmitter is not silent. In order
to ensure secure communication, the SINR value at each of the secondary nodes
should be less than a predefined threshold. Clearly, when more secondary nodes
are deployed, more primary transmitters will remain silent for a given guard
zone radius, thus impacting the amount of energy harvested by the secondary
network. Our results concretely show the existence of an optimal deployment
density for the secondary network that maximizes the density of nodes that are
able to harvest sufficient amount of energy. Furthermore, we show the
dependence of this optimal deployment density on the guard zone radius of the
primary network. In addition, we show that the optimal guard zone radius
selected by the primary network is a function of the deployment density of the
secondary network. This interesting coupling between the two networks is
studied using tools from game theory. Overall, this work is one of the few
concrete works that symbiotically merge tools from stochastic geometry and game
theory.

recurrent module iteratively refines the segmentation results, leveraging the
depth and semantic predictions from the previous iterations.
  Through extensive experiments on four popular large-scale RGB-D datasets, we
demonstrate this approach achieves competitive semantic segmentation
performance with a model which is substantially more compact. We carry out
extensive analysis of this architecture including variants that operate on
monocular RGB but use depth as side-information during training, unsupervised
gating as a generic attentional mechanism, and multi-resolution gating. We find
that gated pooling for joint semantic segmentation and depth yields

considered about 3,000 high-quality spectra from two instrumental set-ups
centred on 760 and 860 nm, which cover about 380 nm each. These data allowed us
to measure line intensities for several OH bands in order to derive band
intensities and rotational temperatures for different upper vibrational levels
as a function of solar activity and observing date. The results were compared
with those derived from emission and temperature profile data of the radiometer
SABER on the TIMED satellite taken in the Cerro Paranal area between 2002 and
2015. In agreement with the SABER data, the long-term variations in OH
intensity and temperature derived from the UVES data are dominated by the solar
cycle, whereas secular trends appear to be negligible. Combining the UVES and
SABER results, the solar cycle effects for the OH intensity and temperature are
about 12 to 17% and 4 to 5 K per 100 sfu and do not significantly depend on the
selected OH band. The data also reveal that variations of the effective OH
emission layer height and air density can cause significant changes in the OH
rotational temperatures due to a varying ratio of OH thermalising collisions by
air molecules and OH radiation, deactivation, and destruction processes which
impede the rotational relaxation. However, this effect appears to be of minor
importance for the explanation of the rotational temperature variations related
to the solar activity cycle, which causes only small changes in the OH emission
profile.

skills throughout their lifetimes and continuously improve those skills via
experience. A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic
forgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned
information. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed
that catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity,
which can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters
of nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show
that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able
to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby
leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. We
introduce diffusion-based neuromodulation, which simulates the release of
diffusing, neuromodulatory chemicals within an ANN that can modulate (i.e. up
or down regulate) learning in a spatial region. On the simple diagnostic
problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces
task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific
localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and
3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting. Overall,
our results suggest that diffusion-based neuromodulation promotes task-specific
localized learning and functional modularity, which can help solve the
challenging, but important problem of catastrophic forgetting.

matter that lie between crystals and liquids. Hyperuniform systems have
attracted recent attention because they are endowed with novel transport and
optical properties. Recently, the hyperuniformity concept has been generalized
to characterize scalar fields, two-phase media and random vector fields. In
this paper, we devise methods to explicitly construct hyperuniform scalar
fields. We investigate explicitly spatial patterns generated from Gaussian
random fields, which have been used to model the microwave background radiation
and heterogeneous materials, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for spinodal
decomposition, and Swift-Hohenberg equations that have been used to model
emergent pattern formation, including Rayleigh-B{\' e}nard convection. We show
that the Gaussian random scalar fields can be constructed to be hyperuniform.
We also numerically study the time evolution of spinodal decomposition patterns
and demonstrate that these patterns are hyperuniform in the scaling regime.
Moreover, we find that labyrinth-like patterns generated by the Swift-Hohenberg
equation are effectively hyperuniform. We show that thresholding a hyperuniform
Gaussian random field to produce a two-phase random medium tends to destroy the
hyperuniformity of the progenitor scalar field. We then propose guidelines to
achieve effectively hyperuniform two-phase media derived from thresholded
non-Gaussian fields. Our investigation paves the way for new research
directions to characterize the large-structure spatial patterns that arise in
physics, chemistry, biology and ecology. Moreover, our theoretical results are
expected to guide experimentalists to synthesize new classes of hyperuniform
materials with novel physical properties via coarsening processes and using
state-of-the-art techniques, such as stereolithography and 3D printing.

$V$ is the well known P{\""o}schl-Teller potential which we allow to be
repulsive as well as attractive. Using energy landscape methods, linear
stability analysis as well as a time dependent variational approximation, we
derive consistent analytic results for the domains of instability of these new
exact solutions as a function of the strength of the external potential and
$\kappa$. For the repulsive potential (and $g=+1$) we show that there is a
translational instability which can be understood in terms of the energy
landscape as a function of a stretching parameter and a translation parameter
being a saddle near the exact solution. In this case, numerical simulations
show that if we start with the exact solution, the initial wave function breaks
into two pieces traveling in opposite directions. If we explore the slightly
perturbed solution situations, a 1\% change in initial conditions can change
significantly the details of how the wave function breaks into two separate
pieces. For the attractive potential (and $g=+1$), changing the initial
conditions by 1 \% modifies the domain of stability only slightly. For the case
of the attractive potential and negative $g$ perturbed solutions merely
oscillate with the oscillation frequencies predicted by the variational
approximation.

performs poorly when it comes to throughput and adaptability to network

IoT scenarios, such as an LLN with high-speed sensor data streams and mobile
sensing devices. To address this issue, we develop BRPL, an extension of RPL,
providing a practical approach that allows users to smoothly combine any RPL
Object Function (OF) with backpressure routing. BRPL uses two novel algorithms,
QuickTheta and QuickBeta, to support time-varying data traffic loads and node
mobility respectively. We implement BRPL on Contiki OS, an open-source
operating system for the Internet of Things. We conduct an extensive evaluation
using both real-world experiments based on the FIT IoT-LAB testbed and
large-scale simulations using Cooja over 18 virtual servers on the Cloud. The
evaluation results demonstrate that BRPL not only is fully backward compatible
with RPL (i.e. devices running RPL and BRPL can work together seamlessly), but
also significantly improves network throughput and adaptability to changes in
network topologies and data traffic loads. The observed packet loss reduction
in mobile networks is, at a minimum, 60% and up to 1000% can be seen in extreme

total gas fractions of these galaxies, with little correlation between gas
fractions and specific star formation rates. The bottleneck or limiting factor
in the growth of early galaxies is in converting infalling gas to cold
star-forming gas. Thus, we find that the majority of high redshift dwarf
galaxies are effectively in recession, with demand (of star formation) never
rising to meet supply (of gas), irrespective of the baryonic feedback physics
modelled. We conclude that the basic assumption of self-regulation in galaxies
- that they can adjust total gas consumption within a Hubble time - does not
apply for the dwarf galaxies thought to be responsible for providing most UV
photons to reionize the high redshift Universe. We demonstrate how this rapid
molecular time-scale improves agreement between semi-analytic model predictions

investigated to shed light on unexplored quantum-mechanical effects in the

One examines time signals attributed to an induced charge density of an ionic

the signals; this frequency corresponds to the peak electric-field of the
pulse. It is found that at specific $\Omega_{0cv}$'s where the energy of
plasmon caused by photoexcited carriers coincides with the longitudinal-optical
phonon energy, the energetically {\it resonant } interaction between these two
modes leads to striking anticrossings, revealing irregular oscillations with
anomalously enhanced amplitudes in the observed time signals. Also, the
oscillatory pattern is subject to the Rabi flopping of the excited carrier
density that is controlled by $\Omega_{0cv}$. These findings show that the

process models have become widely deployed statistical tools for researchers to
better understand the complex nature of spatial and temporal variability.
However, fitting hierarchical spatiotemporal models often involves expensive
matrix computations with complexity increasing in cubic order for the number of

large data sets. This article offers a focused review of two methods for
constructing well-defined highly scalable spatiotemporal stochastic processes.
Both these processes can be used as ""priors"" for spatiotemporal random fields.
The first approach constructs a low-rank process operating on a
lower-dimensional subspace. The second approach constructs a Nearest-Neighbor
Gaussian Process (NNGP) that ensures sparse precision matrices for its finite
realizations. Both processes can be exploited as a scalable prior embedded
within a rich hierarchical modeling framework to deliver full Bayesian

glossy objects have been proposed, they do not truly scale to all possible
frequencies and high sampling rates without trading storage, glossiness, or

the fact that current approaches are limited to precomputed radiance transfer
(PRT), which is prohibitively expensive in terms of memory requirements and
real-time rendering when both varying light and viewpoint changes are required
together with high sampling rates for high frequency lighting of glossy
material. On the other hand, current methods cannot handle object rotation,
which is one of the paramount issues for all PRT methods using wavelets. This
latter problem arises because the precomputed data are defined in a global
coordinate system and encoded in the wavelet domain, while the object is
rotated in a local coordinate system. At the root of all the above problems is
the lack of efficient run-time solution to the nontrivial problem of rotating

algorithms to achieve leader-follower consensus for a network of Euler-Lagrange
agents. We firstly propose two model-independent algorithms for a subclass of
Euler-Lagrange agents without the vector of gravitational potential forces. By
model-independent, we mean that each agent can execute its algorithm with no
knowledge of the agent self-dynamics. A variable-gain algorithm is employed
when the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a
fully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous
work concerning event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is
directed, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be
centrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities which require
limited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics,
bounds on network topology information and bounds on the initial conditions.
When the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics which include the vector of
gravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed which
requires more information about the agent dynamics but can estimate uncertain
agent parameters.
  For each algorithm, a trigger function is proposed to govern the event update
times. At each event, the controller is updated, which ensures that the control
input is piecewise constant and saves energy resources. We analyse each
controllers and trigger function and exclude Zeno behaviour. Extensive
simulations show 1) the advantages of our proposed trigger function as compared
to those in existing literature, and 2) the effectiveness of our proposed
controllers.

quantum graphs. The well-known conjecture by Bethe and Sommerfeld (1933) says
that the number of open spectral gaps for a system periodic in more than one
direction is finite. To the date its validity is established for numerous
systems, however, it is known that quantum graphs do not comply with this law
as their spectra have typically infinitely many gaps, or no gaps at all. These
facts gave rise to the question about the existence of quantum graphs with the
`Bethe-Sommerfeld property', that is, featuring a nonzero finite number of gaps
in the spectrum. In this paper we prove that the said property is impossible
for graphs with the vertex couplings which are either scale-invariant or
associated to scale-invariant ones in a particular way. On the other hand, we
demonstrate that quantum graphs with a finite number of open gaps do indeed
exist. We illustrate this phenomenon on an example of a rectangular lattice
with a $\delta$ coupling at the vertices and a suitable irrational ratio of the
edges. Our result allows to find explicitly a quantum graph with any prescribed
exact number of gaps, which is the first such example to the date.

connective, positive Kleene iteration. For this new operation, following its
natural interpretation, we present two lines of calculi. The first one is a
fragment of infinitary action logic and includes an omega-rule for introducing
iteration to the antecedent. We also consider a version with infinite (but
finitely branching) derivations and prove equivalence of these two versions. In
Kleene algebras, this line of calculi corresponds to the *-continuous case. For
the second line, we restrict our infinite derivations to cyclic (regular) ones.
We show that this system is equivalent to a variant of action logic that
corresponds to general residuated Kleene algebras, not necessarily
*-continuous. Finally, we show that, in contrast with the case without division
operations (considered by Kozen), the first system is strictly stronger than
the second one. To prove this, we use a complexity argument. Namely, we show,
using methods of Buszkowski and Palka, that the first system is $\Pi_1^0$-hard,
and therefore is not recursively enumerable and cannot be described by a
calculus with finite derivations.

has the merit of being free from uncertainties about the isomer level energy.
However, it requires higher time resolution and shorter tail in the response

the short lifetime of the 29.19-keV state. We have fabricated an X-ray detector
system which has a time resolution of 56 ps and a shorter tail function than

electronic scattering signal by the implemented detector system. The half-life

better precision by a factor three than that reported to date.

\sum_{n\leq x} a(pn)\overline{a(qn)} = {\rm o}(x),~\text{for all distinct

asteroseismic scaling relations. These relations provide a direct link between
observables, i.e. effective temperature and characteristics of the oscillation
spectra, and stellar properties, i.e. mean density and surface gravity (thus
mass and radius). These scaling relations are commonly used to characterize
large samples of stars. Usually, the Sun is used as a reference from which the
structure is scaled. However, for stars that do not have a similar structure as
the Sun, using the Sun as a reference introduces systematic errors as large as
10\% in mass and 5\% in radius. Several alternatives for the reference of the
scaling relation involving the large frequency separation (typical frequency
difference between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial order) have
been suggested in the literature. In a previous paper, we presented a reference
function with a dependence on both effective temperature and metallicity. The
accuracy of predicted masses and radii improved considerably when using
reference values calculated from our reference function. However, the residuals
indicated that stars on the red-giant branch possess a mass dependence that was
not accounted for. Here, we present a reference function for the scaling
relation involving the large frequency separation that includes the mass
dependence. This new reference function improves the derived masses and radii
significantly by removing the systematic differences and mitigates the trend
with $\nu_{\rm max}$ (frequency of maximum oscillation power) that exists when
using the solar value as a reference.

resistivity and heat capacity measurements show that the Kondo-driven

described by van der Waals equation of state is not the hypothesis and it is
the consequence of the thermodynamic conditions of liquid-vapor phase
equilibrium. It is also shown that the thermodynamic conditions of liquid-vapor
phase equilibrium of the fluid give equalities to zero of first and second
partial derivatives at constant temperature of pressure with respect to volume
at critical point which are usual conditions of existence of critical point.

achieve efficient hole injection from metals to ultra-wide band gap AlGaN, and
we show that UV-reflective aluminum (Al) layers can be used for hole injection
into p-AlGaN. The dependence of tunneling on the work function of the metal was
investigated, and it was found that highly reflective Al metal layers can
enable efficient hole injection into p-AlGaN, despite the relatively low work
function of Al. Efficient tunneling hole injection was confirmed by light
emission at 326 nm with on-wafer peak external quantum efficiency and wall-plug
efficiency of 2.65% and 1.55%, respectively. A high power density of 83.7 W/cm2
was measured at 1200 kA/cm2. The metal/semiconductor tunnel junction structure
demonstrated here could provide significant advantages for efficient and
manufacturable device topologies for high power UV emitters.

"1705.08494","Tao Sun","Tao Sun, Robert Hannah, Wotao Yin","Asynchronous Coordinate Descent under More Realistic Assumptions",,,,,"math.OC math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asynchronous-parallel algorithms have the potential to vastly speed up
algorithms by eliminating costly synchronization. However, our understanding to
these algorithms is limited because the current convergence of asynchronous
(block) coordinate descent algorithms are based on somewhat unrealistic
assumptions. In particular, the age of the shared optimization variables being
used to update a block is assumed to be independent of the block being updated.
Also, it is assumed that the updates are applied to randomly chosen blocks. In
this paper, we argue that these assumptions either fail to hold or will imply
less efficient implementations. We then prove the convergence of
asynchronous-parallel block coordinate descent under more realistic
assumptions, in particular, always without the independence assumption. The
analysis permits both the deterministic (essentially) cyclic and random rules
for block choices. Because a bound on the asynchronous delays may or may not be
available, we establish convergence for both bounded delays and unbounded
delays. The analysis also covers nonconvex, weakly convex, and strongly convex
functions. We construct Lyapunov functions that directly model both objective
progress and delays, so delays are not treated errors or noise. A
continuous-time ODE is provided to explain the construction at a high level.

of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mill theory with gauge field of magnetic Wu-Yang
type and a cosmological constant. We consider the logarithmic corrected entropy
in order to analyze the thermal fluctuations corresponding to non-minimal RBH
thermodynamics. In this scenario, we develop various important thermodynamical
quantities such as entropy, pressure, specific heats, Gibb's free energy and
Helmothz free energy. We investigate first law of thermodynamics in the
presence of logarithmic corrected entropy and non-minimal RBH. We also discuss
the stability of this RBH using various frameworks such as $\gamma$ factor
(comprises of ratio of heat capacities), phase transition, grand canonical
ensemble and canonical ensemble. It is observed that the non-minimal RBH
becomes more globally and locally stable if we increase the value of
cosmological constant.

Lipschitz type estimates in any Schatten--von Neumann norm $\boldsymbol S_p$,
$1\le p\le\infty$, for arbitrary functions in the Besov class
