provides an important approach to shed light on the nuclear dynamics leading to
the formation of superheavy elements. In particular, we discuss studying
quasifission dynamics and calculating ingredients for compound nucleus
formation probability calculations. We also discuss possible extensions to TDHF
to address the distribution of observables.

political science and communication networks) can be modeled as dynamic
networks with nodes representing entities of interest and edges representing
interactions among the entities at different points in time. A common
representation for such models is the snapshot model - where a network is
defined at logical time-stamps. An important problem under this model is change
point detection. In this work we devise an effective and efficient
three-step-approach for detecting change points in dynamic networks under the
snapshot model. Our algorithm achieves up to 9X speedup over the
state-of-the-art while improving quality on both synthetic and real world
networks.

from Ni metal in an energy range spanning the K_beta, valence-to-core, and
double-ionization (DI) satellites that appear beyond the single-particle Fermi
level. We make special use of a laboratory-based x-ray spectrometer capable of
both x-ray emission and x-ray absorption measurements to accurately align the
XES and x-ray absorption spectra to a common energy scale. The careful
alignment of energy scales is requisite for correction of the strong sample
absorption of DI fluorescence above the Ni K-edge energy. The successful
correction of absorption effects allows a determination of the branching ratios
for the [1s3d], [1s3p], [1s2p] and [1s2s] satellites with respect to their
corresponding diagram lines. We compare our results with other work, finding
good agreement with prior experiments and with theoretical calculations in the
multi-configuration Dirac-Fock framework.

  Networks","31 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Arrow protocol is a simple and elegant protocol to coordinate exclusive
access to a shared object in a network. The protocol solves the underlying
distributed queueing problem by using path reversal on a pre-computed spanning
tree (or any other tree topology simulated on top of the given network).
  It is known that the Arrow protocol solves the problem with a competitive
ratio of O(log D) on trees of diameter D. This implies a distributed queueing
algorithm with competitive ratio O(s*log D) for general networks with a
spanning tree of diameter D and stretch s. In this work we show that when
running the Arrow protocol on top of the well-known probabilistic tree
embedding of Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC 03], we obtain a randomized
distributed queueing algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(log n) even on
general network topologies. The result holds even if the queueing requests
occur in an arbitrarily dynamic and concurrent fashion and even if
communication is asynchronous. From a technical point of view, the main of the
paper shows that the competitive ratio of the Arrow protocol is constant on a
special family of tree topologies, known as hierarchically well separated
trees.

human hands and objects. Given an image frame, the goal is to predict what
objects will appear in the future frame (e.g., 5 seconds later) and where they
will be located at, even when they are not visible in the current frame. The
key idea is that (1) an intermediate representation of a convolutional object
recognition model abstracts scene information in its frame and that (2) we can
predict (i.e., regress) such representations corresponding to the future frames
based on that of the current frame. We design a new two-stream convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture for videos by extending the state-of-the-art
convolutional object detection network, and present a new fully convolutional
regression network for predicting future scene representations. Our experiments
confirm that combining the regressed future representation with our detection
network allows reliable estimation of future hands and objects in videos. We
obtain much higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art future object
presence forecast method on a public dataset.

shape qualitatively---to develop the use of a geometrical/topological
""invariant'' (the Morse--Smale complex) relating image structure with surface
structure. Differences across individuals are minimal near certain
configurations such as ridges and boundaries, and it is these configurations
that are often represented in line drawings. In particular, we introduce a
method for inferring a qualitative three-dimensional shape from shading
patterns that link the shape-from-shading inference with shape-from-contour
inference. For a given shape, certain shading patches approach ""line drawings''
in a well-defined limit. Under this limit, and invariably with respect to
rendering choices, these shading patterns provide a qualitative description of
the surface. We further show that, under this model, the contours partition the
surface into meaningful parts using the Morse--Smale complex. These critical
contours are the (perceptually) stable parts of this complex and are invariant
over a wide class of rendering models. Intuitively, our main result shows that
critical contours partition smooth surfaces into bumps and valleys, in effect
providing a scaffold on the image from which a full surface can be
interpolated.

amount only up to $y_{PP+PV}=(0.21\pm0.07)\%$, a prediction more precise than
those previously obtained in the literature, and much lower than the

Eve, overhears the transmissions. Our goal is to maximize the sum secrecy rate
(SSR) of the bidirectional transmissions by optimizing the transmit covariance

develop an alternating difference-of-concave (ADC) programming approach to
alternately optimize the transmit covariance matrices at Alice and Bob. We show
that the ADC iteration has a semi-closed-form beamforming solution, and is
guaranteed to converge to a stationary solution of the SSRM problem. Besides
the SSRM design, this paper also deals with a robust SSRM transmit design under
a moment-based random channel state information (CSI) model, where only some
roughly estimated first and second-order statistics of Eve's CSI are available,
but the exact distribution or other high-order statistics is not known. This
moment-based error model is new and different from the widely used

probability-constrained SSRM problem. By leveraging the Lagrangian duality
theory and DC programming, a tractable safe solution to the robust SSRM problem
is derived. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed designs are
demonstrated through simulations.

the deuteron at the electron accelerator facility MAMI in Mainz, Germany. The
experiment used a circularly polarized photon beam and a longitudinally
polarized deuterated butanol target. The reaction products, recoil nucleons and
decay photons from the $\pi^0$ meson were detected with the Crystal Ball and
TAPS electromagnetic calorimeters. Effects from nuclear Fermi motion were
removed by a kinematic reconstruction of the $\pi^{0}N$ final state. A
comparison to data measured with a free proton target showed that the absolute
scale of the cross sections is significantly modified by nuclear final-state

section corrected for FSI effects under the assumption that the FSI effects are
similar for neutrons and protons.

that in the nanometer-scale junction electrons are trapped in states that

called the $\left( \beta, \varpi \right)$-stability, and use it as a new
perspective to build the general theory for cross-validation. The $\left(
\beta, \varpi \right)$-stability mathematically connects the generalization
ability and the stability of the cross-validated model via the Rademacher
complexity. Our result reveals mathematically the effect of cross-validation
from two sides: on one hand, cross-validation picks the model with the best
empirical generalization ability by validating all the alternatives on test
sets; on the other hand, cross-validation may compromise the stability of the
model selection by causing subsampling error. Moreover, the difference between
training and test errors in q\textsuperscript{th} round, sometimes referred to
as the generalization error, might be autocorrelated on q. Guided by the ideas
above, the $\left( \beta, \varpi \right)$-stability help us derivd a new class
of Rademacher bounds, referred to as the one-round/convoluted Rademacher
bounds, for the stability of cross-validation in both the i.i.d.\ and
non-i.i.d.\ cases. For both light-tail and heavy-tail losses, the new bounds
quantify the stability of the one-round/average test error of the
cross-validated model in terms of its one-round/average training error, the
sample sizes $n$, number of folds $K$, the tail property of the loss (encoded
as Orlicz-$\Psi_\nu$ norms) and the Rademacher complexity of the model class

the results for the 2X2 MIMO channel with i.i.d. links. We show that having

the noncoherent MIMO channel with i.i.d. links, the traditional method of
training each transmit antenna independently is degrees of freedom (DoF)

  We first study single-message broadcast algorithms in noisy radio networks
and show that the Decay algorithm [Bar-Yehuda et al., 1992] remains robust in
the noisy model while the diameter-linear algorithm of Gasieniec et al., 2007
does not. We give a modified version of the algorithm of Gasieniec et al., 2007
that is robust to sender and receiver faults, and extend both this modified
algorithm and the Decay algorithm to robust multi-message broadcast algorithms.
  We next investigate the extent to which (network) coding improves throughput
in noisy radio networks. We address the previously perplexing result of Alon et
al. 2014 that worst case coding throughput is no better than worst case routing
throughput up to constants: we show that the worst case throughput performance
of coding is, in fact, superior to that of routing -- by a $\Theta(\log(n))$
gap -- provided receiver faults are introduced. However, we show that any
coding or routing scheme for the noiseless setting can be transformed to be
robust to sender faults with only a constant throughput overhead. These
transformations imply that the results of Alon et al., 2014 carry over to noisy
radio networks with sender faults.

perturbations (inclusion) from a known background conductivity is typically
reconstructed from idealized continuum data modelled by a Neumann-to-Dirichlet

inclusions, where the conductivity distribution has both more and less
conductive parts relative to the background conductivity; one such method is
the monotonicity method of Harrach, Seo, and Ullrich. We formulate the method
for irregular indefinite inclusions, meaning that we make no regularity
assumptions on the conductivity perturbations nor on the inclusion boundaries.
We show, provided that the perturbations are bounded away from zero, that the
outer support of the positive and negative parts of the inclusions can be
reconstructed independently. Moreover, we formulate a regularization scheme
that applies to a class of approximative measurement models, including the
Complete Electrode Model, hence making the method robust against modelling
error and noise. In particular, we demonstrate that for a convergent family of
approximative models there exists a sequence of regularization parameters such
that the outer shape of the inclusions is asymptotically exactly characterized.
Finally, a peeling-type reconstruction algorithm is presented and, for the

gained an enormous amount of attention from both academia and industry. SRAM
PUF is among one of the popular silicon PUF constructions that exploits random
initial power-up states from SRAM cells to extract hardware intrinsic secrets
for identification and key generation applications. The advantage of SRAM PUFs
is that they are widely embedded into commodity devices, thus such a PUF is
obtained without a custom design and virtually free of implementation costs. A
phenomenon known as `aging' alters the consistent
reproducibility---reliability---of responses that can be extracted from a
readout of a set of SRAM PUF cells. Similar to how a PUF exploits undesirable
manufacturing randomness for generating a hardware intrinsic fingerprint, SRAM
PUF unreliability induced by aging can be exploited to detect recycled
commodity devices requiring no additional cost to the device. In this context,
the SRAM PUF itself acts as an aging sensor by exploiting responses sensitive
to aging. We use SRAMs available in pervasively deployed commercial
off-the-shelf micro-controllers for experimental validations, which complements
recent work demonstrated in FPGA platforms, and we present a simplified
detection methodology along experimental results. We show that less than 1,000

stationary, compact solutions, even in the absence of disorder and
nonlinearity. These compact solutions are related to the existence of flat
dispersion curves (bands). Nonlinearity can destabilize such compactons. One
common flat-band-generating system is the 1D cross-stitch model, in which
compactons were shown to exist for the photonic lattice with Kerr nonlinearity.
The compactons exist there already in the linear regime and are not generally
destructed by that nonlinearity. Smooth nonlinearity of this kind does not
allow doing a complete stability analysis for this chain. We consider a
discrete mechanical system with flat dispersion bands, in which the
nonlinearity exists due to impact constraints. There, one can use the concept
of the saltation matrix for the analytic construction of the monodromy matrix.
Besides, we consider a smooth nonlinear lattice with linearly connected
massless boxes, each containing two symmetric anharmonic oscillators. In this
model, the flat bands and discrete compactons also readily emerge. This system
also permits performing comprehensive stability analysis, at least in the
anti-continuum limit, due to the reduced number of degrees-of-freedom. In both
systems, there exist two types of localization. The first one is the complete
localization, and the second one is the more common exponential localization.
The latter type is associated with discrete breathers (DBs). Two principal
mechanisms for the loss of stability are revealed. The first one is the
possible internal instability of the symmetric and/or antisymmetric solution in
the individual unit cell of the chain. One can interpret this instability
pattern as internal resonance between the compacton and the DB. The other
mechanism is global instability related to resonance of the stationary solution
with the propagation frequencies.

the posterior as the minimizer of a functional. The variational viewpoint is
far from new and is at the heart of popular methods for posterior
approximation. However, some of its consequences seem largely unexplored. We
focus on the following one: defining the posterior as the minimizer of a
functional gives a natural path towards the posterior by moving in the
direction of steepest descent of the functional. This idea is made precise
through the theory of gradient flows, allowing to bring new tools to the study
of Bayesian models and algorithms. Since the posterior may be characterized as
the minimizer of different functionals, several variational formulations may be
considered. We study three of them and their three associated gradient flows.
We show that, in all cases, the rate of convergence of the flows to the
posterior can be bounded by the geodesic convexity of the functional to be
minimized. Each gradient flow naturally suggests a nonlinear diffusion with the
posterior as invariant distribution. These diffusions may be discretized to
build proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. By
construction, the diffusions are guaranteed to satisfy a certain optimality
condition, and rates of convergence are given by the convexity of the
functionals. We use this observation to propose a criterion for the choice of

too few benefits for real systems for the resources they cost. We propose

We show that the

surface has an open Fermi surface, which cannot host the quantum Hall effect.
Via a ""wormhole"" tunneling assisted by the Weyl nodes, the Fermi arcs at
opposite surfaces can form a complete Fermi loop and support the quantum Hall
effect. The edge states of the Fermi arcs show a unique 3D distribution, giving
an example of (d-2)-dimensional boundary states. This is distinctly different
from the surface-state quantum Hall effect from a single surface of topological
insulator. As the Fermi energy sweeps through the Weyl nodes, the sheet Hall
conductivity evolves from the 1/B dependence to quantized plateaus at the Weyl
nodes. This behavior can be realized by tuning gate voltages in a slab of
topological semimetal, such as the TaAs family, Cd$_3$As$_2$, or Na$_3$Bi. This

the Sudakov suppression of the exclusive production of two gluon jets. Hence,
the Bose-Einstein correlation is the main source of the azimuthal angle
correlations which generates $v_n$ with odd and even $n$.
  We found, that without this suppression, the measurement of an event with

do not depend on multiplicity, while for hadron-hadron scattering, such

$H_0(\curl,D)$ in $L^2(D)^d$, homogenization of Maxwell wave equation can be
significantly more complicated than that of scalar wave equations in the
$H^1(D)$ setting, and requires analysis uniquely for Maxwell wave equations. We
employ multiscale convergence. The homogenized Maxwell wave equation and the
initial condition are deduced from the multiscale homogenized equation. When
the coefficient of the second order time derivative in the multiscale equation
depends on the microscopic scales, the derivation is significantly more
complicated, comparing to scalar wave equations, due to the corrector terms for
the solution $\ue$ of the multiscale equation in the $L^2(D)^d$ norm, which do
not appear in the $H^1(D)$ setting. For two scale equations, we derive an
explicit homogenization error estimate for the case where the solution $u_0$ of
the homogenized equation belongs to $L^\infty((0,T);H^1(\curl,D))$. When $u_0$
only belongs to a weaker regularity space $L^\infty((0,T);H^s(\curl,D))$ for
$0<s<1$, we contribute an approach to deduce a new homogenization error in this
case, which depends on $s$. For general multiscale problems, a corrector is
derived albeit without an explicit homogenization error estimate. These
correctors and homogenization errors play an essential role in deriving
numerical correctors for approximating the solutions to the multiscale problems

the best possible result that, if $t$ is a positive integer, and $F$ is a
forest of order at most $\frac{1}{6}\left(t^3+6t^2+17t+12\right)$, then
$f_2(F)\leq t$. We study $f_3(F)$ for forests $F$ in more detail obtaining
similar almost tight results, and we establish upper bounds on $f_k(G)$ for
graphs $G$ of girth at least $5$. For graphs $G$ of girth more than $2p$, for
$p$ at least $3$, our results imply
$f_k(G)=O\left(n(G)^{\frac{p+1}{3p}}\right)$. Finally, we show that, for every
fixed $k$, and every given forest $F$, the value of $f_k(F)$ can be determined
in polynomial time.

components. The components in either network exhibit complex dependencies on

this paper, we restrict to the dependencies in the power network and propose
the Multi-scale Implicative Interdependency Relation (MIIR) model that address
the existing limitations. A formal description of the model along with its
working dynamics and a brief validation with respect to the 2011 Southwest

problem is proposed. For a given time instant, the problem solves for a set of
$K$ entities in a power network which when failed at that time instant would
cause the maximum number of entities to fail eventually. Owing to the problem
being NP-complete we devised a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) to obtain the
optimal solution and a polynomial time sub-optimal heuristic. The efficacy of
the heuristic with respect to the MIP is compared by using different bus system
data. In general, the heuristic is shown to provide near optimal solution at a
much faster time than the MIP.

When random variables are discrete or Gaussian, tools from computational
algebraic geometry can be used to understand implications between conditional
independence statements. This is accomplished by computing primary
decompositions of conditional independence ideals. As examples the chapter
presents in detail the graphical model of a four cycle and the intersection
axiom, a certain implication of conditional independence statements. Another
important problem in the area is to determine all constraints on a graphical

direction, and are essential for spintronics applications where one needs to
read, write, store and transfer spin-data. This spin sensitivity appears to
restrict them to be magnetic, and the known examples indeed are. The
fabrication of real spintronic devices from such materials is often hampered,
however, by stray magnetic fields, domain walls, short spin coherence times,
scattering on magnetic atoms or magnetically active interfaces, and other
characteristics that come along with the magnetism. The surfaces of topological
insulators, or Dirac or Weyl semimetals, could be an alternative, but
production of high-quality thin films without the presence of the bulk states
at the Fermi level remains very challenging. Here we introduce non-magnetic
half-metals and demonstrate that this state is realized in IrBiSe. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations we
find a record-high Dresselhaus spin-orbit splitting, fully spin-polarized
remnant Fermi surfaces and a chiral 3D spin-texture, all with no magnetism
present. Promising applications include using IrBiSe as a source of
spin-polarized electrons, and lightly doped IrBiSe is expected to generate
electric-field-controlled spin-polarized currents, free from back scattering,

particular we study a uniformly accelerated source of a quantum field state - a
single-mode squeezer. Even though the initial state of the field is vacuum (a
pure state) and the interaction with the quantum source in the accelerated

say that a set $S\subseteq2^E$ of subsets of $E$ is a \textit{powerful set} if
the set of characteristic vectors of sets in $S$ is a powerful code. Powerful
sets (codes) include cocircuit spaces of binary matroids (equivalently, linear

each powerful set, there is an associated nonnegative-integer-valued rank
function (by a construction of Farr), although it does not in general satisfy
all the matroid rank axioms.
  In this paper we investigate the combinatorial properties of powerful sets.
We prove fundamental results on special elements (loops, coloops, frames,
near-frames, and stars), their associated types of single-element extensions,
various ways of combining powerful sets to get new ones, and constructions of
nonlinear powerful sets. We show that every powerful set is determined by its
clutter of minimal nonzero members. Finally, we show that the number of
powerful sets is doubly exponential, and hence that almost all powerful sets

architectures is characterizing their optimal capacities.
  An important, widely-used neural architecture is known as autoencoders where
the network reconstructs the input at the output layer via a representation at
a hidden layer.
  Even though capacities of several neural architectures have been addressed
using statistical physics methods, the capacity of autoencoder neural networks
is not well-explored.
  Here, we analytically show that an autoencoder network of binary neurons with
a hidden layer can achieve a capacity that grows exponentially with network
size.
  The network has fixed random weights encoding a set of dense input patterns
into a dense, expanded (or \emph{overcomplete}) hidden layer representation. A
set of learnable weights decodes the input patters at the output layer. We
perform a mean-field approximation of the model to reduce the model to a
perceptron problem with an input-output dependency. Carrying out Gardner's
\emph{replica} calculation, we show that as the expansion ratio, defined as the
number of hidden units over the number of input units, increases, the
autoencoding capacity grows exponentially even when the sparseness or the
coding level of the hidden layer representation is changed. The
replica-symmetric solution is locally stable and is in good agreement with
simulation results obtained using a local learning rule. In addition, the
degree of symmetry between the encoding and decoding weights monotonically
increases with the expansion ratio.

particularly when samples from each source are distributed differently. These
differences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons:
sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart, affecting their individual
measurements. Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian
inference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically
distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability
distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter
is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while
respecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and
requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself.
Improving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient,
parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary
distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input
distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to
nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that
tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete, needing to
discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge, we also
provide the first bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the
discretization becomes finer. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our method, both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere,

Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is
moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using next state's value
function. $\lambda$-returns generalize beyond 1-step returns and strike a
balance between Monte Carlo and TD learning methods. While lambda-returns have
been extensively studied in RL, they haven't been explored a lot in Deep RL.
This paper's first contribution is an exhaustive benchmarking of
lambda-returns. Although mathematically tractable, the use of exponentially
decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a
rather ad-hoc design choice. Our second major contribution is that we propose a
generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns
(CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an
end-to-end manner. This allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants
to weigh the n-step returns based targets. In contrast, lambda-returns restrict
RL agents to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. Autodidactic
returns can be used for improving any RL algorithm which uses TD learning. We
empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of
multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the
use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the Asynchronous Advantage

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the
virtual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders
to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to
iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution
of output variables conditioned on some input variables. This approach is
applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score
used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional
distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising
autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a
corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of
this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for
structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not
any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output
variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function
parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few
neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally
find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by
conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based
on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint
distribution of outputs.

objective for quantum computing. The D-Wave quantum annealing processors have
been at the forefront of experimental attempts to address this goal, given
their relatively large numbers of qubits and programmability. A complete
determination of the optimal time-to-solution (TTS) using these processors has
not been possible to date, preventing definitive conclusions about the presence
of a scaling advantage. The main technical obstacle has been the inability to
verify an optimal annealing time within the available range. Here we overcome
this obstacle and present a class of problem instances for which we observe an
optimal annealing time using a D-Wave 2000Q processor over a range spanning up
to more than $2000$ qubits. This allows us to perform an optimal TTS
benchmarking analysis and perform a comparison to several classical algorithms,
including simulated annealing, spin-vector Monte Carlo, and discrete-time
simulated quantum annealing. We establish the first example of a scaling
advantage for an experimental quantum annealer over classical simulated
annealing: we find that the D-Wave device exhibits certifiably better scaling
than simulated annealing, with $95\%$ confidence, over the range of problem
sizes that we can test. However, we do not find evidence for a quantum speedup:
simulated quantum annealing exhibits the best scaling by a significant margin.
Our construction of instance classes with verifiably optimal annealing times
opens up the possibility of generating many new such classes, paving the way
for further definitive assessments of scaling advantages using current and
future quantum annealing devices.

have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of challenging,

deep neural networks to learn rich domain representations for approximating the
value function or policy. Batch reinforcement learning methods with linear
representations, on the other hand, are more stable and require less hyper
parameter tuning. Yet, substantial feature engineering is necessary to achieve
good results. In this work we propose a hybrid approach -- the Least Squares
Deep Q-Network (LS-DQN), which combines rich feature representations learned by
a DRL algorithm with the stability of a linear least squares method. We do this
by periodically re-training the last hidden layer of a DRL network with a batch
least squares update. Key to our approach is a Bayesian regularization term for
the least squares update, which prevents over-fitting to the more recent data.
We tested LS-DQN on five Atari games and demonstrate significant improvement
over vanilla DQN and Double-DQN. We also investigated the reasons for the
superior performance of our method. Interestingly, we found that the
performance improvement can be attributed to the large batch size used by the
LS method when optimizing the last layer.

We assume a time slotted system, where the relays update their positions before
the beginning of each time slot. Modeling the wireless channel as a Gaussian
spatiotemporal stochastic field, we propose a novel $2$-stage stochastic
programming problem formulation for optimally specifying the positions of the
relays at each time slot, such that the expected QoS of the network is
maximized, based on causal Channel State Information (CSI) and under a total
relay transmit power budget. This results in a schema where, at each time slot,
the relays, apart from optimally beamforming to the destination, also
optimally, predictively decide their positions at the next time slot, based on
causally accumulated experience. Exploiting either the Method of Statistical
Differentials, or the multidimensional Gauss-Hermite Quadrature Rule, the
stochastic program considered is shown to be approximately equivalent to a set
of simple subproblems, which are solved in a distributed fashion, one at each
relay. Optimality and performance of the proposed spatially controlled system
are also effectively assessed, under a rigorous technical framework; strict
optimality is rigorously demonstrated via the development of a version of the
Fundamental Lemma of Stochastic Control, and, performance-wise, it is shown
that, quite interestingly, the optimal average network QoS exhibits an
increasing trend across time slots, despite our myopic problem formulation.
Numerical simulations are presented, experimentally corroborating the success

photonic circuitry, and in particular silicon photonics circuitry, there is now
an opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A
particularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the
photonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building
blocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in
particular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due
to unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on
the applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major
obstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for post trimming of such
resonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory
technology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale
Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges
in the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located in close proximity to the
silicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon,
modifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the
resonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS
compatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and
commercialized. We expect such an approach to pave the way for even more
efficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic
and electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters,
modulators, sensors, and lasers, to name a few.

  supercritical accretion flow with outflow","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1070",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the effects of ordered large scale magnetic field on the structure
of supercritical accretion flow in the presence of outflow. In the cylindrical
coordinates ($r, \varphi,z$), We write the 1.5 dimensional, the steady state
($\frac{\partial}{\partial t}=0$) and axisymmetric ($\frac{\partial}{\partial
\varphi}=0$) inflow-outflow equations by using the self similar solutions. Also
a model for radiation pressure supported accretion flow threaded by both
toroidal and vertical components of magnetic field has been formulated.
  For studying the outflows, we adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as
$\dot{M}=\dot{M}_{out}{(\frac{r}{r_{out}})^{s+\frac{1}{2}}}$ with
$s=\frac{1}{2}$. Also by following the previous works, we have considered the
interchange of mass, radial and angular momentum and the energy between inflow
and outflow. we have found numerically that two components of magnetic field
have the opposite effects on the thickness of the disc and similar effects on
the radial and angular velocities of the flow. We have found that the existence
of the toroidal component of magnetic field will lead to increasing of radial
and azimuthal velocities as well as the relative thickness of the disc, which
is increased . Moreover, the thickness of the disc will decrease when the
vertical component of magnetic field becomes important in magnetized flow. The
solutions indicated that the mass inflow rate, the specific energy of outflow
affect strongly on the advection parameter.We have shown that by increasing the
two components of magnetic field, the temperature of the accretion flow will
decrease significantly. On the other hand we have shown the bolometric
luminosity of the slim discs for high values of $\dot{m} (\dot{m}>>1)$ is not
sensitive to mass accretion rate and is kept constant ($L \approx 10 L_{E}$).

billions of dollars and showing the popularity of crowdfunding. However,
according to Kickstarter, 35% backers did not receive rewards on time. To
maintain the trust between creators and backers, and sustain the crowdfunding
business growth, it is crucial to understand how on-time and late reward
delivery projects are different. In this paper, we analyze characteristics of
on-time and late reward delivery projects, especially, focusing on project
descriptions, creator profiles, and activeness and linguistic patterns of
creators and backers. Our analysis reveals that the less complicated a project
is and more actively a creator responds to backers, the higher an on-time
reward delivery probability is. It shows there are significant differences
between on-time and late reward delivery projects.

in porous medium flows based on the experimentally determined distributions of
pore velocity and pore size reported in Holzner et al. Phys. Rev. E 92, 013015
(2015). The particle's passing through one channel is modelled as one step of
the walk. The step's (channel) length is random and the walker's velocity at
consecutive steps of the walk is conserved with finite probability mimicking
that at the turning point there could be no abrupt change of velocity. We
provide the Laplace transform of the characteristic function of the walker's
position and reductions for different cases of independence of the CTRW's
step's duration \tau, length l and velocity v. We solve our model with
independent l and v. The model incorporates different forms of the tail of the
probability density of small velocities that vary with the model parameter
\alpha. Depending on that parameter all types of anomalous diffusion can hold,
from super- to subdiffusion. In a finite interval of \alpha, ballistic behavior
with logarithmic corrections holds that was observed in a previously introduced
CTRW model with independent l and \tau. Universality of tracer's diffusion in
the porous medium is considered.
