that these deviations are due to a mass-loading effect of the surface ligands.

demonstrate that this model is capable of accurately reproducing the $l = 0$

different ligand identities and epitaxially grown CdSe/CdS core/shell

can be used to infer the elastic properties of surface bound ligands, such as
sound velocities and elastic moduli, that are otherwise challenging.

question has been debated in a number of publications as whether the effect can
be of any significance for realistic astrophysical conditions. Although this
effect is strongly suppressed due to smallness of neutrino magnetic moment, for
ultra-high energy neutrinos (PeV neutrinos recently observed by the IceCube

neutrinos propagating in dense matter. An advanced view on the $SL\nu$ in

also several competing processes, we determine conditions for which the $SL\nu$

azimuthal angle of the stripper. The beam emittance was also measured using the
method based on the quadrupole strength variation. The results obtained with

alternate framework to obtain queue length trajectories by direct simulation of

piecewise constant external inflow and capacity functions, and the proposed

Additionally, if the external inflow and capacity functions are periodic and
satisfy a stability condition, then there exists a globally attractive periodic
orbit. We provide an iterative procedure to compute this periodic orbit. A
periodic trajectory is iteratively updated for every link based on updates to a
specific time instant when its queue length transitions from being zero to

model includes Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms within its action in a
surprisingly renormalizable form. This occurs thanks to the presence of action
terms which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability.
However, those terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more
decreasing that the Dirac one at large momenta, indicating power counting
renormalizability. The approach, can also be interpreted as generalized
renormalization procedure for massless QCD. The free propagator, given by the
substraction between a massive and a massless Dirac ones, in the Lee-Wick form,
suggests that the theory also retains unitarity. The appearance of finite quark
masses already in the tree approximation in the scheme is determined by the
fact that the new action terms explicitly break chiral invariance. The approach
looks as being able to implement the Fritzsch Democratic Symmetry breaking
ideas about the quark mass hierarchy. Also, a link of the theory with the SM
seems that can follow after employing the Zimmermann's couplings reduction
scheme. The renormalized Feynman diagram expansion of the model is written here
and the formula for the degree of divergence of the diagrams is derived. The
primitive divergent graphs are identified. We start their evaluation through
the calculation of the divergence of the gluon polarization operator. The
divergent part of the gluon selfenergy results to be transverse as required by
gauge invariance and also independent of the new couplings appearing. The
calculations of the rest of primitive divergences will be presented elsewhere.

spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles. The x-space reconstruction in
MPI results in highly blurry images, where the resolution depends on both
system parameters and nanoparticle type. Previous techniques to counteract this
blurring rely on the knowledge of the imaging point spread function (PSF),
which may not be available or may require additional measurements. This work
proposes a blind deconvolution algorithm for MPI to recover the precise spatial
distribution of nanoparticles. The proposed algorithm exploits the observation
that the imaging PSF in MPI has zero phase in Fourier domain. Thus, even though
the reconstructed images are highly blurred, phase remains unaltered. We
leverage this powerful property to iteratively enforce consistency of phase and
bounded l1 energy information, using an orthogonal Projections Onto Convex Sets
(POCS) algorithm. To demonstrate the method, comprehensive simulations were
performed without and with nanoparticle relaxation effects, and at various
noise levels. In addition, imaging experiments were performed on an in-house
MPI scanner using a three-vial phantom that contained different nanoparticle
types. Image quality was compared with conventional deconvolution methods,
Wiener deconvolution and Lucy-Richardson method, which explicitly rely on the
knowledge of PSF. Both the simulation results and experimental imaging results
show that the proposed blind deconvolution algorithm outperforms the
conventional deconvolution methods. Without utilizing the imaging PSF, the
proposed algorithm improves image quality and resolution even in the case of
different nanoparticle types, while displaying reliable performance against
loss of the fundamental harmonic, nanoparticle relaxation effects, and noise.

degradation in presence of multi-path propagation and low received

operational ranges and extensibility. To mitigate the effects of low SNR and
multi-path propagation, we devise a robust algorithm that iteratively removes
possible outliers by taking advantage of redundant TDoA estimates. Experiments

natural approach might be to monitor data use and retain only the working-set

such as count featurization, are often used to limit the data needed to train
ML workloads to improve performance or scalability. We present Pyramid, a
limited-exposure data management system that builds upon count featurization to
enhance data protection. As such, Pyramid uniquely introduces both the idea and
proof-of-concept for leveraging training set minimization methods to instill

""matter-antimatter coexistence method"", where matter and anti-matter systems
are prepared on two parallel ${\bf R}^4$-sheets in five-dimensional Euclidean
space-time. We put a matter system $M$ with a chemical potential $\mu \in {\bf
C}$ on a ${\bf R}^4$-sheet, and also put an anti-matter system $\bar M$ with
$-\mu^*$ on the other ${\bf R}^4$-sheet shifted in the fifth direction. Between
the gauge variables $U_\nu \equiv e^{iagA_\nu}$ in $M$ and $\tilde U_\nu \equiv
e^{iag \tilde A_\nu}$ in $\bar M$, we introduce a correlation term with a real
parameter $\lambda$. In one limit of $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, a strong
constraint $\tilde U_\nu(x)=U_\nu(x)$ is realized, and therefore the total
fermionic determinant becomes real and non-negative, due to the cancellation of
the phase factors in $M$ and $\bar M$, although this system resembles QCD with
an isospin chemical potential. In another limit of $\lambda \rightarrow 0$,
this system goes to two separated ordinary QCD systems with the chemical
potential of $\mu$ and $-\mu^*$. For a given finite-volume lattice, if one
takes an enough large value of $\lambda$, $\tilde U_\nu(x) \simeq U_\nu(x)$ is
realized and phase cancellation approximately occurs between two fermionic
determinants in $M$ and $\bar M$, which suppresses the sign problem and is
expected to make the lattice calculation possible. For the obtained gauge
configurations of the coexistence system, matter-side quantities are evaluated
through their measurement only for the matter part $M$. The physical quantities
in finite density QCD are expected to be estimated by the calculations with
gradually decreasing $\lambda$ and the extrapolation to $\lambda=0$. We also
consider more sophisticated improvement of this method using an irrelevant-type
correlation.

  abstract",,,,"cs.FL cs.LO quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  String diagrams provide a convenient graphical framework which may be used
for equational reasoning about morphisms of monoidal categories. However,
unlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational
proofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally
establish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal
structure.
  Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone
process, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using
software proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.
  However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some
scenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string
diagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete
string diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not
precise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string
diagrams.
  The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for
equational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is
amenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families
of string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph
grammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using
rewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents
equational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families
of string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free
graph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by
showing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic
reasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software
implementation by proving important decidability properties.

interaction with the x rays is described in rate-equation approximation. To
understand the mechanisms of the interaction, a path analysis is devised which
allows us to investigate what sequences of photoionization and decay processes
lead to a specific configuration and with what probability. Thereby, we uncover
a connection to the mathematics of graph theory and formal languages. In
detail, we study the ion yields and find that plain rate equations do not
provide a satisfactory description. We need to extend the rate equations for
neon to incorporate double Auger decay of a $K$-shell vacancy and
photoionization shake off for neutral neon. Shake off is included for valence
and core ionization; the former has hitherto been overlooked but has important
consequences for the ion yields from an x-ray energy below the core ionization
threshold. Furthermore, we predict the photon yields from XUV and x-ray
fluorescence; these allow one insights into the configurations populated by the
interaction with the x rays. Finally, we discover that inaccuracies in those
Auger decay widths employed in previous studies have only a minor influence on
ion and photon yields.

corrections are relatively dense, a simple test based on the total number of

undergo several changes in behavior depending on density of the underlying

tests are based on Higher Criticism or Maximum Degree type tests based on a
linear combination of within and across (estimated) community degrees. In the

protoplanetary disc via angular momentum exchange with the disc material. The
resulting surface density profile of the disc is investigated for one
dimensional and two dimensional disc models and, in agreement with previous
work, it is found that one dimensional gaps are significantly deeper than their
two dimensional counterparts for the same initial conditions. We find, by
applying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs
containing no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and
the formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the
equilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is
absent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap
depth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by
torque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,
and two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is
present. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal
stability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.
Further investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive
to the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one
dimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even
further to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,
especially for lower mass planets. This behaviour is found to be consistent
across discs with varying parameters.

toric manifolds over $\mathrm{vc}(I^n)$ an $n$-cube with one vertex cut. They
are all projective. On the other hand, Oda's $3$-fold, the simplest
non-projective toric manifold, is over $\mathrm{vc}(I^n)$. In this paper, we
classify toric manifolds over $\mathrm{vc}(I^n)$ $(n\ge 3)$ as varieties and
also as smooth manifolds. As a consequence, it turns out that (1) there are
many non-projective toric manifolds over $\mathrm{vc}(I^n)$ but they are all
diffeomorphic, and (2) toric manifolds over $\mathrm{vc}(I^n)$ in some class
are determined by their cohomology rings as varieties among toric manifolds.

input samples. In this paper, we investigate a much more constrained and
realistic attack scenario wherein the target classifier is minimally exposed to
the adversary, revealing on its final classification decision (e.g., reject or
accept an input sample). Moreover, the adversary can only manipulate malicious
samples using a blackbox morpher. That is, the adversary has to evade the
target classifier by morphing malicious samples ""in the dark"". We present a
scoring mechanism that can assign a real-value score which reflects evasion
progress to each sample based on the limited information available. Leveraging
on such scoring mechanism, we propose an evasion method -- EvadeHC -- and
evaluate it against two PDF malware detectors, namely PDFRate and Hidost. The
experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed evasion attacks are
effective, attaining $100\%$ evasion rate on the evaluation dataset.
Interestingly, EvadeHC outperforms the known classifier evasion technique that
operates based on classification scores output by the classifiers. Although our

real-world classification tasks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel
setting, namely learning from complementary labels for multi-class

belong to. Collecting complementary labels would be less laborious than
collecting ordinary labels, since users do not have to carefully choose the
correct class from a long list of candidate classes. However, complementary
labels are less informative than ordinary labels and thus a suitable approach
is needed to better learn from them. In this paper, we show that an unbiased
estimator to the classification risk can be obtained only from complementarily
labeled data, if a loss function satisfies a particular symmetric condition. We
derive estimation error bounds for the proposed method and prove that the
optimal parametric convergence rate is achieved. We further show that learning
from complementary labels can be easily combined with learning from ordinary
labels (i.e., ordinary supervised learning), providing a highly practical
implementation of the proposed method. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
the usefulness of the proposed methods.

build an emotion based feed forward deep neural network which produces the

continuous values in the 2-dimensional space (Valence and Arousal), which are

studied systematically in the dressed metric approach of LQC. When it is
dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the quantum bounce, the
evolution of the background can be divided into three different phases prior to
the preheating, {\em bouncing, transition and slow-roll inflation}. During the
bouncing phase, the evolution is independent of not only the initial
conditions, but also the inflationary potentials. In particular, the expansion
factor can be well described by the same exact solution in all the cases
considered. In contrast, in the potential dominated case such a universality is
lost. It is because of this universality that the linear perturbations are also
independent of the inflationary models and obtained exactly. During the
transition phase, the evolutions of the background and its linear perturbations
are found explicitly, and then matched to the ones given in the other two
phases. Hence, once the initial conditions are imposed, the linear scalar and
tensor perturbations will be uniquely determined. Considering two different
sets of initial conditions, one imposed during the contracting phase and the
other at the bounce, we calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients and find that the
two sets yield the same results and all lead to particle creations at the onset
of the inflation. Due to the pre-inflationary dynamics, the scalar and tensor
power spectra become scale-dependent. Comparing with the Planck 2015 data, we
find constraints on the total e-folds that the universe must have expanded

indicates the mechanical stability and dynamical stability of the MAX phase.
The Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy specific heat capacity and
Debye temperature have also been calculated from the phonon density of states.
Mulliken population analysis indicates the existence of prominent covalency in
chemical bonding of Sc2InC. The electronic charge density mapping shows a
combination of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding in the compound. The Fermi
surface is comprised due to the low dispersive Sc 3d and C 2p states from the
[ScC] blocks. The phase is expected to be a soft material and easily mechinable
due to its low Vicker hardness value. Furthermore, the analysis of various
optical properties (such as dielectric function, refractive index,
photoconductivity, absorption coefficients, loss function and reflectivity)
suggests that the nanolaminate Sc2InC is a promising candidate for
optoelectronic devices in the visible and ultraviolet energy regions and as a

nine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous
observing coverage at other observatories. We use multi-observatory constraints
and modeling of bursts seen only at 3 GHz to confirm earlier results showing
that burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst
spectra are characterized by a ~500 MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as
high as $10^{40}$ erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent
dispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent
profiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error
to the estimate of DM by up to 1%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB

is actively debated. It was suggested that a proto-Rhea and a proto-Dione might
have collided recently, giving birth to the modern system of mid-sized moons.
It is also suggested that the rapid viscous spreading of the debris may have
implanted mass inside Saturn's Roche limit, giving birth to the modern Saturn's
ring system. However, this scenario has been only investigated in very
simplified way for the moment. This paper investigates it in detail to assess
its plausibility by using $N$-body simulations and analytical arguments. When
the debris disk is dominated by its largest remnant, $N$-body simulations show
that the system quickly re-accrete into a single satellite without significant
spreading. On the other hand, if the disk is composed of small particles,
analytical arguments suggest that the disk experiences dynamical evolutions in
three steps. The disk starts significantly excited after the impact and
collisional damping dominates over the viscous spreading. After the system
flattens, the system can become gravitationally unstable when particles are
smaller than $\sim$ 100 m. However, the particles grow faster than spreading.
Then, the system becomes gravitationally stable again and accretion continues
at a slower pace, but spreading is inhibited. Therefore, the debris is expected
to re-accrete into several large bodies. In conclusion, our results show that
such a scenario may not form the today's ring system. In contrast, our results
suggest that today's mid-sized moons are likely re-accreted from such a
catastrophic event.

identification and observation that serves as a basis for the development of
the general framework for biosignature assessment described in Catling et al.,
(2017). O2 is a potentially strong biosignature that was originally thought to
be an unambiguous indicator for life at high-abundance. We describe the
coevolution of life with the early Earth's environment, and how the interplay
of sources and sinks in the planetary environment may have resulted in
suppression of O2 release into the atmosphere for several billion years, a
false negative for biologically generated O2. False positives may also be
possible, with recent research showing potential mechanisms in exoplanet
environments that may generate relatively high abundances of atmospheric O2
without a biosphere being present. These studies suggest that planetary
characteristics that may enhance false negatives should be considered when
selecting targets for biosignature searches. Similarly our ability to interpret
O2 observed in an exoplanetary atmosphere is also crucially dependent on
environmental context to rule out false positive mechanisms. We describe future
photometric, spectroscopic and time-dependent observations of O2 and the
planetary environment that could increase our confidence that any observed O2
is a biosignature, and help discriminate it from potential false positives. By
observing and understanding O2 in its planetary context we can increase our
confidence in the remote detection of life, and provide a model for
biosignature development for other proposed biosignatures.

far-field targets and estimating their corresponding directions from single
snapshot measurements. The principles of sparse signal recovery (SSR) are used
for the single snapshot detection and estimation of multiple targets. In the
SSR framework, the DoA estimation problem is grid based and can be posed as the
lasso optimization problem. However, the SSR framework for DoA estimation gives
rise to the grid mismatch problem, when the unknown targets (sources) are not
matched with the estimation grid chosen for the construction of the array
steering matrix at the receiver. The block sparse recovery framework is known
to mitigate the grid mismatch problem by jointly estimating the targets and
their corresponding offsets from the estimation grid using the group lasso
estimator. The corresponding detection problem reduces to estimating the
optimal regularization parameter ($\tau$) of the lasso (in case of perfect
grid-matching) or group-lasso estimation problem for achieving the required
probability of correct detection ($P_c$). We propose asymptotic and finite
sample test statistics for detecting the number of sources with the required
$P_c$ at moderate to high signal to noise ratios. Once the number of sources
are detected, or equivalently the optimal $\hat{\tau}$ is estimated, the
corresponding estimation and grid matching of the DoAs can be performed by
solving the lasso or group-lasso problem at $\hat{\tau}$

noise, our weak approximating diffusion process suggests the following dynamics
for the SGD iteration starting from a local minimizer (resp.~saddle point): it
escapes in a number of iterations exponentially (resp.~almost linearly)
dependent on the inverse stepsize. The results are obtained using the theory
for random perturbations of dynamical systems (theory of large deviations for
local minimizers and theory of exiting for unstable stationary points). In
addition, we discuss the effects of batch size for the deep neural networks,

unstable stationary points and sharp minimizers. Our theory indicates that one
should increase the batch size at later stage for the SGD to be trapped in flat

rely on the feature ensemble about query-document pair instead of the
similarity between query instance and documents. However, existing algorithms
do not consider local structures in query-document feature space, and are
fragile to irrelevant noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel
Riemannian metric learning algorithm to capture the local structures and
develop a robust LtR algorithm. First, we design a concept called \textit{ideal
candidate document} to introduce metric learning algorithm to query-independent
model. Previous metric learning algorithms aiming to find an optimal metric
space are only suitable for query-dependent model, in which query instance and
documents belong to the same feature space and the similarity is directly
computed from the metric space. Then we extend the new and extremely fast
global Geometric Mean Metric Learning (GMML) algorithm to develop a localized
GMML, namely L-GMML. Based on the combination of local learned metrics, we
employ the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain~(NDCG) scorer and
Weighted Approximate Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss to optimize the \textit{ideal
candidate document} for each query candidate set. Finally, we can quickly
evaluate all candidates via the similarity between the \textit{ideal candidate
document} and other candidates. By leveraging the ability of metric learning
algorithms to describe the complex structural information, our approach gives
us a principled and efficient way to perform LtR tasks. The experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed L-GMML algorithm outperforms
the state-of-the-art metric learning to rank methods and the stylish
query-independent LtR algorithms regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency.

sympathetic cooling by elastic collisions (ECs). Here we demonstrate another
method of cooling ions that is based on resonant charge exchange (RCE) between
the trapped ion and the ultracold parent atom. Specifically, trapped Cs$^{+}$
ions are cooled by collisions with co-trapped, ultracold Cs atoms and,
separately, by collisions with co-trapped, ultracold Rb atoms. We observe that
the cooling of Cs$^{+}$ ions by Cs atoms is more efficient than cooling of
Cs$^{+}$ ions by Rb atoms. This signals the presence of a cooling mechanism
apart from the elastic ion-atom collision channel for the Cs-Cs$^{+}$ case,
which is cooling by RCE. The efficiency of cooling by RCE is experimentally
determined and the per-collision cooling is found to be two orders of magnitude
higher than cooling by EC. The result provides the experimental basis for
future studies on charge transport by electron hopping in atom-ion hybrid
systems.

referred to as the Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) spectrum, provides a detailed
characterization of correlation functions and power spectra of stochastic
systems via decomposition formulas in terms of RP resonances. Stochastic
analysis techniques relying on the theory of Markov semigroups for the study of
the RP spectrum and a rigorous reduction method is presented in Part I. This
framework is here applied to study a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in view of
characterizing the statistical properties of nonlinear oscillators perturbed by
noise, depending on their stability. In light of the H\""ormander theorem, it is
first shown that the geometry of the unperturbed limit cycle, in particular its
isochrons, is essential to understand the effect of noise and the phenomenon of
phase diffusion. In addition, it is shown that the spectrum has a spectral gap,
even at the bifurcation point, and that correlations decay exponentially fast.
Explicit small-noise expansions of the RP eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are
then obtained, away from the bifurcation point, based on the knowledge of the
linearized deterministic dynamics and the characteristics of the noise. These
formulas allow one to understand how the interaction of the noise with the
deterministic dynamics affect the decay of correlations. Numerical results
complement the study of the RP spectrum at the bifurcation, revealing useful
scaling laws. The analysis of the Markov semigroup for stochastic bifurcations
is thus promising in providing a complementary approach to the more geometric
random dynamical system approach. This approach is not limited to
low-dimensional systems and the reduction method presented in part I is applied
to a stochastic model relevant to climate dynamics in part III.

performance attributes with better accuracy than considering just source or
just binary code. Because our analysis is static, the target program does not
need to be executed on the target architecture, which enables users to perform
analysis on available machines instead of conducting expensive exper- iments on
potentially expensive resources. Moreover, statically generated models enable
performance prediction on non-existent or unavailable architectures. In
addition to flexibility, because model generation time is significantly reduced
compared to dynamic analysis approaches, our method is suitable for rapid
application performance analysis and improvement. We present several scientific
application validation results to demonstrate the current capabilities of our

content are correlated. These correlations are tighter for close pairs of

formation scenarios, galaxies form within dark matter halos. To explain the
amplitude and the spatial range of galactic conformity two--halo terms or
assembly bias become important. With the scale dependent correlation
coefficients the amplitude and the spatial range of conformity are determined
from galaxy and halo samples. The scale dependent correlation coefficients are
introduced as a new descriptive statistic to quantify the correlations between
properties of galaxies or halos, depending on the distances to other galaxies
or halos. These scale dependent correlation coefficients can be applied to the
galaxy distribution directly. Neither a splitting of the sample into
subsamples, nor an a priori clustering is needed. This new descriptive
statistic is applied to galaxy catalogues derived from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey III and to halo catalogues from the MultiDark simulations. In the galaxy
sample the correlations between absolute Magnitude, velocity dispersion,
ellipticity, and stellar mass content are investigated. The correlations of
mass, spin, and ellipticity are explored in the halo samples. Both for galaxies

dependent correlation coefficients reveal a signal of conformity out to 40Mpc

not yet been fully understood. In this work, we used the density gradient
theory (DGT) and considered the influence of capillary waves (CW) on the
predicted size-dependent surface tensions and nucleation rates for selected
$n$-alkanes. The DGT model was completed by an equation of state (EoS) based on
the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and compared
to the classical nucleation theory and the Peng--Robinson EoS. It was found
that the critical clusters are practically free of CW because they are so small
that even the smallest CW wavelengths do not fit into their finite dimensions.
The CW contribute to the entropy of the system and thus decrease the surface
tension. A correction for the effect of CW on the surface tension is presented.
The effect of the different EoSs is relatively small because by a fortuitous
coincidence their predictions are similar in the relevant range of critical
cluster sizes. The difference of the DGT predictions to the classical
nucleation theory computations is important but not decisive. Of the effects
investigated, the most pronounced is the suppression of the CW which causes a
sizable decrease of the predicted nucleation rates. The major difference
between experimental nucleation rate data and theoretical predictions remains
in the temperature dependence. For normal alkanes, this discrepancy is much
stronger than observed, e.g., for water. The theoretical corrections developed
here have a minor influence on the temperature dependency. We provide empirical
equations correcting the predicted nucleation rates to values comparable with
experiments.

which we trained with {\mu}CT data. This enables us to precisely evaluate the
eye location estimate of an eye tracker. Results. We show that the proposed
testing stage with the corresponding kinematic model is suitable for such a
validation. Further, we evaluate a particular eye tracker based navigation
system and show that this system is able to successfully determine the eye
center with sub-millimeter accuracy. Conclusions. We show the suitability of
the evaluated eye tracker for eye interventions, using the proposed testing
stage and the corresponding kinematic model. The results further enable
specific enhancement of the navigation system to potentially get even better
results.

of unsupervised partitional clustering, k-means is a very important algorithm
for this. In this technical report, we develop a new k-means variant called
Augmented k-means, which is a hybrid of k-means and logistic regression. During
each iteration, logistic regression is used to predict the current cluster
labels, and the cluster belonging probabilities are used to control the
subsequent re-estimation of cluster means. Observations which can't be firmly
identified into clusters are excluded from the re-estimation step. This can be
valuable when the data exhibit many characteristics of real datasets such as
heterogeneity, non-sphericity, substantial overlap, and high scatter. Augmented
k-means frequently outperforms k-means by more accurately classifying
observations into known clusters and / or converging in fewer iterations. We
demonstrate this on both simulated and real datasets. Our algorithm is
implemented in Python and will be available with this report.

hypothesized to play a role in synthesizing input in the theoretical framework

representation with that of the input provides a validation mechanism during
perceptual inference and learning. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed that
the synthesis machinery can compose new, unobserved images by imagination to
train the network itself so as to increase the robustness of the system in
novel scenarios. As a proof of concept, we investigated whether images composed
by imagination could help an object recognition system to deal with occlusion,
which is challenging for the current state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural
networks. We fine-tuned a network on images containing objects in various
occlusion scenarios, that are imagined or self-generated through a deep
generator network. Trained on imagined occluded scenarios under the object
persistence constraint, our network discovered more subtle and localized image
features that were neglected by the original network for object classification,
obtaining better separability of different object classes in the feature space.
This leads to significant improvement of object recognition under occlusion for
our network relative to the original network trained only on un-occluded
images. In addition to providing practical benefits in object recognition under
occlusion, this work demonstrates the use of self-generated composition of
visual scenes through the synthesis loop, combined with the object persistence
constraint, can provide opportunities for neural networks to discover new
relevant patterns in the data, and become more flexible in dealing with novel
situations.

distribution fits based on panchromatic photometry from the Galaxy and Mass
Assembly (GAMA) and COSMOS datasets in ten redshift intervals with completeness
corrections applied. Below $z = 0.45$, we have credible SED fits from 100 nm to
1 mm. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of the far-infrared data, our
far-infrared CSEDs contain a mix of predicted and measured fluxes above $z =
0.45$. Our results include appropriate errors to highlight the impact of these
corrections. We show that the bolometric energy output of the Universe has
declined by a factor of roughly four -- from $5.1 \pm 1.0$ at $z \sim 1$ to
$1.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{35}~h_{70}$~W~Mpc$^{-3}$ at the current epoch. We show
that this decrease is robust to cosmic variance, SED modelling and other
various types of error. Our CSEDs are also consistent with an increase in the
mean age of stellar populations. We also show that dust attenuation has
decreased over the same period, with the photon escape fraction at 150~nm
increasing from $16 \pm 3$ at $z \sim 1$ to $24 \pm 5$ per cent at the current
epoch, equivalent to a decrease in $A_\mathrm{FUV}$ of 0.4~mag. Our CSEDs

that at late times it can no longer be accessed locally. This is reflected
quantitatively in the out-of-time-ordered correlator of local operators, which
is expected to decay to zero with time. However, for systems of finite size,
out-of-time-ordered correlators do not decay exactly to zero and in this paper
we show that the residual value can provide useful insights into the chaotic
dynamics. When energy is conserved, the late-time saturation value of the
out-of-time-ordered correlator of generic traceless local operators scales as
an inverse polynomial in the system size. This is in contrast to the inverse
exponential scaling expected for chaotic dynamics without energy conservation.
We provide both analytical arguments and numerical simulations to support this

using its approximate minimum dominating set. CCCDs showed relatively good
performance in the classification of imbalanced data sets, and although CCCDs
have a convenient construction in $\mathbb{R}^d$, finding minimum dominating
sets is NP-hard and its probabilistic behaviour is not mathematically tractable
except for $d=1$. On the other hand, a particular family of PCDs, called
\emph{proportional-edge} PCDs (PE-PCDs), has mathematical tractable minimum
dominating sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$; however their construction in higher
dimensions may be computationally demanding. More specifically, we show that
the classifiers based on PE-PCDs are prototype-based classifiers such that the
exact minimum number of prototypes (equivalent to minimum dominating sets) are

theoretical attention in condensed matter physics. Among these, recently
discovered Weyl semimetals have a dispersion described by a three-dimensional
Dirac cone, which is at the root of exotic physics such as the chiral anomaly
in magnetotransport. In a time reversal symmetric (TRS) Weyl semimetal film,
the confinement gap gives the quasiparticles a mass, while TRS is preserved by
having an even number of valleys with opposite masses. The film can be tuned
through a topological phase transition by a gate electric field. In this work,
we present a theoretical study of the quantum corrections to the conductivity
of a topological semimetal thin film, which is governed by the complex
interplay of the chiral band structure, mass term, and scalar and spin-orbit
scattering. We study scalar and spin-orbit scattering mechanisms on the same
footing, demonstrating that they have a strong qualitative and quantitative
impact on the conductivity correction. We show that, due to the spin structure
of the matrix Green's functions, terms linear in the extrinsic spin-orbit
scattering are present in the Bloch and momentum relaxation times, whereas
previous works had identified corrections starting from the second order. In
the limit of small quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity
spin-orbit coupling lead to a potentially observable density dependence in the
weak antilocalization correction. Moreover, when the mass term is around 30
percent of the linear Dirac terms, the system is in the unitary symmetry class
with zero quantum correction and switching the extrinsic spin-orbit scattering
drives the system to the weak antilocalization. We discuss the crossover
between the weak localization and weak antilocalization regimes in terms of the
singlet and triplet Cooperon channels, tuning the spin-orbit scattering
strength.

function is the expectation of exponential of the path sum of a random
stationary and ergodic bounded potential plus $\theta X_n$. The random walk
policies are measurable with respect to the random potential, and are adapted,
with their drifts uniformly bounded in magnitude by a parameter
$\delta\in[0,1]$. Under natural conditions on the potential, we prove that the
normalized logarithm of the optimal cost function converges. The proof is
constructive in the sense that we identify asymptotically optimal policies
given the value of the parameter $\delta$, as well as the law of the potential.
It relies on correctors from large deviation theory as opposed to arguments
based on subadditivity which do not seem to work except when $\delta = 0$.
  The Bellman equation associated to this control problem is a second-order
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) stochastic partial difference equation with a separable
random Hamiltonian which is nonconvex in $\theta$ unless $\delta = 0$. We prove
that this equation homogenizes under linear initial data to a first-order HJ
deterministic partial differential equation. When $\delta = 0$, the effective
Hamiltonian is the tilted free energy of random walk in random potential and it
is convex in $\theta$. In contrast, when $\delta = 1$, the effective
Hamiltonian is piecewise linear and nonconvex in $\theta$. Finally, when
$\delta \in (0,1)$, the effective Hamiltonian is expressed completely in terms
of the tilted free energy for the $\delta=0$ case and its

Australian National University, October 2016. 97 pp",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning is a general and powerful framework with which to
study and implement artificial intelligence. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled RL algorithms to achieve impressive performance in restricted
domains such as playing Atari video games (Mnih et al., 2015) and, recently,
the board game Go (Silver et al., 2016). However, we are still far from
constructing a generally intelligent agent. Many of the obstacles and open
questions are conceptual: What does it mean to be intelligent? How does one
explore and learn optimally in general, unknown environments? What, in fact,
does it mean to be optimal in the general sense? The universal Bayesian agent
AIXI (Hutter, 2005) is a model of a maximally intelligent agent, and plays a
central role in the sub-field of general reinforcement learning (GRL).
Recently, AIXI has been shown to be flawed in important ways; it doesn't
explore enough to be asymptotically optimal (Orseau, 2010), and it can perform
poorly with certain priors (Leike and Hutter, 2015). Several variants of AIXI
have been proposed to attempt to address these shortfalls: among them are
entropy-seeking agents (Orseau, 2011), knowledge-seeking agents (Orseau et al.,
2013), Bayes with bursts of exploration (Lattimore, 2013), MDL agents (Leike,
2016a), Thompson sampling (Leike et al., 2016), and optimism (Sunehag and

experiments against various environments, similar to OpenAI Gym (Brockman et
al., 2016), and a suite of interactive demos that explore different properties
of the agents, similar to REINFORCEjs (Karpathy, 2015). We use AIXIjs to

simply depending on the change in the eigenenergies or the probability

evolution, the transitions between the different quantum states representing
the quantum coherence can affect the essential thermodynamic properties, and
thus the general definitions of the heat and work should be clarified with
respect to the microscopic generic time-dependent system. By integrating the
coherence effects in the exactly-solvable dynamics of quantum-spin precession,
the internal energy is rigorously transferred as the work in the thermodynamic
adiabatic process. The present study demonstrates that quantum adiabatic

magnetic field perturbations at 780 km altitude. The Active Magnetosphere and
Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment data products derived from the
Iridium constellation provide global maps of the magnetic field perturbations.
Cluster data just upstream of the Earth's bow shock have been used to estimate
the dayside reconnection rate. By using a statistical model where the magnetic
field can respond on several time scales, we confirm previous reports of an
almost immediate response both near noon and near midnight combined with a
10-20 min reconfiguration time of the two-cell convection pattern. The response
of the ionospheric convection has been associated with the expansion of the
polar cap boundary in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. In the original formulation
of this paradigm the expansion spreads from noon to midnight in 15-20 min.
However, also an immediate global response has been shown to be consistent with
the paradigm when the previous dayside reconnection history is considered. In
this paper we present a new explanation for how the immediate response can be
accommodated in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. The new explanation is based on
how MHD waves propagate in the magnetospheric lobes when newly reconnected open
flux tubes are added to the lobes, and the magnetopause flaring angle
increases.

indicate a strong, interaction-induced tendency to avoid the simultaneous
existence of partially filled spin-up and spin-down LLs. Rather, we find that
such partially filled LLs consist of coexisting regions of full and empty LLs.
At the boundaries between the regions of full and empty LLs, we observe edge
stripes of nearly constant $\nu$ close to half-odd filling. This suggests that
the exchange interaction induces a behavior similar to a Hund's rule for the
occupation of the spin split LLs. The screening of the disorder and edge
potential appears significantly reduced as compared to static Thomas-Fermi
screening. Our results are consistent with a local, lateral $\nu$ dependence of
the exchange-enhanced spin splitting. Hence, on quantum-coherent length scales
as probed here, the electron system of the IQH effect behaves similar to a
non-interacting single particle system - not because of the absence, but rather
due to the dominance of many-body effects.

  Methods. The JPEG2000 standard offers useful new features that facilitate the
dissemination and analysis of high-resolution image data and offers a solution
to the challenge of efficiently browsing petabyte-scale image archives. The
JHelioviewer software is open source, platform independent and extendable via a
plug-in architecture.
  Results. With JHelioviewer, users can visualise the Sun for any time period
between September 1991 and today. They can perform basic image processing in
real time, track features on the Sun and interactively overlay magnetic field
extrapolations. The software integrates solar event data and a time line
display. As a first step towards supporting science planning of the upcoming
Solar Orbiter mission, JHelioviewer offers a virtual camera model that enables
users to set the vantage point to the location of a spacecraft or celestial
body at any given time.

to describe and understand the dynamics of gluons in hadrons in the Minkowski
space-time, the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP)
is shown in the simplest available context of heavy quarkonia to exhibit a
welcome degree of universality in the first approximation it yields once one
assumes that beyond perturbation theory gluons obtain effective mass. Namely,
in the second-order terms, the Coulomb potential with Breit-Fermi spin
couplings in the effective quark-antiquark component of a heavy quarkonium, is
corrected in one-flavor QCD by a spin-independent harmonic oscillator term that
does not depend on the assumed effective gluon mass or the choice of the RGPEP
generator. The new generator we use here is much simpler than the ones used
before and has the advantage of being suitable for studies of the effective
gluon dynamics at higher orders than the second and beyond the perturbative
expansion.

component of FWHM~1600-1800 km/s in the hydrogen recombination lines
(Pa$\alpha$, Br$\delta$, and Br$\gamma$) and also in the coronal line [Si
VI]$\lambda$1.963 micron. Thus the data confirm the presence of the nuclear
ionized outflow previously detected in the optical and reveal its coronal
counterpart. Both the ionized and coronal nuclear outflows are resolved, with
seeing-deconvolved full widths at half maximum of 1.1$\pm$0.1 and 0.9$\pm$0.1
kpc along PA$\sim$72-74 deg. This orientation is almost coincident with the
radio axis (PA=77 deg), suggesting that the radio jet could have triggered the
nuclear outflow. In the case of the H$_2$ lines we do not require a broad
component to reproduce the profiles, but the narrow lines are blueshifted by
~50 km/s on average from the galaxy systemic velocity. This could be an
indication of the presence of a nuclear molecular outflow, although the bulk of
the H$_2$ emission in the inner ~2 arcsec (~3 kpc) of the galaxy follows a
rotation pattern. We find evidence for kinematically disrupted gas (FWHM>250
km/s) at up to 5.6 kpc from the AGN, which can be naturally explained by the
action of the outflow. The narrow component of [Si VI] is redshifted with
respect to the systemic velocity, unlike any other emission line in the K-band
spectrum. This indicates that the region where the coronal lines are produced
is not co-spatial with the narrow line region.

and is featured by a pair of charged scalars, which could affect many
low-energy processes. In the ""Higgs basis"" for a generic 2HDM, only one scalar
doublet gets a nonzero vacuum expectation value and, under the criterion of
minimal flavor violation, the other one is fixed to be either color-singlet or
color-octet, which are named as the type-III and the type-C 2HDM, respectively.
In this paper, we study the charged-scalar effects of these two models on the
$K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing, an ideal process to probe New Physics (NP) beyond the

theoretical inputs, we then give a detailed phenomenological analysis, in the
cases of both real and complex Yukawa couplings of the charged scalars to
quarks. The parameter spaces allowed by the current experimental data on the
mass difference $\Delta m_K$ and the CP-violating parameter $\epsilon_K$ are
obtained and the differences between these two 2HDMs are investigated, which
are helpful to distinguish them from each other from a phenomenological point

samples, the system generates constraints that limit motion orthogonal to the
rigid body model's surface. These constraints, along with prior motion,
collision/contact constraints, and joint mechanics, are resolved with a
projected Gauss-Seidel solver. Due to camera noise properties and attachment
errors, the numerous surface constraints are impulse capped to avoid
overpowering mechanical constraints. To improve tracking accuracy, multiple
simulations are spawned at each frame and fed a variety of heuristics,
constraints and poses. A 3D error metric selects the best-fit simulation,
helping the system handle challenging hand motions. Such an approach enables
real-time, robust, and accurate 3D skeletal tracking of a user's hand on a

stochastic uncertainty quantification designed for fluid dynamics to the
Born-Infeld model of nonlinear electromagnetism. The similarities in the
results are striking. Namely, the introduction of Stratonovich cylindrical
noise into each of their Hamiltonian formulations introduces stochastic Lie
transport into their dynamics in the same form for both theories. Moreover, the
resulting stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) retain their
unperturbed form, except for an additional term representing induced Lie
transport by the set of divergence-free vector fields associated with the
spatial correlations of the cylindrical noise. The explanation for this
remarkable similarity lies in the method of construction of the Hamiltonian for
the Stratonovich stochastic contribution to the motion in both cases; which is
done via pairing spatial correlation eigenvectors for cylindrical noise with
the momentum map for the deterministic motion. This momentum map is responsible
for the well-known analogy between hydrodynamics and electromagnetism. The
momentum map for the Maxwell and Born-Infeld theories of electromagnetism
treated here is the 1-form density known as the Poynting vector. Two Appendices

a uniform bound on the number of connected components in the Delaunay graph

depletion during the entire Odin operational time and in both hemispheres. Our
study focuses on the Arctic region, where two O$_{3}$ destruction mechanisms
play an important role, involving halogen and nitrogen chemical families (i.e.
NOx = NO and NO$_{2}$), respectively. The temporal evolution and geographical
distribution of (O$_{3}$) loss in the low and middle stratosphere have been
investigated between 2002 and 2013. For the first time, this has been done
based on the study of a series of winter-spring seasons over more than a
decade, spanning very different dynamical conditions. The chemical mechanisms
involved in O$_{3}$ depletion are very sensitive to thermal conditions and
dynamical activity, which are extremely variable in the Arctic stratosphere. We
have focused our analysis on particularly cold and warm winters, in order to
study the influence this has on ozone loss. The winter 2010/11 is considered as
an example for cold conditions. This case, which has been the subject of many
studies, was characterised by a very stable vortex associated with particularly
low temperatures, which led to an important halogen-induced O$_{3}$ loss
occurring inside the vortex in the lower stratosphere. We found a loss of 2.1
ppmv at an altitude of 450K in the end of March 2011, which corresponds to the
largest ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere observed during the last
decade. This result is consistent with other studies. (continued)

the presence of galaxy-wide winds. Given the young stellar populations, it is

an accretion disk around a weakly magnetized white dwarf (WD) in cataclysmic
variables. At the inner edge of the disk, the gas comes upon the surface of the
WD and has to get rid of its excess kinetic energy in order to settle down on
the more slowly rotating outer stellar layers. This region is known as the
boundary layer (BL). Aims. In this work we investigate the vertical structure
of the BL, which is still poorly understood. We shall provide details of the
basic structure of the two-dimensional (2D) BL and how it depends on parameters
such as stellar mass and rotation rate, as well as the mass-accretion rate. We
further investigate the destination of the disk material and compare our
results with previous one-dimensional (1D) simulations. Methods. We solve the
2D equations of radiation hydrodynamics in a spherical geometry using a
parallel grid-based code that employs a Riemann solver. The radiation energy is
considered in the two-temperature approach with a radiative flux given by the
flux-limited diffusion approximation. Results. The BL around a non-rotating WD
is characterized by a steep drop in angular velocity over a width of only 1% of
the stellar radius, a heavy depletion of mass, and a high temperature (500 000
K) as a consequence of the strong shear. Variations in Om_star, M_star, and
M_dot influence the extent of the changes of the variables in the BL but not
the general structure. Depending on Om_star, the disk material travels up to
the poles or is halted at a certain latitude. The extent of mixing with the
stellar material also depends on Om_star. We find that the 1D approximation
matches the 2D data well, apart from an underestimated temperature.

edge-on galaxies (flat galaxies of Karachentsev et al. 1999). Estimates of
$M_{HI}$, given in the HYPERLEDA database for flat galaxies appear to be on
average higher at $\sim $0.2 dex, than for isolated galaxies with similar
$V_{rot}$ or $D_{25}$ values, most probably, due to the overvaluation of
self-absorption in the HI line. We confirm that the hydrogen mass for both
samples closely correlates with galactic disc integral specific angular
momentum $J$, which is proportional to $V_{rot}D_{25}$ or $V_{rot}R_0$, with
low surface brightness galaxies lie along a common $V_{rot}R_0$ sequence. This
relationship can be explained, assuming that gas mass in the disc is regulated
by marginal gravitational stability condition of gas layer. A comparison of the
observed and theoretically expected dependences leads to a conclusion that
either gravitational stability corresponds to higher values of Toomre parameter
than is usually assumed, or the threshold stability condition for most galaxies
took place only in the past, when gas mass in discs was 2-4 times higher than
at present (with the exception of galaxies with abnormally high $HI$ content).
The last condition requires that the gas accretion was not compensated by gas
consumption during the evolution of most of galaxies.

While the dust mass can be estimated using standard methods, determining the
gas mass - and thus the amount of material available to form giant planets -
has proven to be very difficult. Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising
alternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the
robustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas
mass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.
Deuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the
thermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and
vertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas
mass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no
prior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD
1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass
disks (M$_{\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$). For more massive disks, this
uncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1
line or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this
uncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial
and vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the
gas mass to $6\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ < M$_{\rm disk} < 9\cdot10^{-3}$
M$_\odot$. Future observations require a 5$\sigma$ sensitivity of
$1.8\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$ ($2.5\cdot10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$) and a spectral
resolving power R > 300 (1000) to detect HD 1-0 (HD 2-1) for all disk masses
above $10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ with a line-to-continuum ratio > 0.01. These results
show that HD can be used as an independent gas mass tracer with a relatively
low uncertainty and should be considered as an important science goal for
future FIR missions.

spatial averages of the fluxes and gradients of solutions. We implement a
renormalization-type scheme to obtain an algebraic rate for their convergence,

obtain estimates of the homogenization error for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem

the cumulative effect of (non-)energetic processing. We focus on astronomically
relevant CO:CH3OH = 4:1 ice analogues exposed to doses relevant for the
collapse stage of dense clouds. Hydrogenation experiments result in the
formation of methyl formate (MF HC(O)OCH3), glycolaldehyde (GA HC(O)CH2OH) and
ethylene glycol (EG H2C(OH)CH2OH) at 14 K. The absolute abundances and the
abundance fractions are found to be dependent on the H-atom/CO-CH3OH molecule
ratios and on the overall deposition rate. In the case that ices are exposed to
UV photons only, several different COMs are found. Typically, the abundance
fractions are 0.2 for MF, 0.3 for GA and 0.5 for EG as opposed to the values
found in pure hydrogenation experiments without UV in which MF is largely
absent: 0.0, 0.2-0.6 and 0.8-0.4, respectively. In experiments where both are
applied, overall COM abundances drop to about half of those found in the pure
UV irradiation experiments, but the composition fractions are very similar.
This implies COM ratios can be used as a diagnostic tool to derive the
processing history of an ice. Solid-state branching ratios derived here for GA

definitions, we compute complexity bounds for the problems of establishing
whether a given slice of a linear schema is a dynamic slice and whether a
linear schema has a non-trivial dynamic slice and prove that the latter problem

waves at nanoscale are key elements of compact photonic circuits. However,
previously implemented designs employ plasmonic nanoantennas with high Ohmic
losses, relatively low spectral resolution, and complicated lithographically
made architectures. Here we propose an ultracompact and simple dielectric
nanoantenna (silicon nanosphere) allowing for both directional launching of
surface plasmon polaritons on a thin gold film and their demultiplexing with a
high spectral resolution. We show experimentally that mutual interference of
magnetic and electric dipole moments supported by the dielectric nanoantenna
results in opposite propagation of the excited surface waves whose wavelengths
differ by less than 50 nm in the optical range. Broadband reconfigurability of
the nanoantennas operational range is achieved simply by varying the diameter
of the silicon sphere. Moreover, despite subwavelength size ($<\lambda/3$) of
the proposed nanoantennas, they demonstrate highly efficient and directional
launching of surface waves both in the forward and backward directions with the
measured front-to-back ratio having a contrast of almost two orders of
magnitude within a 50 nm spectral band. Our lithography-free design has great
potential as highly efficient, low-cost, and ultracompact demultiplexer for
advanced photonic circuits.

convolutional and fully connected features, coming from all layers of a deep

the context of the problem, and discretizes their values to reduce noise and
regularize the embedding space. Significantly, this also reduces the
computational cost of processing the resultant representations. The proposed
method is shown to outperform single layer embeddings on several image
classification tasks, while also being more robust to the choice of the
pre-trained model used for obtaining the initial features. The performance gap
in classification accuracy between thoroughly tuned solutions and the
full-network embedding is also reduced, which makes of the proposed approach a
competitive solution for a large set of applications.

accretion on to a magnetized white dwarf (WD) in an intermediate polar system

ultraviolet (UV) energy ranges during its dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2015
March-April. Comparing data from quiescence and near outburst, we have found
that the maximum plasma temperature decreased from about 26 to 16.2+/-0.4 keV.
This is consistent with the previously proposed scenario of increase in mass
accretion rate while the inner radius of the magnetically disrupted accretion
disc shrinks, thereby lowering the shock temperature. A NuSTAR observation also
revealed a high-amplitude WD spin modulation of the very hard X-rays with a
single-peaked profile, suggesting an obscuration of the lower accretion pole
and an extended shock region on the WD surface. The X-ray spectrum of GK Per
measured with the Swift X-Ray Telescope varied on time-scales of days and also
showed a gradual increase of the soft X-ray flux below 2 keV, accompanied by a
decrease of the hard flux above 2 keV. In the Chandra observation with the High
Energy Transmission Gratings, we detected prominent emission lines, especially
of Ne, Mg and Si, where the ratios of H-like to He-like transition for each
element indicate a much lower temperature than the underlying continuum. We
suggest that the X-ray emission in the 0.8-2 keV range originates from the
magnetospheric boundary.

Strategies to manage these risks hinge on a sound characterization of the
uncertainties. For example, recent studies suggest that large fractions of the
Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) may rapidly disintegrate in response to rising global
temperatures, leading to potentially several meters of sea-level rise during
the next few centuries. It is deeply uncertain, for example, whether such an
AIS disintegration will be triggered, how much this would increase sea-level
rise, whether extreme storm surges intensify in a warming climate, or which
emissions pathway future societies will choose. Here, we assess the impacts of
these deep uncertainties on projected flooding probabilities for a levee ring
in New Orleans, Louisiana. We use 18 scenarios, presenting probabilistic
projections within each one, to sample key deeply uncertain future projections
of sea-level rise, radiative forcing pathways, storm surge characterization,
and contributions from rapid AIS mass loss. The implications of these deep
uncertainties for projected flood risk are thus characterized by a set of 18
probability distribution functions. We use a global sensitivity analysis to
assess which mechanisms contribute to uncertainty in projected flood risk over
the course of a 50-year design life. In line with previous work, we find that
the uncertain storm surge drives the most substantial risk, followed by general
AIS dynamics, in our simple model for future flood risk for New Orleans.

different types of modes: perturbative and non-perturbative in the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling $\alpha$. The sound and hydrodynamic modes of the perturbative branch
can be expressed through their Schwazrschild-AdS limits by adding a linear in
$\alpha$ correction to the damping rates: $\omega \approx Re(\omega_{SAdS}) -
Im(\omega_{SAdS}) (1 - \alpha \cdot ((D+1) (D-4) /2 R^2)) i$, where $R$ is the
AdS radius. The non-perturbative branch of modes consists of purely imaginary
modes, whose damping rates unboundedly increase when $\alpha$ goes to zero.
When the black hole radius is much larger than the anti-de Sitter radius $R$,
the regime of the black hole with planar horizon (black brane) is reproduced.
If the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ (or used in holography $\lambda_{GB}$) is
not small enough, then the black holes and branes suffer from the instability,
so that the holographic interpretation of perturbation of such black holes
becomes questionable, as, for example, the claimed viscosity bound violation in
the higher derivative gravity. For example, $D=5$ black brane is unstable at
$|\lambda_{GB}|>1/8$ and has anomalously large relaxation time when approaching

interest for gamma-gamma colliders and Compton Sources for the production of

role of the electron recoil and how it controls the relativistic Doppler/boost
effect in various regimes. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations of inverse
Compton scattering in various scenarios are presented, showing very good
agreement with the analytical formulas: in particular we find that the
bandwidth dependence on the electron beam emittance, of paramount importance in
Thomson regime, as it limits the amount of focusing imparted to the electron
beam, becomes much less sensitive in deep Compton regime, allowing a stronger
focusing of the electron beam to enhance luminosity without loss of
mono-chromaticity. A similar effect occurs concerning the bandwidth dependence
on the frequency spread of the incident photons: in deep recoil regime the
bandwidth comes out to be much less dependent on the frequency spread.

continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) method to statistical samples
generated by the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method in a Majorana fermion

investigate the low-temperature spin dynamics dominated by thermally excited
gauge fluxes, including the unconventional phase transition caused by gauge
flux loops in three dimensions, which was unreachable by the previous methods.
We apply this technique to the Kitaev model in both two and three dimensions.
Our results clearly distinguish two cases: while the dynamics changes smoothly
through the crossover in the two-dimensional honeycomb case, it exhibits
singular behaviors at the phase transition in the three-dimensional
hyperhoneycomb case. We show that the low-temperature spin dynamics is a
sensitive probe for thermally fluctuating gauge fluxes that behave very

the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs, and can be interpreted

by introducing an absorptivity that does not assume that every photon with an

absorption properties also maximizes the recombination current within the

and that this is more likely to occur for materials with small band gaps.

vertices of two graphs so that they are as similar as possible. A common method
for approximately solving the NP-hard graph matching problem is relaxing it to
a convex optimization problem over the set of doubly stochastic (DS) matrices.
Recent analysis has shown that for almost all pairs of isomorphic and
asymmetric graphs, the DS relaxation succeeds in correctly retrieving the
isomorphism between the graphs. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the case
of symmetric isomorphic graphs. This goal is motivated by shape matching
applications where the graphs of interest usually have reflective symmetry.
  For symmetric problems the graph matching problem has multiple isomorphisms
and so convex relaxations admit all convex combinations of these isomorphisms
as viable solutions. If the convex relaxation does not admit any additional
superfluous solution we say that it is convex exact. In this case there are
tractable algorithms to retrieve an isomorphism from the convex relaxation.
  We show that convex exactness depends strongly on the symmetry group of the
graphs; For a fixed symmetry group $G$, either the DS relaxation will be convex
exact for almost all pairs of isomorphic graphs with symmetry group $G$, or the
DS relaxation will fail for all such pairs. We show that for reflective groups
with at least one full orbit convex exactness holds almost everywhere, and
provide some simple examples of non-reflective symmetry groups for which convex
exactness always fails.
  When convex exactness holds, the isomorphisms of the graphs are the extreme
points of the convex solution set. We suggest an efficient algorithm for
retrieving an isomorphism in this case. We also show that the ""convex to
concave"" projection method will also retrieve an isomorphism in this case.

convolutional neural networks are available for recognizing these Chinese
phrases or the presented images, and (3) each captcha must be solved within a
few seconds. We collected 2.6 million captchas, with 2.6 million deformed

association graph, composed of over 6 million vertices, and linked these
vertices based on co-occurrence information and feature similarity between

projection of the Chinese phrases onto a 230-dimensional latent space. Using
label propagation, we computed the likelihood of each of the eight images

features of (Rational) Conformal Field Theory. Our goal in this paper is to
explore the possibility of having an equivalent relationship in the context of
lattice models. We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use
the concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin
chain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding
to bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general
non-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the
algebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its
blob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin
chains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic
TL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are
known to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid
translation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the
open model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This
statement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map
between irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine
TL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose
continuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)
spin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any
longer: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the
modules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the
content in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but
the detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.
This carries over to the continuum limit.

on weight parameters based on the convex conjugacy theory, and samples weights
are determined in an adaptive manner. An efficient iterative algorithm is
developed with a convergence guarantee. Experimental results on four benchmarks
demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model.

spectroscopic data since 1974 and conducted a new two-year monitoring campaign
in 2015-2017, resulting in a total temporal baseline over four decades. The
long-term variations in the optical continuum exhibit a wave-like pattern and
the Hbeta integrated flux series varies with a similar behavior. The broad
Hbeta profiles have asymmetric double peaks, which change strongly with time
and tend to merge into a single peak during some epochs. The period in the
optical continuum determined from various period-search methods is about 20 yr
and the estimated false alarm probability with null hypothesis simulations is
about 1*10^-3. The overall variations of the broad Hbeta profiles also follow
the same period. However, the present database only covers two cycles of the
suggested period, which strongly encourages continued monitoring to track more
cycles and confirm the periodicity. Nevertheless, in light of the possible
periodicity and the complicated Hbeta profile, Ark~120 is one candidate of the
nearest radio-quiet AGNs with possible periodic variability, and it is thereby
a potential candidate host for a sub-parsec supermassive black hole binary.

inclusive $(d,p)$ reactions in the breakup-fusion formalism, pointing to some
applications and making the connection with current experimental capabilities.
Three independent implementations of the reaction formalism have been recently
developed, making use of different numerical strategies. The codes also
originally relied on two different but equivalent representations, namely the
prior (Udagawa-Tamura, UT) and the post (Ichimura-Austern-Vincent, IAV)
representations.
  The different implementations have been benchmarked, and then applied to the
Ca isotopic chain. The neutron-Ca propagator is described in the Dispersive
Optical Model (DOM) framework, and the interplay between elastic breakup (EB)
and non-elastic breakup (NEB) is studied for three Ca isotopes at two different
bombarding energies. The accuracy of the description of different reaction
observables is assessed by comparing with experimental data of $(d,p)$ on
$^{40,48}$Ca. We discuss the predictions of the model for the extreme case of
an isotope ($^{60}$Ca) currently unavailable experimentally, though possibly
available in future facilities (nominally within production reach at FRIB). We
explore the use of $(d,p)$ reactions as surrogates for $(n,\gamma)$ processes,
by using the formalism to describe the compound nucleus formation in a
$(d,p\gamma)$ reaction as a function of excitation energy, spin, and parity.
The subsequent decay is then computed within a Hauser-Feshbach formalism.
Comparisons between the $(d,p\gamma)$ and $(n,\gamma)$ induced gamma decay
spectra are discussed to inform efforts to infer neutron captures from
$(d,p\gamma)$ reactions. Finally, we identify areas of opportunity for future
developments, and discuss a possible path toward a predictive reaction theory.

granular substrate by measuring the growth dynamics of the wet aggregate. We
show that this aggregate is fully saturated and its cohesion is ensured by the
capillary depression at the air-liquid interface. The growth dynamics is
controlled by the liquid fraction at the surface of the aggregate and exhibits
two regimes. In the viscous regime, the growth dynamics is limited by the
capillary-driven flow of liquid through the granular packing to the surface of
the aggregate. In the capture regime, the capture probability depends on the
availability of the liquid at the saturated interface, which is controlled by
the hydrostatic depression in the material. We propose a model that
rationalizes our observations and captures both dynamics based on the evolution
of the capture probability with the hydrostatic depression.

Neptune-mass planet HAT-P-26b. We use two formation different models based on
pebbles and planetesimals accretion, and includes gas accretion, disk migration
and simple photoevaporation. The models tracks the atmospheric oxygen
abundance, in addition to the orbital period, and mass of the forming planets,
that we compare to HAT-P-26b. We find that pebbles accretion can explain this
planet more naturally than planetesimals accretion that fails completely unless
we artificially enhance the disk metallicity significantly. Pebble accretion
models can reproduce HAT-P-26b with either a high initial core mass and low
amount of envelope enrichment through core erosion or pebbles dissolution, or
the opposite, with both scenarios being possible. Assuming a low envelope
enrichment factor as expected from convection theory and comparable to the
values we can infer from the D/H measurements in Uranus and Neptune, our most
probable formation pathway for HAT-P-26b is through pebble accretion starting
around 10 AU early in the disk's lifetime.

possibility to move across a network by means of long-range links that
significantly reduce the characteristic path length. A natural question would
be whether there exist several ""types"" of small-world architectures, giving

investigate small-world signatures in complex networks by analyzing
multifractal characteristics of time series generated from such networks. In
particular, we suggest that the degree of right-sided asymmetry of multifractal
spectra is linked with the degree of small-worldness present in networks. This
claim is supported by numerical simulations performed on several parametric
models, including prototypical small-world networks, scale-free, fractal and
also real-world networks describing protein molecules. Our results also
indicate that right-sided asymmetry emerges with the presence of the following
topological properties: low edge density, low average shortest path, and high

proxy use in a model, and provides a witness that identifies which parts of the

of proxy use of a protected information type are inappropriate, we make use of
a normative judgment oracle that makes this inappropriateness determination for
a given witness. Our repair algorithm uses the witness of an inappropriate
proxy use to transform the model into one that provably does not exhibit proxy
use, while avoiding changes that unduly affect classification accuracy. Using a

to detect proxy use instances that would be difficult to find using existing

In the case of the 2-sphere, the first stage has been treated rigorously in
recent work of Dahlqvist and Norris, which shows that the large-$N$ limit of
the Wilson loop functional for a simple closed curve in $S^{2}$ exists and that
the associated variance goes to zero.
  We give a rigorous treatment of the second stage of analysis in the case of
the 2-sphere. Dahlqvist and Norris independently performed such an analysis,
using a similar but not identical method. Specifically, we establish the
existence of the limit and the vanishing of the variance for arbitrary loops
with (a finite number of) simple crossings. The proof is based on the
Makeenko-Migdal equation for the Yang-Mills measure on surfaces, as established
rigorously by Driver, Gabriel, Hall, and Kemp, together with an explicit
procedure for reducing a general loop in $S^{2}$ to a simple closed curve. The
methods used here also give a new proof of these results in the plane case, as
a variant of the methods used by L\'{e}vy.
  We also consider loops on an arbitrary surface $\Sigma$. We put forth two
natural conjectures about the behavior of Wilson loop functionals for
topologically trivial simple closed curves in $\Sigma.$ Under the weaker of the
conjectures, we establish the existence of the limit and the vanishing of the
variance for topologically trivial loops with simple crossings that satisfy a
""smallness"" assumption. Under the stronger of the conjectures, we establish the

scattering and collisions between protoplanets on the giant impact stage. We
investigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of
protoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths. We perform $N$-body
simulations of protoplanets in gas-free disks, changing the initial
eccentricities and inclinations systematically. We find that while the
eccentricities of protoplanets are well relaxed through their evolution, the
inclinations are not. When the initial inclinations are small, they are not
generally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur
immediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the initial
inclinations are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is
less effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their
number, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are
affected by the initial inclinations of protoplanets.

cells as a function of its geometrical parameters. Contrary to their
non-radiative counterpart, fluorescence losses strongly depend on the
environment. By properly tuning the thicknesses of the buffer layers between
the active regions of the cell and the electrodes, the exciton lifetime and,
hence, the exciton diffusion length can be increased. The importance of this
phenomenon depends on the radiative quantum efficiency, which is the fraction
of the exciton decay that is intrinsically due to fluorescence. Besides this
effect, interferences within the cell control the efficiency of sunlight
injection into the active layers. An optimal cell design must rely on the
consideration of these two aspects. By properly managing fluorescence losses,
one can significantly improve the cell performance. To demonstrate this fact,
we use realistic material parameters inspired from literature data and obtain
an increase of power conversion efficiency from 11.3% to 12.7%. Conversely, not
to take into account the strong dependence of fluorescence on the environment
may lead to a sub-optimal cell design and a degradation of cell performance.
The presence of radiative losses, however small, significantly changes the
optimal thicknesses. We illustrate this latter situation with experimental
material data.

functions of the first and second kinds of nonnegative real orders and positive
arguments. Our algorithm makes use of the well-known observation that although
the Bessel functions themselves are expensive to represent via piecewise
polynomial expansions, the logarithms of certain solutions of Bessel's equation
are not. We exploit this observation by numerically precomputing the logarithms
of carefully chosen Bessel functions and representing them with piecewise
bivariate Chebyshev expansions. Our scheme is able to evaluate Bessel functions
of orders between $0$ and $1\sep,000\sep,000\sep,000$ at essentially any
positive real argument. In that regime, it is competitive with existing methods
for the rapid evaluation of Bessel functions and has several advantages over
them. First, our approach is quite general and can be readily applied to many
other special functions which satisfy second order ordinary differential
equations. Second, by calculating the logarithms of the Bessel functions rather
than the Bessel functions themselves, we avoid many issues which arise from
numerical overflow and underflow. Third, in the oscillatory regime, our
algorithm calculates the values of a nonoscillatory phase function for Bessel's
differential equation and its derivative. These quantities are useful for
computing the zeros of Bessel functions, as well as for rapidly applying the
Fourier-Bessel transform. The results of extensive numerical experiments
demonstrating the efficacy of our algorithm are presented. A Fortran package
which includes our code for evaluating the Bessel functions as well as our code
for all of the numerical experiments described here is publically available.

improve performance of image analysis approaches. In particular, priors can be
useful in cases where images are corrupted and contain artefacts due to
limitations in image acquisition. The highly constrained nature of anatomical
objects can be well captured with learning based techniques. However, in most
recent and promising techniques such as CNN based segmentation it is not
obvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge. State-of-the-art methods
operate as pixel-wise classifiers where the training objectives do not
incorporate the structure and inter-dependencies of the output. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a generic training strategy that incorporates
anatomical prior knowledge into CNNs through a new regularisation model, which
is trained end-to-end. The new framework encourages models to follow the global
anatomical properties of the underlying anatomy (e.g. shape, label structure)
via learned non-linear representations of the shape. We show that the proposed
approach can be easily adapted to different analysis tasks (e.g. image
enhancement, segmentation) and improve the prediction accuracy of the
state-of-the-art models. The applicability of our approach is shown on
multi-modal cardiac datasets and public benchmarks. Additionally, we
demonstrate how the learned deep models of 3D shapes can be interpreted and
used as biomarkers for classification of cardiac pathologies.

Networks (LPWANs) have shown their suitability to empower a major part of
Internet of Things applications. Nonetheless, most LPWAN solutions are built on
star topology (or single-hop) networks, often causing lifetime shortening in
stations located far from the gateway. In this respect, recent studies show
that multi-hop routing for uplink communications can reduce LPWANs' energy
consumption significantly. However, it is a troublesome task to identify such
energetically optimal routings through trial-and-error brute-force approaches
because of time and, especially, energy consumption constraints. In this work
we show the benefits of facing this exploration/exploitation problem by running
centralized variations of the multi-arm bandit's epsilon-greedy, a well-known
online decision-making method that combines best known action selection and
knowledge expansion. Important energy savings are achieved when proper
randomness parameters are set, which are often improved when conveniently
applying similarity, a concept introduced in this work that allows harnessing
the gathered knowledge by sporadically selecting unexplored routing
combinations akin to the best known one.

with correction due to the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the
background of non-commutative geometry. Considering the reformulation of the
tunnelling mechanism by Banerjee and Majhi, the Hawking radiation spectrum is
evaluated through the density matrix for the outgoing modes. The GUP corrected
effective temperature and the corresponding GUP corrected effective metric in
non-commutative geometry are determined using Hawking's periodicity arguments.
Thus, we obtain further corrections to the non-strictly thermal black hole (BH)
radiation spectrum which give new final distributions. Then, we show that the
GUP and the non-commutative geometry modify the Bohr-like BH recently discussed
in a series of papers in the literature. In particular, we find the intriguing
result that the famous law of Bekenstein on the area quantization is affected
neither by non-commutative geometry nor by the GUP. This is a clear indication
of the universality of Bekenstein's result. In addition, we find that both the
Bekentsein-Hawking entropy and the total BH entropy to third order

the collection of telemetry data for individual animals has improved
dramatically, the methods to properly account for inherent uncertainties (e.g.,
measurement error, dependence, barriers to movement) have lagged behind. Still,
many new statistical approaches have been developed to infer unknown quantities
affecting animal movement or predict movement based on telemetry data.
Hierarchical statistical models are useful to account for some of the
aforementioned uncertainties, as well as provide population-level inference,
but they often come with an increased computational burden. For certain types
of statistical models, it is straightforward to provide inference if the latent
true animal trajectory is known, but challenging otherwise. In these cases,
approaches related to multiple imputation have been employed to account for the
uncertainty associated with our knowledge of the latent trajectory. Despite the
increasing use of imputation approaches for modeling animal movement, the
general sensitivity and accuracy of these methods have not been explored in
detail. We provide an introduction to animal movement modeling and describe how
imputation approaches may be helpful for certain types of models. We also
assess the performance of imputation approaches in a simulation study. Our
simulation study suggests that inference for model parameters directly related
to the location of an individual may be more accurate than inference for
parameters associated with higher-order processes such as velocity or
acceleration. Finally, we apply these methods to analyze a telemetry data set

improve segmentation accuracy and robustness. A major way to encode such a

self-intersection or mesh folding. Those problems require complex and expensive
algorithms to mitigate. In this paper, we propose a novel shape prior directly
embedded in the voxel grid space, based on gradient vector flows of a
pre-segmentation. The flexible and powerful prior shape representation is ready
to be extended to simultaneously segmenting multiple interacting objects with
minimum separation distance constraint. The problem is formulated as a Markov
random field problem whose exact solution can be efficiently computed with a
single minimum s-t cut in an appropriately constructed graph. The proposed
algorithm is validated on two multi-object segmentation applications: the brain
tissue segmentation in MRI images, and the bladder/prostate segmentation in CT

quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional
to the product of beam coverage fractions of the transmitter and receiver

pro-vides a flexible and economic strategy for data management and resource
sharing. Security and privacy become major concerns in the cloud scenario, for
which Searchable Encryption (SE) technology is proposed to support efficient
retrieval of encrypted data. However, the absence of lightweight ranked search
is still a typical shortage in existing SE schemes. In this paper, we propose a
Lightweight Efficient Multi-keyword Ranked Search over Encrypted Cloud Data
using Dual Word Embeddings (LRSE) scheme that supports top-k retrieval in the
known background model. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue and
design goals for lightweight ranked search in SE. We employ word embedding
trained on the whole English Wikipedia using word2vec to replace the general
dictionary, afterwards we make use of Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) to
substitute traditional Vector Space Model (VSM), based on which we achieve the
goal of lightweight ranked search with higher precision and solve the
challenging prob-lems caused by updating the traditional dictionary in existing
SE schemes. In LRSE, we employ an improved secure kNN scheme to guarantee
sufficient pri-vacy protection. Our security analysis shows that LRSE satisfies
our formulated privacy requirements and extensive experiments performed on
real-world datasets demonstrate that LRSE indeed accords with our proposed
design goals.
