Arecibo radio telescopes during Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton
observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 to search for
simultaneous radio and X-ray bursts. We find 12 radio bursts from FRB 121102
during 70 ks total of X-ray observations. We detect no X-ray photons at the
times of radio bursts from FRB 121102 and further detect no X-ray bursts above
the measured background at any time. We place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of
$3\times10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10 keV fluence for X-ray bursts at
the time of radio bursts for durations $<700$ ms, which corresponds to a burst
energy of $4\times10^{45}$ erg at the measured distance of FRB 121102. We also
place limits on the 0.5--10 keV fluence of $5\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ and
$1\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for bursts emitted at any time during the
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, respectively, assuming a typical X-ray
burst duration of 5 ms. We analyze data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space

10--100 keV fluence of $4\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ ($5\times10^{47}$ erg at
the distance of FRB 121102) for gamma-ray bursts at the time of radio bursts.
We also present a deep search for a persistent X-ray source using all of the
X-ray observations taken to date and place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit on the
0.5--10 keV flux of $4\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\times10^{41}$

  We present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently

- an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can
compute maximally informative sensing locations. We analyze the learnt policy
by showing that offline imitation of a clairvoyant oracle is implicitly
equivalent to online oracle execution in conjunction with posterior sampling.
This observation allows us to obtain powerful near-optimality guarantees for

is a key event in the cosmic history of baryonic matter. We derive, in the
context of the large-scale bias expansion, the imprints of the epoch of
reionization in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and identify two
contributions of particular importance. First, the Compton scattering of CMB
photons off the free electrons lead to a drag force on the baryon fluid. This
drag induces a relative velocity between baryons and CDM which is of the same
order of magnitude as the primordially-induced relative velocity, and enters in
the evolution of the relative velocity as calculated by Boltzmann codes. This
leads to a unique contribution to galaxy bias involving the matter velocity
squared. The second important effect is a modulation of the galaxy density by
the ionizing radiation field through radiative-transfer effects, which is
captured in the bias expansion by so-called higher-derivative terms. We
constrain both of these imprints using the power spectrum of the BOSS DR12
galaxy sample. While they do not lead to a shift in the baryon acoustic
oscillation scale, including these terms is important for unbiased cosmology
constraints from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum.

estimate different information channels from mono or stereo images, including

the recent years for these tasks, the estimated information is often imprecise
particularly near depth discontinuities or creases. Studies have however shown
that precisely such depth edges carry critical cues for the perception of
shape, and play important roles in tasks like depth-based segmentation or
foreground selection. Unfortunately, the currently extracted channels often
carry conflicting signals, making it difficult for subsequent applications to
effectively use them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of obtaining
high-precision depth edges (i.e., depth contours and creases) by jointly
analyzing such unreliable information channels. We propose DepthCut, a
data-driven fusion of the channels using a convolutional neural network trained
on a large dataset with known depth. The resulting depth edges can be used for
segmentation, decomposing a scene into depth layers with relatively flat depth,
or improving the accuracy of the depth estimate near depth edges by
constraining its gradients to agree with these edges. Quantitatively, we
compare against 15 variants of baselines and demonstrate that our depth edges
result in an improved segmentation performance and an improved depth estimate
near depth edges compared to data-agnostic channel fusion. Qualitatively, we
demonstrate that the depth edges result in superior segmentation and depth

ability to controllably tune between the various ground state orders, makes it
a rich system in which to explore interaction driven phenomena. In the
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, the unique Landau level spectrum
of BLG is anticipated to support a non-Abelian even-denominator state that is
tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. However, observation of this
state, which is anticipated to be stronger than in conventional systems, has
been conspicuously difficult. Here we report transport measurements of a robust
even denominator FQHE in high-mobility, dual gated BLG devices. We confirm that
the stability of the energy gap can be sensitively tuned and map the phase
diagram. Our results establish BLG as a dynamic new platform to study
topological ground states with possible non-Abelian excitations.

precisely, knotoids are diagrams representing projections of open curves in 3D
space, in contrast to knot diagrams which represent projections of closed
curves in 3D space. The intrinsic difference with classical knot theory is that
the generalization provided by knotoids admits non-trivial topological
entanglement of the open curves provided that their geometry is frozen as it is
the case for crystallized proteins. Consequently, our approach doesn't require
the closure of chains into loops which implies that the geometry of analysed
chains does not need to be changed by closure in order to characterize their

that were classified earlier as knotted and also new, topologically interesting

essentiality of a gene is connected with its degree of conservation among
several unrelated bacterial species, each one characterised by its own codon
usage bias. Confirming previous results on E. coli, we show the existence of a
universal exponential relation between gene essentiality and conservation in

least two groups of functionally distinct genes, characterised by different
levels of conservation and codon bias: i) a core of essential genes, mainly
related to cellular information processing; ii) a set of less conserved
nonessential genes with prevalent functions related to metabolism. In
particular, the genes in the first group are more retained among species, are
subject to a stronger purifying conservative selection and display a more
limited repertoire of synonymous codons. The core of essential genes is close
to the minimal bacterial genome, which is in the focus of recent studies in
synthetic biology, though we confirm that orthologs of genes that are essential
in one species are not necessarily essential in other species. We also list a
set of highly shared genes which, reasonably, could constitute a reservoir of

rotational states, which are accompanied by significant changes in physical
structure (size, shape, pressure and temperature profile, etc.). However,
variations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet
formation and evolution. Here, we present a new code, HERCULES, that solves for
the equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping
constant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of
morphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond
which the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital
velocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a
structure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected
to a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and
models of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are
substantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected
angular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies
will exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot,
rotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation
and the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of
post-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion,
core formation and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms
for satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for
terrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.

work is motivated by the following central question: can we break the
$\Theta(\log n)$ time complexity barrier and the $\Theta(m)$ message complexity
barrier in the CONGEST model for MIS or closely-related symmetry breaking

  - Time Complexity: We show that we can break the $O(\log n)$ ""barrier"" for 2-

0$, which is $o(\log n)$ for a wide range of $\Delta$ values (e.g., $\Delta =
2^{(\log n)^{1/2-\varepsilon}}$). These are the first 2- and 3-ruling set

in the CONGEST model.
  - Message Complexity: We show an $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the message
complexity of computing an MIS (i.e., 1-ruling set) which holds also for
randomized algorithms and present a contrast to this by showing a randomized
algorithm for 2-ruling sets that, whp, uses only $O(n \log^2 n)$ messages and
runs in $O(\Delta \log n)$ rounds. This is the first message-efficient

outcome of the underlying symmetries of a dynamical system and can be tested
using data from future surveys such as Euclid. Using techniques from standard
perturbation theory (SPT), previous studies of consistency relation have
concentrated on continuity-momentum (Euler)-Poisson system of an ideal fluid.
We investigate the consistency relations in effective field theory (EFT) which
adjusts the SPT predictions to account for the departure from the ideal fluid
description on small scales. We provide detailed results for the 3D density
contrast $\delta$ as well as the {\em scaled} divergence of velocity

correction to SPT results becomes important at $k \gtrsim 0.05 \rm h/Mpc$ and
that the suppression from EFT to SPT results that scales as square of the wave
number $k$, can reach $40\%$ of the total at $k \approx 0.25\rm h/Mpc$ at
$z=0$. We have also investigated whether effective field theory corrections to
models of primordial non-Gaussianity can alter the squeezed limit behaviour,

For a given intrinsic frequency and coupling constant, upon varying the time

phase locked states. By further increasing of the time delay, this phase again
undergoes a transition to another patterned partially synchronized state. We
show that the transition between theses phases are discontinuous and moreover

difficulty makes symbolic regression limited in practical applications.
Fortunately, in many engineering problems, the independent variables in target
models are separable or partially separable. This feature inspires us to
develop a new approach, block building programming (BBP). BBP divides the
original target function into several blocks, and further into factors. The
factors are then modeled by an optimization engine (e.g. GP). Under such
circumstances, BBP can make large reductions to the search space. The partition

equations and of relativistic hydrodynamics, the history of the fluid is not
simple to track, especially when compared with particle-based codes. The use of
tracers, namely massless particles that are advected with the flow, represents
a simple and effective way to solve this problem. Yet, the use of tracers in
numerical relativity is far from being settled and several issues, such as the
impact of different placements in time and space of the tracers, or the
relation between the placement and the description of the underlying fluid,
have not yet been addressed. In this paper we present the first detailed
discussion of the use tracers in numerical-relativity simulations focussing on
both unbound material -- such as the one leading to r-process nucleosynthesis
in binary mergers of neutron stars -- and on bound material -- such as the one
in the core of the object produced from the merger of two neutron stars. In
particular, when interested in unbound matter, we have evaluated four different
placement schemes that could be used to initially distribute the tracers and
how well their predictions match those obtained when using information from the
actual fluid flow. Countering our naive expectations, we found that the most
effective method does not rely on the rest-mass density distribution nor on the
fluid that is unbound, but simply distributes tracers uniformly in rest-mass
density. This prescription leads to the closest matching with the information
obtained from the hydrodynamical solution. When considering bound matter, we
demonstrate that tracers can provide insight into the fine details of the fluid
motion as they can be used to track the evolution of fluid elements or to
calculate the variation of quantities that are conserved along streamlines of
adiabatic flows.

electron-phonon system. We study a temperature regime in which the electrical
resistivity of this system exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and increases
linearly with temperature - a sign that there are no long-lived charged
quasiparticles - although the phonons remain well-defined quasiparticles. The
long-lived phonons determine $\lambda_L$, rendering it parametrically smaller
than the theoretical upper-bound $\lambda_L \ll \lambda_{max}=2\pi T/\hbar$.
Significantly, the chaos properties seem to be intrinsic - $\lambda_L$ and
$v_B$ are the same for electronic and phononic operators. We consider two
models - one in which the phonons are dispersive, and one in which they are
dispersionless. In either case, we find that $\lambda_L$ is proportional to the
inverse phonon lifetime, and $v_B$ is proportional to the effective phonon
velocity. The thermal and chaos diffusion constants, $D_E$ and $D_L\equiv
v_B^2/\lambda_L$, are always comparable, $D_E \sim D_L$. In the dispersive
phonon case, the charge diffusion constant $D_C$ satisfies $D_L\gg D_C$, while
in the dispersionless case $D_L \ll D_C$.

synthesis simulations we predict the likelihood of a companion star being
present when these massive stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae

outer hydrogen and possibly helium layers before explosion. We use these
results to interpret new Hubble Space Telescope observations of the site of the
broad-lined Type Ic SN 2002ap, 14 years post-explosion. For a subsolar
metallicity consistent with SN 2002ap, we expect a main-sequence companion
present in about two thirds of all stripped-envelope SNe and a compact
companion (likely a stripped helium star or a white dwarf/neutron star/black
hole) in about 5% of cases. About a quarter of progenitors are single at
explosion (originating from initially single stars, mergers or disrupted
systems). All the latter scenarios require a massive progenitor, inconsistent
with earlier studies of SN 2002ap. Our new, deeper upper limits exclude the
presence of a main-sequence companion star $>8$-$10$ Msun, ruling out about 40%
of all stripped-envelope SN channels. The most likely scenario for SN 2002ap
includes nonconservative binary interaction of a primary star initially
$\lesssim 23$ Msun. Although unlikely ($<$1% of the scenarios), we also discuss
the possibility of an exotic reverse merger channel for broad-lined Type Ic

regulating cooling losses, thus moderating the inflow of gas on to the central

demonstrate the validity of our implementation by comparing against simple

well as drive turbulence, albeit within the jet lobes only. Jet-driven
turbulence is, however, a largely ineffective heating source and is unlikely to
dominate the ICM heating budget even if the jet lobes efficiently fill the
cooling region, as it contains at most only a few per cent of the total

orbiting substructures, while inefficient at heating the ICM, drive large-scale
turbulence and when combined with jet feedback, result in line-of-sight
velocities and velocity dispersions consistent with the Hitomi observations of
the Perseus cluster.

in response to i) the inward pumping of angular momentum through deep and
slowly rotating convective layers; and ii) the winding up of a helical magnetic
field in radiative layers. Field winding can transport angular momentum
effectively even when the toroidal field is limited by kinking. Magnetic
helicity is pumped into a growing radiative layer from an adjacent convective
envelope (or core). The receding convective envelope that forms during the
early accretion phase of a massive star is the dominant source of helicity in
its core, yielding a $\sim 10^{13}$ G polar magnetic field in a collapsed
neutron star (NS) remnant. Using MESA models of various masses, we find that
the NS rotation varies significantly, from $P_{\rm NS} \sim 0.1-1$ s in a
13$\,M_\odot$ model to $P_{\rm NS} \sim 2$ ms in a $25\,M_\odot$ model with an
extended core. Stronger inward pumping of angular momentum is found in more
massive stars, due to the growing thickness of the convective shells that form
during the later stages of thermonuclear burning. On the other hand, stars that
lose enough mass to form blue supergiants in isolation end up as very slow
rotators. The tidal spin-up of a 40$\,M_\odot$ star by a massive binary
companion is found to dramatically increase the spin of the remnant black hole,
allowing a rotationally supported torus to form during the collapse. The

quantum computation and communication. Serious steps have therefore been taken
towards a formal framework for contextuality as an operational resource.
However, the most important component for a resource theory - a concrete,
explicit form for the free operations of contextuality - was still missing.
Here we provide such a component by introducing noncontextual wirings: a
physically-motivated class of contextuality-free operations with a friendly
parametrization. We characterize them completely for the general case of
black-box measurement devices with arbitrarily many inputs and outputs. As
applications, we show that the relative entropy of contextuality is a
contextuality monotone and that maximally contextual boxes that serve as
contextuality bits exist for a broad class of scenarios. Our results complete a
unified resource-theoretic framework for contextuality and Bell nonlocality.

easy-axis magnetic anisotropy along the $c$ axis due to the spin-orbit

The model Hamiltonian consisting of in-plane anisotropic exchange interactions,
the interlayer exchange interaction, and easy-axis single-ion anisotropy can
explain our inelastic neutron scattering data well. Strong Ising-like

duration signals like planet transits at the expense of long-term trends. This
long-term variability can be recovered in photometry from the Full Frame Images
(FFIs), a set of calibration data collected approximately monthly during the
Kepler mission. Here, we present f3, an open-source package to perform
photometry on the Kepler FFIs in order to detect changes in the brightness of
stars in the Kepler field of view over long time baselines. We apply this
package to a sample of 4,000 Sun-like stars with measured rotation periods. We
find $\approx 10\%$ of these targets have long-term variability in their
observed flux. For the majority of targets we identify the luminosity
variations are either correlated or anticorrelated with the short-term
variability due to starspots on the stellar surface. We find a transition
between anticorrelated (starspot-dominated) variability and correlated
(facula-dominated) variability between rotation periods of 15 and 25 days,
suggesting the transition between the two modes is complete for stars at the
age of the Sun. We also identify a sample of stars with apparently complete
cycles, as well as a collection of short-period binaries with extreme
photometric variation over the Kepler mission.

(WI) have important implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, and
this has drawn significant interest recently. Since the WI can generate a large
magnetic field from no initial field, the maximum magnitudes achieved can have
significant consequences for a number of applications. Hence, an understanding
of the detailed dynamics driving the nonlinear saturation of the WI is
important. This work considers the nonlinear saturation of the WI when
counter-streaming populations of initially unmagnetized electrons are perturbed
by a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the direction of streaming.
Previous works have found magnetic trapping to be important and connected
electron skin depth spatial scales to the nonlinear saturation of the WI. 2
Results presented in this work are consistent with these findings for a
high-temperature case. However, using a high-order continuum kinetic simulation
tool, this work demonstrates that, when the electron populations are colder, a
significant electrostatic potential develops that works with the magnetic field
to create potential wells. The electrostatic field develops due to transverse
flows induced by the WI, and in some cases is strengthened by a secondary
instability. This field plays a key role in saturation of the WI for colder
populations. The role of the electrostatic potential in Weibel instability
saturation has not been studied in detail previously.

from annihilation in dwarf galaxies with the Fermi-LAT. Viable solutions remain
at couplings of order unity, for singlet masses between the Higgs mass and
about 300 GeV, and at masses above $\sim$1 TeV. Only in the latter case can the
scalar singlet constitute all of dark matter. Frequentist analysis shows that
the low-mass resonance region, where the singlet is about half the mass of the
Higgs, can also account for all of dark matter, and remains viable. However,
Bayesian considerations show this region to be rather fine-tuned.

that stau co-annihilation is now ruled out in the CMSSM at more than 95\%

and show that the model leads to a period of accelerated expansion with an
exit. Further, we compute the scalar and tensor power spectrum for the model

statistics, primarily since estimating the precise relationship between the
covariates and the response is of great importance in many scientific
disciplines. However, most of theory and methods developed towards this goal
for the linear model invoke the assumption of iid sub-Gaussian covariates and
errors. This paper analyzes the theoretical properties of Sure Independence
Screening (SIS) (Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008)

covariates and errors. We also introduce a generalized least squares screening
(GLSS) procedure which utilizes the serial correlation present in the data. By
utilizing this serial correlation when estimating our marginal effects, GLSS is
shown to outperform SIS in many cases. For both procedures we prove sure
screening properties, which depend on the moment conditions, and the strength
of dependence in the error and covariate processes, amongst other factors.
Additionally, combining these screening procedures with the adaptive Lasso is
analyzed. Dependence is quantified by functional dependence measures (Wu [Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 14150-14154]), and the results rely on the use
of Nagaev-type and exponential inequalities for dependent random variables. We
also conduct simulations to demonstrate the finite sample performance of these

tourists, and yet tourists generate an enormous quantity of data (Big Data)
when they visit cities. These data sources can be used to track their presence
through their activities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the digital
footprint of urban tourists through Big Data. Unlike other papers that use a
single data source, this article examines three sources of data to reflect
different tourism activities in cities: Panoramio (sightseeing), Foursquare
(consumption), and Twitter (being connected). Tourist density in the three data
sources is compared via maps, correlation analysis (OLS) and spatial
self-correlation analysis (Global Moran's I statistic and LISA). Finally the
data are integrated using cluster analysis and combining the spatial clusters
identified in the LISA analysis in the different data sources. The results show
that the data from the three activities are partly spatially redundant and
partly complementary, and allow the characterisation of multifunction tourist
spaces (with several activities) and spaces specialising in one or various
activities (for example, sightseeing and consumption). The case study analysed
(Madrid) reveals a significant presence of tourists in the city centre, and
increasing specialisation from the centre outwards towards the periphery. The
main conclusion of the paper is that it is not sufficient to use one data
source to analyse the presence of tourists in cities; several must be used in a
complementary manner.

paper, we propose a novel adaptive sample size second-order method, which
reduces the cost of computing the Hessian by solving a sequence of ERM problems
corresponding to a subset of samples and lowers the cost of computing the
Hessian inverse using a truncated eigenvalue decomposition. We show that while
we geometrically increase the size of the training set at each stage, a single
iteration of the truncated Newton method is sufficient to solve the new ERM
within its statistical accuracy. Moreover, for a large number of samples we are
allowed to double the size of the training set at each stage, and the proposed
method subsequently reaches the statistical accuracy of the full training set
approximately after two effective passes. In addition to this theoretical
result, we show empirically on a number of well known data sets that the
proposed truncated adaptive sample size algorithm outperforms stochastic
alternatives for solving ERM problems.

function, based on the scalar singlet model of dark matter. We examine the

dimensionality of the sampling problem. We evaluate performance on four
metrics: optimality of the best fit found, completeness in exploring the
best-fit region, number of likelihood evaluations, and total runtime. For
Bayesian posterior estimation at high resolution, T-Walk provides the most
accurate and timely mapping of the full parameter space. For profile likelihood

finite graph G with n colors is a polynomial in n, called the chromatic
polynomial of G. Read conjectured in 1968 that for any graph G, the sequence of
absolute values of coefficients of the chromatic polynomial is unimodal: it
goes up, hits a peak, and then goes down. Read's conjecture was proved by June
Huh in a 2012 paper making heavy use of methods from algebraic geometry. Huh's
result was subsequently refined and generalized by Huh and Katz, again using
substantial doses of algebraic geometry. Both papers in fact establish
log-concavity of the coefficients, which is stronger than unimodality.
  The breakthroughs of Huh and Huh-Katz left open the more general Rota-Welsh
conjecture where graphs are generalized to (not necessarily representable)
matroids and the chromatic polynomial of a graph is replaced by the
characteristic polynomial of a matroid. The Huh and Huh-Katz techniques are not
applicable in this level of generality, since there is no underlying algebraic
geometry to which to relate the problem. But in 2015 Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz
announced a proof of the Rota-Welsh conjecture based on a novel approach
motivated by but not making use of any results from algebraic geometry. The
authors first prove that the Rota-Welsh conjecture would follow from
combinatorial analogues of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem and Hodge-Riemann
relations in algebraic geometry. They then implement an elaborate inductive
procedure to prove the combinatorial Hard Lefschetz Theorem and Hodge-Riemann
relations using purely combinatorial arguments.

interact over a flow-aligned magnetic field has been recently investigated [PoP
\textbf{23}, 062122 (2016)]. The analysis is here extended to the case of an
arbitrarily tilted magnetic field. The two plasma shells are initially cold and
identical. For any angle $\theta \in [0,\pi/2]$ between the field and the
initial flow, the hierarchy of unstable modes is numerically determined in
terms of the initial Lorentz factor of the shells $\gamma_0$, and the field
strength as measured by a parameter denoted $\sigma$. For $\theta=0$, four
different kinds of mode are likely to lead the linear phase. The hierarchy
simplifies for larger $\theta$'s, partly because the Weibel instability can no
longer be cancelled in this regime. For $\theta>0.78$ (44$^\circ$) and in the
relativistic regime, the Weibel instability always govern the interaction. In
the non-relativistic regime, the hierarchy becomes $\theta$-independent because
the interaction turns to be field-independent. As a result, the two-stream
instability becomes the dominant one, regardless of the field obliquity.

out-of-equilibrium collective oscillations of a macromolecule is described as a
classical phonon condensation phenomenon. If a macromolecule is modeled as an
open system, that is, it is subjected to an external energy supply and is in
contact with a thermal bath to dissipate the excess energy, the internal
nonlinear couplings among the normal modes make the system undergo a
non-equilibrium phase transition when the energy input rate exceeds a threshold
value. This transition takes place between a state where the energy is
incoherently distributed among the normal modes, to a state where the input
energy is channeled into the lowest frequency mode entailing a coherent
oscillation of the entire molecule. The model put forward in the present work
is derived as the classical counterpart of a quantum model proposed long time
ago by H. Fr\""ohlich in the attempt to explain the huge speed of enzymatic
reactions. In the second part of the present paper (experimental), we show that
such a phenomenon is actually possible. Two different and complementary THz
near-field spectroscopic techniques, a plasmonic rectenna, and a micro-wire
near-field probe, have been used in two different labs to get rid of artefacts.
By considering a aqueous solution of a model protein, the BSA (Bovine Serum
Albumin), we found that this protein displays a remarkable absorption feature
around 0.314 THz, when driven in a stationary out-of-thermal equilibrium state
by means of optical pumping. The experimental outcomes are in very good
qualitative agreement with the theory developed in the first part, and in
excellent quantitative agreement with a theoretical result allowing to identify
the observed spectral feature with a collective oscillation of the entire

a new method to forecast the future movements of Standard & Poor's 500 Index

companies by connecting them with links whose weights are given by the mutual
information of 60-minute price movements of the pairs of the companies with the
consecutive 5,340 minutes price records. We showed that the changes in the
strength distributions of the networks provide an important information on the
network's future movements. We built several metrics using the strength
distributions and network measurements such as centrality, and we combined the
best two predictors by performing a linear combination. We found that the
combined predictor and the changes in S&P 500 show a quadratic relationship,
and it allows us to predict the amplitude of the one step future change in S&P
500. The result showed significant fluctuations in S&P 500 Index when the
combined predictor was high. In terms of making the actual index predictions,
we built ARIMA models. We found that adding the network measurements into the
ARIMA models improves the model accuracy. These findings are useful for
financial market policy makers as an indicator based on which they can
interfere with the markets before the markets make a drastic change, and for
quantitative investors to improve their forecasting models.

stellar mass via major mergers throughout their evolution. While pair fractions
are found to agree with those predicted by the Henriques et al. (2014)

carrier, studies have associated SHBG in modulating behavioral aspects related
to sexual receptivity. Among steroids, estradiol (17\b{eta}-estradiol,
oestradiol or E2) is well recognized as the most active endogenous female
hormone, exerting important roles in reproductive and nonreproductive
functions. Thus, in this study we aimed to employ molecular dynamics (MD) and
docking techniques for quantifying the interaction energy between a complex
aqueous solution, composed by different salts, SHBG and E2. Due to glucose
concentration resembles those observed in diabetic levels, special emphasis was
devoted to uncover the main consequences of this carbohydrate on the SHBG and
E2 molecules. We also examined possible energetic changes due to solution on
the binding energy of SHBG-E2 complex. In this framework, our calculations
uncovered a remarkable interaction energy between glucose and SHBG surface.
Surprisingly, we also observed solute components movement toward SHBG yielding
clusters surrounding the protein. This finding, corroborated by the higher
energy and shorter distance found between glucose and SHBG, suggests a scenario
in favor of a detainment state. In addition, in spite of protein superficial
area increment it does not exerted modification on binding site area nor over
binding energy SHBG-E2 complex. Finally, our calculations also highlighted an
interaction between E2 and glucose when the hormone was immersed in the

  scalar-input differential systems",,,,,"math.OC math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider nonlinear scalar-input differential control systems in the
vicinity of an equilibrium. When the linearized system at the equilibrium is
controllable, the nonlinear system is smoothly small-time locally controllable,
i.e., whatever $m>0$ and $T>0$, the state can reach a whole neighborhood of the
equilibrium at time $T$ with controls arbitrary small in $C^m$-norm. When the
linearized system is not controllable, we prove that small-time local
controllability cannot be recovered from the quadratic expansion and that the
following quadratic alternative holds.
  Either the state is constrained to live within a smooth strict invariant
manifold, up to a cubic residual, or the quadratic order adds a signed drift in
the evolution with respect to this manifold. In the second case, the quadratic
drift holds along an explicit Lie bracket of length $(2k+1)$, it is quantified
in terms of an $H^{-k}$-norm of the control, it holds for controls small in
$W^{2k,\infty}$-norm. These spaces are optimal for general nonlinear systems
and are slightly improved in the particular case of control-affine systems.
  Unlike other works based on Lie-series formalism, our proof is based on an
explicit computation of the quadratic terms by means of appropriate
transformations. In particular, it does not require that the vector fields
defining the dynamic are smooth. We prove that $C^3$ regularity is sufficient
for our alternative to hold.
  This work underlines the importance of the norm used in the smallness
assumption on the control: depending on this choice of functional setting, the
same system may or may not be small-time locally controllable, even though the
state lives within a finite dimensional space.

preferences. It is being used in many settings, such as school choice, course
allocations and residency matches. In some cases, several `items' are given to
each participant. Without having any information on the underlying cardinal
utilities, arguing about fairness of allocation requires extending the ordinal
item ranking to ordinal bundle ranking. The most commonly used such extension
is stochastic dominance (SD), where a bundle X is preferred over a bundle Y if
its score is better according to all additive score functions. SD is a very
conservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while
many allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on
the underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference
between two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at
the bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call
diminishing differences (DD), where X is preferred over Y if its score is
better according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption.
We give a full characterization of allocations that are
necessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption.
Based on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for
finding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation if it exists. Using
simulations, we show that with high probability, a necessarily-proportional
allocation does not exist but a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation exists,
and moreover, that allocation is proportional according to the underlying
cardinal utilities. We also consider chore allocation under the analogous
condition --- increasing-differences.

  Systems","Technical report",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An essential step for achieving multiplexing gain in MIMO downlink systems is
to collect accurate channel state information (CSI) from the users.
Traditionally, CSIs have to be collected before any data can be transmitted.
Such a sequential scheme incurs a large feedback overhead, which substantially
limits the multiplexing gain especially in a network with a large number of
users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate the feedback
overhead by leveraging the recently developed Full-duplex radios. Our approach
is based on the key observation that using Full-duplex radios, when the
base-station (BS) is collecting CSI of one user through the uplink channel, it
can use the downlink channel to simultaneously transmit data to other
(non-interfering) users for which CSIs are already known. By allowing
concurrent channel probing and data transmission, our scheme can potentially
achieve a higher throughput compared to traditional schemes using Half-duplex
radios. The new flexibility introduced by our scheme, however, also leads to
fundamental challenges in achieving throughout optimal scheduling. In this
paper, we make an initial effort to this important problem by considering a
simplified group interference model. We develop a throughput optimal scheduling
policy with complexity $O((N/I)^I)$, where $N$ is the number of users and $I$
is the number of user groups. To further reduce the complexity, we propose a
greedy policy with complexity $O(N\log N)$ that not only achieves at least 2/3
of the optimal throughput region, but also outperforms any feasible Half-duplex
solutions. We derive the throughput gain offered by Full-duplex under different
system parameters and show the advantage of our algorithms through numerical
studies.

forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national
level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series
methods (Shang and Hyndman, 2017) to reconcile age-specific mortality
forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods
to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of
mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different
ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality
rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate
the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the
independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods
are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific
mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to
allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality
rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for
estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups,

of 0.1"") are highly desirable yet very rare so far. In this work, we present a
detailed observation of a pre-eruption evolution of a filament obtained by the
1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). One end
of the filament is anchored at the sunspot in NOAA active region (AR) 11515,
which is well observed by NST H$\alpha$ off-bands four hours before till one
hour after the filament eruption. A M1.6 flare is associated with the eruption.
We observed persistent downflowing materials along the H$\alpha$ multi-threaded
component of the loop towards the AR end during the pre-eruption phase. We
traced the trajectories of plasma blobs along the H$\alpha$ threads and
obtained the plane-of-sky velocity of 45 km s$^{-1}$ on average. We further
estimated the real velocities of the downflows and the altitude of the filament
by matching the observed H$\alpha$ threads with magnetic field lines
extrapolated from a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model. Observation of
chromospheric brightenings (BZs) at the footpoints of the falling plasma blobs
is also presented in the paper. The lower limit of the kinetic energy per
second of the downflows through the BZs is found to be $\sim$ 10$^{21}$ erg.
Larger FOV observations from BBSO full disk H$\alpha$ images show that the AR
end of the filament started ascending four hours before the flare. We attribute
the observed downflows at the AR end of the filament to the draining effect of
the filament rising prior to its eruption. During the slow-rise phase, the
downflows continuously drained away $\sim$ 10$^{15}$g mass from the filament
over a few hours, which is believed to be essential for the instability at
last, and could be an important precursor of eruptive events.

integral approach, combining different methods to evaluate correlation
functions from complex solutions for the Liouville field, and (b) via the
conformal block expansion. This latter approach identifies an integral over the
continuum of normalizable states and a sum over an infinite tower of lighter
discrete states, whose contribution we extract by analytically continuing
standard results to our HHLL setting. The sum over this tower reproduces the
sum over those complex saddlepoints of the path integral that contribute to the
correlator. Our path integral computations reveal that when the two light
operators are inserted at equal time in radial quantization, the leading-order
HHLL correlator is independent of their separation, and more generally that at
this order there is no short-distance singularity as the two light operators
approach each other. The conformal block expansion likewise shows that in the
discrete sum short-distance singularities are indeed absent for all
intermediate states that contribute. In particular, the Virasoro vacuum block,
which would have been singular at short distances, is not exchanged. The
separation-independence of equal-time correlators is due to cancelations
between the discrete contributions. These features lead to a Lorentzian
singularity that, in conformal theories with anti-de Sitter (AdS) duals, would
be associated to locality below the AdS scale.

algorithm, diminishing batch normalization (DBN), where we update the BN
parameters in a diminishing moving average way. BN is very effective in
accelerating the convergence of a neural network training phase that it has
become a common practice. Our proposed DBN algorithm remains the overall
structure of the original BN algorithm while introduces a weighted averaging
update to some trainable parameters. We provide an analysis of the convergence
of the DBN algorithm that converges to a stationary point with respect to
trainable parameters. Our analysis can be easily generalized for original BN
algorithm by setting some parameters to constant. To the best knowledge of
authors, this analysis is the first of its kind for convergence with Batch
Normalization introduced. We analyze a two-layer model with arbitrary
activation function. The primary challenge of the analysis is the fact that
some parameters are updated by gradient while others are not. The convergence
analysis applies to any activation function that satisfies our common
assumptions. In the numerical experiments, we test the proposed algorithm on
complex modern CNN models with stochastic gradients and ReLU activation. We
observe that DBN outperforms the original BN algorithm on MNIST, NI and
CIFAR-10 datasets with reasonable complex FNN and CNN models.

varies according to the level of other covariates and often has important
implications in decision making. When there are tens or hundreds of covariates,
it becomes necessary to use the observed data to select a simpler model for
effect modification and then make valid statistical inference. We propose a two
stage procedure to solve this problem. First, we use Robinson's transformation
to decouple the nuisance parameters from the treatment effect of interest and
use machine learning algorithms to estimate the nuisance parameters. Next,
after plugging in the estimates of the nuisance parameters, we use the Lasso to
choose a low-complexity model for effect modification. Compared to a full model
consisting of all the covariates, the selected model is much more
interpretable. Compared to the univariate subgroup analyses, the selected model
greatly reduces the number of false discoveries. We show that the conditional
selective inference for the selected model is asymptotically valid given the
rate assumptions in classical semiparametric regression. Extensive simulation
studies are conducted to verify the asymptotic results and an epidemiological
application is used to demonstrate the method.

systems is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The credit assignment
problem, i.e. determining the local contribution of each synapse to the
network's global output error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically
plausible local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks
implementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of number of
neurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from rate models. Finally,
these networks should be robust to noise and neural deaths in order to sustain
these representations in the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We
approach this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking
networks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control theory. Local learning rules are
ensured by feeding back into the network its own error, resulting in a synaptic
plasticity rule depending solely on presynaptic inputs and post-synaptic
feedback. The spiking efficiency and robustness of the network are guaranteed
by maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory balance, ensuring that each spike
represents a local projection of the global output error and minimizes a loss
function. The resulting networks can learn to implement complex dynamics with
very small numbers of neurons and spikes, exhibit the same spike train
variability as observed experimentally, and are extremely robust to noise and
neuronal loss.

step, the processing of the current example depends on the parameters learned
from the previous examples. Prior approaches to parallelizing linear learners
using SGD, such as HOGWILD! and ALLREDUCE, do not honor these dependencies
across threads and thus can potentially suffer poor convergence rates and/or
poor scalability. This paper proposes SYMSGD, a parallel SGD algorithm that, to
a first-order approximation, retains the sequential semantics of SGD. Each
thread learns a local model in addition to a model combiner, which allows local
models to be combined to produce the same result as what a sequential SGD would
have produced. This paper evaluates SYMSGD's accuracy and performance on 6
datasets on a shared-memory machine shows upto 11x speedup over our heavily
optimized sequential baseline on 16 cores and 2.2x, on average, faster than
HOGWILD!.

and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in
neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical
systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a
recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by
the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent network, e.g. the
contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined
based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools
from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that
neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic
plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established
neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both
their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons
should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the
circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and
produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally.
Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and
robust computation at the population level.

recently constructed infinitely many pairs of non-commensurable, non-arithmetic

begin with the same first $m$ geodesic lengths. In the present paper, we show
that this phenomenon is surprisingly common in the arithmetic setting. In

methods. In applied mathematics, where much of the current theoretical work on
approximation resides, the inputs are considered to be observed exactly. The
prevailing philosophy is that while the exact problem is, regrettably,
unsolvable, any approximation should be as small as possible. However, from a
statistical perspective, an approximate or regularized solution may be
preferable to the exact one. Regularization formalizes a trade-off between
fidelity to the data and adherence to prior knowledge about the data-generating
process such as smoothness or sparsity. The resulting estimator tends to be
more useful, interpretable, and suitable as an input to other methods.

channel, the transmitter may be unable to control precisely the number of

always has mass points at zero and the maximum number of particles that can be
released. We then consider diffusive particle transport, derive the capacity

that when the transmitter cannot generate particles at a high rate, the optimal

then functions of the class-appropriate transition dynamic. Unfortunately,
these dynamics are generically nonnormal, nondiagonalizable, singular, and so
on. Tractably analyzing these dynamics relies on adapting the recently

several RNN architectures such as simple RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We
compare and evaluate our proposed RNN model with uncompressed RNN model on
sequence classification and sequence prediction tasks. Our proposed RNNs with

Pop~III star formation rate density (SFRD), which peaks at $\sim 10^{-3}\ {\rm

suggests that, while individual halos can suppress in-situ Pop~III star

Pop~III star formation. The maximum enrichment from Pop~III star formation in
star forming dark matter halos is $Z\sim10^{-2}\ Z_\odot$, whereas the minimum

Fortunately, in many applications, the target function is separable or
partially separable. This feature motivated us to develop a new method, divide
and conquer (D&C), for symbolic regression, in which the target function is
divided into a number of sub-functions and the sub-functions are then
determined by any of a GP algorithm. The separability is probed by a new
proposed technique, Bi-Correlation test (BiCT). D&C powered GP has been tested
on some real-world applications, and the study shows that D&C can help GP to

Here we show that when driven atoms are in the collectively strongly coupled
regime with the cavity, exhibiting vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS), lasing is
observed for the emitted light, red detuned from atomic transition. This is
demonstrated experimentally by the observation of a lasing threshold,
polarisation purity, mode purity, and line narrowing. The laser is created
spontaneously by the atomic emission into the cavity mode, which stimulates
cavity emission, and is capable of operating continuously without a seed laser.
The gain mechanism is understood by theoretical modelling and illustrates why
the observed lasing is generic to the coupled system. This opens up a range of
possibilities of using the phenomenon for a variety of new measurements.

which occurs at $T\sim$90 K is seen in the GGA calculations, but its degree
($\delta n \sim 0.1$ electron) is far from what one would expect from naive
expectations based on the formal ionic valences. The mechanism of the charge
ordering is argued to be related with a sizable kinetic energy gain due to
formation of two molecular orbitals in short Nb$^{3+}$-Nb$^{3+}$ dimers caused
by a strong nonlinearity of the distance dependence on electron hopping. We
think that this mechanism of charge ordering, stabilized not by decrease of
interaction energy, but rather by the gain in kinetic energy, may be operative
in many other systems, especially consisting of structural dimers.

based on the mechanism. The first one is the intrinsic Hall effect due to the
Berry curvature in momentum space; this is a Hall effect that solely arises
from the band structure of solids. On the other hand, another contribution to
the Hall effect, so-called extrinsic mechanism, comes from impurity scatterings
such as skew scattering and side jump; for the extrinsic mechanism, the
spin-orbit interaction of the impurity ions is often required. These two
mechanisms are often discussed separately; the intrinsic Hall effect is
dominant in the intermediate resistivity region while the latter, i.e., skew
scattering, becomes important in the clean limit. In this work, it is shown
theoretically that the non-commutative nature of the real-space coordinates in
the presence of the Berry curvature causes the skew scattering by the
nonmagnetic impurity without relativistic spin-orbit interactions, in sharp
contrast to the conventional cases.

the class of weak (distributional) solutions. Specifically, we find a sequence
$\tau_M \to \infty$ of positive stopping times for which the Euler system
admits infinitely many solutions originating from the same initial data. The
solutions are weak in the PDE sense but strong in the probabilistic sense,

convection parameter. We adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as
$\dot{M}=\dot{M}_{out}{(\frac{r}{r_{out}})^{s}}$ with $s> 0$ to investigate the
influence of outflow on the structure of inflow where $s$ is a constant and
indication the effect of wind. Also, we have studied the radiation spectrum and
temperature of CDAFs. The thermal bermsstrahlung emission as a radiation
mechanism is taken into account for calculating the spectra emitted by the
CDAFs. The energy that powers bremsstrahlung emission at large radii is
provided by convective transport from small radii and viscous and resistivity
dissipation. Our results indicate that the disc rotates slower and accretes
faster, it becomes hotter and thicker for stronger wind. By increasing all
component of magnetic field, the disc rotates faster and accretes slower while
it becomes hotter and thicker. We show that the outflow parameter and all
component of magnetic field have the same effects on the luminosity of the
disc. We compare the dynamical structure of the disc in two different solutions
(with and without resistivity parameter). We show that only the radial infall
velocity and the surface density could changed by resistivity parameter
obviously. Increasing the effect of wind increases the disc's temperature and
luminosity of the disc. The effect of magnetic field is similar to the effect
of wind in the disc's temperature and luminosity of the disc, but the influence

spaces corresponding to JT models carrying a Lie group symmetry are identified,
and their invariants used to reduce their adiabatic potential energy surfaces
into orbit spaces. Each orbit consists of a set of JT distorted molecular
structures with equal adiabatic electronic spectrum. Molecular motion may be
decomposed into pseudorota- tional and radial. The former preserves the orbit,
while the latter maps an orbit into another. The dimensionality and topology of
the internal space of each orbit depends on the number of degener- ate states
in its adiabatic electronic spectra. Furthermore, qualitatively different
pseudorotational modes occur in orbits of different types. We also provide a
simple proof that the electronic spectrum for the space of JT minimum-energy
structures (trough) displays a universality predicted by the epikernel
principle. This result is in turn used to prove the topological equivalence
between bosonic (fermionic) JT troughs and real (quaternionic) projective
spaces, a conclusion which has outstanding physical consequences, as explained
in our work. The relevance of our study for the more common case of JT systems
with only discrete point group symmetry, and for generic asymmetric molecular
systems with conical intersections involving more than two states is likewise
discussed. In particular, we show that JT models with continuous symmetries
present the simplest models of conical intersections among an arbitrary number
of electronic state crossings.

prediction with large datasets. It facilitates optimal spatial prediction
(kriging) on the most commonly used manifolds (in Euclidean space and on the
surface of the sphere), for both spatial and spatio-temporal fields. It differs
from many of the packages for spatial modelling and prediction by avoiding
stationary and isotropic covariance and variogram models, instead constructing
a spatial random effects (SRE) model on a fine-resolution discretised spatial
domain. The discrete element is known as a basic areal unit (BAU), whose
introduction in the software leads to several practical advantages. The
software can be used to (i) integrate multiple observations with different
supports with relative ease; (ii) obtain exact predictions at millions of
prediction locations (without conditional simulation); and (iii) distinguish
between measurement error and fine-scale variation at the resolution of the
BAU, thereby allowing for reliable uncertainty quantification. The temporal
component is included by adding another dimension. A key component of the SRE
model is the specification of spatial or spatio-temporal basis functions; in
the package, they can be generated automatically or by the user. The package
also offers automatic BAU construction, an expectation-maximisation (EM)
algorithm for parameter estimation, and functionality for prediction over any
user-specified polygons or BAUs. Use of the package is illustrated on several
spatial and spatio-temporal datasets, and its predictions and the model it
implements are extensively compared to others commonly used for spatial
prediction and modelling.

3D CNN. To our best knowledge, this is the first application of 3D CNN in
skeleton-based action recognition. Our method consists of three stages. First,
skeleton joints are mapped into a 3D coordinate space and then encoding the
spatial and temporal information, respectively. Second, 3D CNN models are
seperately adopted to extract deep features from two streams. Third, to enhance
the ability of deep features to capture global relationships, we extend every
stream into multitemporal version. Extensive experiments on the SmartHome

outperforms most of RNN-based methods, which verify the complementary property
between spatial and temporal information and the robustness to noise.

that, despite being more powerful, the realizability problem for PROMPT-LTL is
not harder than its LTL counterpart. For asynchronous systems we have to
express scheduling assumptions and therefore consider an assume-guarantee
synthesis problem. As asynchronous distributed synthesis is already undecidable
for LTL, we give a semi-decision procedure for the PROMPT-LTL assume-guarantee
synthesis problem based on bounded synthesis. Finally, we show that our results
extend to the stronger logics PLTL and PLDL.

interactions beyond nearest neighbors can be essential to describe stability of
skyrmionic spin structures. We focus on the prototypical film system

constraint of classical probability theory that if one assigns a prior
probability of 0 or 1 to a hypothesis, then the posterior has to be 0 or 1 as
well (this is a straightforward implication of how Bayes's rule works).
Relatedly, hypotheses with a very low prior cannot be updated to have a very
high posterior without a tremendous amount of new evidence to support them (or
to make other possibilities highly improbable). Cromwell's rule appears at odds
with our intuition of how humans update probabilities. In this work, we report
two simple decision making experiments, which seem to be inconsistent with
Cromwell's rule. Quantum probability theory, the rules for how to assign
probabilities from the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, provides an
alternative framework for probabilistic inference. An advantage of quantum
probability theory is that it is not subject to Cromwell's rule and it can
accommodate changes from zero or very small priors to significant posteriors.
We outline a model of decision making, based on quantum theory, which can
accommodate the changes from priors to posteriors, observed in our experiments.

rocky/icy cores. Observations indicate that such exoplanets exist at a broad
range of orbital radii, but it is not known whether they accreted their

viscous discs that undergo gaseous envelope accretion in situ with orbital
radii in the range $0.1-10\rm au$. Additionally, we determine the long-term
evolution of the planets that had no runaway gas accretion phase after disc
dispersal. We find: (i) Planets with $5 \rm M_{\oplus}$ cores never undergo
runaway accretion. The most massive envelope contained $2.8 \rm M_{\oplus}$
with the planet orbiting at $10 \rm au$. (ii) Accretion is more efficient onto
$10 \rm M_{\oplus}$ and $15 \rm M_{\oplus}$ cores. For orbital radii $a_{\rm p}
\ge 0.5 \rm au$, $15 \rm M_{\oplus}$ cores always experienced runaway gas
accretion. For $a_{\rm p} \ge 5 \rm au$, all but one of the $10 \rm M_{\oplus}$
cores experienced runaway gas accretion. No planets experienced runaway growth
at $a_{\rm p} = 0.1 \rm au$. (iii) We find that, after disc dispersal, planets
with significant gaseous envelopes cool and contract on Gyr time-scales, the
contraction time being sensitive to the opacity assumed. Our results indicate
that Hot Jupiters with core masses $\lesssim 15 \rm M_{\oplus}$ at $\lesssim
0.1 \rm au$ likely accreted their gaseous envelopes at larger distances and
migrated inwards. Consistently with the known exoplanet population,
Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes at small radii during the disc lifetime, accrete
only modest gaseous envelopes.

approach. Rodlike particles were considered as linear $k$-mers of two mutually
perpendicular orientations ($k_x$- and $k_y$-mers) on a square lattice. These
$k_x$- and $k_y$-mers were treated as species of two kinds. A random sequential
adsorption model was used to produce an initial homogeneous distribution of
$k$-mers. The concentration of $k$-mers, $p$, was varied in the range from 0.1
to the jamming concentration, $p_j$. By means of the Monte Carlo technique,
translational diffusion of the $k$-mers was simulated as a random walk, while
rotational diffusion was ignored. We demonstrated that the diffusion
coefficients are strongly anisotropic and nonlinearly concentration-dependent.
For sufficiently large concentrations (packing densities) and $k \geq 6$, the
system tends toward a well-organized steady state. Boundary conditions (BC)
predetermine the final state of the system. When periodic BCs are applied along
both directions of the square lattice, the system tends to a steady state in
the form of diagonal stripes. The formation of stripe domains takes longer time
the larger the lattice size, and is observed only for concentrations above a
particular critical value. When insulating (zero flux) BCs are applied along
both directions of the square lattice, each kind of $k$-mer tries to completely
occupy a half of the lattice divided by a diagonal, e.g., $k_x$-mers locate in
the upper left corner, while the $k_y$-mers are situated in the lower right
corner (""yin-yang"" pattern). From time to time, regions built of $k_x$- and
$k_y$-mers exchange their locations through irregular patterns. When mixed BCs
are used (periodic BCs are applied along one direction whereas insulating BCs
are applied along the other one), the system still tends to form the stripes,
but they are unstable and change their spatial orientation.

to optimality by simultaneous primal and dual separation, the practical
efficacy of which is shown by a computational study.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel model of robust flows which provides a
compromise between stochastic and robust optimization by assigning
probabilities to groups of scenarios. The new model can be solved by the same

relevance. Here we investigate a coupled nonlinear delay differential system
modeling theEl-Ni\~no/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which arises
through the strong coupling of the ocean-atmosphere system. In particular, we
study the temporal patterns of the sea surface temperature anomaly of the two
sub-regions. For identical sub-regions we typically observe a co-existence of
amplitude and oscillator death behavior for low delays, and heterogeneous
oscillations for high delays, when inter-region coupling is weak. For moderate
inter-region coupling strengths one obtains homogeneous oscillations for
sufficiently large delays and amplitude death for small delays. When the
inter-region coupling strength is large, oscillations are suppressed
altogether, implying that strongly coupled sub-regions do not exhibit ENSO-like
oscillations. Further we observe that larger strengths of self-delay coupling
favours oscillations, while oscillations die out when the delayed coupling is
weak. This indicates again that delayed feedback, incorporating oceanic wave
transit effects, is the principal cause of oscillatory behaviour. So the effect
of trapped ocean waves propagating in a basin with closed boundaries is crucial
for the emergence of ENSO. Further, we show how non-uniformity in delays, and
difference in the strengths of the self-delay coupling of the sub-regions,
affect the rise of oscillations. Interestingly we find that larger delays and
self-delay coupling strengths lead to oscillations, while strong inter-region
coupling kills oscillatory behaviour. Thus, we find that coupling sub-regions
has a very significant effect on the emergence of oscillations, and strong
coupling typically suppresses oscillations, while weak coupling of
non-identical sub-regions can induce oscillations, thereby favouring ENSO.

Lyapunov exponents and their associated covariant Lyapunov vectors have been
proposed as tools for supporting the understanding of critical transitions in
chaotic dynamical systems. However, it is in general not clear how the
statistical properties of dynamical systems change across a boundary crisis
during which a chaotic attractor collides with a saddle. This behavior is
investigated here for a boundary crisis in the Lorenz flow, for which neither
the Lyapunov exponents nor the covariant Lyapunov vectors provide a criterion
for the crisis. Instead, the convergence of the time evolution of probability
densities to the invariant measure, governed by the semigroup of transfer
operators, is expected to slow down at the approach of the crisis. Such
convergence is described by the eigenvalues of the generator of this semigroup,
which can be divided into two families, referred to as the stable and unstable
Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, respectively. The former describes the convergence
of densities to the attractor (or escape from a repeller) and is estimated from
many short time series sampling the phase space. The latter is responsible for
the decay of correlations, or mixing, and can be estimated from a long times
series, invoking ergodicity. It is found numerically for the Lorenz flow that
the stable resonances do approach the imaginary axis during the crisis, as is
indicative of the loss of global stability of the attractor. On the other hand,
the unstable resonances, and a fortiori the decay of correlations, do not ag
the proximity of the crisis, thus questioning the usual design of early warning
indicators of boundary crises of chaotic attractors and the applicability of
response theory close to such crises.

of machine learning methods to the so-called domain shift, namely the
difference between source (training) and target (test) data distributions. In
particular, unsupervised domain adaptation assumes no labels are available in
the target domain. To this end, aligning second order statistics (covariances)
of target and source domains have proven to be an effective approach ti fill
the gap between the domains. However, covariance matrices do not form a
subspace of the Euclidean space, but live in a Riemannian manifold with
non-positive curvature, making the usual Euclidean metric suboptimal to measure
distances. In this paper, we extend the idea of training a neural network with
a constraint on the covariances of the hidden layer features, by rigorously
accounting for the curved structure of the manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices. The resulting loss function exploits a theoretically sound
geodesic distance on such manifold. Results show indeed the suboptimal nature
of the Euclidean distance. This makes us able to perform better than previous
approaches on the standard Office dataset, a benchmark for domain adaptation
techniques.

the resulting phase diagram is quite different from that of purely

half filling, patterns of AFM dimers dominate, where the effective electronic

from H-alpha/[N II] ratio. Although doubly-peaked emission profiles are rarely
found, line asymmetries often imply multiple velocity components along the line
of sight. This is especially true for the sodium absorption, and for the [O

to other known properties of the nebula and of its massive stars 9 Sgr,

example how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn about the
expected private training data; how the exploitation of additional data can
reveal private information in the original one; and how what looks like
unrelated features can teach us about each other. Confronted with this
challenge, in this paper we open a new line of research, where the security,
privacy, and fairness is learned and used in a closed environment. The goal is
to ensure that a given entity (e.g., the company or the government), trusted to
infer certain information with our data, is blocked from inferring protected
information from it. For example, a hospital might be allowed to produce
diagnosis on the patient (the positive task), without being able to infer the
gender of the subject (negative task). Similarly, a company can guarantee that
internally it is not using the provided data for any undesired task, an
important goal that is not contradicting the virtually impossible challenge of
blocking everybody from the undesired task. We design a system that learns to
succeed on the positive task while simultaneously fail at the negative one, and
illustrate this with challenging cases where the positive task is actually
harder than the negative one being blocked. Fairness, to the information in the
negative task, is often automatically obtained as a result of this proposed
approach. The particular framework and examples open the door to security,
privacy, and fairness in very important closed scenarios, ranging from private
data accumulation companies like social networks to law-enforcement and
hospitals.

energetic eruptive phenomena in our solar system and able to release a large
quantity of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar atmosphere into the solar
wind. When these high-speed magnetized plasmas along with the energetic
particles arrive at the Earth, they may interact with the magnetosphere and
ionosphere, and seriously affect the safety of human high-tech activities in
outer space. The travel time of a CME to 1 AU is about 1-3 days, while
energetic particles from the eruptions arrive even earlier. An efficient
forecast of these phenomena therefore requires a clear detection of CMEs/flares
at the stage as early as possible. To estimate the possibility of an eruption
leading to a CME/flare, we need to elucidate some fundamental but elusive
processes including in particular the origin and structures of CMEs/flares.
Understanding these processes can not only improve the prediction of the
occurrence of CMEs/flares and their effects on geospace and the heliosphere but
also help understand the mass ejections and flares on other solar-type stars.
The main purpose of this review is to address the origin and early structures
of CMEs/flares, from multi-wavelength observational perspective. First of all,
we start with the ongoing debate of whether the pre-eruptive configuration,
i.e., a helical magnetic flux rope (MFR), of CMEs/flares exists before the
eruption and then emphatically introduce observational manifestations of the
MFR. Secondly, we elaborate on the possible formation mechanisms of the MFR
through distinct ways. Thirdly, we discuss the initiation of the MFR and
associated dynamics during its evolution toward the CME/flare. Finally, we come
to some conclusions and put forward some prospects in the future.

equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. The hydro-kinetic equations
can be coupled to existing second order hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the
physics of these fluctuations, which become dominant near the critical point.
We use the hydro-kinetic equations to calculate the modifications of energy
momentum tensor by thermal fluctuations from the earliest moments and at late
times in Bjorken expansion. The solution to the kinetic equations precisely
determines the coefficient of the first fractional power ($\propto
\tau^{-3/2}$) in the energy momentum tensor gradient expansion. Numerically, we
find that the contribution to the longitudinal pressure from hydrodynamic
fluctuations is comparable to the second order hydrodynamic terms for typical
medium parameters used to simulate heavy ion collisions.

to an output. Instead, it often involves a systematic deduction by ruling out
other possible outcomes as a self-checking mechanism. In this paper, we
describe the design of a hybrid neural network for logical learning that is
similar to the human reasoning through the introduction of an auxiliary input,
namely the indicators, that act as the hints to suggest logical outcomes. We
generate these indicators by digging into the hidden information buried
underneath the original training data for direct or indirect suggestions. We
used the MNIST data to demonstrate the design and use of these indicators in a
convolutional neural network. We trained a series of such hybrid neural
networks with variations of the indicators. Our results show that these hybrid
neural networks are very robust in generating logical outcomes with inherently
higher prediction accuracy than the direct use of the original input and output
in apparent models. Such improved predictability with reassured logical
confidence is obtained through the exhaustion of all possible indicators to
rule out all illogical outcomes, which is not available in the apparent models.
Our logical learning process can effectively cope with the unknown unknowns
using a full exploitation of all existing knowledge available for learning. The
design and implementation of the hints, namely the indicators, become an
essential part of artificial intelligence for logical learning. We also
introduce an ongoing application setup for this hybrid neural network in an
autonomous grasping robot, namely as_DeepClaw, aiming at learning an optimized
grasping pose through logical learning.

three basic steps. Firstly, the explicit saliency map is obtained based on the

which maps the implicit saliency priors embedded into regional features with
the saliency values. Finally, the explicit semantic map and the implicit map
are adaptively fused to form a pixel-accurate saliency map which uniformly
covers the objects of interest. We further evaluate the proposed framework on
two challenging datasets, namely, ECSSD and HKUIS. The extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

charge in the MSSM and in the $Z_3$-symmetric NMSSM. The breakdown is triggered
by the charged states of the Higgs doublets acquiring vacuum expectation
values. In the MSSM, it is known that the presence of a charge conserving
minimum for the tree-level Higgs potential precludes a deeper (global)
charge-breaking minimum. We find that the inclusion of radiative correction to
the potential does not alter the situation while a deeper charge-conserving
minimum could arise, albeit with no major practical consequences. In the NMSSM
scenario, a charge-breaking global minimum, with or without an accompanying
charge-conserving deeper minimum, could appear even with the tree-level Higgs
potential thanks to the presence of a charge-neutral scalar state which
transforms as a singlet under the Standard Model gauge group. Use of the NMSSM
Higgs potential that includes both quantum and thermal corrections and the
requirement of a viable (stable or long-lived) vacuum that breaks the
electroweak symmetry, along with its compatibility with the latest Higgs data,
lead to nontrivial constraints on the NMSSM parameter space.

method for learning recurrent computational graphs. Truncated BPTT keeps the
computational benefits of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while relieving
the need for a complete backtrack through the whole data sequence at every
step. However, truncation favors short-term dependencies: the gradient estimate
of truncated BPTT is biased, so that it does not benefit from the convergence
guarantees from stochastic gradient theory. We introduce Anticipated Reweighted
Truncated Backpropagation (ARTBP), an algorithm that keeps the computational
benefits of truncated BPTT, while providing unbiasedness. ARTBP works by using
variable truncation lengths together with carefully chosen compensation factors
in the backpropagation equation. We check the viability of ARTBP on two tasks.
First, a simple synthetic task where careful balancing of temporal dependencies
at different scales is needed: truncated BPTT displays unreliable performance,
and in worst case scenarios, divergence, while ARTBP converges reliably.
Second, on Penn Treebank character-level language modelling, ARTBP slightly
outperforms truncated BPTT.

two-phase coexistence in the canonical ensemble to finite volume,
""measurements"" of the nucleus volume together with the pressure and chemical
potential of the surrounding fluid allows to extract the surface free energy of
the nucleus. Neither the knowledge of the (in general non-spherical) nucleus
shape nor of the angle-dependent interface tension is required for this task.
The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated for a variant of the
Asakura-Oosawa model for colloid-polymer mixtures, which form face-centered
cubic colloidal crystals. For a polymer to colloid size ratio of $0.15$, the
colloid packing fraction in the fluid phase can be varied from melt values to
zero by the variation of an effective attractive potential between the
colloids. It is found that the approximation of spherical crystal nuclei often
underestimates actual nucleation barriers significantly. Nucleation barriers
are found to scale as $\Delta F^*=(4\pi/3)^{1/3}\bar{\gamma}(V^*)^{2/3}+const.$
with the nucleus volume $V^*$, and the effective surface tension $\bar{\gamma}$
that accounts implicitly for the nonspherical shape can be precisely estimated.

Therefore, quite large volumes of experimental data as well as theoretical
descriptions have been accumulated. Although some of the formalisms are not so
easy to handle, the results agree impressively well with the data. The
objective of this paper is to review the actual status of both experimental and
theoretical investigations. Aiming at making this material accessible to a
large variety of readers, including young students and researchers, I gave some
details on the schematic models which are able to unveil the main features of
chirality in nuclei. Also, since most formalisms use a rigid triaxial rotor for
the nuclear system's core, I devoted some space to the semi-classical
description of the rigid triaxial as well as of the tilted triaxial rotor. In
order to answer the question whether the chiral phenomenon is spread over the
whole nuclear chart and whether it is specific only to a certain type of
nuclei, odd-odd, odd-even or even-even, the current results in the mass regions
of $A\sim 60,80,100,130,180,200$ are briefly described for all kinds of
odd/even-odd/even systems. The chiral geometry is a sufficient condition for a
system of proton-particle, neutron-hole and a triaxial rotor to have the
electromagnetic properties of chiral bands. In order to prove that such
geometry is not unique for generating magnetic bands with chiral features, I
presented a mechanism for a new type of chiral bands. One tries to underline
the fact that this rapidly developing field is very successful in pushing
forward nuclear structure studies.

reproduce the CO lines up to J~6, however, the higher rotational ladder
requires the presence of a separate source of excitation. We consider X-ray
heating by the AGN as a source of excitation, and find that it can reproduce
the observed CO Spectral Energy Distribution. By adopting a composite PDR+XDR

50Ti excesses, strongly suggesting a neutron-capture nucleosynthetic origin of
the 32S excess and thus the initial presence of radiogenic 32Si (t1/2=153 yr).
More importantly, we found that the 15N and 26Al excesses of AB1 grains form a
trend that extends to the region in the N-Al isotope plot occupied by C2

of the holographic principle and entropic force in physics. The vacuum energy
was spent for the organization of new microstates during the entire life of the
Universe, but in the initial period of its evolution the vacuum energy (78
orders) were reduced more effectively by the vacuum condensates produced by
phase transitions, because the Universe lost the high symmetry during its
expansion. Important problems of physics and cosmology can be solved if the
quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons are composite particles. The dark matter,
partially or all consisting of familon-type pseudo-Goldstone bosons with a mass
of 10^{-5} - 10^{-3} eV, can be explained in the composite model. Three
generations of elementary particles are absolutely necessary in this model. In
addition, this model realizes three relativistic phase transitions in a medium
of familons at different red shifts, forming a large-scale structure of dark
matter that was ""repeated"" by baryons. We predict the detection of dark matter
dynamics, the detection of familons as dark matter particles, and the
development of spectroscopy for dark medium due to the probable presence of

to distribute the computation across, say $k$, machines and process the data
using limited communication between them. A particularly appealing framework
here is the simultaneous communication model whereby each machine constructs a
small representative summary of its own data and one obtains an
approximate/exact solution from the union of the representative summaries. If
the representative summaries needed for a problem are small, then this results
in a communication-efficient and round-optimal protocol. While many fundamental
graph problems admit efficient solutions in this model, two prominent problems
are notably absent from the list of successes, namely, the maximum matching
problem and the minimum vertex cover problem. Indeed, it was shown recently
that for both these problems, even achieving a polylog$(n)$ approximation
requires essentially sending the entire input graph from each machine.
  The main insight of our work is that the intractability of matching and
vertex cover in the simultaneous communication model is inherently connected to
an adversarial partitioning of the underlying graph across machines. We show
that when the underlying graph is randomly partitioned across machines, both
these problems admit randomized composable coresets of size $\widetilde{O}(n)$
that yield an $\widetilde{O}(1)$-approximate solution. This results in an
$\widetilde{O}(1)$-approximation simultaneous protocol for these problems with
$\widetilde{O}(nk)$ total communication when the input is randomly partitioned
across $k$ machines. We further prove the optimality of our results. Finally,
by a standard application of composable coresets, our results also imply
MapReduce algorithms with the same approximation guarantee in one or two rounds

usual, i.e., the sparse approximation problem has to be solved for several data
vectors coming from closely related measurements. Thus, there is an unknown
inter-vector correlation between the data vectors. Using SMV methods typically

the past few years several algorithms for the MMV case have been designed to
overcome this problem. Most of these techniques focus on the approximation
quality while quite strong assumptions to the type of inter-vector correlation
are made. While we still want to find a sparse approximation, our focus lies on
preserving (possibly complex) structures in the data. Structural knowledge is
of interest in many applications. It can give information about e.g., type,

  First, in spite of the strong interest in community detection, a strong

missing. Yet, it is crucial to be able to determine the specific feats that we

$\mathcal{S}$ interacts with each probe sequentially, for a given duration, and
the Landauer principle relates the energy variation of $\mathcal{E}$ and the
decrease of entropy of $\mathcal{S}$ by the entropy production of the dynamical
process. We consider refinements of the Landauer bound at the level of the full

Collaborative filtering methods can be used to capture underlying patterns in

competitive performance compared to collaborative filtering when sufficient

roughly 35% for songs occurring in 5 or more training playists, whereas the
proposed model achieves a recall@100 of roughly 15% for songs occurring in 4 or

applications in various fields. Often, some or all of the variables are
discrete. The authors propose two new quantile regression approaches to handle
such mixed discrete-continuous data. Both of them generalize the continuous
D-vine quantile regression, where the dependence between the response and the
covariates is modeled by a parametric D-vine. D-vine quantile regression
provides very flexible models, that enable accurate and fast predictions.
Moreover, it automatically takes care of major issues of classical quantile
regression, such as quantile crossing and interactions between the covariates.
The first approach keeps the parametric estimation of the D-vines, but modifies
the formulas to account for the discreteness. The second approach estimates the
D-vine using continuous convolution to make the discrete variables continuous
and then estimates the D-vine nonparametrically. A simulation study is
presented examining for which scenarios the discrete-continuous D-vine quantile
regression can provide superior prediction abilities. Lastly, the functionality
of the two introduced methods is demonstrated by a real-world example
predicting the number of bike rentals.

frequentist coverage rate that is constant as a function of the model
parameters, yet provides smaller intervals than the usual interval procedure,
on average across regression coefficients. The proposed procedure is obtained
by defining a class of CIPs that all have exact $1-\alpha$ frequentist
coverage, and then selecting from this class the procedure that minimizes a
prior expected interval width. Such a procedure may be described as
""frequentist, assisted by Bayes"" or FAB. We describe an adaptive approach for
estimating the prior distribution from the data so that exact non-asymptotic
$1-\alpha$ coverage is maintained. Additionally, in a ""$p$ growing with $n$""
asymptotic scenario, this adaptive FAB procedure is asymptotically
Bayes-optimal among $1-\alpha$ frequentist CIPs.

solver for compressible flows with large-scale flow-induced deformation of the

sharp-interface immersed boundary method based flow solver with an open-source
finite-element structure dynamics solver. The flow solver is based on a
higher-order finite-difference method on Cartesian grid and employs ghost-cell
methodology to impose boundary conditions on the immersed boundary. A
higher-order accuracy near the immersed boundary is achieved by combining the
ghost-cell approach with a weighted least-square error method based on a
higher-order approximate polynomial. The second order spatial accuracy of the
flow solver is established by performing a grid refinement study. The structure
solver is validated with a canonical elastostatics problem. The FSI solver is
validated with published measurements and simulations for the large-scale
deformation of a thin elastic steel panel subjected to blast loading in a shock
tube. The solver correctly predicts oscillating behavior of the tip of the
panel with reasonable fidelity and computed shock wave propagation is
qualitatively consistent with the published results. In order to demonstrate
the fidelity of the solver and to investigate coupled physics of the
shock-structure interaction for a thin elastic plate, we employ the solver for
simulating 6.4 kg TNT blast loading on the thin elastic plate. The initial
conditions of the blast are taken from field tests reported in the literature.

paper, we model the multiwavelength spectrum of the Cygnus, for the first time
using a broad data set from radio, MeV (COMPTEL), GeV (Fermi), TeV (Argo) and
10s of TeV (Milagro) energies. The modeling is performed assuming a
leptohadronic model. We solve the steady-state transport equation for leptons
and hadrons injected homogeneously in the region and test the role of diffusive
transport and energy loss by radiation and interaction. The result shows that
diffusion loss plays a significant role in Cygnus X and always exceeds the
advection loss as well as almost all other loss processes. The best-fit
parameters we find are a magnetic field of $B=8.9\times10^{-6}$ G, a target
density of $N_t=19.4$ cm$^{-3}$, a cosmic ray spectral index of $\alpha=2.37$
and neutral gas distribution over a depth of 116 pc. We find that the fit
describes the data up to TeV energies well, while the Milagro data are
underestimated. This transport model with a broad multiwavelength fit provides
a neutrino flux which approaches the sensitivity of IceCube at very high
energies ($>$ 50 TeV). In the future, the flux sensitivity of IceCube will be
improved. With this rather pessimistic model, leaving out the influence of
possible strong, high-energy point sources, we already expect the flux in the

which can have a significant detrimental effect on a city. In this paper, a
novel approach is proposed for analyzing the problem of allocating security
resources, such as firewalls and anti-malware, over the various cyber
components of an interdependent CPS to protect the system against imminent

attacker seeks to allocate its resources to compromise the CPS, while the
defender chooses how to distribute its resources to defend against potential
attacks. To evaluate the effects of defense and attack, various CPS factors are
considered including human-CPS interactions as well as physical and topological
characteristics of a CPS such as flow and capacity of interconnections and
minimum path algorithms. Results show that, for the case in which the attacker
is not aware of the CPS interdependencies, the defender can have a higher
payoff, compared to the case in which the attacker has complete information.
The results also show that, in the case of more symmetric nodes, due to
interdependencies, the defender achieves its highest payoff at the equilibrium
compared to the case with independent, asymmetric nodes.

solvability is $e^{1/2}/2$, at most. Stephan Mertens's extensive numerics
compelled him to conjecture that this probability is of order $n^{-1/4}$. Jimmy
Tan introduced a notion of a stable cyclic partition, and proved existence of
such a partition for every system of members' preferences, discovering that
presence of odd cycles in a stable partition is equivalent to absence of a

partitions with odd cycles grows as $n^{1/4}$. However the standard deviation
of that number is of order $n^{3/8}\gg n^{1/4}$, too large to conclude that the

extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power'. If correct,
this is a spectacular impossibility theorem for hidden variable theories, which
is more general than the theorems of Bell and Leggett. C&R's claim essentially
means that in any hidden variable theory that is compatible with
quantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are
independent of these hidden variables. On closer inspection, however, the
generality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an
assumption called 'Freedom of Choice'. As the name suggests, this assumption
involves the independence of an experimenter's choice of measurement settings.
But in the way C&R define this assumption, a no-signalling condition is
surreptitiously presupposed, making the assumption less innocent than it
sounds. When using this definition, any hidden variable theory violating
Parameter Independence, such as Bohmian Mechanics, is immediately shown to be
incompatible with quantum-mechanical predictions. Also, the argument of C&R is
hard to follow and their mathematical derivation contains several gaps, some of
which cannot be closed in the way they suggest. We shall show that these gaps
can be filled. The issue with the 'Freedom of Choice' assumption can be
circumvented by explicitly assuming Parameter Independence. This makes the
result less general, but better founded. We then obtain an impossibility
theorem for hidden variable theories satisfying Parameter Independence only.
So, while quantum mechanics itself satisfies Parameter Independence, if a
variable is added that changes the outcome probabilities, however slightly,
Parameter Independence must be violated.

in biomolecular modeling and is a fundamental tool for structural biology. It
is used to calculate electrostatic potentials around an ensemble of fixed
charges immersed in an ionic solution. Efficient numerical computation of the
PBE yields a high number of degrees of freedom in the resultant algebraic
system of equations. Coupled with the fact that in most cases the PBE requires
to be solved multiple times for a large number of system configurations, this
poses great computational challenges to conventional numerical techniques. To
accelerate such computations, we here present the reduced basis method (RBM)
which greatly reduces this computational complexity by constructing a reduced
order model of typically low dimension. In this study, we employ a simple
version of the PBE for proof of concept and discretize the linearized PBE
(LPBE) with a centered finite difference scheme. The resultant linear system is
solved by the aggregation-based algebraic multigrid method at different samples
of ionic strength on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. The discretized LPBE,
which we call the high-fidelity full order model (FOM), yields solution as
accurate as other LPBE solvers. We then apply the RBM to FOM. The discrete
empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is applied to the Dirichlet boundary
conditions which are nonaffine with the parameter, to reduce the complexity of
the reduced order model (ROM). From the numerical results, we notice that the
RBM reduces the model order from $\mathcal{N} = 2\times 10^{6}$ to $N = 6$ at
an accuracy of $10^{-9}$ and reduces computational time by a factor of
approximately $7,600$. DEIM, on the other hand, is also used in the
offline-online phase of solving the ROM for different values of parameters
which provides a speed-up of $20$ for a single iteration of the greedy

the quasi--local cold dark matter energy density and a quasi--local Hubble
factor-like scalar via a coupling constant $\alpha$. The autonomous numerical
system obtained from the evolution equations is classified for different
choices of the free parameters: the adiabatic constant of the dark energy $w$
and $\alpha$. The presence of a past attractor in a non-physical region of the
energy densities phase-space of the system makes the coupling term non physical
when the energy flows from the matter to the dark energy in order to avoid
negative values of the dark energy density in the past. On the other hand, if
the energy flux goes from dark energy to dark matter, the past attractor lays
in a physical region. The system is also numerically solved for some
interesting initial profiles leading to different configurations: an ever
expanding mixture, a scenario where the dark energy is completely consumed by
the non-relativistic matter by means of the coupling term, a scenario where the
dark energy disappears in the inner layers while the outer layers expand as a
mixture of both sources, and, finally, a structure formation toy model
scenario, where the inner shells containing the mixture collapse while the
outer shells expand.

belt, on the right side of the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonance. The proximity of
this resonance to the family left side in semi-major axis caused many former
family members to be lost. As a consequence, the family shape in the $(a,1/D)$
domain is quite asymmetrical, with a preponderance of objects on the right side
of the distribution. The Rafita family is also characterized by a leptokurtic
distribution in inclination, which allows the use of methods of family age
estimation recently introduced for other leptokurtic families such as Astrid,
Hansa, Gallia, and Barcelona. In this work we propose a new method based on the
behavior of an asymmetry coefficient function of the distribution in the
$(a,1/D)$ plane to date incomplete asteroid families such as Rafita. By
monitoring the time behavior of this coefficient for asteroids simulating the
initial conditions at the time of the family formation, we were able to
estimate that the Rafita family should have an age of $490\pm200$ Myr, in good
agreement with results from independent methods such as Monte Carlo simulations
of Yarkovsky and Yorp dynamical induced evolution and the time behaviour of the
kurtosis of the $\sin{(i)}$ distribution. Asteroids from the Rafita family can
reach orbits similar to 8\% of the currently known near Earth objects.
$\simeq$1\% of the simulated objects are present in NEO-space during the final
10 Myr of the simulation, and thus would be comparable to objects in the
present-day NEO population.

field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the
transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic
band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern
number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was
shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial
dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason
that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work,
we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays
to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array
of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed
such that the propagation of light along the device samples over
higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical
dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's
band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second
Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry.
In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by
localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated
auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping
from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to
the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the
opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first
experimental realization of higher-dimensional topological physics.

distinguish between different galaxy formation and evolution models. Most of
the metallicity determinations are based on optical line ratios. However, the
optical spectral range is subject to dust extinction and, for high-z objects (z
> 3), some of the lines used in optical metallicity diagnostics are shifted to
wavelengths not accessible to ground based observatories. For this reason, we
explore metallicity diagnostics using far-infrared (IR) line ratios which can
provide a suitable alternative in such situations. To investigate these far-IR
line ratios, we modeled the emission of a starburst with the photoionization
code CLOUDY. The most sensitive far-IR ratios to measure metallicities are the
[OIII]52$\mu$m and 88$\mu$m to [NIII]57$\mu$m ratios. We show that this ratio
produces robust metallicities in the presence of an AGN and is insensitive to
changes in the age of the ionizing stellar. Another metallicity sensitive ratio
is the [OIII]88$\mu$m/[NII]122$\mu$m ratio, although it depends on the
ionization parameter. We propose various mid- and far-IR line ratios to break
this dependency. Finally, we apply these far-IR diagnostics to a sample of 19
local ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) observed with Herschel and Spitzer. We
find that the gas-phase metallicity in these local ULIRGs is in the range 0.7 <
Z_gas/Z_sun < 1.5, which corresponds to 8.5 < 12 + log (O/H) < 8.9. The
inferred metallicities agree well with previous estimates for local ULIRGs and
this confirms that they lie below the local mass-metallicity relation.

a more objective method is required. In this paper, we report on a recent
automated Her2 scoring contest, held in conjunction with the annual PathSoc
meeting held in Nottingham in June 2016, aimed at systematically comparing and
advancing the state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) based automated

stained with both Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and IHC for Her2. The contesting
algorithms automatically predicted scores of the IHC slides for an unseen

This paper presents a benchmark for comparing the performance of automated

the two-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect. It is characterized by the
first Chern number which manifests in the quantized Hall response induced by an

adversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified
off-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of
noise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar
quantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image
entropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for
different kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be
effectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample
and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks.
More than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models
are used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different
attack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a
high overall F1 score of 96.39% and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware

account of the origins of neural elongations: Why did neural elongations (axons
and dendrites) first originate, such that they could become the central
component of both neurons and nervous systems? Two contrasting conceptual
accounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles
provide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here
the basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both
situated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural
elongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,
which require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes
to build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for
early nervous systems. Here the coordination of activity across extended parts
of a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of
(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest
proto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were
initially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the
patterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present
computational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random
neural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can
generate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding
elongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result
supports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very
first full neurons and nervous systems.

districts or the distribution of votes. The ""efficiency gap,"" which does the
latter, plays a central role in a 2016 federal court case on the
constitutionality of Wisconsin's state legislative district plan.
Unfortunately, however, the efficiency gap reduces to proportional
representation, an expectation that is not a constitutional right. We present a
new measure of partisan asymmetry that does not rely on the shapes of
districts, is simple to compute, is provably related to the ""packing and
cracking"" integral to gerrymandering, and that avoids the constitutionality
issue presented by the efficiency gap. In addition, we introduce a
generalization of the efficiency gap that also avoids the equivalency to
proportional representation. We apply the first function to US congressional
and state legislative plans from recent decades to identify candidate
gerrymanders.

  effects in equatorial orbits","Accepted 2017 May 10. Received 2017 April 29; in original form 2017
  January 13",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1204",,"physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here we study the dynamical effects of the solar radiation pressure (SRP) on
a spacecraft that will survey the near-Earth rotating asteroid (101955) Bennu
when the projected shadow is accounted for. The spacecraft's motion near
(101955) Bennu is modelled in the rotating frame fixed at the centre of the
asteroid, neglecting the sun gravity effects. We calculate the solar radiation
pressure at the perihelion, semi-major axis and aphelion distances of the
asteroid from the Sun. The goals of this work are to analyse the stability for
both homogeneous and inhomogeneous mass distribution and study the effects of
the solar radiation pressure in equatorial orbits close to the asteroid
(101955) Bennu. As results, we find that the mascon model divided into ten
equal layers seems to be the most suitable for this problem. We can highlight
that the centre point $E$8, which was linearly stable in the case of the
homogeneous mass distribution, becomes unstable in this new model changing its
topological structure. For a Sun initial longitude $\psi_0 = -180^o$, starting
with the spacecraft longitude $\lambda = 0$, the orbits suffer fewer impacts
and some (between 0.4 and 0.5 km), remaining unwavering even if the maximum
solar radiation is considered. When we change the initial longitude of the Sun
to $\psi_0 = -135^o$, the orbits with initial longitude $\lambda = 90^0 $
appear to be more stable. Finally, when the passage of the spacecraft in the
shadow is accounted for, the effects of solar radiation pressure are softened,
and we find more stable orbits.

The principal part of the appropriate differential operator is not

financial research, of profound economic implications. While this has hitherto
been tackled through data analysis techniques, the resemblances between this
and other problems, like the design of recommendation systems and of diagnostic
/ prognostic medical tools, suggest that a complex network approach may yield
important benefits. In this contribution we present a first hybrid data mining
/ complex network classification algorithm, able to detect illegal instances in
a real card transaction data set. It is based on a recently proposed network
reconstruction algorithm that allows creating representations of the deviation
of one instance from a reference group. We show how the inclusion of features
extracted from the network data representation improves the score obtained by a
standard, neural network-based classification algorithm; and additionally how
this combined approach can outperform a commercial fraud detection system in
specific operation niches. Beyond these specific results, this contribution
represents a new example on how complex networks and data mining can be
integrated as complementary tools, with the former providing a view to data
beyond the capabilities of the latter.
