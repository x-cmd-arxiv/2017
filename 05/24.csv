graph regime with bounded expected degrees, as well as exact recovery in the
dense regime. An immediate corollary of our results yields error bounds under
the Censored Block Model. Moreover, these error bounds are robust, continuing
to hold under heterogeneous edge probabilities and a form of the so-called

  Significantly, this error rate is achieved by the SDP solution itself without
any further pre- or post-processing, and improves upon existing
polynomially-decaying error bounds proved using the Grothendieck\textquoteright

  In ACT-R models, there are often cognitive processes that should always yield
the same result while others e.g. implement strategies to solve a problem that
could yield different results. In this paper, a decidable confluence criterion
for ACT-R is presented. It allows to identify ACT-R rules that are not

  The sound and complete translation of ACT-R to CHR from prior work is used to
come up with a suitable invariant-based confluence criterion from the CHR

developed method of dependent component analysis to image denoising when
multiple distorted copies of one and the same image are available, each being
corrupted by a different and unknown noise process. In a simplified scenario,
we assume that the distorted image is corrupted by noise that acts
independently on each pixel. We answer completely the question of how to
perform optimal denoising, when at least three distorted copies are available:
First we define optimality of an algorithm in the presented scenario, and then

use specification mining techniques, which can automatically derive models that
capture the behavior of the system under analysis. So far, most specification
mining techniques focused on the functional behavior of the systems, with
specific emphasis on models that represent the ordering of operations, such as
tempo- ral rules and finite state models. Although useful, these models are
inherently partial. For instance, they miss the timing behavior, which is
extremely relevant for many classes of systems and com- ponents, such as shared
libraries and user-driven applications. Mining specifications that include both
the functional and the timing aspects can improve the applicability of many
testing and analysis solutions. This paper addresses this challenge by
presenting the Timed k-Tail (TkT) specification mining technique that can mine
timed automata from program traces. Since timed automata can effectively
represent the interplay between the functional and the timing behavior of a
system, TkT could be exploited in those contexts where time-related information
is relevant. Our empirical evaluation shows that TkT can efficiently and
effectively mine accurate models. The mined models have been used to identify
executions with anomalous timing. The evaluation shows that most of the
anomalous executions have been correctly identified while producing few false

in the upper chromosphere is lower by a factor of 1.30-1.65 compared to the
photosphere. The magnetic field strength of the umbra decreases from the
photosphere towards the upper chromosphere by an average rate of 0.5-0.9 G
km$^{-1}$. The difference in the magnetic field strength between both
atmospheric layers steadily decreases from the sunspot center to the outer
boundary of the sunspot, with the field (in particular its horizontal
component) being stronger in the chromopshere outside the spot, suggestive of a
magnetic canopy. The sunspot displays a twist that on average is similar in the
two layers. However, the differential twist between photosphere and
chromosphere increases rapidly towards the outer penumbral boundary. The
magnetic field vector is more horizontal with respect to the solar surface by
roughly 5-20$^\circ$ in the photosphere compared to the upper chromosphere.
Above a lightbridge, the chromospheric magnetic field is equally strong as that
in the umbra, whereas the lightbridge's field is weaker than its surroundings
in the photosphere by roughly 1 kG. This suggests a cusp-like magnetic field
structure above the lightbridge.

emission at radio frequencies in both clusters of galaxies and radio galaxies,
through the non-thermal radiation emission called synchrotron. However, the
total power radiated through this mechanism is ill constrained, as the lower
limit of the electron energy distribution, or low-energy cutoffs, for radio
emission in galaxy clusters and radio galaxies have not yet been determined.
This lower limit, parametrized by the lower limit of the electron momentum -
pmin - is critical for estimating the energetics of non-thermal electrons
produced by cluster mergers or injected by radio galaxy jets, which impacts the
formation of large-scale structure in the universe, as well as the evolution of
local structures inside galaxy clusters. The total pressure due to the
relativistic, non-thermal population of electrons is critically dependent on
pmin, making the measurement of this non-thermal pressure a promising technique
to estimate the electron low-energy cutoff. We present here the first
unambiguous detection of this pressure for a non-thermal population of
electrons in a radio galaxy jet/lobe, located at a significant distance away
from the center of the Bullet cluster of galaxies.

traces are not openly available and may be completely missing in some cities
due to legal issues, we turn to transferring knowledge from public transport
open data, i.e, taxis and buses, to ridesourcing detection among ordinary

take taxi and bus data as input to learn a random forest (RF) classifier using
trajectory features shared by taxis/buses and ridesourcing/other cars. Then, we
use the RF to label all the candidate cars. In Stage 2, leveraging the subset
of high confident labels from the previous stage as input, we further learn a
convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for ridesourcing detection, and
iteratively refine RF and CNN, as well as the feature set, via a co-training
process. Finally, we use the resulting ensemble of RF and CNN to identify the
ridesourcing cars in the candidate pool. Experiments on real car, taxi and bus

pore-block geometry of Sierpinski carpets (SCs), the area filled by the
invading fluid was shown to scale as F~t^n, with n<1/2, thus providing a
macroscopic realization of anomalous diffusion [Filipovitch et al, Water
Resour. Res. 52 5167 (2016)]. The results agree with simulations of a diffusion
equation with constant pressure at one of the borders of those fractals, but
the exponent n is very different from the anomalous exponent nu=1/D_W of single
particle diffusion in the same fractals (D_W is the random walk dimension).
Here we use a scaling approach to show that those exponents are related as
n=nu(D_F-D_B), where D_F and D_B are the fractal dimensions of the bulk and of
the border from which diffusing particles come, respectively. This relation is
supported by accurate numerical estimates in two SCs and in two generalized
Menger sponges (MSs), in which we performed simulations of single particle
random walks (RWs) with a rigid impermeable border and of a diffusive
infiltration model in which that border is permanently filled with diffusing
particles. This study includes one MS whose external border is also fractal.
The exponent relation is also consistent with the recent simulational and
experimental results on fluid infiltration in SCs, and explains the approximate
quadratic dependence of n on D_F in these fractals. We also show that the
mean-square displacement of single particle RWs has log-periodic oscillations,
whose periods are similar for fractals with the same scaling factor in the
generator (even with different embedding dimensions), which is consistent with
the discrete scale invariance scenario. The roughness of a diffusion front
defined in the infiltration problem also shows this type of oscillation, which
is enhanced in fractals with narrow channels between large lacunas.

spatio-temporal annotations with possibly multiple annotations for each person;
(3) exhaustive annotation of these atomic actions over 15-minute video clips;
(4) people temporally linked across consecutive segments; and (5) using movies

a continuum model of membrane and protein dynamics to study the behaviour of

entropic forces, and the geometric constraints on the membrane can result in
the formation of patterns of highly-curved/protein-rich and
weakly-curved/protein-poor domains on the membrane. The spontaneous formation
of such patterns can be triggered either by an increase in the average density
of curvature-inducing proteins, or by a relaxation of the geometric constraints
on the membrane imposed by the membrane tension or by the tethering of the
membrane to a rigid cell wall or cortex. These parameters can also be tuned to
select the size and number of the protein-rich domains that arise upon pattern
formation. The very general mechanism presented here could be related to

because of the strange features of its light curve: a wide, asymmetric dimming
taking up to 15 per cent of the light at D793 and a period of multiple, narrow
dimmings happening approximately 700 days later. Several models have been
proposed to account for this abnormal behaviour, most of which require either
unlikely causes or a finely-tuned timing. We aim at offering a relatively
natural solution, invoking only phenomena that have been previously observed,
although perhaps in larger or more massive versions. We model the system using
a large, ringed body whose transit produces the first dimming and a swarm of
Trojan objects sharing its orbit that causes the second period of multiple
dimmings. The resulting orbital period is $T\approx12$ years, with a semi-major
axis $a\approx6$ au. Our model allows us to make two straightforward
predictions: we expect the passage of a new swarm of Trojans in front of the
star starting during the early months of 2021, and a new transit of the main
object during the first half of 2023.

evolution of a disease. In our model we consider a multiplex network consisting
of two layers. One of the layers corresponds to a social network where people
share their opinions and influence others opinions. The social model that rules
the dynamic is the M-model, which takes into account two different processes
that occurs in a society: persuasion and compromise. This two processes are
related through a parameter $r$, $r<1$ describes a moderate and committed
society, for $r>1$ the society tends to have extremist opinions, while $r=1$
represents a neutral society. This social network may be of real or virtual
contacts. On the other hand, the second layer corresponds to a network of
physical contacts where the disease spreading is described by the SIR-Model. In
this model the individuals may be in one of the following four states:
Susceptible ($S$), Infected($I$), Recovered ($R$) or Vaccinated ($V$). A
Susceptible individual can: i) get vaccinated, if his opinion in the other
layer is totally in favor of the vaccine, ii) get infected, with probability
$\beta$ if he is in contact with an infected neighbor. Those $I$ individuals
recover after a certain period $t_r=6$. Vaccinated individuals have an
extremist positive opinion that does not change. We consider that the vaccine
has a certain effectiveness $\omega$ and as a consequence vaccinated nodes can
be infected with probability $\beta (1 - \omega)$ if they are in contact with
an infected neighbor. In this case, if the infection process is successful, the
new infected individual changes his opinion from extremist positive to totally
against the vaccine. We find that depending on the trend in the opinion of the
society, which depends on $r$, different behaviors in the spread of the
epidemic occurs. An epidemic threshold was found.

interactions can be thought of as symmetry broken versions of one and the same
interaction, viz., the multi-center bond. We use specially chosen molecular
units to show that the symmetry breaking is controlled by density and
electronegativity variation. We show that the bond order changes with bond
deformation but in a step-like fashion, regions of near constancy separated by
electronic localization transitions. These will often cause displacive
transitions as well so that the bond strength, order, and length are
established self-consistently. We further argue on the inherent relation of the
covalent, closed-shell, and multi-center interactions with ionic and metallic
bonding. All of these interactions can be viewed as distinct sectors on a phase
diagram with density and electronegativity variation as control variables; the
ionic and covalent/secondary sectors are associated with on-site and bond-order
charge density wave respectively, the metallic sectorwith an electronic fluid.
While displaying a contiguity at low densities, the metallic and ionic
interactions represent distinct phases separated by discontinuous transitions
at sufficiently high densities. Multi-center interactions emerge as a hybrid of
the metallic and ionic bond that results from spatial coexistence of
delocalized and localized electrons. In the present description, the issue of
the stability of a compound is that of mutual miscibility of electronic fluids
with distinct degrees of electron localization, supra-atomic ordering in
complex inorganic compounds comes about naturally. The notions of electronic
localization advanced hereby suggest a high throughput, automated procedure for
screening candidate compounds and structures with regard to stability, without
the need for computationally costly geometric optimization.

our application of TPRN, internal representations learned by end-to-end

performance penalty need be paid for this increased interpretability: the
proposed model performs comparably to a state-of-the-art system on the SQuAD QA

Representation: for each input word, the model selects a symbol to encode the
word, and a role in which to place the symbol, and binds the two together. The
selection is via soft attention. The overall interpretation is built from
interpretations of the symbols, as recruited by the trained model, and
interpretations of the roles as used by the model. We find support for our
initial hypothesis that symbols can be interpreted as lexical-semantic word
meanings, while roles can be interpreted as approximations of grammatical roles
(or categories) such as subject, wh-word, determiner, etc. Fine-grained
analysis reveals specific correspondences between the learned roles and parts
of speech as assigned by a standard tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003), and finds
several discrepancies in the model's favor. In this sense, the model learns
significant aspects of grammar, after having been exposed solely to
linguistically unannotated text, questions, and answers: no prior linguistic
knowledge is given to the model. What is given is the means to build
representations using symbols and roles, with an inductive bias favoring use of

fraction larger than 1 fb for a $Z'$ mass in the 200--450 GeV range, and larger
than 0.1 fb for a mass up to 800 GeV. The 1-loop decay of the $Z'$ into lepton
pairs competes with $h^0 \gamma$, even if the $Z'$ couplings to leptons vanish
at tree level. We also present a model in which a $Z'$ boson decays into a
Higgs boson and a pair of collimated photons, mimicking an $h^0 \gamma$

discovery mode for a $Z'$ as heavy as 2 TeV. When the resonance is a scalar,

This typically assumes that all clients learn the coding matrix so that they

formalize the intuition that the achieved privacy can increase by decreasing

$T_k\geq T$ transmissions, and with the property that each client learns at
most $k$ rows of the coding matrix to decode its message. We derive upper and

where we have $k$ players receiving private inputs, and a coordinator who
receives no input; the coordinator can communicate with all the players, but
the players cannot communicate with each other. In this model, we ask: if an
input graph is divided between the players, with each player receiving some of
the edges, how many bits do the players and the coordinator need to exchange to
determine if the graph is triangle-free, or $\textit{far}$ from triangle-free?
  For general communication protocols, we show that
$\tilde{O}(k(nd)^{1/4}+k^2)$ bits are sufficient to test triangle-freeness in
graphs of size $n$ with average degree $d$ (the degree need not be known in
advance). For $\textit{simultaneous}$ protocols, where there is only one
communication round, we give a protocol that uses $\tilde{O}(k \sqrt{n})$ bits
when $d = O(\sqrt{n})$ and $\tilde{O}(k (nd)^{1/3})$ when $d =
\Omega(\sqrt{n})$; here, again, the average degree $d$ does not need to be
known in advance. We show that for average degree $d = O(1)$, our simultaneous
protocol is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors. For higher
degrees, we are not able to give lower bounds on testing triangle-freeness, but
we give evidence that the problem is hard by showing that finding an edge that
participates in a triangle is hard, even when promised that at least a constant
fraction of the edges must be removed in order to make the graph triangle-free.

between the metallicity and the mass of the stellar halo for galaxies with
Milky Way-like stellar masses. Using the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations, we find that this relationship arises because a single massive
massive progenitor contributes the bulk of the mass to the accreted stellar
component as well as sets its metallicity. Moreover, in the Illustris
simulations, this relationship extends over 3 orders of magnitude in accreted
stellar mass for central galaxies. We show that for Milky Way-like mass
galaxies, the scatter in accreted metallicity at a fixed accreted stellar mass
encodes information about the stellar mass of the dominant accreted progenitor,
while the radial density and metallicity gradients of the accreted stellar
component encodes information about the time of accretion of the dominant
progenitor. We demonstrate that for Milky Way-like mass galaxies, the Illustris
simulations predict that the metallicity and the stellar mass of the total
accreted stellar component can be reconstructed from aperture measurements of
the stellar halo along the minor axis of edge-on disk galaxies. These
correlations highlight the potential for observational studies of stellar halos
to quantify our understanding of the most dominant events in the growth history
of galaxies. We explore the implications of our model for our understanding of

relatively late and massive accretion is favoured for M31; additionally, we

serve as the birthplace for satellites. Understanding their characteristics via
simulations also helps to prepare for their observations. Here we study disks
around 1, 3, 5, 10 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ planets with three dimensional, global
radiative hydrodynamic simulations with sub-planet peak resolution, and various
planetary temperatures. We found that as the 1 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ planet
radiates away its formation heat, the circumplanetary envelope transitions to a
disk between $T_p = 6000$ K and 4000 K. In the case of 3-10 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$
planets a disk always forms. The temperature profile of the circumplanetary
disks is very steep, the inner 1/6th is over the silicate condensation
temperature and the entire disk is above water freezing point, making satellite
formation impossible in this early stage ($<$1 Myr). Satellites might form much
later and first in the outer parts of the disk migrating inwards later on. Our
disk masses are $1, 7, 20, 40 \times 10^{-3}\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ for the 1, 3, 5,
10 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ gas giants respectively, and we provide an empirical
formula to estimate the subdisk masses based on the planet- and circumstellar
disk mass. Our finding is that the cooler the planet, the lower the temperature
of the subdisk, the higher the vertical influx velocities, and the planetary
gap is both deeper and wider. We also show that the gaps in 2D and 3D are
different. The subdisk eccentricity increases with planetary mass and violently
interacts with the circumstellar disk, making satellite-formation less likely,
if $\mathrm{M_p} \gtrsim 5 \mathrm{M_{Jup}}$.

integrated gas-phase metallicities increase with decreasing cluster-centric
distance. To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we
use a semi-analytic model to quantify the ""observational bias"" that RPS
introduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral
field spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic
disks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at
z=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of
-0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a
mean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas
removal and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low
mass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the
more massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS
produces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of -0.05 log(M_*/M_sun)/Mpc.
This mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient
of -0.03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher
metallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z=0.35. We hypothesize that
additional mechanisms including steep internal metallicity gradients and
self-enrichment due to gas strangulation are needed to reproduce our
observations at z=0.35.

kicks are ejecta asymmetries (e.g., conservation of momentum between NS and
ejecta) and anisotropic neutrino emission. Observations of supernova remnants
(SNRs) can give us insights into the mechanism that generates these NS kicks.
In this paper, we investigate the relationship between NS kick velocities and
the X-ray morphologies of 18 SNRs observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory
and the Rontgen Satellite (ROSAT). We measure SNR asymmetries using the
power-ratio method (a multipole expansion technique), focusing on the dipole,
quadrupole, and octupole power-ratios. Our results show no correlation between
the magnitude of the power-ratios and NS kick velocities, but we find that for
Cas A and G292.0+1.8, whose emission traces the ejecta distribution, their NSs
are preferentially moving opposite to the bulk of the X-ray emission. In
addition, we find a similar result for PKS 1209-51, CTB 109, and Puppis A;
however their emission is dominated by circumstellar/interstellar material, so
their asymmetries may not reflect their ejecta distributions. Our results are
consistent with the theory that NS kicks are a consequence of ejecta
asymmetries as opposed to anisotropic neutrino emission. In the future,
additional observations to measure NS proper motions within ejecta-dominated
SNRs are necessary to constrain robustly the NS kick mechanism.

peculiar spectral and temporal evolution and is most likely the result of
scattering of the radio emission by the turbulent Milky Way interstellar medium

duration of the variability seen here are qualitatively more similar to extreme
scattering events previously observed in quasars, rather than normal
interstellar scintillation effects. High-cadence, broadband radio observations
of future GRBs are needed to fully characterize such effects, which can
sensitively probe the properties of the ISM and must be taken into account
before variability intrinsic to the GRB can be interpreted correctly.

shell-crossing or orbit crossing, denotes the breakdown of the single-stream
regime of the cold-dark-matter fluid. At this instant, the velocity becomes
multi-valued and the density singular. Shell-crossing is well understood in one
dimension (1D), but not in higher dimensions. This paper is about
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) flow that depends on all three coordinates but
differs only slightly from a strictly 1D flow, thereby allowing a perturbative
treatment of shell-crossing using the Euler--Poisson equations written in
Lagrangian coordinates. The signature of shell-crossing is then just the
vanishing of the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, a regular perturbation
problem. In essence the problem of the first shell-crossing, which is highly
singular in Eulerian coordinates, has been desingularized by switching to
Lagrangian coordinates, and can then be handled by perturbation theory. Here,
all-order recursion relations are obtained for the time-Taylor coefficients of
the displacement field, and it is shown that the Taylor series has an infinite
radius of convergence. This allows the determination of the time and location
of the first shell-crossing, which is generically shown to be taking place
earlier than for the unperturbed 1D flow. The time variable used for these
statements is not the cosmic time $t$ but the linear growth time $\tau \sim
t^{2/3}$. For simplicity, calculations are restricted to an Einstein--de Sitter
universe in the Newtonian approximation, and tailored initial data are used.
However it is straightforward to relax these limitations, if needed.

100s of years, in which all the energy released by orbital decay can be
efficiently transported to the surface, where it is radiated away. If the
remaining envelope is to be removed during this phase, this removal must occur
through some as-yet-undetermined mechanism. We carried out 1-d hydrodynamic
simulations of a low-mass red giant undergoing a synthetic common-envelope
event in such a slow spiral-in phase, using the stellar evolutionary code MESA.
We simulated the heating of the envelope due to frictional dissipation from a
binary companion's orbit in multiple configurations and investigated the
response of the giant's envelope. We find that our model envelopes become
dynamically unstable and develop large-amplitude pulsations, with periods in
the range 3-20 years and very short growth time-scales of similar order. The
shocks and associated rebounds that emerge as these pulsations grow are in some
cases strong enough to dynamically eject shells of matter of up to 0.1
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, $\sim 10$ % of the mass of the envelope, from the stellar
surface at above escape velocity. These ejections are seen to repeat within a
few decades, leading to a time-averaged mass-loss rate of order $10^{-3}$
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \: \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which is sufficiently high to
represent a candidate mechanism for removing the entire envelope over the

catalogs to isolate a robust sample of central galaxies with high purity and
completeness. The properties we investigate are star formation rate (SFR),
exponential disk scale length $R_{\rm exp}$, and Sersic index of the light
profile, $n$. We find that, at all stellar masses, there is an inverse
correlation between SFR and $\delta$, meaning that above-average star forming
centrals live in underdense regions. For $n$ and $R_{\rm exp}$, there is no
correlation with $\delta$ at $M_{\rm star}\lesssim 10^{10.5}$ $M_\odot$, but at
higher masses there are positive correlations; a weak correlation with $R_{\rm
exp}$ and a strong correlation with $n$. These data are evidence of assembly
bias within the star-forming population. The results for SFR are consistent
with a model in which SFR correlates with present-day halo accretion rate,
$\dot{M}_h$. In this model, galaxies are assigned to halos using the abundance
matching ansatz, which maps galaxy stellar mass onto halo mass. At fixed halo
mass, SFR is assigned to galaxies using the same approach,but $\dot{M}_h$ is
used to map onto SFR. The best-fit model requires some scatter in the
$\dot{M}_h$-SFR relation. The $R_{\rm exp}$ and $n$ measurements are consistent
with a model in which these quantities are correlated with the spin parameter
of the halo, $\lambda$. Halo spin does not correlate with $\delta$ at low halo
masses, but for higher mass halos, high-spin halos live in higher density
environments at fixed $M_h$. Put together with the earlier installments of this
series, these data demonstrate that quenching processes have limited
correlation with halo formation history, but the growth of active galaxies, as
well as other detailed properties, are influenced by the details of halo
assembly.

induce random transitions between stable states. The rate of transition can be
characterised in terms of the noise-free system's dynamics and the added noise:
for potential systems in the presence of asymptotically low noise the
well-known Kramers' escape time gives an expression for the mean escape time.
This paper examines some general properties and examples of transitions between
local steady and oscillatory attractors within networks: the transition rates
at each node may be affected by the dynamics at other nodes. We use first
passage time theory to explain some properties of scalings noted in the
literature for an idealised model of initiation of epileptic seizures in small
systems of coupled bistable systems with both steady and oscillatory
attractors. We focus on the case of sequential escapes where a steady attractor
is only marginally stable but all nodes start in this state. As the nodes
escape to the oscillatory regime, we assume that the transitions back are very
infrequent in comparison. We quantify and characterise the resulting sequences
of noise-induced escapes. For weak enough coupling we show that a master
equation approach gives a good quantitative understanding of sequential
escapes, but for strong coupling this description breaks down.

the generation of deep-UV laser pulses at MHz repetition rates and \mu
J-energies by means of dispersive wave (DW) emission from self-compressed
solitons in gas-filled single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (SR-PCF).
Pulses from an ytterbium fiber laser (~300 fs) are first compressed to ~25 fs
in a SR-PCF-based nonlinear compression stage, and subsequently used to pump a
second SR-PCF stage for broadband DW generation in the deep UV. The UV
wavelength is tunable by selecting the gas species and the pressure. At 100 kHz
repetition rate, a pulse energy of 1.05 \mu J was obtained at 205 nm (average

It is one of the few
young PMS stars known to be associated with a planetary mass companion, DH Tau
b, orbiting at large separation and detected by direct imaging. DH Tau b is
thought to be accreting based on copious H${\alpha}$ emission and exhibits
variable Paschen Beta emission. NOEMA observations at 230 GHz allow us to place
constraints on the disk dust mass for both DH Tau b and the primary in a regime
where the disks will appear optically thin. We estimate a disk dust mass for
the primary, DH Tau A of $17.2\pm1.7\,M_{\oplus}$, which gives a disk-to-star
mass ratio of 0.014 (assuming the usual Gas-to-Dust mass ratio of 100 in the
disk). We find a conservative disk dust mass upper limit of 0.42$M_{\oplus}$
for DH Tau b, assuming that the disk temperature is dominated by irradiation
from DH Tau b itself. Given the environment of the circumplanetary disk,
variable illumination from the primary or the equilibrium temperature of the
surrounding cloud would lead to even lower disk mass estimates. A MCFOST
radiative transfer model including heating of the circumplanetary disk by DH
Tau b and DH Tau A suggests that a mass averaged disk temperature of 22 K is
more realistic, resulting in a dust disk mass upper limit of 0.09$M_{\oplus}$
for DH Tau b. We place DH Tau b in context with similar objects and discuss the
consequences for planet formation models.

intermixing effects of dispersion and nonlinearity. The device consists of
identical cylinders arranged in a chain, which interact with each other as per
nonlinear Hertz's contact law. For a `dimer' configuration, i.e., two different
contact angles alternating in the chain, we analytically, numerically, and
experimentally show that impulse excitation can either propagate as a localized
wave, or it can travel as a highly dispersive wave. Remarkably, these extremes
can be achieved in this periodic arrangement simply by \textit{in-situ} control
of contact angles between cylinders. We close the discussion by highlighting
the key characteristics of the mechanisms that facilitate strong attenuation of
incident impulse. These include low frequency to high frequency (LF-HF)
scattering, and turbulence-like cascading in a periodic system. We thus
envision that these adaptive, cylinder-based nonlinear phononic crystals, in
conjunction with conventional impact mitigation mechanisms, could be used to
design highly tunable and efficient impact manipulation devices.

idea is to incorporate a parallel path that sends representations of input
values forward to deeper network layers. This scheme is substantially different
from ""deep supervision"" in which the loss layer is re-introduced to earlier
layers. The parallel path provided by fast-forwarding enhances the training
process in two ways. First, it enables the individual layers to combine
higher-level information (from the standard processing path) with lower-level
information (from the fast-forward path). Second, this new architecture reduces
the problem of vanishing gradients substantially because the fast-forwarding
path provides a shorter route for gradient backpropagation. In order to
evaluate the utility of the proposed technique, a Fast-Forward Network (FFNet),
with 20 convolutional layers along with parallel fast-forward paths, has been
created and tested. The paper presents empirical results that demonstrate
improved learning capacity of FFNet due to fast-forwarding, as compared to

consecutive tasks or tasks with changing requirements. We present the Recurrent
Discounted Attention (RDA) unit that builds on the RWA by additionally allowing
the discounting of the past.
  We empirically compare our model to RWA, LSTM and GRU units on several

learn much quicker than the LSTM and with better performance. On the multiple

can provide sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which may be
a the result of quantum gravity physics (QG). We review some observationally
testable consequences of LIV using effective field theory (EFT) formalism. To
do this, one can postulate the existence of additional small LIV terms in free
particle Lagrangians, suppressed by powers of the Planck mass. The
observational consequences of such terms are then examined. In particular, one
can place limits on a class of non-renormalizable, mass dimension five and six

Lagrangian-coherent-structure detection method of Haller et al. (2016) based on
the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation. RCLVs are identified for 30, 90,
and 270 day intervals over the entire satellite dataset, beginning in 1993. In
contrast to structures identified using Eulerian eddy-tracking methods, the
RCLVs maintain material coherence over the specified time intervals, making
them suitable for material transport estimates. Statistics of RCLVs are
compared to statistics of eddies identified from sea-surface height (SSH) by
Chelton et al. 2011. RCLVs and SSH eddies are found to propagate westward at
similar speeds at each latitude, consistent with the Rossby wave dispersion
relation. However, RCLVs are uniformly smaller and shorter-lived than SSH
eddies. A coherent eddy diffusivity is derived to quantify the contribution of
RCLVs to meridional transport; it is found that RCLVs contribute less than 1%
to net meridional dispersion and diffusion in this sector, implying that eddy
transport of tracers is mostly due to incoherent motions, such as swirling and
filamentation outside of the eddy cores, rather than coherent meridional
translation of eddies themselves. These findings call into question prior
estimates of coherent eddy transport based on Eulerian eddy identification
methods.

able to handle highly heterogeneous data better than first-order

augmenting contextual embeddings with second-order information further improves
model performance in some cases. Due to variance in the random initializations

areas. They help people select the optimal treatment for the test population
with certain statistical guarantee. However, subjects can show significant
heterogeneity in response to treatments. The problem of customizing treatment
assignment based on subject characteristics is known as uplift modeling,
differential response analysis, or personalized treatment learning in
literature. A key feature for uplift modeling is that the data is unlabeled. It
is impossible to know whether the chosen treatment is optimal for an individual
subject because response under alternative treatments is unobserved. This
presents a challenge to both the training and the evaluation of uplift models.
In this paper we describe how to obtain an unbiased estimate of the key
performance metric of an uplift model, the expected response. We present a new
uplift algorithm which creates a forest of randomized trees. The trees are
built with a splitting criterion designed to directly optimize their uplift
performance based on the proposed evaluation method. Both the evaluation method

types. Experimental results on synthetic data and industry-provided data show
that our algorithm leads to significant performance improvement over other

networks of non-muscle cells is still largely based on the intuition derived
from earlier works on muscle contractility. This view, however, largely
overlooks the free energy gain following passive cross-linker binding, which,
even in the absence of active fluctuations, provides a thermodynamic drive
towards highly overlapping filamentous states. In this work, we shed light on
this phenomenon, showing that passive cross-linkers, when considered in the
context of two anti-parallel filaments, generate noticeable contractile forces.
However, as binding free energy of cross-linkers is increased, a sharp onset of
kinetic arrest follows, greatly diminishing effectiveness of this contractility
mechanism, allowing the network to contract only with weakly resisting tensions
at its boundary. We have carried out stochastic simulations elucidating this
mechanism, followed by a mean-field treatment that predicts how contractile
forces asymptotically scale at small and large binding energies, respectively.
Furthermore, when considering an active contractile filament pair, based on
non-muscle myosin II, we found that the non-processive nature of these motors
leads to highly inefficient force generation, due to recoil slippage of the
overlap during periods when the motor is dissociated. However, we discovered
that passive cross-linkers can serve as a structural ratchet during these
unbound motor time spans, resulting in vast force amplification. Our results
shed light on the non-equilibrium effects of transiently binding proteins in
biological active matter, as observed in the non-muscle actin cytoskeleton,
showing that highly efficient contractile force dipoles result from synergy of
passive cross-linker and active motor dynamics, via a ratcheting mechanism on a
funneled energy landscape.

antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice. We consider spin-$S$ model with
nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) interactions. We
focus on the range of $1/8<J_2/J_1<1$, where the ordered states are different
from those in the model with only nearest neighbor exchange. A classical ground
state in this range has four sublattices and is infinitely degenerate in any
field. The actual order is then determined by quantum fluctuations via ""order
from disorder"" phenomenon. We argue that the phase diagram is rich due to
competition between competing four-sublattice quantum states which break either
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ orientational symmetry or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ sublattice symmetry. At
small and high fields, the ground state is a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-breaking canted
stripe state, but at intermediate fields the ordered states break
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ sublattice symmetry. The most noticeable of such states is
""three up, one down"" state in which spins in three sublattices are directed
along the field and in one sublattice opposite to the field. Such a state
breaks no continuous symmetry and has gapped excitations. As the consequence,
magnetization has a plateau at exactly one half of the saturation value. We
identify gapless states, which border the ""three up, one down"" state and
discuss the transitions between these states and the canted stripe state.

Orthogonal (DO) approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which
the corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original
system dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold. The embedded geometry
of the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed. The curvature of the
manifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through
the study of the Weingarten map. Differentiability results for the orthogonal
projection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit
dynamical system for tracking the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

explicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values. The DO
approximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies
instantaneously the SVD truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the
reduced solution. Riemannian matrix optimization is investigated in this
extrinsic framework to provide algorithms that adaptively update the best low

I) made it possible to perform Baade-Wesselink (BW) analysis of a large sample
of Blazhko stars for the first time. The BW distances of Blazhko stars turned
out to be unreliable, as significantly different distances were obtained for
the stars of the Blazhko sample and also for the same star in different
modulation phases. Even the results of small modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars
may be doubtful. This result warns that the application of the BW method to
Blazhko stars is not trustworthy.
  Keeping the distance fixed for each Blazhko star in each modulation phase, a
significant difference between the spectroscopic and the photometric radius
($R_{\textrm{sp}}$, $R_{\textrm{ph}}$) variations is detected. The phase and
amplitude variations of $R_{\textrm{sp}}$ follow the changes of the light curve
during the Blazhko cycle but the $R_{\textrm{ph}}$ curve seems to be not (or
only marginally) affected by the modulation. The asynchronous behaviour of
$R_{\textrm{sp}}$ and $R_{\textrm{ph}}$ supports the interpretation of the
Blazhko effect as a depth-dependent phenomenon, as the spectroscopic radius
variation reflects the radial displacement of the line-forming region high in
the atmosphere, while the photospheric radius variation is derived from the
information of the observed visual-band light emitted mostly by the lower
photosphere. The stability of $R_{\textrm{ph}}$ may be interpreted as a strong

cumulants, extracted from fluid dynamical simulations, are studied. The
commonly used finite particle number sampling procedure introduces an
additional Poissonian (or multinomial if global baryon number conservation is
enforced) contribution which increases the extracted moments of the baryon
number distribution. If this procedure is applied to a fluctuating fluid
dynamics framework one severely overestimates the actual cumulants. We show
that the sampling of so called test-particles suppresses the additional
contribution to the moments by at least one power of the number of
test-particles. We demonstrate this method in a numerical fluid dynamics
simulation that includes the effects of spinodal decomposition due to a first
order phase transition. Furthermore, in the limit where anti-baryons can be
ignored, we derive analytic formulas which capture exactly the effect of
particle sampling on the baryon number cumulants. These formulas may be used to
test the various numerical particle sampling algorithms.

higher dimensions, there is no critical nonlinearity. Indeed, for the nonlinear
diffusion of the form 1/u all the solutions, independently on the magnitude of
initial mass, stay bounded. However, the argument presented in [8] deals with
the Jager-Luckhaus type system. And is very sensitive to this restriction.
Namely, the change of variables introduced in [8], being a main step of the
method, works only for the Jager-Luckhaus modification. It does not seem to be
applicable in the usual version of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system.
The present paper fulfils this gap and deals with the case of the usual
parabolic-elliptic version. To handle it we establish a new Lyapunov-like
functional (it is related to what was done in [8]), which leads to global
existence of the initial-boundary value problem for any initial mass.

Short-crested wave breaking over a steeper beach generates stronger rip

the nature of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales in the Earth's magnetosheath.
In the first decade of the kinetic range, just below the ion gyroscale, the
turbulence was found to be similar to that in the upstream solar wind:
predominantly anisotropic, low-frequency and kinetic Alfv\'en in nature. A key
difference, however, is that the magnetosheath ions are typically much hotter
than the electrons, $T_\mathrm{i}\gg T_\mathrm{e}$, which, together with
$\beta_\mathrm{i}\sim 1$, leads to a change in behaviour in the second decade,
close to electron scales. The turbulence here is characterised by an increased
magnetic compressibility, following a mode we term the inertial kinetic
Alfv\'en wave, and a steeper spectrum of magnetic fluctuations, consistent with
the prediction $E_B(k_\perp)\propto k_\perp^{-11/3}$ that we obtain from a set

maximize a long-term network utility by jointly optimizing the data rate
control at the network layer and the power allocation among multiple users at
the physical layer, subject to practical constraints on both the short-term and
long-term power consumptions. To solve this problem, we leverage the
recently-developed Lyapunov optimization framework to convert the original
long-term optimization problem into a series of online rate control and power
allocation problems in each timeslot. The power allocation problem, however, is
shown to be non-convex in nature and thus cannot be solved with a standard
method. However, we explore two structures of the optimal solution and develop
a dynamic programming based power allocation algorithm, which can derive a
globally optimal solution, with a polynomial computational complexity.
Extensive simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the
proposed joint rate control and power allocation framework for NOMA systems,
which demonstrate that the proposed NOMA design can significantly outperform
multiple benchmark schemes, including orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes
with optimal power allocation and NOMA schemes with non-optimal power
allocation, in terms of average throughput and data delay.

flows, and shows that they result from the development of partially jammed
clusters of grains, or granular vortices. Transverse diffusion coefficients $D$
and average vortex sizes $\ell$ are systematically measured in simulated plane
shear flows at differing internal numbers $I$ revealing (i) a strong deviation
from the expected scaling $D\propto d^2 \dot \gamma$ involving the grain size
$d$ and shear rate $\dot \gamma$ and (ii) an increase in average vortex size
$\ell$ at low $I$, following $\ell\propto dI^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ but limited by the
system size. A general scaling $D\propto \ell d \dot \gamma $ is introduced
that captures all the measurements and highlights the key role of vortex size.
This leads to establishing a scaling for the diffusivity in dense granular flow
as $D\propto d^2 \sqrt{\dot \gamma/ t_i}$ involving the geometric average of
shear time $1/\dot\gamma$ and inertial time $t_i$ as the relevant time scale.
Analysis of grain trajectories further evidence that this diffusion process
arises from a vortex-driven random walk.

differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the

discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been
studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that
of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational
efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due
to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this
paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its
computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques,
as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new
approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN.
The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the
advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with
relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets,
including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN
significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative

compare the obtained results with the continuum-limit approximation. As in
graphene, nonuniform strain leads to a time-reversal preserving pseudo-magnetic
field that induces (pseudo) Landau levels. Unlike a real magnetic field, strain
lifts the degeneracy of the zeroth pseudo Landau levels at different valleys.
Moreover, for the zigzag edge under uniaxial strain, strain removes the
degeneracy within the pseudo-Landau levels by inducing a tilt in their energy
dispersion. The latter arises from next-to-leading order corrections to the
continuum-limit Hamiltonian, which are absent for a real magnetic field. We
show that, for the lowest pseudo-Landau levels in the Haldane model, the
dominant contribution to the tilt is different from graphene. In addition,
although strain does not strongly modify the dispersion of the edge states,
their interplay with the pseudo-Landau levels is different for the armchair and
zigzag ribbons. Finally, we study the effect of strain in the band structure of
the Haldane model at the critical point of the topological transition, thus
shedding light on the interplay between non-trivial topology and strain in

appears in the bending equation, unlike the case of the cosmological constant,
$\alpha=-1$. Due to this new term in particular, existing data for the light
bending at galactic scales yields, $(1+\alpha)\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-14})$,

Myr for intermediate-mass stars and 4-5 Myr for low-mass stars. In this study,
we simulate populations of young stars to investigate whether this apparent
dependence of estimated age on spectral type may be explained by the star
formation history of the association. Solar and intermediate mass stars begin
their pre-main sequence evolution on the Hayashi track, with fully convective
interiors and cool photospheres. Intermediate mass stars quickly heat up and
transition onto the radiative Henyey track. As a consequence, for clusters in
which star formation occurs on a similar timescale as the transition from a
convective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages
are calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass. Simple simulations
of a cluster with constant star formation over several Myr may explain about
half of the difference in inferred ages versus photospheric temperature;
speculative constructions that consist of a constant star formation followed by
a large supernova-driven burst could fully explain the differences, including
those between F and G stars where evolutionary tracks may be more accurate. The
age spreads of low-mass stars predicted from these prescriptions for star
formation are consistent with the observed luminosity spread of Upper Sco. The
conclusion that a lengthy star formation history will yield a temperature
dependence in ages is expected from the basic physics of pre-main sequence
evolution and is qualitatively robust to the large uncertainties in pre-main
sequence evolutionary models.

stage simply thresholds this estimate to select the ""important"" predictors. The
asymptotic false discovery proportion (AFDP) and true positive proportion
(ATPP) of these TVS are evaluated. We prove that for a fixed ATPP, in order to
obtain a smaller AFDP, one should pick a bridge estimator with smaller
asymptotic mean square error in the first stage of TVS. Based on such
principled discovery, we present a sharp comparison of different TVS, via an
in-depth investigation of the estimation properties of bridge estimators.
Rather than ""order-wise"" error bounds with loose constants, our analysis
focuses on precise error characterization. Various interesting signal-to-noise
ratio and sparsity settings are studied. Our results offer new and thorough
insights into high-dimensional variable selection. For instance, we prove that
a TVS with Ridge in its first stage outperforms TVS with other bridge

economic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative. Against this backdrop,
we propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram(ECG)
monitoring service. Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring
of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could
indicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia. Note that a traditional
telecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional
diagnostic centre without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic
accuracy of a bedside setup, albeit at high bandwidth cost. In this context, we
aim at reducing cost without significantly sacrificing reliability. To this
end, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that detects with high sensitivity
the anomalous beats only which are then transmitted. We further compress those
transmitted beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable
reconstruction/diagnostic fidelity. Such a scheme would not only reduce the
overall bandwidth requirement, but also localising anomalous beats, thereby
reducing physicians' burden. Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on
MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
system. In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC
in one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than
9% (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99.15%
reduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118-fold savings over traditional
telecardiology.

data in a related source domain to achieve informed knowledge transfer and help
the classification of unlabeled data in a target domain. In this paper, we
propose a novel DA method, namely Robust Data Geometric Structure Aligned,
Close yet Discriminative Domain Adaptation (RSA-CDDA), which brings closer, in
a latent joint subspace, both source and target data distributions, and aligns
inherent hidden source and target data geometric structures while performing
discriminative DA in repulsing both interclass source and target data. The
proposed method performs domain adaptation between source and target in solving
a unified model, which incorporates data distribution constraints, in
particular via a nonparametric distance, i.e., Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD),
as well as constraints on inherent hidden data geometric structure segmentation
and alignment between source and target, through low rank and sparse
representation. RSA-CDDA achieves the search of a joint subspace in solving the
proposed unified model through iterative optimization, alternating Rayleigh
quotient algorithm and inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm.
Extensive experiments carried out on standard DA benchmarks, i.e., 16
cross-domain image classification tasks, verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) experiment are described.
  The search for sterile neutrinos is currently one of the hottest topics in
neutrino physics. The JSNS$^2$ experiment aims to search for the existence of
neutrino oscillations with $\Delta m^2$ near 1 eV$^2$ at the J-PARC Materials
and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). A 1 MW beam of 3 GeV protons
incident on a spallation neutron target produces an intense neutrino beam from
muon decay at rest. Neutrinos come predominantly from $\mu^+$ decay: $\mu^{+}
\to e^{+} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu} + \nu_{e}$. The experiment will search for
$\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ to $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ oscillations which are detected by the
inverse beta decay interaction $\bar{\nu}_{e} + p \to e^{+} + n$, followed by
gammas from neutron capture on Gd. The detector has a fiducial volume of 17
tons and is located 24 meters away from the mercury target. JSNS$^2$ offers the
ultimate direct test of the LSND anomaly.
  In addition to the sterile neutrino search, the physics program includes
cross section measurements with neutrinos with a few 10's of MeV from muon
decay at rest and with monochromatic 236 MeV neutrinos from kaon decay at rest.
These cross sections are relevant for our understanding of supernova explosions
and nuclear physics.

a generic encoding of classic control and traversal strategies used in rewrite

estab- lished termination methods used for term rewriting systems can be
applied to analyze the termination of strategy controlled term rewriting

can be easily adapted to handle many-sorted signa- tures and we use a
meta-level representation of terms to reduce the size of the encodings. The
corresponding implementation in Tom generates term rewriting systems compatible
with the syntax of termination tools such as AProVE and TTT2, tools which
turned out to be very effective in (dis)proving the termination of the
generated term rewriting systems. The approach can also be seen as a generic
strategy compiler which can be integrated into languages providing pattern
matching primitives; experiments in Tom show that applying our encoding leads
to performances comparable to the native Tom strategies.

October and November. In some years, however, the activity is significantly
enhanced. Previous studies based on long-term activity statistics concluded
that the enhancement is caused by a swarm of meteoroids locked in 7:2 resonance
with Jupiter. Here we present precise data on 144 Taurid fireballs observed by
new digital cameras of the European Fireball Network in the enhanced activity
year 2015. Orbits of 113 fireballs show common characteristics and form
together a well defined orbital structure, which we call new branch. We found
that this branch is characterized by longitudes of perihelia lying between
155.9-160o and latitudes of perihelia between 4.2-5.7o. Semimajor axes are
between 2.23-2.28 AU and indeed overlap with the 7:2 resonance. Eccentricities
are in wide range 0.80-0.90. The orbits form a concentric ring in the inner
solar system. The masses of the observed meteoroids were in a wide range from
0.1 g to more than 1000 kg. We found that all meteoroids larger than 300 g were
very fragile, while those smaller than 30 g were much more compact. Based on
orbital characteristics, we argue that asteroids 2015 TX24 and 2005 UR, both of
diameters 200-300 meters, are direct members of the new branch. It is therefore
very likely that the new branch contains also numerous still not discovered
objects of decameter or even larger size. Since asteroids of sizes of tens to
hundreds meters pose a treat to the ground even if they are intrinsically weak,
impact hazard increases significantly when the Earth encounters the Taurid new
branch every few years. Further studies leading to better description of this
real source of potentially hazardous objects, which can be large enough to
cause significant regional or even continental damage on the Earth, are
therefore extremely important.

number of additional queries in worst-case time between $O(1)$ and $O(\log{n})$

technique, based on a heavy path decomposition of the suffix tree, enables also
a representation of the suffix array, of the inverse suffix array, and of $T$

explosions, is irrotational in nature, but the development of significant
amounts of vorticity and helicity, accompanied by large-scale dynamo action,
has been reported. Several earlier investigations examined vorticity production
in simpler systems; here all the relevant processes can be considered
simultaneously. We also investigate the mechanisms for the generation of net
helicity and large-scale flow in the system. We use a three-dimensional,
stratified, rotating and shearing local simulation domain of the size 1x1x2
kpc$^3$, forced with SN explosions occurring at the rate typical of the solar
neighbourhood in the Milky Way. In addition to the nominal simulation run with
realistic Milky Way parameters, we vary the rotation and shear rates, but keep
the absolute value of their ratio fixed. Reversing the sign of shear vs.
rotation allows us to separate the rotation- and shear-generated contributions.
As in earlier studies, we find the generation of significant amounts of
vorticity, with on average 65% of the kinetic energy being in the rotational
modes. The vorticity production can be related to the baroclinicity of the
flow, especially in the regions of hot, dilute clustered supernova bubbles. In
these regions, the vortex stretching acts as a sink of vorticity. The net
helicities produced by rotation and shear are of opposite signs for physically
motivated rotation laws, with the solar neighbourhood parameters resulting in
the near cancellation of the total net helicity. We also find the excitation of
oscillatory mean flows, the strength and oscillation period of which depend on
the Coriolis and shear parameters; we interpret these as signatures of the
anisotropic kinetic (AKA) effect. We use the method of moments to fit for the
turbulent transport coeffcients, and find $\alpha_{\rm AKA}$ values of the
order 3-5 km/s.

exponential only in the dimension of the program, and polynomial in the size of

fixed-parameter algorithms for NP-hard problems, where one wishes to isolate
the hardness of a problemby some parameter. However, in many cases using
Lenstra's algorithm has two drawbacks: First, the run time of the resulting
algorithms is often doubly-exponential in the parameter, and second, an ILP
formulation in small dimension cannot easily express problems involving many
different costs.
  Inspired by the work of Hemmecke, Onn and Romanchuk [Math. Prog. 2013], we
develop a single-exponential algorithm for so-called combinatorial n-fold
integer programs, which are remarkably similar to prior ILP formulations for
various problems, but unlike them, also allow variable dimension. We then apply

  Unlike Lenstra's algorithm, which is essentially a bounded search tree
algorithm, our result uses the technique of augmenting steps. At its heart is a
deep result stating that in combinatorial n-fold IPs, existence of an
augmenting step implies existence of a \local"" augmenting step, which can be
found using dynamic programming. Our results provide an important insight into
many problems by showing that they exhibit this phenomenon, and highlights the
importance of augmentation techniques.

redshift z~4 (when the Universe was 1.5 billion years old) necessitates the
presence of galaxies with star-formation rates exceeding 100 solar masses per
year at z>6 (corresponding to an age of the Universe of less than 1 billion
years). Surveys have discovered hundreds of galaxies at these early cosmic
epochs, but their star-formation rates are more than an order of magnitude
lower. The only known galaxies with very high star-formation rates at z>6 are,
with only one exception, the host galaxies of quasars, but these galaxies also
host accreting supermassive (more than $10^9$ solar masses) black holes, which
probably affect the properties of the galaxies. Here we report observations of
an emission line of singly ionized carbon ([CII] at a wavelength of 158
micrometres) in four galaxies at z>6 that are companions of quasars, with
velocity offsets of less than 600 kilometers per second and linear offsets of
less than 600 kiloparsecs. The discovery of these four galaxies was
serendipitous; they are close to their companion quasars and appear bright in
the far-infrared. On the basis of the [CII] measurements, we estimate
star-formation rates in the companions of more than 100 solar masses per year.
These sources are similar to the host galaxies of the quasars in [CII]
brightness, linewidth and implied dynamical masses, but do not show evidence
for accreting supermassive black holes. Similar systems have previously been
found at lower redshift. We find such close companions in four out of
twenty-five z>6 quasars surveyed, a fraction that needs to be accounted for in
simulations. If they are representative of the bright end of the [CII]
luminosity function, then they can account for the population of massive
elliptical galaxies at z~4 in terms of cosmic space density.

estimating antimicrobial exposure in Danish pig herds. Most challenges
presented are followed by at least one robust solution. A set of challenges
requiring awareness from the researcher, but for which no immediate solution

is extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the
single-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in
biochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable
here, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical
processes with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different

most simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal

diffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to
incorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate
on this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation
methods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with
situation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a
computationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical
functions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion

determination of crystals, crystallized protein structures or even single
molecules. While these techniques rely on coherent scattering, incoherent
processes like Compton scattering or fluorescence emission -- often the
predominant scattering mechanisms -- are generally considered detrimental for
imaging applications. Here we show that intensity correlations of incoherently
scattered x-ray radiation can be used to image the full 3D structure of the
scattering atoms with significantly higher resolution compared to conventional
coherent diffraction imaging and crystallography, including additional
three-dimensional information in Fourier space for a single sample orientation.
We present a number of properties of incoherent diffractive imaging that are
conceptually superior to those of coherent methods.

from a collection of line integrals. Given a complete sampling of such line
integrals for various angles and directions, explicit inverse formulas exist to
reconstruct the object. Given noisy and incomplete measurements, the inverse
problem is typically solved through a regularized least-squares approach. A
challenge for both approaches is that in practice the exact directions and
offsets of the x-rays are only known approximately due to, e.g. calibration
errors. Such errors lead to artifacts in the reconstructed image. In the case
of sufficient sampling and geometrically simple misalignment, the measurements
can be corrected by exploiting so-called consistency conditions. In other
cases, such conditions may not apply and we have to solve an additional inverse
problem to retrieve the angles and shifts. In this paper we propose a general
algorithmic framework for retrieving these parameters in conjunction with an
algebraic reconstruction technique. The proposed approach is illustrated by
numerical examples for both simulated data and an electron tomography dataset.

increasing the data rate by more than twice for sparse vehicle density while
enhancing the network throughput proportionally to the number of vehicles.
Furthermore, SAMBA was proven to be more efficient compared to legacy BF

immersed boundary method to account for the dispersed phase. Suspensions with 3
different Gaussian distributions of particle radii are considered (i.e. 3
different standard deviations). The distributions are centered on the reference
particle radius of the monodisperse suspension. In the most extreme case, the
radius of the largest particles is 4 times that of the smaller particles. We
consider two different solid volume fractions, 2% and 10%. We find that for all
polydisperse cases, both fluid and particles statistics are not substantially
altered with respect to those of the monodisperse case. Mean streamwise fluid
and particle velocity profiles are almost perfectly overlapping. Slightly
larger differences are found for particle velocity fluctuations. These increase
close to the wall and decrease towards the centerline as the standard deviation
of the distribution is increased. Hence, the behavior of the suspension is
mostly governed by excluded volume effects regardless of particle size
distribution (at least for the radii here studied). Due to turbulent mixing,
particles are uniformly distributed across the channel. However, smaller
particles can penetrate more into the viscous and buffer layer and velocity
fluctuations are therein altered. Non trivial results are presented for
particle-pair statistics.

driven by radiative acceleration of dust grains. For M-type AGB stars, the
nature of the wind-driving dust species has been a matter of intense debate. A
proposed source of the radiation pressure triggering the outflows is photon
scattering on Fe-free silicate grains. This wind-driving mechanism requires
grain radii of about 0.1 - 1 micron in order to make the dust particles
efficient at scattering radiation around the stellar flux maximum. Grain size
is therefore an important parameter for understanding the physics behind the
winds of M-type AGB stars. We seek to investigate the diagnostic potential of
scattered polarized light for determining dust grain sizes. We have developed a
new tool for computing synthetic images of scattered light in dust and gas
shells around AGB stars, which can be applied to detailed models of dynamical
atmospheres and dust-driven winds. We present maps of polarized light using
dynamical models computed with the DARWIN code. The synthetic images clearly
show that the intensity of the polarized light, the position of the inner edge
of the dust shell, and the size of the dust grains near the inner edge are all
changing with the luminosity phase. Non-spherical structures in the dust shells
can also have an impact on the polarized light. We simulate this effect by
combining different pulsation phases into a single 3D structure before
computing synthetic images. An asymmetry of the circumstellar envelope can
create a net polarization, which can be used as diagnostics for the grain size.
The ratio between the size of the scattering particles and the observed
wavelength determines at what wavelengths net polarization switches direction.
If observed, this can be used to constrain average particle sizes.

Molecular hydrogen does not adsorb at temperatures above 110 K in contrast to

different adlayer phases of atomic hydrogen on Sb(111) occur. At low substrate
temperatures ($110~$K), the deposited hydrogen layer does not show any ordering
while we observe a perfectly ordered $(1\times 1)$ H/Sb(111) structure for
deposition at room temperature. Furthermore, the amorphous hydrogen layer
deposited at low temperature forms an ordered overlayer upon heating the
crystal to room temperature. Hydrogen starts to desorb at $T_m = 430~$K which
corresponds to a desorption energy of $E_{des}=(1.33\pm0.06)~$eV. Using
measurements of the helium reflectivity during hydrogen exposure at different

proposed scheme, the BS performs the semi-persistent scheduling to optimize the
time scheduling and allocate frequency resources in a non-orthogonal manner
while the vehicles autonomously perform distributed power control. We formulate
the centralized scheduling and resource allocation problem as equivalent to a
multi-dimensional stable roommate matching problem, in which the users and
time/frequency resources are considered as disjoint sets of players to be
matched with each other. We then develop a novel rotation matching algorithm,
which converges to a q-exchange stable matching after a limited number of
iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the
traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of the latency and

During
their 3 dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid
collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak
long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in
both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred
value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range
attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents
in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space
requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy
of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion,
friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical
separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays
are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus,
next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that
the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not
sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes
the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that
ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than
to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing
interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate,
whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model
discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled
phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of
large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions. Our code is available at

temperature and spacecraft potential by the Rosetta Langmuir probe instrument,

warm component with electron temperature typically 5--10 eV at all heliocentric
distances covered (1.25 to 3.83 AU). A cold component, with temperature no
higher than about 0.1 eV, appears in the data as short (few to few tens of
seconds) pulses of high probe current, indicating local enhancement of plasma
density as well as a decrease in electron temperature. These pulses first
appeared around 3 AU and were seen for longer periods close to perihelion. The
general pattern of pulse appearance follows that of neutral gas and plasma
density. We have not identified any periods with only cold electrons present.
The electron flux to Rosetta was always dominated by higher energies, driving
the spacecraft potential to order -10 V. The warm (5--10 eV) electron
population is interpreted as electrons retaining the energy they obtained when
released in the ionisation process. The sometimes observed cold populations
with electron temperatures below 0.1 eV verify collisional cooling in the coma.
The cold electrons were only observed together with the warm population. The
general appearance of the cold population appears to be consistent with a
Haser-like model, implicitly supporting also the coupling of ions to the
neutral gas. The expanding cold plasma is unstable, forming filaments that we
observe as pulses.

to investigate the effects of the bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$, particle
Reynolds number $Re_p$ and duct to particle size ratio $h/a$ at different solid
volume fractions $\phi$, from very dilute conditions to $20\%$. We show that
the bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$ is the key parameter in inertial migration of
particles in dilute suspensions. At low solid volume fraction ($\phi=0.4\%$)
and low bulk Reynolds number $(Re_b= 144)$, particles accumulate at the center
of the duct walls. As $Re_b$ is increased, the focusing position moves
progressively towards the corners of the duct. At higher volume fractions,
$\phi=5, 10$ and $20\%$, and in wider ducts with $Re_b=550$, particles are
found to migrate away from the duct core towards the walls. In particular, for
$\phi=5$ and $10\%$, particles accumulate preferentially at the corners. At the
highest volume fraction considered, $\phi=20\%$, particles sample all the
volume of the duct, with a lower concentration at the duct core. The presence
of particles induces secondary cross-stream motions in the duct cross-section,
for all $\phi$. The intensity of these secondary flows depends strongly on
particle rotation rate, on the maximum concentration of particles in focusing
positions, and on the solid volume fraction. We find that the secondary flow
intensity increases with the volume fraction up to $\phi=5\%$. However, beyond
$\phi=5\%$ excluded volume effects lead to a strong reduction of cross-stream
velocities.

synthetic aperture radar (Doppler-SAR) paradigm. Conventional SAR
interferometry relies on wideband transmitted waveforms to obtain high range
resolution. Topography of a surface is directly related to the range difference
between two antennas configured at different positions. Doppler-SAR is a novel
imaging modality that uses ultra-narrowband continuous waves (UNCW). It takes
advantage of high resolution Doppler information provided by UNCWs to form high
resolution SAR images.
  We introduced the theory of Doppler-SAR interferometry. We derived
interferometric phase model and develop the equations of height mapping. Unlike
conventional SAR interferometry, we show that the topography of a scene is
related to the difference in Doppler between two antennas configured at
different velocities. While the conventional SAR interferometry uses range,
Doppler and Doppler due to interferometric phase in height mapping, Doppler-SAR
interferometry uses Doppler, Doppler-rate and Doppler-rate due to
interferometric phase in height mapping. We demonstrate our theory in numerical
simulations.
  Doppler-SAR interferometry offers the advantages of long-range, robust,
environmentally friendly operations; low-power, low-cost, lightweight systems
suitable for low-payload platforms, such as micro-satellites; and passive
applications using sources of opportunity transmitting UNCW.

gradient descent or one of its variants. These methods update the weights using
their gradient, estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has
been observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent
degradation in generalization performance - known as the ""generalization gap""
phenomena. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an
open problem.
  Contributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We
find that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically
with the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a ""random walk on
random landscape"" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar
""ultra-slow"" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted
experiments to show empirically that the ""generalization gap"" stems from the
relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size, and can be
completely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further
investigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and
present a novel algorithm named ""Ghost Batch Normalization"" which enables
significant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of
updates. To validate our findings we conduct several additional experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, we reassess common practices
and beliefs concerning training of deep models and suggest they may not be
optimal to achieve good generalization.

  of time-varying treatment",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has recently been a growing interest in the development of statistical
methods to compare medical costs between treatment groups. When cumulative cost
is the outcome of interest, right-censoring poses the challenge of informative
missingness due to heterogeneity in the rates of cost accumulation across
subjects. Existing approaches seeking to address the challenge of informative
cost trajectories typically rely on inverse probability weighting and target a
net ""intent-to-treat"" effect. However, no approaches capable of handling
time-dependent treatment and confounding in this setting have been developed to
date. A method to estimate the joint causal effect of a treatment regime on
cost would be of value to inform public policy when comparing interventions. In
this paper, we develop a nested g-computation approach to cost analysis in
order to accommodate time-dependent treatment and repeated outcome measures. We
demonstrate that our procedure is reasonably robust to departures from its
distributional assumptions and can provide unique insights into fundamental
differences in average cost across time-dependent treatment regimes.

game [Playing with Subshifts, Fund. Inform. 132 (2014), 131--152]. The game has
a predetermined (possibly finite) choice sequence $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$,
$\ldots$ of integers such that on round $n$ the player $A$ chooses a subset
$S_n$ of size $\alpha_n$ of some fixed finite alphabet and the player $B$ picks
a letter from the set $S_n$. The outcome is determined by whether the word
obtained by concatenating the letters $B$ picked lies in a prescribed target
set $X$ (a win for player $A$) or not (a win for player $B$). Typically, we
consider $X$ to be a subshift. The winning shift $W(X)$ of a subshift $X$ is
defined as the set of choice sequences for which $A$ has a winning strategy
when the target set is the language of $X$. The winning shift $W(X)$ mirrors
some properties of $X$. For instance, $W(X)$ and $X$ have the same entropy.
Virtually nothing is known about the structure of the winning shifts of
subshifts common in combinatorics on words. In this paper, we study the winning
shifts of subshifts generated by marked uniform substitutions, and show that
these winning shifts, viewed as subshifts, also have a substitutive structure.
Particularly, we give an explicit description of the winning shift for the
generalized Thue-Morse substitutions. It is known that $W(X)$ and $X$ have the
same factor complexity. As an example application, we exploit this connection
to give a simple derivation of the first difference and factor complexity
functions of subshifts generated by marked substitutions. We describe these
functions in particular detail for the generalized Thue-Morse substitutions.

classify all finite-dimensional, irreducible representations and determine the

  Chaining Extended",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aligning sequencing reads on graph representations of genomes is an important
ingredient of pan-genomics. Such approaches typically find a set of local
anchors that indicate plausible matches between substrings of a read to
subpaths of the graph. These anchor matches are then combined to form a
(semi-local) alignment of the complete read on a subpath. Co-linear chaining is
an algorithmically rigorous approach to combine the anchors. It is a well-known
approach for the case of two sequences as inputs. Here we extend the approach
so that one of the inputs can be a directed acyclic graph (DAGs), e.g. a
splicing graph in transcriptomics or a variant graph in pan-genomics.
  This extension to DAGs turns out to have a tight connection to the minimum
path cover problem, asking for a minimum-cardinality set of paths that cover
all the nodes of a DAG. We study the case when the size $k$ of a minimum path
cover is small, which is often the case in practice. First, we propose an
algorithm for finding a minimum path cover of a DAG $(V,E)$ in $O(k|E|\log|V|)$
time, improving all known time-bounds when $k$ is small and the DAG is not too
dense. Second, we introduce a general technique for extending dynamic
programming (DP) algorithms from sequences to DAGs. This is enabled by our
minimum path cover algorithm, and works by mimicking the DP algorithm for
sequences on each path of the minimum path cover. This technique generally
produces algorithms that are slower than their counterparts on sequences only
by a factor $k$. Our technique can be applied, for example, to the classical
longest increasing subsequence and longest common subsequence problems,
extended to labeled DAGs. Finally, we apply this technique to the co-linear
chaining problem. We also implemented the new co-linear chaining approach.
Experiments on splicing graphs show that the new method is efficient also in
practice.

results are obtained by use of the asymptotic stability of constant solutions
and pairs of diverging traveling front solutions of these equations, instead of

The construction of the first kind of entire solutions is based on these

eventually stay in a conformed region. Another kind of entire solutions is
related to some traveling front solutions of scalar equations

worst-case quality loss, that ensures that the output of the mechanism always

maximizes the conditional entropy and is optimal in terms of average adversary
error, and compare its performance with previously proposed optimal mechanisms
using two real datasets. Our empirical results confirm that no mechanism fares
well on every privacy criteria simultaneously, making apparent the need for
considering multiple privacy dimensions to have a good understanding of the

complex downtown scenarios with multiple road users, e.g., pedestrians, bikes,

challenge by combining a Bayesian filtering technique for environment
representation, and machine learning as long-term predictor. More specifically,
a dynamic occupancy grid map is utilized as input to a deep convolutional
neural network. This yields the advantage of using spatially distributed
velocity estimates from a single time step for prediction, rather than a raw
data sequence, alleviating common problems dealing with input time series of
multiple sensors. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks have the inherent
characteristic of using context information, enabling the implicit modeling of
road user interaction. Pixel-wise balancing is applied in the loss function
counteracting the extreme imbalance between static and dynamic cells. One of
the major advantages is the unsupervised learning character due to fully
automatic label generation. The presented algorithm is trained and evaluated on
multiple hours of recorded sensor data and compared to Monte-Carlo simulation.

demonstrator. PERLE is thus projected as a facility to investigate efficient,
high current (> 10 mA) ERL operation with three re-circulation passages through
newly designed SCRF cavities, at 801.58 MHz frequency, and following
deceleration over another three re-circulations. In its fully equipped
configuration, PERLE provides an electron beam of approximately 1 GeV energy. A
physics programme possibly associated with PERLE is sketched, consisting of
high precision elastic electron-proton scattering experiments, as well as
photo-nuclear reactions of unprecedented intensities with up to 30 MeV photon
beam energy as may be obtained using Fabry-Perot cavities. The facility has
further applications as a general technology test bed that can investigate and
validate novel superconducting magnets (beam induced quench tests) and
superconducting RF structures (structure tests with high current beams, beam
loading and transients). Besides a chapter on operation aspects, the report
contains detailed considerations on the choices for the SCRF structure, optics
and lattice design, solutions for arc magnets, source and injector and on
further essential components. A suitable configuration derived from the here
presented design concept may next be moved forward to a technical design and
possibly be built by an international collaboration which is being established.

of the chemical evolution and advancement of planet formation theory in
low-mass environments. Historically the determination of stellar parameters of
low-mass stars has been challenging due to the low surface temperature, causing
several molecules to form in the photospheric layers. In our work we use the
fact that infrared high-resolution spectrographs have opened up a new window
for investigating M dwarfs.
  Aims. Metallicity determination using high-resolution spectra is more
accurate than the use of low-resolution spectra, but rather time-consuming. In
this paper we expand our sample analyzed with this precise method both in
metallicity and effective temperature in order to build up a calibration sample
for a future revised empirical calibration.
  Methods. Because of the relatively few molecular lines in the J-band,
continuum rectification is possible for high-resolution spectra, allowing the
stellar parameters to be determined with greater accuracy than using optical
spectra. The metallicity was determined using synthetic spectral fitting of
several atomic species.
  Results. We have analyzed sixteen targets, with a range of effective
temperature from 3350-4550 K. The resulting metallicities lie between -0.5 <
[M/H] < +0.4. A few targets have previously been analyzed using low-resolution
spectra, and we find a rather good agreement with our values. A comparison with
available photometric calibrations shows varying agreement, and the spread
within all empirical calibrations is large.
  Conclusions. Including the targets from our previous paper, we have analyzed
28 M dwarfs using high-resolution infrared spectra. The targets spread
approximately one dex in metallicity and 1400 K in effective temperature. For
individual M dwarfs we achieve uncertainties of 0.05 dex and 100 K on average.

proposed. To enhance the performance, this method is substantially modified in
this paper: i) because the wavelet transform used for instantaneous frequency
(IF) estimation is not signal-dependent, a low-complexity ASTFT based on a
novel concentration measure is addressed; ii) in order to increase robustness
to IF estimation error, the principal component analysis (PCA) replaces the
difference operator for calculating the chirp rate; and iii) a more robust
Gaussian kernel with time-frequency-varying window width is proposed.
Simulation results show that our method has higher energy concentration than
the other ASTFTs, especially for multicomponent signals and nonlinear FM
signals. Also, for IF estimation, our method is superior to many other adaptive
TFRs in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments.

Suppose that $L_i\cong P_2$, for some $i$ and that some vertex $u$ of $L_{i-1}$
is at distance $1$ in the grid to a vertex $v$ of $L_{i+1}$. An elementary
transformation of the path consists in replacing the edge of $L_i$ by a new

characterizes molecular devices, but their precise understanding and control

conductance of alkanedithiolate junctions can both increase and decrease with
mechanical stretching and the specific trend is determined by the S-Au linkage
coordination number (CN) or the molecule-electrode contact atomic structure.
Specifically, we find that the mechanical pulling results in the conductance
increase for the junctions based on S-Au CN two and CN three contacts, while
the conductance is minimally affected by stretching for junctions with the CN
one contact and decreases upon the formation of Au monoatomic chains. Detailed
analysis unravels the mechanisms involving the competition between the
stretching-induced upshift of the highest occupied molecular orbital-related
states toward the Fermi level of electrodes and the deterioration of
molecule-electrode electronic couplings in different contact CN cases.
Moreover, we experimentally find a higher chance to observe the conductance
enhancement mode under a faster elongation speed, which is explained by ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations that reveal an important role of thermal
fluctuations in aiding deformations of contacts into low-coordination
configurations that include monoatomic Au chains. Pointing out the
insufficiency in previous notions of associating peak values in conductance
histograms with specific contact atomic structures, this work resolves the
controversy on the origins of ubiquitous multiple conductance peaks in

solution is the design of an efficient data delivery solution. Social
characteristics are recently being considered as a promising alternative. Most
opportunistic network applications rely on the different mobile devices carried
by users, and whose behavior affects the use of the device itself.
  This work presents the ""Friendship and Selfishness Forwarding"" (FSF)
algorithm. FSF analyses two aspects to make message forwarding decisions when a
contact opportunity arises: First, it classifies the friendship strength among
a pair of nodes by using a machine learning algorithm to quantify the
friendship strength among pairs of nodes in the network. Next, FSF assesses the
relay node selfishness to consider those cases in which, despite a strong
friendship with the destination, the relay node may not accept to receive the
message because it is behaving selfishly, or because its device has resource
constraints in that moment.
  By using trace-driven simulations through the ONE simulator, we show that the
FSF algorithm outperforms previously proposed schemes in terms of delivery
rate, average cost, and efficiency.

predicts the inner and outer radius of the region, the cloud dynamics under the

Knowledge of the dynamics allows to predict the shapes of the emission lines as

function enrichment, which overcomes the common problem of the RANS-LES
transition and enables coarse meshes near the boundary. While the concept of
function enrichment as an efficient discretization technique for turbulent
boundary layers has been proposed in an earlier article by Krank & Wall (J.
Comput. Phys. 316 (2016) 94-116), the contribution of this work is a rigorous
derivation of a new multiscale turbulence modeling approach and a corresponding
discontinuous Galerkin discretization scheme. In the near-wall area, the
Navier-Stokes equations are explicitly solved for an LES and a RANS component
in one single equation. This is done by providing the Galerkin method with an
independent set of shape functions for each of these two methods; the standard
high-order polynomial basis resolves turbulent eddies where the mesh is
sufficiently fine and the enrichment automatically computes the
ensemble-averaged flow if the LES mesh is too coarse. As a result of the
derivation, the RANS model is consistently applied solely to the RANS degrees
of freedom, which effectively prevents the typical issue of a log-layer
mismatch in attached boundary layers. As the full Navier-Stokes equations are
solved in the boundary layer, spatial refinement gradually yields wall-resolved
LES with exact boundary conditions. Numerical tests show the outstanding
characteristics of the wall model regarding grid independence, superiority
compared to equilibrium wall models in separated flows, and achieve a speed-up
by two orders of magnitude compared to wall-resolved LES.

is a concentration inequality that bounds the probability that

$\theta^\star$ is the parameter of an unknown target distribution, $\hat
\theta_n$ is the empirical parameter estimate built from $n$ observations,
$\psi$ is the log-partition function of the exponential family and
$\mathcal{B}^\psi$ is the corresponding Bregman divergence. From the
perspective of stochastic multi-armed bandits, we pay special attention to the
case when the boundary function $f$ is logarithmic, as it is enables to analyze
the regret of the state-of-the-art \KLUCB\ and \KLUCBp\ strategies, whose
analysis was left open in such generality. Indeed, previous results only hold
for the case when $K=1$, while we provide results for arbitrary finite

surprisingly, we highlight that the proof techniques to achieve these strong

hyper-elastic wall. In the fluid region the flow is governed by the
incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, while the solid is a neo-Hookean
material satisfying the incompressible Mooney-Rivlin law. The multiphase flow
is solved with a one-continuum formulation, using a monolithic velocity field
for both the fluid and solid phase, which allows the use of a fully Eulerian
formulation. The simulations are carried out at Reynolds bulk $Re=2800$ and
examine the effect of different elasticity and viscosity of the deformable
wall. We show that the skin friction increases monotonically with the material
elastic modulus. The turbulent flow in the channel is affected by the moving
wall even at low values of elasticity since non-zero fluctuations of vertical
velocity at the interface influence the flow dynamics. The near-wall streaks
and the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly reduced near a highly
elastic wall while the flow becomes more correlated in the spanwise direction,
similarly to what happens for flows over rough and porous walls. As a
consequence, the mean velocity profile in wall units is shifted downwards when
shown in logarithmic scale, and the slope of the inertial range increases in
comparison to that for the flow over a rigid wall. We propose a correlation
between the downward shift of the inertial range, its slope and the wall-normal
velocity fluctuations at the wall, extending results for the flow over rough
walls. We finally show that the interface deformation is determined by the
fluid fluctuations when the viscosity of the elastic layer is low, while when
this is high the deformation is limited by the solid properties.

mass introduced by the mirror leptons but are otherwise unnecessary and assumed
to be decoupled in previous phenomenological studies. Furthermore, as we

affects lepton flavor changing gauge transitions, it decouples from these

a finite measurable partition such that the symmetric cylinder sets in the
generated process shrink in diameter uniformly to zero. The problem of
existence and optimal cardinality of uniform generators has lead us to new
challenges in the theory of symbolic extensions. At the beginning we show that
uniform generators can be identified with so-called symbolic extensions with an
embedding, i.e., symbolic extensions admitting an equivariant measurable
selector from preimages. From here we focus on such extensions and we strive to
characterize the collection of the corresponding extension entropy functions on
invariant measures. For aperiodic zero-dimensional systems we show that this
collection coincides with that of extension entropy functions in arbitrary
symbolic extensions, which, by the general theory of symbolic extensions, is
known to coincide with the collection of all affine superenvelopes of the
entropy structure of the system. In particular, we recover, after [Bu16], that
an aperiodic zero-dimensional system is asymptotically h- expansive if and only
if it admits an isomorphic symbolic extension. Next we pass to systems with
periodic points, and we introduce the notion of a period tail structure, which
captures the local growth rate of periodic orbits. Finally, we succeed in
precisely identifying the wanted collection of extension entropy functions in
symbolic extensions with an embedding: these are all the affine superenvelopes
of the usual entropy structure which lie above certain threshold function
determined by the period tail structure. This characterization allows us, among
other things, to give estimates (and in examples to compute precisely) the
optimal cardinality of a uniform generator.

range of delay tuning in a self-mode-locked two-section quantum dash lasers
emitting at ~ 1.55 micron and operating at ~ 21 GHz repetition rate subject to
single and dual optical feedback into gain section. Various feedback conditions
are investigated and optimum levels determined for narrowest linewidth and
reduced timing jitter for both single and dual loop configurations. We
demonstrate that dual loop feedback, with the shorter feedback cavity tuned to
be fully resonant, followed by fine tuning of the phase of the longer feedback
cavity, gives stable narrow RF spectra across the widest delay range, unlike
single loop feedback. In addition, for dual loop configurations, under fully
resonant conditions, integrated timing jitter is reduced from 3.9 ps to 295 fs
[10 kHz-100 MHz], the RF linewidth narrows from 100 kHz to < 1 kHz, with more
than 30 dB fundamental side-mode suppression. We show that dual loop optical
feedback with separate fine tuning of both external cavities is far superior to
single loop feedback, with increased system tolerance against phase delay
mismatch, making it a robust and cost-effective technique for developing
practical, reliable and low-noise mode-locked lasers, optoelectronic

MR images without folding complications and with robustness to chemical shift
and susceptibility artifacts. It is here shown that further resolution
improvements can arise by relying on multiple receivers, to interpolate the
sampled data along the low-bandwidth dimension. The ensuing multiple-sensor
interpolation is akin to recently introduced SPEN interleaving procedures,
albeit without requiring multiple shots.
  Methods: By casting SPEN's spatial rasterization in k-space, it becomes
evident that local k-data interpolations enabled by multiple receivers are akin
to real-space interleaving of SPEN images. The practical implementation of such
resolution-enhancing procedure becomes similar to those normally used in SMASH
or SENSE, yet relaxing these methods' fold-over constraints.
  Results: Experiments validating the theoretical expectations were carried out
on phantoms and human volunteers on a 3T scanner. The experiments showed the
expected resolution enhancement, at no cost in the sequence's complexity. With
the addition of multibanding and stimulated echo procedures, 48-slices
full-brain coverage could be recorded free from distortions at sub-mm
resolution, in 3 sec.
  Conclusion: Super-resolved SPEN with SENSE (SUSPENSE) achieves the goals of
multi-shot SPEN interleaving within one single scan, delivering single-shot
sub-mm in-plane resolutions in scanners equipped with suitable multiple
sensors.

excelling especially in galaxies. When formulated as a modified gravity theory,
it leads to the so called external field effect (EFE). In the case of the solar
system this means that bodies orbiting the Sun are influenced, beyond its tidal
effect, by the external gravitational field of the Galaxy with magnitude
$\sim2\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ and time-varying direction. Aphelia of
intermediate outer Oort cloud (OC) comets ($30<X<60,~X\equiv
10^{6}/a[\text{au}]$, where $a$ is semimajor axis) are distributed
non-uniformly on the celestial sphere, showing an apparent concentration around
a great circle centered at Galactic longitudes $L=-45$ and 135 deg. Such
non-uniformity is beyond that attributable to the classical injectors of
comets, stellar encounters and the Galactic tides, as well as the expected
observational biases. We investigated a hypothesis that the great circle
concentration of aphelia is a consequence of the long-term action of EFE in the
framework of MD. We considered exclusively quasi-linear MOND (QUMOND) theory.
We built our model of the OC in MD on an analytical approximation of the QUMOND
potential for a point mass in the dominant external field of constant
magnitude. The model is well applicable at heliocentric distances
$r\gtrsim10~000$ au. Constraints on the strength of EFE found by the analysis
of the Cassini radio-tracking data were taken into account. We demonstrated
characteristic imprint of the EFE on the distribution of aphelia of candidate
outer OC comets that migrated down to $r=10~000$ au. By both analytical and
numerical calculations, we showed that the combined effect of EFE and the
Galactic tides could qualitatively account for the characteristic features seen
in the observed distribution of aphelia of the outer OC comets.

collections is actual more than ever because of fatal corrosion of the 19th
century glass beads. Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful method for
investigation of glass, namely, of correlation of the structure-chemical
composition. Therefore, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used for
examination of degradation processes in cloudy turquoise glass beads, which in
contrast to other color ones deteriorate especially strongly. Micro-X-ray
fluorescence spectrometry of samples has shown that lead-potassium glass
PbO-K$_2$O-SiO$_2$ with small amount of Cu and Sb was used for manufacture of
cloudy turquoise beads. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study of the
beads at different stages of glass corrosion was carried out in the range from
200 to 4000 cm$^{-1}$ in the attenuated total reflection mode. In all the
spectra, we have observed shifts of two major absorption bands to low-frequency
range (~1000 and ~775 cm$^{-1}$) compared to ones typical for amorphous SiO2
(~1100 and 800 cm$^{-1}$, respectively). Such an effect is connected with
Pb$^{2+}$ and K$^+$ appending to the glass network. The presence of a weak band
at ~1630 cm$^{-1}$ in all the spectra is attributed to the adsorption of
H$_2$O. After annealing of the beads, the band disappeared completely in less
deteriorated samples and became significantly weaker in more destroyed ones.
Based on that we conclude that there is adsorbed molecular water on the beads.
However, products of corrosion (e.g., alkali in the form of white crystals or
droplets of liquid alkali) were not observed on the glass surface. We have also
observed glass depolymerisation in the strongly degraded beads, which is
exhibited in domination of the band peaked at ~1000 cm$^{-1}$.

the Schr\""odinger equation, however, the probability current is not locally
conserved. We show that in these cases the correct electromagnetic coupling
requires a relatively simple extension of Maxwell theory which has been known
for some time and recently improved by covariant integration of a scalar degree
of freedom. We discuss some general properties of the solutions and examine in
particular the case of an oscillating dipolar source. Remarkable mathematical
and physical differences emerge with respect to Maxwell theory, as a
consequence of additional current terms present in the equations for $\nabla
\cdot \textbf{E}$ and $\nabla \times \textbf{B}$. Several possible applications
are mentioned.

evolution of the upper crust. The general application of thermal history
modelling of apatite fission-track analysis requires both the parameters of the
apparent age together with the confined track-length distribution of the
spontaneous tracks. However, obtaining length data is relatively easy and does
not require either irradiation or LA-ICP-MS commonly used for determining the
uranium content of the grains for age dating. This leads to a shorter
laboratory process. For this purpose, based on apatite U-Th/He method, this
paper attempts to decouple apatite fission-track age from apatite fission-track
length, and then combine the lengths with the respective apatite U-Th/He age to
model the thermal history. Therefore, experiments were designed and conducted
using a new program ""Low-T Thermo"". Results of this modelling are presented
from the following experiments: apatite fission-track age combined with apatite
U-Th/He age; apatite fission-track confined track-length distribution plus
apatite U-Th/He age. The modelling precision using this method is related to
the relative errors of the apatite U-Th/He ages and the helium diffusion model.
This combination of apatite fission-track length and apatite U-Th/He ages has
not been implemented before but is presented here as an alternative way of
determining thermal histories without the addition of apatite fission-track
ages.
