surface flows into solar active regions. These play an important role in
flux-transport models of the solar dynamo.
  Aims. We aim to validate the existence of the inflows by deriving horizontal
flow velocities around active regions with local correlation tracking of
granulation.
  Methods. We generate a six-year long-time series of full-disk maps of the
horizontal velocity at the solar surface by tracking granules in continuum
intensity images provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
  Results. On average, active regions are surrounded by inflows extending up to
10 deg from the center of the active region of magnitudes of 20-30 m/s,
reaching locally up to 40 m/s, which is in agreement with results from local
helioseismology. By computing an ensemble average consisting of 243 individual
active regions, we show that the inflows are not azimuthally symmetric but
converge predominantly towards the trailing polarity of the active region with
respect to the longitudinally and temporally averaged flow field.

Specifically, we want to use minimal supervision to learn a latent

example, consider a collection of face images grouped by identity. We wish to
anchor the semantics of the grouping into a relevant and disentangled

semantically meaningful parts by working both at the group level and the
observation level, while retaining efficient test-time inference. Quantitative
and qualitative evaluations show that the ML-VAE model (i) learns a
semantically meaningful disentanglement of grouped data, (ii) enables
manipulation of the latent representation, and (iii) generalises to unseen

quasi-probability distributions associated with a Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism
where Clifford gates are positive state-independent maps. This is accomplished
by generalizing the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism to three generators instead of
two---producing an exterior, or Grassmann, algebra---which results in Clifford
group gates for qubits that act as a permutation on the finite Weyl phase space
points naturally associated with stabilizer states. As a result, a non-negative
probability distribution can be associated with each stabilizer state's
three-generator Wigner function, and these distributions evolve
deterministically to one another under Clifford gates. This corresponds to a
hidden variable theory that is non-contextual and local for qubit Clifford
gates while Clifford (Pauli) measurements have a context-dependent
representation. Equivalently, we show that qubit Clifford gates can be
expressed as propagators within the three-generator Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism
whose semiclassical expansion is truncated at order $\hbar^0$ with a finite
number of terms. The $T$-gate, which extends the Clifford gate set to one
capable of universal quantum computation, require a semiclassical expansion of
the propagator to order $\hbar^1$. We compare this approach to previous
quasi-probability descriptions of qubits that relied on the two-generator
Wigner-Weyl-Moyal formalism and find that the two-generator Weyl symbols of
stabilizer states result in a description of evolution under Clifford gates
that is state-dependent, in contrast to the three-generator formalism. We have
thus extended Wigner non-negative quasi-probability distributions from the odd

new planning and operational tools. However, such tools depend on system
topology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in
distribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to
find line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately,
the linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the
input measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output
measurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even
with a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of
finding the topology using non-zero line parameters with a proper metric. To
model input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the
error-in-variables (EIV) model in a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
framework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly
solving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a
generalized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and
noise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with
parameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization
fashion in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a
radial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior
performance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder

thermal emission, which we attribute to the presence of a weak active galactic
nuclei (AGN). In addition, we report for the first time a broad component
(FWHM$\sim$ 3000km$s^{-1}$) in the H$\alpha$ emission line in the nuclear
region of NGC 5044. By using emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams we found
that two dominant ionization processes coexist, while the nuclear region (inner
200 pc) is ionized by a low luminosity AGN, the filamentary structures are
consistent with being excited by shocks. The H$\alpha$ velocity field shows
evidence of a rotating disk, which has a velocity amplitude of
$\sim$240kms$^{-1}$ at $\sim$ 136 pc from the nucleus. Assuming a Keplerian
approach we estimated that the mass inside this radius is $1.9\times10^9$
$M_{\odot}$, which is in agreement with the value obtained through the
M-$\sigma$ relation, $ M_{SMBH}=1.8\pm1.6\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$. Modelling the
ionized gas velocity field by a rotating disk component plus inflows towards
the nucleus along filamentary structures, we obtain a mass inflow rate of
$\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$. This inflow rate is enough to power the central AGN in NGC
5044.

different input symbols to the channel incur a certain cost. For example, for
bosonic quantum channels, the cost associated with an input state is the number
of photons, which is proportional to the energy consumed. In such a setting, it
is often useful to know the maximum amount of information that can be reliably
transmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the capacity per unit cost. In
this paper, we generalize the capacity per unit cost to various communication
tasks involving a quantum channel such as classical communication,
entanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and
quantum communication. For each task, we define the corresponding capacity per
unit cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity.
Furthermore, for the special and natural case in which there is a zero-cost
state, we obtain expressions in terms of an optimized relative entropy
involving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an
explicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the capacity per
unit cost. Finally, we compute capacities per unit cost for various bosonic
Gaussian channels and introduce the notion of a blocklength constraint as a
proposed solution to the long-standing issue of infinite capacities per unit
cost. This motivates the idea of a blocklength-cost duality, on which we
elaborate in depth.

in many technological applications such as enhanced oil recovery and geological
carbon-dioxide sequestration. The flow within numerous natural and synthetic
porous materials that contain multiple scales of pores cannot be adequately
described by the classical Darcy equations. It is for this reason that
mathematical models for fluid flow in media with multiple scales of pores have
been proposed in the literature. However, these models are analytically
intractable for realistic problems. In this paper, a stabilized mixed
four-field finite element formulation is presented to study the flow of an
incompressible fluid in porous media exhibiting double porosity/permeability.
The stabilization terms and the stabilization parameters are derived in a
mathematically and thermodynamically consistent manner, and the computationally
convenient equal-order interpolation of all the field variables is shown to be
stable. A systematic error analysis is performed on the resulting stabilized
weak formulation. Representative problems, patch tests and numerical
convergence analyses are performed to illustrate the performance and
convergence behavior of the proposed mixed formulation in the discrete setting.
The accuracy of numerical solutions is assessed using the mathematical
properties satisfied by the solutions of this double porosity/permeability
model. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework can perform well under
transient conditions and that it can capture well-known instabilities such as
viscous fingering.

presence of clouds/hazes. Such inferences are typically based on spectral
slopes in the optical deviant from gaseous Rayleigh scattering or low-amplitude
spectral features in the infrared. We investigate three observable metrics that
could allow constraints on cloud properties from transmission spectra, namely,
the optical slope, the uniformity of this slope, and condensate features in the
infrared. We derive these metrics using model transmission spectra considering
Mie extinction from a wide range of condensate species, particle sizes, and
scale heights. Firstly, we investigate possible degeneracies among the cloud
properties for an observed slope. We find, for example, that spectra with very
steep optical slopes suggest sulphide clouds (e.g. MnS, ZnS, Na$_2$S) in the
atmospheres. Secondly, (non)uniformities in optical slopes provide additional
constraints on cloud properties, e.g., MnS, ZnS, TiO$_2$, and Fe$_2$O$_3$ have
significantly non-uniform slopes. Thirdly, infrared spectra provide an
additional powerful probe into cloud properties, with SiO$_2$, Fe$_2$O$_3$,
Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, and MgSiO$_3$ bearing strong infrared features observable with

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster mass function and from weak gravitational
lensing studies, when taken at face value, is in tension with measurements of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). In
this work, we revisit whether this possible discrepancy can be attributed to
new interactions in the dark matter sector. Focusing on a cosmological model
where dark matter interacts with a dark radiation species until the epoch of
matter-radiation equality, we find that measurements of the Lyman-alpha flux
power spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides no support to the
hypothesis that new dark matter interactions can resolve the possible tension
between CMB and large-scale structure (LSS). Indeed, while the addition of dark
matter-dark radiation interactions leads to an improvement of
$2\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}=12$ with respect to the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model when only CMB, BAO, and LSS data are considered,
the inclusion of Lyman-alpha data reduces the improvement of the fit to
$2\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}=6$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM. We thus conclude that the
statistical evidence for new dark matter interactions (largely driven by the
Planck SZ dataset) is marginal at best, and likely caused by systematics in the
data. We also perform a Fisher forecast analysis for the reach of a future
dataset composed of a CMB-S4 experiment combined with the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope galaxy survey. We find that the constraint on the effective number of
fluid-like dark radiation species, $\Delta N_{\rm fluid}$, will be improved by
an order of magnitude compared to current bounds.

affecting supernova dust grains as they are incorporated into the thermalized
medium within young massive star clusters. The model is used to explain the
near- to mid-infrared (NIR-MIR) excess found in such clusters and usually
modeled as a blackbody with temperature $\sim (400-1000)$ K. In our approach,
dust grains are efficiently produced in the clumpy ejecta of core-collapse
supernovae, fragmented into small pieces ($\lesssim 0.05$ $\mu$m) as they are
incorporated into the hot and dense ISM, heated via frequent collisions with
electrons and the absorption of energetic photons. Grains with small sizes can
more easily acquire the high temperatures ($\sim 1000$ K) required to produce a
NIR-MIR excess with respect to the emission of foreground PAHs and starlight.
However, the extreme conditions inside young massive clusters make difficult
for these small grains to have a persistent manifestation at NIR-MIR
wavelengths as they are destroyed by efficient thermal sputtering.
Nevertheless, the chances for a persistent manifestation are increased by
taking into account that small grains become increasingly transparent to their
impinging ions as their size decreases. For an individual SN event, we find
that the NIR-MIR excess last longer if the time required to incorporate all the
grains into the thermalized medium is also longer, and in some cases,
comparable to the characteristic interval between supernova explosions. Our
models, can successfully explain the near-infrared excesses found in the star
clusters observed in M33 (Rela\~no et al. 2016) assuming a low heating
efficiency and mass-loading. In this scenario, the presence of the NIR-MIR
excess is an indication of efficient dust production in SNe and its subsequent
destruction

matter based on large deviation theory, a bias model for the tracer density in

model to relate the log-densities of dark matter to those of mass-weighted dark
haloes in real and redshift space. The validity of the parametrised bias model
is established using a parametrisation-independent extraction of the bias
function. This average bias model is then combined with the dark matter PDF,
neglecting any scatter around it: it nevertheless yields an excellent model for
densities-in-cells statistics of mass tracers that is parametrised in terms of
the underlying dark matter variance and three bias parameters. The procedure is
validated on measurements of both the one and two point statistics of subhalo
densities in the state-of-the-art Horizon Run 4 simulation showing excellent
agreement for measured dark matter variance and bias parameters. Finally, it is
demonstrated that this formalism allows for a joint estimation of the nonlinear
dark matter variance and the bias parameters using solely the statistics of
subhaloes. Having verified that galaxy counts in hydrodynamical simulations
sampled on a scale of 10 Mpc/h closely resemble those of subhaloes, this work
provides important steps towards making theoretical predictions for

$\lesssim30$ keV in its 0.3-79 keV spectrum strongly suggests that the compact

a soft excess, which can be accounted for by either a partial-covering absorber

prospects for future follow-up observations of potentially inhabited planets.
All orbit nearby M-stars and are likely tidally locked in 1:1 spin-orbit
states, which motivates the consideration of the effects that tidal locking
might have on planetary habitability. On Earth, periods of global glaciation
(snowballs) may have been essential for habitability and remote signs of life
(biosignatures) because they are correlated with increases in the complexity of
life and in the atmospheric oxygen concentration. In this paper we investigate
the snowball bifurcation (sudden onset of global glaciation) on tidally locked
planets using both an energy balance model and an intermediate-complexity
global climate model. We show that tidally locked planets are unlikely to
exhibit a snowball bifurcation as a direct result of the spatial pattern of
insolation they receive. Instead they will smoothly transition from partial to
complete ice coverage and back. A major implication of this work is that
tidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle should not be found in a
snowball state. Moreover, this work implies that tidally locked planets near
the outer edge of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing fluxes will
equilibrate with a small unglaciated substellar region rather than cycling
between warm and snowball states. More work is needed to determine how the lack
of a snowball bifurcation might affect the development of life on a tidally
locked planet.

geodesic which characterizes the corresponding black-hole spacetime. One
naturally wonders whether the no-short hair inequality
$r_{\text{hair}}>r_{\text{null}}$ is a generic property of all electrically
neutral hairy black-hole spacetimes? In this paper we provide evidence that the
answer to this interesting question may be positive. In particular, we prove
that the recently discovered cloudy Kerr black-hole spacetimes --
non-spherically symmetric non-static black holes which support linearized
massive scalar fields in their exterior regions -- also respect this no-short

$r_{\text{field}}/r_+>r_+/r_-$ on the effective lengths of the external
bound-state massive scalar clouds (here $r_{\text{field}}$ is the peak location

it is independent of the physical parameters (proper mass and angular harmonic

photons by free electrons on our past light cone. This polarized Sunyaev
Zel'dovich (pSZ) effect is sensitive to the electrons' locally observed CMB
quadrupole, which is sourced primarily by long wavelength inhomogeneities. By
combining the remote quadrupoles measured by free electrons throughout the
Universe after reionization, the pSZ effect allows us to obtain additional
information about large scale modes beyond what can be learned from our own
last scattering surface. Here we determine the power of pSZ tomography, in
which the pSZ effect is cross-correlated with the density field binned at
several redshifts, to provide information about the long wavelength Universe.
The signal we explore here is a power asymmetry in the cross-correlation
between $E$ or $B$ mode CMB polarization and the density field. We compare this
to the cosmic variance limited noise: the random chance to get a power
asymmetry in the absence of a large scale quadrupole field. By computing the
necessary transfer functions and cross-correlations, we compute the
signal-to-noise ratio attainable by idealized next generation CMB experiments
and galaxy surveys. We find that a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 1-10$ is in
principle attainable over a significant range of power multipoles, with the
strongest signal coming from the first multipoles in the lowest redshift bins.
These results prompt further assessment of realistically measuring the pSZ
signal and the potential impact for constraining cosmology on large scales.

the injection of nuclei, where we take into account that a nuclear cascade from
photo-disintegration can fully develop in the source. One of our main
objectives is to test if recent results from the IceCube and the Pierre Auger
Observatory can be accommodated with the paradigm that GRBs are the sources of
Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). While our key results are obtained
using an internal shock model, we discuss how the secondary emission from a GRB
shell can be interpreted in terms of other astrophysical models. It is
demonstrated that the expected neutrino flux from GRBs weakly depends on the
injection composition, which implies that prompt neutrinos from GRBs can
efficiently test the GRB-UHECR paradigm even if the UHECRs are nuclei. We show
that the UHECR spectrum and composition, as measured by the Pierre Auger
Observatory, can be self-consistently reproduced in a combined
source-propagation model. In an attempt to describe the energy range including
the ankle, we find tension with the IceCube bounds from the GRB stacking
analyses. In an alternative scenario, where only the UHECRs beyond the ankle
originate from GRBs, the requirement for a joint description of cosmic-ray and
neutrino observations favors lower luminosities, which does not correspond to
the typical expectation from {\gamma}-ray observations.

perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces
(`spin chains'), quantum field theory and holography. We tackle this problem in
1D spin-chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number
of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs),
and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the
observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by
a `hydrodynamical' equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary
circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy).
In this hydrodynamic picture quantum information travels in a front with a
`butterfly velocity' $v_{\text{B}}$ that is smaller than the light cone
velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time.
The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do
\emph{not} observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form $\sim
e^{\lambda_\text{L}(t-x/v)}$ for a fixed Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\text{L}$.
We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences
for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be
significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the
hydrodynamical description applies to more generic ergodic systems and support
this by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator
wavefront also holds in a more traditional non-random Floquet spin-chain. We
also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich
hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can
nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.

FSPT phases into gauge theories through gauging the global symmetry of the

statistics that are allowed only in the the presence of fermionic particles,
which correspond to 3D ""intrinsic"" FSPT phases, i.e., those that do not stem

that strong interaction is necessary to realize them. We show that the simplest
unitary symmetry to support 3D intrinsic FSPT phases is
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$. To establish the results, we first derive a
complete set of physical constraints on Abelian loop braiding statistics.
Solving the constraints, we obtain all possible Abelian loop braiding

that the CME magnetic field in the corona is significantly higher than the

of the flux-rope magnetic field strength is faster than that of the ambient

correlated with that in interplanetary flux ropes constructed from in situ

reason for the observed correlation between the peak field strength in MCs is
the higher magnetic field content in faster coronal flux ropes and ultimately
the higher reconnected flux in the eruption region. The magnetic flux ropes

the granularity of pruning, affects the efficiency of hardware accelerator
design as well as the prediction accuracy. Coarse-grained pruning creates
regular sparsity patterns, making it more amenable for hardware acceleration

quantitatively measure the trade-off between sparsity regularity and prediction

more structured sparsity pattern. Our experimental results show that
coarse-grained pruning can achieve a sparsity ratio similar to unstructured
pruning without loss of accuracy. Moreover, due to the index saving effect,
coarse-grained pruning is able to obtain a better compression ratio than
fine-grained sparsity at the same accuracy threshold. Based on the recent

demonstrate that coarse-grained sparsity saves about 2x the memory references

circuits must be compiled to take into account constraints on the hardware. For
near-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is
critical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the
application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits
to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on
compiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor
constraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow
great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom
makes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is
a greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible
circuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal
planning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA
circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report
compilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this
test set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning
is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.

that when the band inversion dominates over SOC, there appear ""twin"" Dirac

peculiar structure in which the upper cone of one of the twin continuously

as a means of protecting the observable cosmological constant from quantum
radiative corrections. The original proposal was based on using global Lagrange
multipliers, but later a local formulation was provided. Subsequently other
interesting claims of a different non-local approach to the cosmological
constant problem were made, based again on global Lagrange multipliers. We
examine some of these proposals and find their mutual relationship. We explain
that the proposals which do not treat the cosmological constant counterterm as
a dynamical variable require fine tunings to have acceptable solutions.
Furthermore, the counterterm often needs to be retuned at every order in the
loop expansion to cancel the radiative corrections to the cosmological
constant, just like in standard GR. These observations are an important
reminder of just how the proposal of vacuum energy sequester avoids such
problems.

Starting from a universal differential algebra of forms based on the above

the Inner derivations in order to have well defined contractions and from where
the algebraic dependence of its coefficients is derived. This again then
defines the noncommutative equivalent of the geometrical line-element in
commutative differential geometry. We stress, however, that even though the
components of the twisted metric are by construction symmetric in their algebra
valuation, this is not so for their inverse and thus to construct it we made
use of Gel'fand's theory of quasi-determinants, which is conceptually
straightforward but computationally becoming quite complicate beyond an algebra

dynamics in one-dimensional stochastically forced Burgers equation at Reynolds
number $\mathrm{Re} \approx 2.7 \times 10^4$. We demonstrate that Fourier triad
phases over the inertial range display a collective behaviour characterised by
intermittent periods of synchronisation and alignment, reminiscent of Kuramoto
model (Kuramoto 1984) and directly related to collisions of shocks in physical
space. These periods of synchronisation favour efficient energy fluxes across
the inertial range towards small scales, resulting in strong bursts of
dissipation and enhanced coherence of Fourier energy spectrum. The fast time
scale of the onset of synchronisation relegates energy dynamics to a passive
role: this is further examined using a reduced system with the Fourier
amplitudes fixed in time -- a phase-only model. We show that intermittent triad
phase dynamics persists without amplitude evolution and we broadly recover many
of the characteristics of the full Burgers system. In addition, for both full
Burgers and phase-only systems the physical space velocity statistics reveals
that triad phase alignment is directly related to the non-Gaussian statistics
typically associated with structure-function intermittency in turbulent
systems.

Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for
reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich
knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are an SRL framework which integrates
neural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning
from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with
logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we
develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the
classification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant
part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is
evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that the
use of background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the
performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-the-art
Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show
that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning

within a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in 2+1 dimensions, appropriate for the
Kekul\'e transition in honeycomb lattice materials. For this model the standard
Landau-Ginzburg approach suggests a first order transition due to the
symmetry-allowed cubic terms in the action. At zero temperature, however,
quantum fluctuations of the massless Dirac fermions have to be included. We
show that they reduce the putative first-order character of the transition and
can even render it continuous, depending on the number of Dirac fermions $N_f$.
A non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach is employed to
investigate the phase transition for a wide range of fermion numbers. For the
first time we obtain the critical $N_f$, where the nature of the transition
changes. Furthermore, it is shown that for large $N_f$ the change from the
first to second order of the transition as a function of dimension occurs
exactly in the physical 2+1 dimensions. We compute the critical exponents and
predict sizable corrections to scaling for $N_f =2$.

dynamics, able to capture for example universal properties of entanglement
growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of
operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D
and higher dimensions, and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to
operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that
the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation,
which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC, and the
butterfly speed $v_{B}$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens
diffusively, with a width scaling in time as $t^{1/2}$. We address fluctuations
in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that
they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front. Turning to
higher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a
remarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies
that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as $t^{1/3}$ in 2+1D
and $t^{0.24}$ in 3+1D (KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with
simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in a lattice model, the late time shape
of the spreading operator is in general not spherical. However when full
spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact
asymptotic form for the OTOC in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an
alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition
function of an Ising-like model. As a result of special structure arising from
unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which
can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for
entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.

process. The intensity functions of many point processes involve two
components: the background and the effect by the history. Due to its inherent
spontaneousness, the background can be treated as a time series while the other
need to handle the history events. In this paper, we model the background by a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with its units aligned with time series indexes
while the history effect is modeled by another RNN whose units are aligned with
asynchronous events to capture the long-range dynamics. The whole model with
event type and timestamp prediction output layers can be trained end-to-end.
Our approach takes an RNN perspective to point process, and models its
background and history effect. For utility, our method allows a black-box
treatment for modeling the intensity which is often a pre-defined parametric
form in point processes. Meanwhile end-to-end training opens the venue for
reusing existing rich techniques in deep network for point process modeling. We

their tractability and ability to combine complex physical sensor models with
useful regularity criteria. Such methods motivated the recently developed
Plug-and-Play prior method, which provides a framework to use advanced
denoising algorithms as regularizers in inversion. However, the need to
formulate regularized inversion as the solution to an optimization problem
limits the possible regularity conditions and physical sensor models.
  In this paper, we introduce Consensus Equilibrium (CE), which generalizes
regularized inversion to include a much wider variety of both forward
components and prior components without the need for either to be expressed
with a cost function. CE is based on the solution of a set of equilibrium
equations that balance data fit and regularity. In this framework, the problem
of MAP estimation in regularized inversion is replaced by the problem of
solving these equilibrium equations, which can be approached in multiple ways.
  The key contribution of CE is to provide a novel framework for fusing
multiple heterogeneous models of physical sensors or models learned from data.
We describe the derivation of the CE equations and prove that the solution of
the CE equations generalizes the standard MAP estimate under appropriate
circumstances.
  We also discuss algorithms for solving the CE equations, including ADMM with
a novel form of preconditioning and Newton's method. We give examples to
illustrate consensus equilibrium and the convergence properties of these
algorithms and demonstrate this method on some toy problems and on a denoising
example in which we use an array of convolutional neural network denoisers,

consensus can achieve a better result than any of them individually.

conveniently captured by a graph. Accounting for this graph support is crucial
to analyze the data, leading to an area known as graph signal processing (GSP).
The two most important tools in GSP are the graph shift operator (GSO), which
is a sparse matrix accounting for the topology of the graph, and the graph
Fourier transform (GFT), which maps graph signals into a frequency domain
spanned by a number of graph-related Fourier-like basis vectors. This
alternative representation of a graph signal is denominated the graph frequency
signal. Several attempts have been undertaken in order to interpret the support
of this graph frequency signal, but they all resulted in a one-dimensional
interpretation. However, if the support of the original signal is captured by a
graph, why would the graph frequency signal have a simple one-dimensional
support? That is why, for the first time, we propose an irregular support for
the graph frequency signal, which we coin the dual graph. The dual GSO leads to
a better interpretation of the graph frequency signal and its domain, helps to
understand how the different graph frequencies are related and clustered,
enables the development of better graph filters and filter banks, and
facilitates the generalization of classical SP results to the graph domain.

probabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as standard candles
using parallax measurements from the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect
of our methodology is to fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax,
photometry, and dust corrections uncertainties, which leads to more robust
results than standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and
intrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band, and WISE
bands W1, W2, W3, and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC is
$-1.61 \pm$ 0.01 (in Ks), $+0.44 \pm$ 0.01 (in G) , $-0.93 \pm$ 0.01 (in J),

dispersion is $\sim 0.17 \pm$ 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a typical
distance precision of $\sim$ 8%). Thus RC stars are reliable and precise
standard candles. In addition, we have also re-calibrated the zero point of the
absolute magnitude of the RC in each band, which provide a benchmark for future
studies to estimate distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error

sinonasal cavity for numerical investigations of sprayed drug transport
presents a host of methodological ambiguities. For example, subject-specific
radiographic images used for 3D reconstructions typically exclude spray
bottles. Subtracting a bottle contour from the 3D airspace and dilating the
anterior nasal vestibule for nozzle placement augment the complexity of
model-building. So, we explored the question: how essential are these steps to
adequately simulate nasal airflow and identify the optimal delivery conditions
for intranasal sprays? In particular, we focused on particle deposition
patterns in the maxillary sinus, a critical target site for chronic
rhinosinusitis (CRS). The models were reconstructed from post-surgery computed
tomography scans for a 39-year-old Caucasian male, with CRS history.
Inspiratory airflow patterns during resting breathing are reliably tracked
through CFD-based steady state laminar-viscous modeling and such regimes
portray relative lack of sensitivity to inlet perturbations. Consequently, we
hypothesized that the posterior airflow transport and the particle deposition
trends should not be radically affected by the nozzle subtraction and
vestibular dilation. The study involved 1 base model and 2 derived models; the
latter two with nozzle contours (two different orientations) subtracted from
the dilated anterior segment of the left vestibule. We analyzed spray transport
in the left maxillary sinus for multiple release conditions. Similar release
points, localized on an approximately 2mm-by-4.5mm contour, facilitated
improved maxillary deposition in all three test cases. This suggests functional
redundancy of nozzle insertion in a 3D numerical model for identifying the
optimal spray release locations.

by jointly optimizing an objective function through a ""two-player game"" between
a generator and a discriminator. Despite their empirical success, however, two
very basic questions on how well they can approximate the target distribution
remain unanswered. First, it is not known how restricting the discriminator
family affects the approximation quality. Second, while a number of different
objective functions have been proposed, we do not understand when convergence
to the global minima of the objective function leads to convergence to the
target distribution under various notions of distributional convergence.
  In this paper, we address these questions in a broad and unified setting by
defining a notion of adversarial divergences that includes a number of recently
proposed objective functions. We show that if the objective function is an
adversarial divergence with some additional conditions, then using a restricted
discriminator family has a moment-matching effect. Additionally, we show that
for objective functions that are strict adversarial divergences, convergence in
the objective function implies weak convergence, thus generalizing previous
results.

to warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage
of this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or

satellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some
satellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple

compressibility effects elongate the near wake for cases above and below the

elongation becomes more pronounced as the Reynolds number approaches this

increases from its critical value, even for the low range of Reynolds numbers

data has become an increasingly common component of athlete training
programmes. Today it is incredibly easy and affordable to set up a fixed camera
and record athletes in a wide range of sports, such as diving, gymnastics,
golf, tennis, etc. However, the manual analysis of the obtained footage is a
time-consuming task which involves isolating actions of interest and
categorizing them using domain-specific knowledge. In order to automate this
kind of task, three challenging sub-problems are often encountered: 1)
temporally cropping events/actions of interest from continuous video; 2)
tracking the object of interest; and 3) classifying the events/actions of
interest.
  Most previous work has focused on solving just one of the above sub-problems
in isolation. In contrast, this paper provides a complete solution to the
overall action monitoring task in the context of a challenging real-world
exemplar. Specifically, we address the problem of diving classification. This
is a challenging problem since the person (diver) of interest typically
occupies fewer than 1% of the pixels in each frame. The model is required to
learn the temporal boundaries of a dive, even though other divers and
bystanders may be in view. Finally, the model must be sensitive to subtle
changes in body pose over a large number of frames to determine the
classification code. We provide effective solutions to each of the sub-problems
which combine to provide a highly functional solution to the task as a whole.
The techniques proposed can be easily generalized to video footage recorded
from other sports.

for star formation and feedback from Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, hydrogen
ionizing radiation, and external metal enrichment due to supernovae winds. This
method is intended to complement analytic studies, which do not include
clustering or individual merger histories, and hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations, which include detailed physics, but are computationally expensive
and have limited dynamic range. Utilizing this technique, we compute the
cumulative Pop III and metal-enriched star formation rate density (SFRD) as a
function of redshift at $z \geq 20$. We find that varying the model parameters
leads to significant qualitative changes in the global star formation history.
The Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and
subsequent metal-enriched star formation are found to have the largest impact.
The effect of clustering (i.e. including the three-dimensional positions of
individual halos) on various feedback mechanisms is also investigated. The
impact of clustering on LW and ionization feedback is found to be relatively

generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way. Under this
framework, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices
of the prior over parameters. This provides us a very general way to
interpolate between generative and discriminative extremes through different
choices of priors. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional
log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled
instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from both
source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular
reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the
negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal
distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a
way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and
semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks,
and build a concrete model, DAuto. Empirically, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it
outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.

  Assistant",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In logical reasoning, it is often the case that only some of a collection of
assumptions are needed to reach a conclusion. A strengthening lemma is an
assertion that a given conclusion is independent in this sense of a particular
assumption. Strengthening lemmas underlie many useful techniques for
simplifying proofs in automated and interactive theorem-provers. For example,
they underlie a mechanism called subordination that is useful in determining
that expressions of a particular type cannot contain objects of another type
and in thereby reducing the number of cases to be considered in proving
universally quantified statements.
  This thesis concerns the automation of the proofs of strengthening lemmas in
a specification logic called the logic of hereditary Harrop formulas (HOHH).
The Abella Proof Assistant embeds this logic in a way that allows it to prove
properties of both the logic itself and of specifications written in it.
Previous research has articulated a (conservative) algorithm for checking if a
claimed strengthening lemma is, in fact, true. We provide here an
implementation of this algorithm within the setting of Abella. Moreover, we
show how to generate an actual proof of the strengthening lemma in Abella from
the information computed by the algorithm; such a proof serves as a more
trustworthy certificate of the correctness of the lemma than the algorithm
itself. The results of this work have been incorporated into the Abella system
in the form of a ""tactic command"" that can be invoked within the interactive
theorem-prover and that will result in an elaboration of a proof of the lemma
and its incorporation into the collection of proven facts about a given
specification.

mean value for all of incoherent states and hence a nonzero mean value
indicates the coherence. The existence of such witnesses are proved for any
finite-dimension states. Not only is the witness efficient in testing whether
the state is coherent, the mean value is also quantitatively related to the
amount of coherence contained in the state. For an unknown state, the modulus
of the mean value of a normalized witness provides a tight lower bound of
$l_1$-norm of coherence in the state. When we have some previous knowledge of
the state, the optimal witness is derived such that its measured mean value,
called the witnessed coherence, equals to the $l_1$-norm of coherence. One can
also fix the witness and implement some incoherent operations on the state
before the witness is measured. In this case, the measured mean value cannot
reach the witnessed coherence if the initial state and the fixed witness does
not match well. Based this result, we design a quantum coherence game. Our
results provides a way to directly measure the coherence in arbitrary finite
dimension states and an operational interpretation of the $l_1$-norm of

orthorhombic phase with a hinge-like structure and an in-plane spontaneous
polarization. The intrinsic Curie temperature Tc of monolayer GeTe is as high
as 570 K and can be raised quickly by applying a tensile strain. An
out-of-plane electric field can effectively decrease the coercive field for the
reversal of polarization, extending its potential for regulating the
polarization switching kinetics. Moreover, for bilayer GeTe the ferroelectric
phase is still the ground state. Combined with these advantages, 2D GeTe is a
promising candidate material for practical integrated ferroelectric
applications.

In this
scenario, investigators often perform list-wise deletion, or delete samples
with any missing values, before applying causal discovery algorithms. List-wise
deletion is a sound and general strategy when paired with algorithms such as
FCI and RFCI, but the deletion procedure also eliminates otherwise good samples
that contain only a few missing values. In this report, we show that we can
more efficiently utilize the observed values with test-wise deletion while
still maintaining algorithmic soundness. Here, test-wise deletion refers to the
process of list-wise deleting samples only among the variables required for
each conditional independence (CI) test used in constraint-based searches.
Test-wise deletion therefore often saves more samples than list-wise deletion
for each CI test, especially when we have a sparse underlying graph. Our
theoretical results show that test-wise deletion is sound under the justifiable
assumption that none of the missingness mechanisms causally affect each other
in the underlying causal graph. We also find that FCI and RFCI with test-wise
deletion outperform their list-wise deletion and imputation counterparts on
average when MNAR holds in both synthetic and real data.

  In this paper we focus on their use as notch filters to remove the signal
from atmospheric OH emission lines from astronomical spectra, however we also
briefly discuss their use as frequency combs for wavelength calibration and as
drop filters for Doppler planet searches.
  We derive the design requirements for ring resonators for OH suppression from
theory and finite difference time domain simulations. We find that rings with
small radii (<10 microns) are required to provide an adequate free spectral
range, leading to high index contrast materials such as Si and Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$.
Critically coupled rings with high self-coupling coefficients should provide
the necessary Q factors, suppression depth, and throughput for efficient OH
suppression.
  We report on our progress in fabricating both Si and Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ rings
for OH suppression, and give results from preliminary laboratory tests. Our
early devices show good control over the free spectral range and wavelength
separation of multi-ring devices. The self-coupling coefficients are high
(>0.9), but further optimisation is required to achieve higher Q and deeper
notches, with current devices having $Q \approx 4000$ and $\approx 10$ dB

SDDI obtains a narrow-band full disk image of the sun at 73 channels from
H$\alpha$ - 9.0 \AA\ to H$\alpha$ + 9.0 \AA, allowing us to study the
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the filament before and during the eruption.
The observed filament is a quiescent filament that erupted on 2016 November 5.
We derived the LOS velocity at each pixel in the filament using the Becker's
cloud model, and made the histograms of the LOS velocity at each time. The
standard deviation of the LOS velocity distribution can be regarded as a
measure for the amplitude of the small scale motion in the filament. We found
that the standard deviation on the previous day of the eruption was mostly
constant around 2-3 km s$^{-1}$, and it slightly increased to 3-4 km s$^{-1}$
on the day of the eruption. It shows further increase with a rate of 1.1 m
s$^{-2}$ about three hours before eruption and again with a rate of 2.8 m
s$^{-2}$ about an hour before eruption. From this result we suggest the
increase in the amplitude of the small scale motions in a filament can be
regarded as a precursor of the eruption.

the distributed state information are governed by an underlying consistency
model. Earlier, we suggested the use of adaptively-consistent controllers that
can autonomously tune their consistency parameters in order to meet the
performance requirements of a certain application. In this paper, we examine
the feasibility of employing adaptive controllers that are built on-top of
tunable consistency models similar to that of Apache Cassandra. We present an
adaptation strategy that uses clustering techniques (sequential k-means and
incremental k-means) in order to map a given application performance indicator
into a feasible consistency level that can be used with the underlying tunable
consistency model. In the cases that we modeled and tested, our results show
that in the case of sequential k-means, with a reasonable number of clusters
(>= 50), a plausible mapping (low RMSE) could be estimated between the
application performance indicators and the consistency level indicator. In the
case of incremental k-means, the results also showed that a plausible mapping
(low RMSE) could be estimated using a similar number of clusters (>= 50) by
using a small threshold (~$ 0.01).

multiple orthogonal frequency functions, a light beam can also be decomposed
into a set of spatial modes that are taken from an orthogonal basis. Such a
decomposition can provide a tool for spatial spectrum analysis, which may allow
the stable, accurate and robust extraction of physical object information that
may not be readily achievable using traditional approaches. As an example, we
measure the opening angle of an object using the complex spectrum of orbital
angular momentum (OAM) modes as the basis, achieving a more than 15 dB
signal-to-noise ratio. We find that the dip (i.e., notch) positions of the OAM
intensity spectrum are dependent on an object's opening angle but independent
of the object opening's angular orientation, whereas the slope of the OAM phase
spectrum is dependent on the object opening's orientation but independent on
the opening angle.

less communication cost on the busiest node. We further conduct an empirical
study to validate our theoretical analysis across multiple frameworks (CNTK and
Torch), different network configurations, and computation platforms up to 112
GPUs. On network configurations with low bandwidth or high latency, D-PSGD can
be up to one order of magnitude faster than its well-optimized centralized

specially crafted perturbations cause deep learning systems to output incorrect
decisions, with potentially disastrous consequences. These vulnerabilities
hinder the deployment of deep learning systems where safety or security is
important. Attempts to secure deep learning systems either target specific
attacks or have been shown to be ineffective.
  In this paper, we propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network
classifiers against adversarial examples. MagNet does not modify the protected
classifier or know the process for generating adversarial examples. MagNet
includes one or more separate detector networks and a reformer network.
Different from previous work, MagNet learns to differentiate between normal and
adversarial examples by approximating the manifold of normal examples. Since it
does not rely on any process for generating adversarial examples, it has
substantial generalization power. Moreover, MagNet reconstructs adversarial
examples by moving them towards the manifold, which is effective for helping
classify adversarial examples with small perturbation correctly. We discuss the
intrinsic difficulty in defending against whitebox attack and propose a
mechanism to defend against graybox attack. Inspired by the use of randomness
in cryptography, we propose to use diversity to strengthen MagNet. We show
empirically that MagNet is effective against most advanced state-of-the-art
attacks in blackbox and graybox scenarios while keeping false positive rate on
normal examples very low.

dynamic transitions of the basic (zonal) shear flows for the three-dimensional
continuously stratified rotating Boussinesq model. The model equations are
fundamental equations in geophysical fluid dynamics, and dynamics associated
with their basic zonal shear flows play a crucial role in understanding many
important geophysical fluid dynamical processes, such as the meridional
overturning oceanic circulation and the geophysical baroclinic instability. In
this paper, first we derive a threshold for the energy stability of the basic
shear flow, and obtain a criteria for nonlinear stability in terms of the
critical horizontal wavenumbers and the system parameters such as the Froude
number, the Rossby number, the Prandtl number and the strength of the shear
flow. Next we demonstrate that the system always undergoes a dynamic transition
from the basic shear flow to either a spatiotemporal oscillatory pattern or
circle of steady states, as the shear strength $\Lambda$ of the basic flow
crosses a critical threshold $\Lambda_c$. Also we show that the dynamic
transition can be either continuous or catastrophic, and is dictated by the
sign of a transition parameter $A$, fully characterizing the nonlinear
interactions of different modes. A systematic numerical method is carried out
to explore transition in different flow parameter regimes. We find that the
system admits only critical eigenmodes with horizontal wave indices $(0,m_y)$.
Such modes, horizontally have the pattern consisting of $m_y$-rolls aligned
with the x-axis. Furthermore, numerically we encountered continuous transitions
to multiple steady states, continuous and catastrophic transitions to
spatiotemporal oscillations.

top-quark mass. The results are compared to Standard Model predictions and in
some cases limits on physics beyond the Standard Model are also extracted in
the context of effective field theory models. The measurements use data
collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments during pp collisions at a

downlink multiuser underlay secondary networks that use fixed-rate
transmissions. We assume that the interference temperature limit (ITL) is
apportioned to accommodate two concurrent transmissions using an interference
temperature apportioning parameter so as to ensure that the overall
interference to the primary receiver does not exceed the ITL. Using the derived
analytical expressions for throughput, when there is only one secondary user in
each network, or when the secondary networks do not employ opportunistic user
selection (use round robin scheduling for example), there exists a critical
fixed-rate below which sum throughput with co-existing secondary networks is
higher than the throughput with a single secondary network. We derive an
expression for this critical fixed-rate. Below this critical rate, we show that
careful apportioning of the ITL is critical to maximizing sum throughput of the
co-existing networks. We derive an expression for this apportioning parameter.
Throughput is seen to increase with increase in number of users in each of the
secondary networks. Computer simulations demonstrate accuracy of the derived

bands are very well correlated with all of the activity indices (with the best
correlation being with the 10.7 cm radio flux), we confirm earlier findings
that there appears to have been a change in the frequency response to activity
during solar cycle 23, and the low frequency shifts are less correlated with
activity in the last two cycles than they were in Cycle 22. At the same time,
the more recent cycles show a slight increase in their sensitivity to activity
levels at medium and higher frequencies, perhaps because a greater proportion
of activity is composed of weaker or more ephemeral regions. This lends weight
to the speculation that a fundamental change in the nature of the solar dynamo
may be in progress.

investigate their effect on the energy emission spectra of Hawking radiation.
We demonstrate that the radiation spectra for the normalised temperature

the dominant emission curve while the other temperatures either support a
significant emission rate only at a specific $\Lambda$ regime or they have
their emission rates globally suppressed. Finally, we compute the

  Phys",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) are charged particles of energies
above $10^{18}$ eV that originate outside of the Galaxy. Because the flux of
the UHECRs at Earth is very small, the only practical way of observing UHECRs
is by measuring the extensive air showers (EAS) produced by UHECRs in the
atmosphere. This is done by using air fluorescence detectors and giant arrays
of particle detectors on the ground. The Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and
Telescope Array (TA) are two large cosmic ray experiments which use such
techniques and cover 3000 km$^2$ and 700 km$^2$ areas on the ground,
respectively. In this paper, we present the UHECR spectrum reported by the TA,
using an exposure of 6300 km$^2$ sr yr accumulated over 7 years of data taking,
and the corresponding result of Auger, using 10 years of data with a total
exposure exceeding 50000 km$^2$ sr yr. We review the astrophysical
interpretation of the two measurements, and discuss their systematic
uncertainties.

Recent methodological developments include multivariate (multiple outcomes) and

corresponding estimation procedure for multivariate network meta-analysis, so
that multiple outcomes and treatments can be included in a single analysis. Our
new multivariate model is a direct extension of a univariate model for network
meta-analysis that has recently been proposed. We allow two types of unknown
variance parameters in our model, which represent between-study heterogeneity
and inconsistency. Inconsistency arises when different forms of direct and
indirect evidence are not in agreement, even having taken between-study
heterogeneity into account. However the consistency assumption is often assumed
in practice and so we also explain how to fit a reduced model which makes this
assumption. Our estimation method extends several other commonly used methods
for meta-analysis, including the method proposed by DerSimonian and Laird
(1986). We investigate the use of our proposed methods in the context of a real
example.

for creating localized states with vast range of applications in condensed
matter physics, photonics and acoustics. In photonics, localized states are
extensively used to confine and manipulate photons. Up to now, all the proposed
localized states are reciprocal and restricted by time reversal symmetry.
Consequently, localization is bidirectional and photons at the allowed passband
in the otherwise forbidden stop band are confined irrespective of the direction
of incident beam. In this report, by embedding a single defect in a
one-dimensional spatiotemporally modulated photonic lattice, we demonstrate
that it is possible to have localization of photon only in one direction. In a
spatiotemporally modulated photonics lattice, a time dependent potential
generates an effective magnetic biasing, which breaks the reciprocity.
Moreover, in such moving lattices the dispersion relation obtains a shift
depending on the direction of effective magnetic biasing. A static defect
synthesized in a temporally modulated lattice will generate a spatial
localization of light in the bandgap. However, due to the shift of the bandgap
the localization occurs in different frequencies depending on the direction of
incident field. We envisage that this phenomenon might has impact not only in
photonics but also other areas of physics and engineering such as condensed
matter and acoustics, opens the doors for designing new types of devices such
as non-reciprocal traps, sensors, unidirectional tunable filters, and might
result in unconventional transports such as unidirectional lasing. Despite its
applications, our proposal, namely a defect sate in a driven system, can be
considered as a pedagogical example of Floquet problem with analytical
solution.

for a class of open quantum systems described by Hudson- Parthasarathy quantum
stochastic differential equations, aiming to reduce the computational burden
associated with online calculation of the quantum filter. By using a
differential geometric approach, the quantum trajectory is constrained in a
finite-dimensional differentiable manifold consisting of an unnormalized
exponential family of quantum density operators, and an exponential quantum
projection filter is then formulated as a number of stochastic differential
equations satisfied by the finite-dimensional coordinate system of this
manifold. A convenient design of the differentiable manifold is also presented
through reduction of the local approximation errors, which yields a
simplification of the quantum projection filter equations. It is shown that the
computational cost can be significantly reduced by using the quantum projection
filter instead of the quantum filter. It is also shown that when the quantum
projection filtering approach is applied to a class of open quantum systems
that asymptotically converge to a pure state, the input-to-state stability of
the corresponding exponential quantum projection filter can be established.
Simulation results from an atomic ensemble system example are provided to
illustrate the performance of the projection filtering scheme. It is expected
that the proposed approach can be used in developing more efficient quantum
control methods.

use these thermal light curves to obtain physical and thermophysical properties
of these icy Solar System bodies. Haumea's thermal light curve is clearly
detected at 100 and 160um. The effect of the reported dark spot is apparent at
100um. Different thermophysical models were applied to these light curves,
varying the thermophysical properties of the surface within and outside the
spot. Although no model gives a perfect fit to the thermal observations,
results imply an extremely low thermal inertia (< 0.5 MKS) and a high phase
integral (> 0.73) for Haumea's surface. We note that the dark spot region
appears to be only weakly different from the rest of the object, with modest
changes in thermal inertia and/or phase integral. The thermal light curve of
2003VS2 is not firmly detected at 70 and at 160um but a thermal inertia of
2+/-0.5 MKS can be derived from these data. The thermal light curve of 2003AZ84
is not firmly detected at 100um. We apply a thermophysical model to the mean
thermal fluxes and to all the Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS thermal data of
2003AZ84, obtaining a close to pole-on orientation as the most likely for this
TNO. For the three TNOs, the thermal inertias derived from light curve analyses
or from the thermophysical analysis of the mean thermal fluxes confirm the
generally small or very small surface thermal inertias of the TNO population,
which is consistent with a statistical mean value of 2.5+/-0.5 MKS.

equal to the Chern number determining the Hall conductivity near half-filling
of a two-dimensional electron gas in a crystal. This mapping unfolds in view of
a correspondence between the critical point for the topological transition in
$\cal{PWS}$ and the {\it strong coupling fixed point} of the Harper's equation.
Oscillatory character of these modes persist in a generalized model related to
an extended Harper system where the electrons also tunnel to the diagonals of a
square lattice. However, beyond a bicritical point, the Majorana oscillations
occur with a random period, characterized by an invariant fractal set.

achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, for the
first time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural
network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an
external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal
coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less
activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron
was assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus
category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was
correct, the neuron was rewarded, i.e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP
was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As
demonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward
modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual
features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that
consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets.
Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic
changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both
feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one
spike per neuron. Thus the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.

depression between 250 and 550 km and in the photospheric umbral magnetic field
between 1500 and 3500 G. The results show that travel-time shifts at
frequencies above approximately 3.50 mHz (depending on the phase-speed filter)
are insensitive to the magnetic field strength. The travel time of these waves
is determined exclusively by the Wilson depression and sound-speed
perturbation. The travel time of waves with lower frequencies is affected by
the direct effect of the magnetic field, although photospheric field strengths
below 1500 G do not leave a significant trace on the travel-time measurements.
These results could potentially be used to develop simplified travel-time

ten-fold enhancement from noncollective cases. The correlation among single

through an underlying conformal structure i.e. conformally equivalent class of
metrics. The property that general relativity itself has no conformal
invariance is reinstated with a constrained scalar field setting the physical
scale. Conformally equivalent metrics have recently been shown to be amenable
to loop quantization including matter coupling. It has been suggested that
conformal geometry may provide an extended symmetry to allow a reformulated
Immirzi parameter necessary for loop quantization to behave like an arbitrary
group parameter that requires no further fixing as its present standard form
does. Here, we find that this can be naturally realized via conformal frame
transformations in scalar-tensor gravity. Such a theory generally incorporates
a dynamical scalar gravitational field and reduces to general relativity when
the scalar field becomes a pure gauge. In particular, we introduce a conformal
Einstein frame in which loop quantization is implemented. We then discuss how
different Immirzi parameters under this description may be related by conformal
frame transformations and yet share the same quantization having, for example,
the same area gaps, modulated by the scalar gravitational field.

Tasks such as scene retrieval suffer from features learned from this weak

particular, we consider the state-of-the art captioning system Show and

DenseCap~\cite{densecap-cvpr-2016}. We demonstrate that, owing to richer

siamese network with a modified pair-wise loss to fuse the features learned

radial orbit instability -- an important phenomenon that structures galaxies.
Antonov (1973) presented a formal proof of the instability for spherical
systems in the limit of purely radial orbits. However, such spheres have highly
inhomogeneous density distributions with singularity $\sim 1/r^2$, resulting in
an inconsistency in the proof. The proof can be refined, if one considers an
orbital distribution close to purely radial, but not entirely radial, which
allows to avoid the central singularity. For this purpose we employ
non-singular analogs of generalised polytropes elaborated recently in our work
in order to derive and solve new integral equations adopted for calculation of
unstable eigenmodes in systems with nearly radial orbits. In addition, we
establish a link between our and Antonov's approaches and uncover the meaning
of infinite entities in the purely radial case. Maximum growth rates tend to
infinity as the system becomes more and more radially anisotropic. The
instability takes place both for even and odd spherical harmonics, with all
unstable modes developing rapidly, i.e. having eigenfrequencies comparable to
or greater than typical orbital frequencies. This invalidates orbital
approximation in the case of systems with all orbits very close to purely
radial.

measure $\Delta_{EW}<30$. By imposing various constraints, we note that: (i)
For $sign(\mu/M_1)=+1$, the parameter space allowed by the DM relic density and
collider bounds can almost be excluded by the very recent spin-independent (SI)
scattering cross section limits from the XENON1T (2017) experiment. (ii) For
$sign(\mu/M_1)=-1$, the SI limits can be evaded due to the cancelation effects
in the $h\tilde{\chi}^0_1\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ coupling, while rather stringent
constraints come from the PandaX-II (2016) spin-dependent (SD) scattering cross
section limits, which can exclude the higgsino mass $|\mu|$ and the LSP mass
$m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1}$ up to about 230 GeV and 37 GeV, respectively.
Furthermore, the surviving parameter space will be fully covered by the
projected XENON1T experiment or the future trilepton searches at the HL-LHC.

  Conference (ATC)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of security mechanisms have been proposed to harden programs written
in unsafe languages, each of which mitigates a specific type of memory error.
Intuitively, enforcing multiple security mechanisms on a target program will
improve its overall security. However, this is not yet a viable approach in
practice because the execution slowdown caused by various security mechanisms
is often non-linearly accumulated, making the combined protection prohibitively
expensive; further, most security mechanisms are designed for independent or
isolated uses and thus are often in conflict with each other, making it
impossible to fuse them in a straightforward way.
  In this paper, we present Bunshin, an N-version-based system that enables
different and even conflicting security mechanisms to be combined to secure a
program while at the same time reducing the execution slowdown. In particular,
we propose an automated mechanism to distribute runtime security checks in
multiple program variants in such a way that conflicts between security checks
are inherently eliminated and execution slowdown is minimized with parallel
execution. We also present an N-version execution engine to seamlessly
synchronize these variants so that all distributed security checks work
together to guarantee the security of a target program.

experimentally verify the non-formation of hydroxylamine upon UV photolysis of
NO ice at cryogenic temperatures as well as the non-detection of NC- and

shows that NH2OH is abundant in the solid phase under dark molecular cloud

  Results and Fast Methods","Updated manuscript",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class of
object rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. The
problems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,
horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform
pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case
where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For
overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of
pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the
end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize
the end-effector distance. While such problems do not involve all the
complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard
challenges in both cases. This is shown through two-way reductions between
well-understood, hard combinatorial challenges and these rearrangement
problems. The benefit of the reduction is that there are well studied
algorithms for solving these well-established combinatorial challenges. These
algorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The
paper builds on these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for
dealing with the rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed pipeline achieves high-quality paths with regards to the optimization

energy models. For the non-linear real space correlation function used in the
GSM, we use the Fourier transform of the RegPT 1-loop matter power spectrum. We
compare predictions of the GSM for a Vainshtein screened and Chameleon screened
model as well as GR. These predictions are compared to the Fourier transform of
the Taruya, Nishimichi and Saito (TNS) redshift space power spectrum model
which is fit to N-Body data. We find very good agreement between the Fourier
transform of the TNS model and the GSM predictions, with $\leq 6\%$ deviations
in the first two correlation function multipoles for all models for separations
in $50$Mpc$/h \leq s \leq 180$Mpc/$h$. Excellent agreement is found in the
differences between the modified gravity and GR multipole predictions for both
approaches to the redshift space correlation function, highlighting their
matched ability in picking up deviations from GR. We elucidate the timeliness
of such non-standard templates at the dawn of stage-IV surveys and discuss
necessary preparations and extensions needed for upcoming high quality data.

making up some or all of the dark matter in the Universe. Most of the
theoretically possible mass range for PBH dark matter has been ruled out with
various null observations of expected signatures of their interaction with
standard astrophysical objects. However, current constraints are significantly
less robust in the 20 M_sun < M_PBH < 100 M_sun mass window, which has received
much attention recently, following the detection of merging black holes with
estimated masses of ~30 M_sun by LIGO and the suggestion that these could be
black holes formed in the early Universe. We consider the potential of advanced
LIGO (aLIGO) operating at design sensitivity to probe this mass range by
looking for peaks in the mass spectrum of detected events. To quantify the
background, which is due to black holes that are formed from dying stars, we
model the shape of the stellar-black-hole mass function and calibrate its
amplitude to match the O1 results. Adopting very conservative assumptions about
the PBH and stellar-black-hole merger rates, we show that ~5 years of aLIGO
data can be used to detect a contribution of >20 M_sun PBHs to dark matter down
to f_PBH<0.5 at >99.9% confidence level. Combined with other probes that
already suggest tension with f_PBH=1, the obtainable independent limits from
aLIGO will thus enable a firm test of the scenario that PBHs make up all of
dark matter.

interaction. The dynamics are studied in the disordered phase close to the
critical point, where the superfluid fluctuations are large. The analysis is
conducted within a two-particle irreducible, large $N$ approximation. The
system is considered from the perspective of critical quenches where it is
shown that the fluctuations follow universal model A dynamics. A signature of
this universality is found in a singular correction to the fermion lifetime,
given by a scaling form $t^{(3-d)/2}S_d(\varepsilon^2 t)$, where $d$ is the
spatial dimension, $t$ is the time since the quench, and $\varepsilon$ is the

spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools to detect magnetic interactions
for the structure analysis of a molecule with broad applications. But
conventional NMR spectroscopy requires macroscopic sample quantities with
hampers in investigating nanoscale structures. Through quantum control of a
single spin quantum sensor, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of nanoscale
organic molecules and single molecules has been achieved. However, the
measurement of the dipolar interaction of nuclear spins within a molecule at
nanoscale and the analysis of its structure remain a big challenge. Here we
succeed in detecting the NMR spectrum from an ice crystal with
(6-nanometer)$^3$ detection volume. More importantly, the magnetic dipolar
coupling between two proton nuclear spins of a water molecule was recorded. The
resolved intra-molecule magnetic dipolar interactions are about 15 kHz and 33
kHz with spectral resolution at a few kHz. Analysis of the interaction-resolved
NMR spectroscopy provides a spatial view of nanoscale ice crystal, from which
the orientation of a water-molecule bond is derived and further the length of
the bond can be got. This work enables NMR spectroscopy applications in single

Clearly this is not always true: normal Hamiltonians have lower bounded
spectrum and often only have discrete eigenvalues, whereas we typically desire
that time can take any real value. Pauli concluded that constructing a general
a time operator is impossible (although clearly it can be done in specific
cases). Here we show how the Pauli argument fails when one uses an external
system (a ""clock"") to track time, so that time arises as correlations between
the system and the clock (conditional probability amplitudes framework). In

its eigenvalues still satisfy the Schroedinger equation for arbitrary

formation energy. Notably, we find that initial symmetry-breaking is required

superfluid can acquire angular momentum via an alternative, microscopic route
-- namely, through interaction with rotating impurities, forming so-called
`angulon quasiparticles' [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 203001 (2015)]. The angulon
instabilities correspond to transfer of a small number of angular momentum
quanta from the impurity to the superfluid, as opposed to vortex instabilities,
where angular momentum is quantized in units of $\hbar$ per atom. Furthermore,
since conventional impurities (such as molecules) represent three-dimensional
(3D) rotors, the angular momentum transferred is intrinsically 3D as well, as
opposed to a merely planar rotation which is inherent to vortices. Herein we
show that the angulon theory can explain the anomalous broadening of the

arrays, which are inherently physically wavelength scaled, hindering their
application in compact subwavelength systems. In this letter, we tackle this
problem by patterning the deep subwavelength resonant elements of metamaterials
onto specific lattices, and create crystalline metamaterials that can develop
complex nonlocal properties due to multiple scattering, despite their very
subwavelength spatial scale that usually implies to disregard their structure.
These spatially dispersive systems can support subwavelength topological

gives a straightforward tabletop platform for the study of photonic topological

is introduced in order to reduce a so-called chaining effect. The main idea is
to prevent chaining through an al- ready identified interloper. We show that in
this way a number of potential interlopers among family members is
significantly reduced. Moreover, we developed an automatic on-line based portal

determine the atmospheric parameters, in particular, the effective temperature.
Second, we select interesting targets for follow-up observations, some of them

symmetric protected band structures from a node-line type to a Weyl one in the

by the mirror symmetry with the reflection-invariant plane perpendicular to
magnetic order. Within mirror symmetry breaking due to the magnetization along
other directions, the gapless node-line loop will degenerate to only one pair
of Weyl points protected by the rotational symmetry along the magnetic axis,
which are largely separated in momentum space. Such Weyl semimetal phase
provides a nice candidate with the minimum number of Weyl points in a condensed

intriguing phenomena, such as the existence of comparable amounts of orthogonal
polarisation modes (OPMs), strong distortions of polarisation angle (PA) curves
into shapes inconsistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), and the strong
circular polarisation V which can be maximum (instead of zero) at the OPM
jumps. It is shown that the existence of comparable OPMs and of the large V
results from a coherent addition of phase-delayed waves in natural propagation
modes, which are produced by an incident linearly polarised signal. The
coherent mode summation implies opposite polarisation properties to those known
from the incoherent case, in particular, the OPM jumps occur at peaks of V ,
whereas V changes sign at a maximum of the linear polarisation fraction L/I.
These features are indispensable to interpret various observed polarisation
effects. It is shown that statistical properties of the emission mechanism and
of propagation effects can be efficiently parametrised in a simple model of
coherent mode addition, which is successfully applied to complex polarisation
phenomena, such as the stepwise PA curve of PSR B1913+16 and the strong
distortions of the PA curve within core components of pulsars B1933+16 and
B1237+25. The inclusion of coherent mode addition opens the possibility for a
number of new polarisation effects, such as inversion of relative modal
strength, twin minima in L/I coincident with peaks in V , 45 deg PA jumps in
weakly polarised emission, and loop-shaped core PA distortions. The empirical
treatment of the coherency of mode addition makes it possible to advance the

It has been recently shown, using a circuit-based approach, that refraction
without spurious diffraction, or diffraction-free, can fortunately be achieved
by a transverse metasurface exhibiting either loss-gain or bianisotropy. Here,
we rederive these conditions using a medium-based - and hence more insightfull

band-gaps, slow or fast waves, negative refraction and dynamic anisotropy can
all be observed by exploring frequencies and wavenumbers from the Floquet-Bloch

directly related to the band-gap frequency, and hence to the slow and fast
waves, while the periodicity is related to the appearance of dynamic
anisotropy. Playing with these two parameters generates a gallery of
metasurface designs to control the propagation of both flexural waves in plates

placement analysis of diverse families of human-specific genomic regulatory
loci (HSGRL) identified topologically-associating domains (TADs) that are
significantly enriched for HSGRL and designated rapidly-evolving in humans TADs
(Genome Biol Evol. 2016 8; 2774-88). Here, the analysis of HSGRL, hESC-enriched
enhancers, super-enhancers (SEs), and specific sub-TAD structures termed
super-enhancer domains (SEDs) has been performed. Markedly distinct features of
the principal regulatory structures of interphase chromatin evolved in the hESC
genome compared to mouse: the SED quantity is 3-fold higher and the median SED
size is significantly larger. Concomitantly, the overall TAD quantity is
increased by 42% while the median TAD size is significantly decreased (p =
9.11E-37) in the hESC genome. Present analyses illustrate a putative global
role for HSGRL in shaping the human-specific features of the interphase
chromatin organization and functions, which are facilitated by accelerated
creation of new enhancers associated with targeted placement of HSGRL at
defined genomic coordinates. A trend toward the convergence of TAD and SED
architectures of interphase chromatin in the hESC genome may reflect changes of
3D-folding patterns of linear chromatin fibers designed to enhance both
regulatory complexity and functional precision of GRNs by creating
predominantly a single gene per regulatory domain structures.

an artin algebra of finite global dimension, this duality restricts to a
duality between their subcategories of acyclic complexes,
${\mathbb{K}}^{{\rm{b}}}_{\rm ac}({\rm mod}{\mbox{-}}\Lambda^{\rm op})$ and
${\mathbb{K}}^{{\rm{b}}}_{\rm ac}({\rm mod}{\mbox{-}}\Lambda).$ As a result, it
will be shown that, in this case, ${\mathbb{K}}_{\rm ac}^{{\rm{b}}}({\rm

  quasi-geostrophic flow",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A two-layer quasi-geostrophic flow is quite insulated from the surrounding
fluid, while the layers interact each other by means of the modulation of the
interface between them and of the turbulence affecting the layers in the
proximity of the interface. In this framework, the time evolution of the
circulation of the flow along the lateral boundaries (upper and lower) is
investigated under the assumption of arbitrary initial conditions. The analytic
solution shows the glue-like behaviour of turbulence, which is parameterized in
the standard way (Pedosky, 1996): initially the glue is wet and each layer
evolves almost independently of the other while, for times far enough from that
initial, the glue hardens and the system converges to a singlelayer one.
Indeed, the circulation of the thinner layer tends to adjust itself in a
parallel way with respect to the thicker layer and the final circulation of the
consequent single-layer system is given by the average of the initial
circulations, each being weighted by the thickness of the related layer.

two-dimensional metamamaterial on a Lieb lattice are derived, and then
linearized around zero flux to obtain the linear frequency spectrum according
to the standard procedure. That spectrum, due to the Lieb lattice geometry,
possesses a frequency band structure exhibiting two characteristic features;
two dispersive bands, which form a Dirac cone at the corners of the first
Brillouin zone, and a flat band crossing the Dirac points. It is demonstrated
numerically that localized states can be excited in the system when it is
initialized with single-site excitations; depending on the amplitude of those
initial states, the localization is either due to the flat-band or to nonlinear
effects. Flat-band localized states are formed in the nearly linear regime,
while localized excitations of the discrete breather type are formed in the
nonlinear regime. These two regimes are separated by an intermediate turbulent
regime for which no localization is observed. Notably, initial single-site
excitations of only edge SQUIDs of a unit cell may end-up in flat-band
localized states; no such states are formed for initial single-site excitations
of a corner SQUID of a unit cell. The degree of localization of the resulting
states is in any case quantified using well-established measures such as the
energetic participation ratio and the second moment.

  Implications for coastal flood risk management",,,"10.1111/risa.12888",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sea-levels are rising in many areas around the world, posing risks to coastal
communities and infrastructures. Strategies for managing these flood risks
present decision challenges that require a combination of geophysical,
economic, and infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new
ground on the considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading
infrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme flood events.
However, many risk-based adaptation strategies remain silent on certain
potentially important uncertainties, as well as the trade-offs between
competing objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic
decision-analytical model (van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture trade-offs across
conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of
structural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge models, and
(iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most strongly influence each
objective using global sensitivity analysis. We find that the flood adaptation
model produces potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional
mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective problem
formulation to one with multi-objective trade-offs dramatically expands the
decision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address
stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties that have large
effects on the model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for
the greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively identifies
important parameter interactions that local methods overlook, and which could
have critical implications for flood adaptation strategies.

high dimensional geophysical systems. Efficient implementation of EnKF in
practice often involves the localization technique, which updates each
component using only information within a local radius. This paper rigorously
analyzes the local EnKF (LEnKF) for linear systems, and shows that the filter
error can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, as long as 1) the sample
size exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends
only on the local radius; 2) the forecast covariance matrix admits a stable
localized structure. In particular, this indicates that with small system and
observation noises, the filter error will be accurate in long time even if the
initialization is not. The analysis also reveals an intrinsic inconsistency
caused by the localization technique, and a stable localized structure is
necessary to control this inconsistency. While this structure is usually taken
for granted for the operation of LEnKF, it can also be rigorously proved for
linear systems with sparse local observations and weak local interactions.
These theoretical results are also validated by numerical implementation of
LEnKF on a simple stochastic turbulence in two dynamical regimes.

differs from previous studies in that solid-state hydrogenation and vacuum
UV-photoprocessing are applied simultaneously to co-depositing molecules. In
parallel, the reactions at play are described for fully characterized
laboratory conditions. The focus is on the formation of molecules containing
both carbon and nitrogen atoms, starting with NO in CO-, H2CO-, and CH3OH-rich
ices at 13 K. The experiments yield three important conclusions. 1. Without
UV-processing hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is formed, as reported previously. 2. With
UV-processing (energetic) NH2 is formed through photodissociation of NH2OH.
This radical is key in the formation of species with an N-C bond. 3. The
formation of three N-C bearing species, HNCO, OCN- and NH2CHO is observed. The
experiments put a clear chemical link between these species; OCN- is found to
be a direct derivative of HNCO and the latter is shown to have the same
precursor as formamide (NH2CHO). Moreover, the addition of VUV competing
channels decreases the amount of NO molecules converted into NH2OH by at least
one order of magnitude. Consequently, this decrease in NH2OH formation yield
directly influences the amount of NO molecules that can be converted into HNCO,
OCN- and NH2CHO.

simulations but is motivated by a novel procedure which is explained in the
work. We add the apex predator as the fourth species in the system that
contains three species that evolve following the standard rules of migration,
reproduction and predation, and study how the system evolves in this new
environment, in comparison with the case in the absence of the apex predator.
The results show that the apex predator engenders the tendency to spread
uniformly in the lattice, contributing to destroy the spiral patterns, keeping
biodiversity but diminishing the average size of the clusters of the species
that compete cyclically.

ratio is one of the most widely applied methods being used as a firm valuation
tool by investment experts. Unfortunately, recent academic developments in
financial econometrics and machine learning rarely look at this tool. In
practice, fundamental PE ratios are often estimated only by subjective expert
opinions. The purpose of this research is to formalize a process of fundamental
PE estimation by employing advanced dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) methodology.
The estimated PE ratio from our model can be used either as a information
support for an expert to make investment decisions, or as an automatic trading
system illustrated in experiments. Forward-backward inference and EM parameter
estimation algorithms are derived with respect to the proposed DBN structure.
Unlike existing works in literatures, the economic interpretation of our DBN
model is well-justified by behavioral finance evidences of volatility. A simple
but practical trading strategy is invented based on the result of Bayesian
inference. Extensive experiments show that our trading strategy equipped with
the inferenced PE ratios consistently outperforms standard investment
benchmarks.
