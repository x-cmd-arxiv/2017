bunching or anti-bunching of photons can be observed when driving the atoms

We employ a Green's function approach and numerical wave-function simulations

study the dynamical and thermodynamic properties of its chromosphere, as well
as the influence of the chromosphere on its observable properties. 3D radiation
hydrodynamics simulations are carried out with the CO5BOLD model atmosphere
code for a star with the atmospheric parameters (Teff=4010 K, log g=1.5,
[M/H]=0.0), which are similar to those of the K-type giant star Aldebaran
(alpha Tau). ... we compute the emergent continuum intensity maps at different
wavelengths, spectral line profiles of Ca II K, the Ca II infrared triplet line
at 854.2nm, and H alpha, as well as the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the emergent radiative flux. The initial model quickly develops a dynamical
chromosphere characterised by propagating and interacting shock waves. The peak
temperatures in the chromospheric shock fronts reach values on the order of up
to 5000 K although the shock fronts remain quite narrow. Like for the Sun, the
gas temperature distribution in the upper layers is composed of a cool
component due to adiabatic cooling in the expanding post-shock regions and a
hot component due to shock waves. For this red giant model, the hot component
is a rather flat high-temperature tail, which nevertheless affects the
resulting average temperatures significantly. The simulations show that the
atmospheres of red giant stars are dynamic and intermittent. Consequently, many
observable properties cannot be reproduced with one-dimensional static models
but demand for advanced 3D HD modelling. Furthermore, including a chromosphere
in the models might produce significant contributions to the emergent UV flux.

answer a question asked by Cohn and Umans. Studying the border support rank of
the matrix multiplication tensor is relevant for the design of matrix

the matrix multiplication tensor lead to upper bounds on the computational
complexity of matrix multiplication, via a construction of Cohn and Umans.

turbulent, with velocity dispersions set by a competition between driving and
dissipation. This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases
with constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting
under the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between
driving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be
studied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that
resembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some
circumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a
rate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized
gas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,
magnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than
would be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case. We
use the simulation results to construct an analytic model that gives an
effective equation of state for a coarse-grained parcel of the gas, in the form
of an ideal equation of state with a polytropic index that depends on the
dissipation and energy transfer rates between the magnetic and turbulent
components. We argue that the reduced dissipation rate and larger equilibrium
velocity dispersion produced by compressing, magnetized turbulence has
important implications for the driving and maintenance of turbulence in
molecular clouds, and for the rates of chemical and radiative processes that
are sensitive to shocks and dissipation.

resolution at radio (8.4GHz) and near-infrared ($2.2\mu$m) wavelengths. This
allows us to characterize the central kpc of these galaxies with a spatial
resolution of $\simeq100$pc. In general, we find a good spatial correlation
between the radio and the near-IR emission, although radio emission tends to be
more concentrated in the nuclear regions. Additionally, we use an MCMC code to
model their multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) using template
libraries of starburst, AGN and spheroidal/cirrus models, determining the
luminosity contribution of each component, and finding that all sources in our
sample are starburst-dominated, except for NGC6926 with an AGN contribution of
$\simeq64$\%. Our sources show high star formation rates ($40$ to
$167M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), supernova rates (0.4 to

  Our results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with a

communities also exhibit much larger acculturation gaps between existing users

explore this mechanism in detail in a specific composite Higgs scenario with
QCD-like dynamics, based on an ultraviolet $SU(N)_{\textrm{TC}}$ 'technicolor'

(SMBHs). They are thought to be the seeds from which SMBHs grow, which would
explain the existence of quasars with BH masses of up to 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$
when the Universe was only 0.8 Gyr old. The detection and study of IMBHs has
thus strong implications for understanding how SMBHs form and grow, which is
ultimately linked to galaxy formation and growth, as well as for studies of the
universality of BH accretion or the epoch of reionisation. Proving the
existence of seed BHs in the early Universe is not yet feasible with the
current instrumentation; however, those seeds that did not grow into SMBHs can
be found as IMBHs in the nearby Universe. In this review I summarize the
different scenarios proposed for the formation of IMBHs and gather all the

characterized but it remains poorly understood. Pioneering work at the Mount
Wilson Observatory demonstrated that other sun-like stars also show regular
activity cycles, and suggested two possible relationships between the rotation
rate and the length of the cycle. Neither of these relationships correctly
describe the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation.
Recent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that
the Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional
phase that occurs in all middle-aged stars. Motivated by these developments, we
identify the manifestation of this magnetic transition in the best available
data on stellar cycles. We propose a reinterpretation of previously published

toward R Aql. Near-simultaneous observations of the 22.23508 GHz 6(16)-5(23)
water maser transition were carried out towards all four sources using the
Effelsberg 100m telescope. The measured line fluxes imply 22 GHz / 1.296 THz
photon luminosity ratios of 0.012, 0.12, and 0.83 respectively for W Hya, U
Her, and VY CMa, values that confirm the 22 GHz maser transition to be

toward VY CMa. Like the 22 GHz maser transition, all three of the THz emission
lines detected here originate from the ortho-H2O spin isomer. Based upon a
model for the circumstellar envelope of W Hya, we estimate that stimulated
emission is responsible for ~ 85% of the observed 1.296 THz line emission, and
thus that this transition may be properly described as a terahertz-frequency
maser. In the case of the 1.885 THz transition, by contrast, our W Hya model
indicates that the observed emission is dominated by spontaneous radiative
decay, even though a population inversion exists.

place constraints on the density profile of dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the

scattering is detected at high signal-to-noise ratio, but it is unclear whether

multisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes
directly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the
first one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The
optimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be
optimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs,
we conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance on

dwarf systems is their likelihood to be tidally locked in a synchronously
rotating spin state. This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by
considering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems
have been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to
mean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a
mean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of
the planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state
of an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a
planetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of
planets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise
synchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin
state, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with
full surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in
illuminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus
on habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very
sensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at
early times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical
planetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both
have Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars.

With renormalization group analysis, the system is found to support two

wavevectors. The transition temperatures of these states are controlled by
perturbations near a one dimensional Luttinger liquid fixed point. Considering
transverse tunneling, the cross-dimensionality breaks down and the density wave

mediated by fluctuation effects. The superconducting gap has an emergent nodal
structure determined by the Fermi momentum, which is tunable by controlling
atomic density. Taking an effective description of the superconducting state,

superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ between 43K and 123K in a
potassium doped aromatic hydrocarbon para-Terphenyl or p-Terphenyl. This
achievement provides the record for the highest Tc in an organic superconductor
overcoming the previous record of Tc=38 K in Cs3C60 fulleride. Here we propose
that the driving mechanism is the quantum resonance between superconducting
gaps near a Lifshitz transition which belongs to the class of Fano resonances
called shape resonances. For the case of p-Terphenyl our numerical solutions of
the multi gap equation shows that high Tc is driven by tuning the chemical
potential by K doping and it appears only in a narrow energy range near a
Lifshitz transition. At the maximum critical temperature, Tc=123K, the
condensate in the appearing new small Fermi surface pocket is in the BCS-BEC
crossover while the Tc drops below 0.3 K where it is in the BEC regime. Finally
we predict the experimental results which can support or falsify our proposed
mechanism: a) the variation of the isotope coefficient as a function of the
critical temperature and b) the variation of the gaps and their ratios
2Delta/Tc as a function of Tc.

tidal radius, which does not reach beyond the stellar extent even if we assume
a high dark matter content (M/L=100). In fact, three of our candidates seem to
be associated with tidal streams, which points to their current disruption.

  2017",,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shingled magnetic recording (SMR) increases the capacity of magnetic hard
drives, but it requires that each zone of a disk be written sequentially and
erased in bulk. This makes SMR a good fit for workloads dominated by large data
objects with limited churn. To explore this possibility, we have developed
SMORE, an object storage system designed to reliably and efficiently store
large, seldom-changing data objects on an array of host-managed or host-aware
SMR disks.
  SMORE uses a log-structured approach to accommodate the constraint that all
writes to an SMR drive must be sequential within large shingled zones. It
stripes data across zones on separate disks, using erasure coding to protect
against drive failure. A separate garbage collection thread reclaims space by
migrating live data out of the emptiest zones so that they can be trimmed and
reused. An index stored on flash and backed up to the SMR drives maps object
identifiers to on-disk locations. SMORE interleaves log records with object
data within SMR zones to enable index recovery after a system crash (or failure
of the flash device) without any additional logging mechanism.
  SMORE achieves full disk bandwidth when ingesting data---with a variety of
object sizes---and when reading large objects. Read performance declines for
smaller object sizes where inter- object seek time dominates. With a worst-case
pattern of random deletions, SMORE has a write amplification (not counting RAID
parity) of less than 2.0 at 80% occupancy. By taking an index snapshot every
two hours, SMORE recovers from crashes in less than a minute. More frequent
snapshots allow faster recovery.

metabolism to extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor,
taking into account the growth capacity of the cell and the impact of toxic

this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity.
We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale
metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results
that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. More
importantly, we derive a number of consequences from the model that are
independent of parameter values. First, that the ratio between cell density and
dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired
metabolic properties invariant across perfusion systems. This conclusion is
robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model
by the negative feedback loop on cell growth due to toxic byproduct
accumulation. Moreover, a complex landscape of steady states in continuous cell
culture emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches,
which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch
culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict
invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A
practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for
large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of
metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced. Thus, in order to actually
reflect the expected behavior in perfusion, performance benchmarks of
cell-lines and culture media should be carried out in a chemostat.

With this aim the Averaged Power (AP) criteria for chattering measurements is
revisited. The STA gains are redesigned to minimize amplitude or AP of
oscillations predicted by HB. The comparison of the chattering produced by
FOSMC and STA with redesigned gains is analyzed taking into account their
amplitudes, frequencies and values of AP allowing to conclude that: (a) for any
value of upperbound of disturbance and Actuator Time Constant (ATC) there exist
a bounded disturbance for which the amplitude and AP of chattering produced by
FOSMC is lower than the caused by STA; (b) if the upperbound of disturbance and
upperbound of time-derivative disturbance are given, then for all sufficiently
small values of ATC the amplitude of chattering and AP produced by STA will be
smaller than the caused by FOSMC; (c) critical values of ATC are predicted by
HB for which the parameters, amplitude of chattering and AP, produced by FOSMC
and STA are the same. Also the frequency of self-exited oscillations caused by
FOSMC is always grater than the produced by STA.

accuracy and time coverage inaccessible from the ground. The main aim of this
paper is the presentation of procedures used to obtain high-precision
photometry from a series of images acquired by the BRITE satellites in two
modes of observing, stare and chopping. We developed two pipelines
corresponding to the two modes of observing. The assessment of the performance
of both pipelines is presented. It is based on two comparisons, which use data
from six runs of the UniBRITE satellite: (i) comparison of photometry obtained
by both pipelines on the same data, which were partly affected by charge
transfer inefficiency (CTI), (ii) comparison of real scatter with theoretical
expectations. It is shown that for CTI-affected observations, the chopping
pipeline provides much better photometry than the other pipeline. For other
observations, the results are comparable only for data obtained shortly after
switching to chopping mode. Starting from about 2.5 years in orbit, the
chopping mode of observing provides significantly better photometry for
UniBRITE data than the stare mode. This paper shows that high-precision space
photometry with low-cost nano-satellites is achievable. The proposed meth- ods,
used to obtain photometry from images affected by high impulsive noise, can be
applied to data from other space missions or even to data acquired from
ground-based observations.

patient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and
its relationship with hospital LOS was assessed via a negative binomial

focuses on 5,588 adult patients hospitalized for trauma at the Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals
from 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: Hospital LOS for trauma inpatients, as an indicator of care
coordination efficiency. RESULTS: Three general types of care coordination
patterns were discovered, each of which was affiliated with a specific patient
group. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS and was
managed by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of
operational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient
groups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operational
areas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to
22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the second and
third patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer
than the first patient group, respectively.

is now used ubiquitously in the modelling of biological processes in which
stochastic effects play an important role. In well-mixed scenarios at the
sub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between
successive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be
appropriately modelled as a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie
algorithm. However, Gillespie's algorithm is routinely applied to model
biological systems for which it was never intended. In particular, processes in
which cell proliferation is important should not be simulated naively using the
Gillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature of the cell cycle breaks
the Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle times is
far less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same
mean.
  Here we suggest a method of modelling the cell cycle that restores the
memoryless property to the system and is therefore consistent with simulation
via the Gillespie algorithm. By breaking the cell cycle into a number of
independent exponentially distributed stages we can restore the Markov property
at the same time as more accurately approximating the appropriate cell cycle
time distributions. The consequences of our revised mathematical model are
explored analytically. We demonstrate the importance of employing the correct
cell cycle time distribution by considering two models incorporating cellular
proliferation (one spatial and one non-spatial) and demonstrating that changing
the cell cycle time distribution makes quantitative and qualitative differences
to their outcomes. Our adaptation will allow modellers and experimentalists
alike to appropriately represent cellular proliferation, whilst still being
able to take advantage of the Gillespie algorithm.

the propagator of soft bosonic fluctuations in theories of itinerant fermions

the $Q^2$ term comes from fermions with high energies (roughly of order of the
bandwidth) and, as such, should be included into the bare bosonic propagator of
the effective low-energy model, and (ii) fluctuations within the low-energy
model generate Landau damping of soft bosons, but affect the $Q^2$ term only
weakly. We argue that the situation is in fact more complex. First, we found
that the high- and low-energy contributions to the $Q^2$ term are of the same
order. Second, we computed the high-energy contributions to the $Q^2$ term in
two microscopic models (a Fermi gas with Coulomb interaction and the Hubbard
model) and found that in all cases these contributions are numerically much
smaller than the low-energy ones, blue especially in 2D. This last result is
relevant for the behavior of observables at low energies, because the
low-energy part of the $Q^2$ term is expected to flow when the effective mass
diverges near QCP. If this term is the dominant one, its flow has to be
computed self-consistently, which gives rise to a novel quantum-critical
behavior. Following up on these results, we discuss two possible ways of
formulating the theory of a QCP with $Q=0$.

neutrino flavor transformations that occur above the neutrinosphere via three
General Relativistic (GR) effects: time dilation, energy redshift, and
trajectory bending. Depending on the compactness of the central object, the
neutrino self-interaction potential is up to three times as large as that
without GR principally due to trajectory bending which increases the
intersection angles between different neutrino trajectories, and time dilation
which changes the fluxes. We determine whether GR effects are important for
flavor transformation during the different epochs of a supernova by using
multi-angle flavor transformation calculations and consider a density profile
and neutrino spectra representative of both the accretion and cooling phases.
We find the GR effects are smaller during the accretion phase due to low
compactness of the proto-neutron star and merely delay the decoherence; the
neutrino bipolar oscillations during the cooling phase are also delayed due to
the GR effects but the delay may be more important because the delay occurs at
radii where it might alter the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind.

(1) They propose that a bound on $t$-midpoints can be obtained by repeated
application of the bound on midpoints, if the original sets are convex. We
construct a specific example where this reasoning fails, and then prove our
construction is general by characterizing the convex sets in the discrete
hypercube. (2) A second proposed technique to bound $t$-midpoints involves new
results in concentration of measure. We follow through on this proposal, with
heavy use on results from the first half of the paper. (3) We show that the
curvature of the discrete hypercube is not positive or zero.

(LV) myocardium from cardiac MR sequences is of significant importance for
identification and diagnosis of cardiac disease. Existing RWT estimation still
relies on segmentation of LV myocardium, which requires strong prior
information and user interaction. No work has been devoted into direct
estimation of RWT from cardiac MR images due to the diverse shapes and
structures for various subjects and cardiac diseases, as well as the complex
regional deformation of LV myocardium during the systole and diastole phases of
the cardiac cycle. In this paper, we present a newly proposed Residual
Recurrent Neural Network (ResRNN) that fully leverages the spatial and temporal
dynamics of LV myocardium to achieve accurate frame-wise RWT estimation. Our
ResRNN comprises two paths: 1) a feed forward convolution neural network (CNN)
for effective and robust CNN embedding learning of various cardiac images and
preliminary estimation of RWT from each frame itself independently, and 2) a
recurrent neural network (RNN) for further improving the estimation by modeling
spatial and temporal dynamics of LV myocardium. For the RNN path, we design for
cardiac sequences a Circle-RNN to eliminate the effect of null hidden input for
the first time-step. Our ResRNN is capable of obtaining accurate estimation of
cardiac RWT with Mean Absolute Error of 1.44mm (less than 1-pixel error) when
validated on cardiac MR sequences of 145 subjects, evidencing its great
potential in clinical cardiac function assessment.

new candidate pulsar. The survey also covers 11 other pulsars with no clear
sign of periodic modulation. The 0.5-8 keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of the
pulsars ranges from $10^{34}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 60 kpc. All the
Chandra sources with $L_X$ $\gtrsim 4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ exhibit
X-ray pulsations. The X-ray spectra of the SMC pulsars (and high mass X-ray
binaries) are in general harder than those of the SMC field population. All but
SXP~8.02 can be fitted by an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of
$\Gamma$ $\lesssim$ 1.5. The X-ray spectrum of the known magnetar SXP~8.02 is
better fitted with a two-temperature blackbody model. Newly measured pulsation
periods of SXP~51.0, SXP~214 and SXP~701 are significantly different from the
previous XMM-Newton and RXTE measurements. This survey provides a rich data set
for energy-dependent pulse profile modeling. Six pulsars show an almost
eclipse-like dip in the pulse profile. Phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals
diverse spectral variation during pulsation cycle: e.g., for an absorbed
power-law model, some exhibit an (anti)-correlation between absorption and
X-ray flux, while others show more intrinsic spectral variation.

kinetic equations with non-trivial equilibrium spin-distribution functions
(NTESDF) in the linear approximation on amplitude of wave perturbations. In
general case, x- and y-projections of the SDF are nonzero which is called the
non-trivial regime. Corresponding equilibrium solution is found. Contribution
of the NTESDF appears in the dielectric permeability tensor in the additive
form. It is explicitly found here. Corresponding modification in the dispersion
equation for the transverse waves is derived. Contribution of NTESDF in the
spectrum of transverse waves is calculated numerically. It is found that the
term caused by the NTESDF can be comparable with the classic terms for the
relatively small wave vectors and frequencies above the cyclotron frequency. In
majority of regimes, the extra spin caused term dominates over the spin term
found earlier, except the small frequency regime, where their contributions in
the whistler spectrum are comparable. A decrease of the left-hand circularly
polarized wave frequency, an increase of the high-frequency right-hand
circularly polarized wave frequency, and a decrease of frequency changing by an
increase of frequency at the growth of the wave vector for the whistler are
found. A dramatic decrease of the spin wave frequency resulting in several
times larger group velocity of the spin wave is found either. Found dispersion
equations are used for obtaining of an effective quantum hydrodynamics
reproducing these results. This generalization requires the introduction of
corresponding equation of state for the thermal part of the spin current in the

pumps or internal instabilities, can scatter via three-waves interactions.
While three-wave scatterings in either forward or backward geometry are
well-known, what happens when waves propagate at angles with one another in
magnetized plasmas remains largely unknown, mainly due to the analytical
difficulty of this problem. In this paper, we overcome this analytical
difficulty and find a convenient formula for three-wave coupling coefficients
in cold, uniform, magnetized plasmas in the most general geometry. This is
achieved by systematically solving the fluid-Maxwell model to second order
using a multiscale perturbative expansion. The general formula for the coupling
coefficient becomes transparent when we reformulate it as the S matrix element
of a quantized Lagrangian. Using the quantized Lagrangian, it is possible to
bypass the perturbative solution and directly obtain the nonlinear coupling
coefficient from the linear response of plasmas. To illustrate how to evaluate
the cold coupling coefficient, we give a set of examples where the
participating waves are either quasi-transverse or quasi-longitudinal. In these
examples, we determine the angular dependence of three-wave scattering, and
demonstrate that backscattering is not necessarily the strongest scattering
channel in magnetized plasmas, in contrast to what happens in unmgnetized
plasmas. Our approach gives a more complete picture, beyond the simple
collimated geometry, of how injected waves can decay in magnetic confinement
devices, as well as how lasers can be scattered in magnetized plasma targets.

Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) via induced nuclear recoil. Our method is
based on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic
solid-state crystals . When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear
recoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm,
with an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with the direction
of the recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain
in the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These
level shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance)
making it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a
solid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in
diamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of
individual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale
region of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter
event, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection
of ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects
in the vicinity of the event can be interrogated to map the strain environment,
thus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach
should be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than
70% at a false positive rate less than 5% for 10 keV recoil energies. If
successful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced
nuclear recoils at solid state densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter
space below the solar neutrino floor. This technique could also potentially be
applied to identify the direction of particles such as neutrons whose low
scattering cross-section requires detectors with a large target mass.

underlying splicing problem to consider two input images, a query image and a
potential donor image. Here the task is to estimate the probability that the
donor image has been used to splice the query image, and obtain the splicing
masks for both the query and donor images. We introduce a novel deep
convolutional neural network architecture, called Deep Matching and Validation
Network (DMVN), which simultaneously localizes and detects image splicing. The
proposed approach does not depend on handcrafted features and uses raw input
images to create deep learned representations. Furthermore, the DMVN is
end-to-end op- timized to produce the probability estimates and the
segmentation masks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art splicing detection methods by a large margin in
terms of both AUC score and speed.

traveling time, and the number of subareas to be covered by the cycle. Based on
this analysis, we then develop an efficient algorithm, the cycles with limited

generally unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to consider estimators,
such as the Concomitant/Scaled Lasso, which jointly optimize over the
regression coefficients as well as over the noise level, making the choice of
the regularization independent of the noise level. However, when data from
different sources are pooled to increase sample size, or when dealing with
multimodal datasets, noise levels typically differ and new dedicated estimators
are needed. In this work we provide new statistical and computational solutions
to deal with such heteroscedastic regression models, with an emphasis on
functional brain imaging with combined magneto- and electroencephalographic

we propose a jointly convex formulation to estimate both the regression

calibrating a LiDAR and a camera. The pipeling uses 3D-3D point correspondences
in LiDAR and camera frame and gives a closed form solution. We further show the
accuracy of the estimate by fusing point clouds from two stereo cameras which
align perfectly with the rotation and translation estimated by our method,
confirming the accuracy of our method's estimates both mathematically and

demonstrate how two cameras with no overlapping field-of-view can also be
calibrated extrinsically using 3D point correspondences. The code has been made

matrices. Such matrices appear in probabilistic models on categorical data,
when the levels are partitioned in p groups, assuming a constant correlation
within a group and a constant correlation for each pair of groups. We obtain
two necessary and sufficient conditions for positive definiteness of elements

replacing a block by its mean value. We prove that for any A $\in$ Bp , A is
positive definite if and only if $\phi$(A) is positive definite. Hence it is
equivalent to check the validity of the covariance matrix of group means, which
only depends on the number of groups and not on their sizes. This theorem can
be extended to a wider set of block matrices. Secondly, we consider the subset
of Bp for which the between group correlation is the same for all pairs of
groups. Positive definiteness then comes down to find the positive definite
interval of a matrix pencil on Sp. We obtain a simple characterization by
localizing the roots of the determinant with within group correlation values.

decentralized manner, through random pairwise interactions. One or more agents
in the population may act as authoritative sources of information, and the
objective of the remaining agents is to obtain information from or about these
source agents. We study two basic tasks: broadcasting, in which the agents are
to learn the bit-state of an authoritative source which is present in the
population, and source detection, in which the agents are required to decide if
at least one source agent is present in the population or not.We focus on
designing protocols which meet two natural conditions: (1) universality, i.e.,
independence of population size, and (2) rapid convergence to a correct global
state after a reconfiguration, such as a change in the state of a source agent.
Our main positive result is to show that both of these constraints can be met.
For both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain
solutions with a convergence time of $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds, w.h.p., from any
starting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that
all agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to
source detection admits one-sided error on a $\varepsilon$-fraction of the
population (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to
implement in practice and have a compact formulation.Our protocols exploit the
properties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the hardness side, our
main structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the
constraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must
display a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an
example). We also observe that the periodicity of the oscillatory behavior of
the protocol, when present, must necessarily depend on the number $^\\# X$ of
source agents present in the population. For instance, our protocols inherently
rely on the emergence of a signal passing through the population, whose period
is $\Theta(\log \frac{n}{^\\# X})$ rounds for most starting configurations. The
design of clocks with tunable frequency may be of independent interest, notably
in modeling biological networks.

eigenstate of the time periodic Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet ground
state (FGS), as well as a physical state obtained from time-evolving an initial
state unitarily under the influence of the time periodic drive are explored.
Topological phases are characterized by different numbers of Majorana zero
($\mathbb{Z}_0$) and $\pi$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}$) modes, where the zero modes are
present even in the absence of the drive, while the $\pi$ modes arise due to
resonant driving. The entanglement spectrum (ES) of the FGS as well as the
physical state show topological Majorana modes whose number is different from
that of the quasi-energy spectrum. The number of Majorana edge modes in the ES
of the FGS vary in time from $|\mathbb{Z}_0-\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}|$ to
$\mathbb{Z}_0+\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}$ within one drive cycle, with the maximal
$\mathbb{Z}_0+\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}$ modes appearing at a special time-reversal
symmetric point of the cycle. For the physical state on the other hand, only
the modes inherited from the initial wavefunction, namely the $\mathbb{Z}_0$
modes, appear in the ES. The $\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}$ modes are absent in the
physical state as they merge with the bulk excitations that are simultaneously
created due to resonant driving. The topological properties of the Majorana

with priors about interacting with the physical world. We applied PVEs to
several simulated control tasks from pixels and achieved promising preliminary

electron-acoustic wave (EAW) propagation in laboratory plasmas remains a
challenging problem, mainly because of heavy damping. In the MaPLE device, the
wave is observed and seen to propagate with phase velocity $\sim1.8$ times the
electron thermal velocity. A small amount of cold, drifting electrons, with
moderate bulk to cold temperature ratio ($\approx 2 - 3$), is present in the
device. It plays a crucial role in reducing the damping. Our calculation
reveals that the drift relaxes the stringent condition on the temperature ratio
for wave destabilization. Growth rate becomes positive above a certain drift
velocity even if the temperature ratio is moderate. The observed phase velocity
agrees well with the theoretical estimate. Experimental realization of the mode
may open up a new avenue in EAW research.

from social networks, web graphs to knowledge-bases. Effectively querying this
graph structured data is non-trivial and has led to research in a variety of
directions -- structured queries, keyword and natural language queries,
automatic translation of these queries to structured queries, etc. We are
concerned with a class of queries called relationship queries, which are
usually expressed as a set of keywords (each keyword denoting a named entity).
The results returned are a set of ranked trees, each of which denotes
relationships among the various keywords. The result list could consist of
hundreds of answers. The problem of keyword search on graphs has been explored
for over a decade now, but an important aspect that is not as extensively
studied is that of user experience. We propose KlusTree, which presents
clustered results to the users instead of a list of all the results. In our
approach, the result trees are represented using language models and are
clustered using JS divergence as a distance measure. We compare KlusTree with
the well-known approaches based on isomorphism and tree-edit distance based
clustering. The user evaluations show that KlusTree outperforms the other two
in providing better clustering, thereby enriching user experience, revealing
interesting patterns and improving result interpretation by the user.

an electron radiography experiment using 45 MeV electrons from an S-band

Programming (ASP), which we refer to as multi-shot ASP solving, and present its
implementation in the ASP system clingo.
  Multi-shot ASP solving features grounding and solving processes that deal
with continuously changing logic programs. In doing so, they remain operative
and accommodate changes in a seamless way. For instance, such processes allow
for advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or
interaction with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. Common to
them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process,
either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. This
evolutionary aspect adds another dimension to ASP since it brings about state
changing operations. We address this issue by providing an operational
semantics that characterizes grounding and solving processes in multi-shot ASP
solving. This characterization provides a semantic account of grounder and
solver states along with the operations manipulating them.
  The operative nature of multi-shot solving avoids redundancies in relaunching
grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning
capacities. clingo accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input
language with control capacities. On the declarative side, a new directive
allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable
subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the
solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the
procedural side. To this end, clingo offers a new application programming
interface that is conveniently accessible via scripting languages.

become useful for quantum protocols when the temperature of the system is
increased, and when the system is allowed to evolve under either the influence
of an external environment, or a closed unitary evolution driven by its own
Hamiltonian due to a sudden change in the system parameters. Using the
one-dimensional anisotropic XY model in a uniform and an alternating transverse
magnetic field, we show that entanglement of the thermal states, corresponding
to the factorization points in the space of the system parameters, revives once
or twice with increasing temperature. We also study the closed unitary
evolution of the quantum spin chain driven out of equilibrium when the external
magnetic fields are turned off, and show that considerable entanglement is
generated during the dynamics, when the initial state has vanishing
entanglement. Interestingly, we find that creation of entanglement for a pair
of spins is possible when the system is made open to an external heat bath,
interacting through that spin-pair having a repetitive quantum interaction.

a way to effectively distribute a total number (or global budget) of nonzero
coefficients across all patches, current sparse recovery algorithms distribute
the global budget equally across all patches despite the wide range of
differences in structural complexity among them. In this work we propose a new

Experimentation using both synthetic and real data shows effectiveness of the

Majorana fermion modes coupled to another SYK model with $N^2$ Majorana fermion
modes, in which the latter has many more degrees of freedom and plays the role
as a thermal bath. For a single SYK model coupled to the thermal bath, we show
that although the Lyapunov exponent is still proportional to temperature, it
monotonically decreases from $2\pi/\beta$ ($\beta=1/(k_BT)$, $T$ is
temperature) to zero as the coupling strength to the thermal bath increases.
For a chain of SYK models, when they are uniformly coupled to the thermal bath,
we show that the butterfly velocity displays a crossover from a
$\sqrt{T}$-dependence at relatively high temperature to a linear $T$-dependence
at low temperature, with the crossover temperature also controlled by the
coupling strength to the thermal bath. If only the end of the SYK chain is
coupled to the thermal bath, the model can introduce a spatial dependence of
both the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Our models provide
canonical examples for the study of thermalization within chaotic models.

within the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The dispersive effects that
lead to non-zero bulk viscosity arise from quark-meson fluctuations above the
Mott transition temperature, where meson decay into two quarks is kinematically
allowed. We adopt the Kubo-Zubarev formalism and compute the equilibrium
imaginary-time correlation function for pressure in the $O(1/N_c)$ power
counting scheme. The bulk viscosity of matter is expressed in terms of the
Lorentz components of the quark spectral function and includes multi-loop
contributions which arise via re-summation of infinite geometrical series of
loop diagrams. We show that the multi-loop contributions dominate the
single-loop contribution close to the Mott line, whereas at high temperatures
the one-loop contribution is dominant. The multi-loop bulk viscosity dominates
the shear viscosity close to the Mott temperature by factors 5 to 20, but with
increasing temperature the shear viscosity becomes the dominant dissipation
mechanism of stresses as the one-loop contribution becomes the main source of
bulk viscosity.

detected 49 galaxies at $>5\sigma$ significance and 12 others are seen at low

$(0.03-1.31)\times10^{10}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$, equivalent to $\log({\rm

explored with local and high-z normal galaxies. We compute the optical to CO
size ratio for 21 galaxies resolved by ALMA at $\sim 3$.""$5$ resolution (6.5

compact than the stellar component. We obtain a global Schmidt-Kennicutt

galaxies lying at `intermediate efficiencies' between a long-standing mode of
star-formation activity and a starburst, specially at $\rm L_{IR}=10^{11-12}

propose that star formation efficiencies can be parameterised by $\log [{\rm

branching processes modelling the social network under competition turn out to
be decomposable, multi-type and continuous time variants. For such processes
types belonging to different sub-classes evolve at different rates and have
different probabilities of extinction etc. We compute content provider wise

However, up to this value of the healing parameter the breakdown is a hybrid
transition, meaning that, besides this first order character, the transition
shows scaling too. In this paper we investigate the question of universality
related to the scaling behavior. Recently we showed that the hybrid phase
transition in the original CF model has two sets of exponents describing

connected by a scaling law. In the CF model with healing we measure these

trivial scaling meaning that fluctuations follow the central limit theorem.

signals from binary black holes. Our method directly compares gravitational
wave data to numerical relativity simulations. This procedure bypasses

In this work, we use only the full posterior parameter distribution for generic
nonprecessing binaries, drawing inferences away from the set of NR simulations
used, via interpolation of a single scalar quantity (the marginalized
log-likelihood, $\ln {\cal L}$) evaluated by comparing data to nonprecessing
binary black hole simulations. We also compare the data to generic simulations,
and discuss the effectiveness of this procedure for generic sources. We
specifically assess the impact of higher order modes, repeating our
interpretation with both $l\le2$ as well as $l\le3$ harmonic modes. Using the
$l\le3$ higher modes, we gain more information from the signal and can better
constrain the parameters of the gravitational wave signal. We assess and
quantify several sources of systematic error that our procedure could
introduce, including simulation resolution and duration; most are negligible.
We show through examples that our method can recover the parameters for equal
mass, zero spin; GW150914-like; and unequal mass, precessing spin sources. Our
study of this new parameter estimation method demonstrates we can quantify and
understand the systematic and statistical error. This method allows us to use
higher order modes from numerical relativity simulations to better constrain
the black hole binary parameters.

management of a patient's conditions in an independent manner, inducing various

healthcare-one that manages a collection of health conditions together-may
enable greater efficacy and cost savings. However, it is not always evident
which sets of conditions should be managed in a bundled program. Study Design:
Retrospective inference of clusters of health conditions from an electronic
medical record (EMR) system. A survey of healthcare experts to ascertain the
plausibility of the clusters for bundled care programs. Methods: We designed a
data-driven framework to infer clusters of health conditions via their shared
clinical workflows according to EMR utilization by healthcare employees. We
evaluated the framework with approximately 16,500 inpatient stays from a large
medical center. The plausibility of the clusters for bundled care was assessed
through a survey of a panel of healthcare experts using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) under a 95% confidence interval. Results: The framework inferred four
condition clusters: 1) fetal abnormalities, 2) late pregnancies, 3) prostate
problems, and 4) chronic diseases (with congestive heart failure featuring
prominently). Each cluster was deemed plausible by the experts for bundled
care. Conclusions: The findings suggest that data from EMRs may provide a basis
for discovering new directions in bundled care. Still, translating such
findings into actual care management will require further refinement,
implementation, and evaluation.

that relational properties among quantum systems, instead of the independent
properties of a quantum system, are the most fundamental elements to construct
quantum mechanics. This idea, combining with the emphasis that measurement of a
quantum system is a bidirectional interaction process, leads to a new framework
to calculate the probability of an outcome when measuring a quantum system. In
this framework, the most basic variable is the relational probability
amplitude. Probability is calculated as summation of weights from the potential
alternative measurement configurations. The properties of quantum systems, such
as superposition and entanglement, are manifested through the rules of counting
the alternatives. Wave function and reduced density matrix are derived from the
relational probability amplitude matrix. They are found to be secondary
mathematical tools that equivalently describe a quantum system without
explicitly calling out the measuring system. Schr\""{o}dinger Equation is
obtained when there is no entanglement in the relational probability amplitude
matrix. Feynman Path Integral is used to calculate the relational probability
amplitude, and is further generalized to formulate the reduced density matrix.
In essence, quantum mechanics is reformulated as a theory that describes
physical systems in terms of relational properties.

functions in Epilepsy patients should be carefully determined prior to surgery.
Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based Real Time Functional Mapping (RTFM) has been
shown to be a safer alternative to the electrical cortical stimulation mapping
(ESM), which is currently the clinical/gold standard. Conventional methods for
analyzing RTFM signals are based on statistical comparison of signal power at
certain frequency bands. Compared to gold standard (ESM), they have limited
accuracies when assessing channel responses.
  In this study, we address the accuracy limitation of the current RTFM signal
estimation methods by analyzing the full frequency spectrum of the signal and
replacing signal power estimation methods with machine learning algorithms,
specifically random forest (RF), as a proof of concept. We train RF with power
spectral density of the time-series RTFM signal in supervised learning
framework where ground truth labels are obtained from the ESM. Results obtained
from RTFM of six adult patients in a strictly controlled experimental setup
reveal the state of the art detection accuracy of $\approx 78\%$ for the
language comprehension task, an improvement of $23\%$ over the conventional
RTFM estimation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
exploring the use of machine learning approaches for determining RTFM signal
characteristics, and using the whole-frequency band for better region
localization. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning based
RTFM signal analysis method over the full spectrum to be a clinical routine in
the near future.

fractional Fourier transform, the 2D nonseparable linear canonical transform
(2D NsLCT) is useful in optics, signal and image processing. To reduce the
digital implementation complexity of the 2D NsLCT, some previous works
decomposed the 2D NsLCT into several low-complexity operations, including 2D
FT, 2D chirp multiplication (2D CM) and 2D affine transformations. However, 2D
affine transformations will introduce interpolation error. In this paper, we
propose a new decomposition called CM-CC-CM-CC decomposition, which decomposes
the 2D NsLCT into two 2D CMs and two 2D chirp convolutions (2D CCs). No 2D
affine transforms are involved. Simulation results show that the proposed
methods have higher accuracy, lower computational complexity and smaller error
in the additivity property compared with the previous works. Plus, the proposed
methods have perfect reversibility property that one can reconstruct the input
signal/image losslessly from the output.
