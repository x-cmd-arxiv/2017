packet loss compared with Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). However, FPMIPv6 still
cannot handle heterogeneous handovers due to the lack of unified Layer 2
triggering mechanism along with the booming of emerging wireless technologies.
Media Independent Handover (MIH) can provide heterogeneous handover support,
and a lot of integration solutions have been proposed for it. However, most of
them focus on the integration of MIH and PMIPv6, and require the additional
mechanisms, which are out of the scope the MIH and difficult to standardize the
operations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an integration solution of
FPMIPv6 and MIH by extending the existing MIH standards, and adopt the city
section mobility model to analyze its performance under different scenarios.
The analytical results show that the proposed solution is capable of reducing
the handover delay and the signaling cost compared with the standard as well as
the fast handover solutions.

realistic picture of velocity gradient statistics at any Reynolds number. To
achieve this level of accuracy, we use as a first modelling step a regularized
self-stretching term in the framework of the Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD)
approximation that was shown to give a realistic picture of small scales
statistics of turbulence only up to moderate Reynolds numbers. As a second
step, we constrain the dynamics, in the spirit of Girimaji & Pope (1990), in
order to impose a peculiar statistical structure to the dissipation seen by the
Lagrangian particle. This probabilistic closure uses as a building block a
random field that fulfils the statistical description of the intermittency,
i.e. multifractal, phenomenon. To do so, we define and generalize to a
statistically stationary framework a proposition made by Schmitt (2003). These
considerations lead us to propose a non-linear and non-Markovian closed
dynamics for the elements of the velocity gradient tensor. We numerically
integrate this dynamics and observe that a stationary regime is indeed reached,
in which (i) the gradients variance is proportional to the Reynolds number,
(ii) gradients are typically correlated over the (small) Kolmogorov time scale
and gradients norms over the (large) integral time scale (iii) the joint

density functions associated with biomedical variables. These estimators that
adjust for measurement error are broadly referred to as density deconvolution
estimators. While most methods in the literature assume the distribution of the
measurement error to be fully known, a recently proposed method based on the
empirical phase function (EPF) can deal with the situation when the measurement
error distribution is unknown. The EPF density estimator has only been
considered in the context of additive and homoscedastic measurement error;
however, the measurement error of many biomedical variables is heteroscedastic
in nature. In this paper, we developed a phase function approach for density
deconvolution when the measurement error has unknown distribution and is
heteroscedastic. A weighted empirical phase function (WEPF) is proposed where
the weights are used to adjust for heteroscedasticity of measurement error. The
asymptotic properties of the WEPF estimator are evaluated. Simulation results
show that the weighting can result in large decreases in mean integrated
squared error (MISE) when estimating the phase function. The estimation of the
weights from replicate observations is also discussed. Finally, the
construction of a deconvolution density estimator using the WEPF is compared to
an existing deconvolution estimator that adjusts for heteroscedasticity, but
assumes the measurement error distribution to be fully known. The WEPF
estimator proves to be competitive, especially when considering that it relies
on the minimal assumption of the distribution of measurement error.

inspired by a Bayesian update rule, the student model leverages the information
learned by the teacher, which acts as a probabilistic knowledge store. The
regularizer reduces the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when
we learn over sequences of distributions. We validate our model's performance
on sequential variants of MNIST, FashionMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SVHN and Celeb-A

used a publicly available Indiana CXR, JSRT and Shenzhen dataset and studied
the performance of known deep convolutional network (DCN) architectures on
different abnormalities. We find that the same DCN architecture doesn't perform
well across all abnormalities. Shallow features or earlier layers consistently
provide higher detection accuracy compared to deep features. We have also found
ensemble models to improve classification significantly compared to single

abnormality detection on these datasets. We find that for cardiomegaly
detection, the deep learning method improves the accuracy by a staggering 17
percentage point compared to rule based methods. We applied the techniques to
the problem of tuberculosis detection on a different dataset and achieved the
highest accuracy. Our localization experiments using these trained classifiers
show that for spatially spread out abnormalities like cardiomegaly and
pulmonary edema, the network can localize the abnormalities successfully most
of the time. One remarkable result of the cardiomegaly localization is that the
heart and its surrounding region is most responsible for cardiomegaly
detection, in contrast to the rule based models where the ratio of heart and
lung area is used as the measure. We believe that through deep learning based

dominance of excitonic effects in the refractive index of the monolayers and
the strong susceptibility of the excitons to the influence of injected charge

to facilitate the interconversion of neutral and charged excitons. The other

superstructure is incommensurable with the primitive unit cell. Recently the
incommensurate phase is induced by applying an in-plane strain to hexagonal
manganites, which demonstrates single chiral modulation of six domain variants.
Here we employ Landau theory in combination with the phase-field method to
investigate the incommensurate phase in hexagonal manganites. It is shown that
the equilibrium wave length of the incommensurate phase is determined by
temperature and the magnitude of the applied strain, and a temperature-strain
phase diagram is constructed for the stability of the incommensurate phase.
Temporal evolution of domain structures reveals that the applied strain not
only produces the force pulling the vortices and anti-vortices in opposite
directions, but also results in the creation and annihilation of
vortex-antivortex pairs.

transport through fractured rock in the subsurface. Discrete fracture network
(DFN) computational suites such as dfnWorks are designed to simulate flow and
transport in such porous media. Flow and transport calculations reveal that a
small backbone of fractures exists, where most flow and transport occurs.
Restricting the flowing fracture network to this backbone provides a
significant reduction in the network's effective size. However, the particle
tracking simulations needed to determine the reduction are computationally
intensive. Such methods may be impractical for large systems or for robust
uncertainty quantification of fracture networks, where thousands of forward
simulations are needed to bound system behavior.
  In this paper, we develop an alternative network reduction approach to
characterizing transport in DFNs, by combining graph theoretical and machine
learning methods. We consider a graph representation where nodes signify
fractures and edges denote their intersections. Using random forest and support
vector machines, we rapidly identify a subnetwork that captures the flow
patterns of the full DFN, based primarily on node centrality features in the
graph. Our supervised learning techniques train on particle-tracking backbone
paths found by dfnWorks, but run in negligible time compared to those
simulations. We find that our predictions can reduce the network to
approximately 20% of its original size, while still generating breakthrough
curves consistent with those of the original network.

located in the vicinities of 1 360 bubble structures throughout the Galactic
Plane and their local environments. The compilation of ~70 000 star-forming
sources, found in the proximity of the ionized (Hii) regions and detected in
both Hi-GAL and GLIMPSE surveys, provided a broad overview of the different
evolutionary stages of star-formation in bubbles, from prestellar objects to
more evolved young stellar objects (YSOs). Surface density maps of star-forming
objects clearly reveal an evolutionary trend where more evolved star-forming
objects are found spatially located near the center, while younger star-forming
objects are found at the edge of the bubbles. We derived dynamic ages for a
subsample of 182 Hii regions for which kinematic distances and radio continuum
flux measurements were available. We detect ~80% more star-forming sources per
unit area in the direction of bubbles than in the surrounding fields. We
estimate ~10% clump formation efficiency (CFE) of Hi-GAL clumps in bubbles,
twice the CFE in fields not affected by feedback. We find higher CFE of
protostellar clumps in younger bubbles, whose density of the bubble shells is
higher. We argue that the formation rate from prestellar to protostellar phase
is probably higher during the early stages of the bubble expansion. Evaluation
of the fragmentation time inside the shell of bubbles advocates the
preexistence of clumps in the medium before the bubble, as supported by
numerical simulations. Approximately 23% of the Hi-GAL clumps are found located
in the direction of a bubble, with 15% for prestellar clumps and 41% for
protostellar clumps. We argue that the high fraction of protostellar clumps may
be due to the acceleration of the star-formation process cause by the feedback
of the (Hii) bubbles.

stochastic, the temporal attention parameters are trained using reinforcement
learning. Extensive experiments validate the accuracy of our method in person
re-identification from depth sequences. Finally, in a scenario where subjects
wear unseen clothes, we show large performance gains compared to a

energy dissipation along the path crossing the geological structure is modeled
considering the losses due to ionization, and also contributions from radiative

At high temperature regime, both of Knight shift and nuclei spin-lattice
relaxation at 133Cs and 75As nuclei exhibit distinct temperature-dependent
behavior, suggesting the breakdown of single spin-fluid model in CsFe2As2. This
is ascribed to the coexistence of both localized and itinerant spin degree of
freedom at 3d orbits, which is consistent with orbital-selective Mott phase.
However, single spin-fluid behavior is gradually recovered by developing a
coherent state among 3d orbits with decreasing temperature. A Kondo liquid
scenario is proposed for the low-temperature coherent state. The present work
sets strong constraint on the theoretical model for Fe-based superconductors.

become the standard tools for training neural networks. However, formal
theoretical understanding of why SGD can train neural networks in practice is
largely missing.
  In this paper, we make progress on understanding this mystery by providing a
convergence analysis for SGD on a rich subset of two-layer feedforward networks
with ReLU activations. This subset is characterized by a special structure
called ""identity mapping"". We prove that, if input follows from Gaussian
distribution, with standard $O(1/\sqrt{d})$ initialization of the weights, SGD
converges to the global minimum in polynomial number of steps. Unlike normal
vanilla networks, the ""identity mapping"" makes our network asymmetric and thus
the global minimum is unique. To complement our theory, we are also able to
show experimentally that multi-layer networks with this mapping have better
performance compared with normal vanilla networks.
  Our convergence theorem differs from traditional non-convex optimization
techniques. We show that SGD converges to optimal in ""two phases"": In phase I,
the gradient points to the wrong direction, however, a potential function $g$
gradually decreases. Then in phase II, SGD enters a nice one point convex
region and converges. We also show that the identity mapping is necessary for
convergence, as it moves the initial point to a better place for optimization.
Experiment verifies our claims.

Therefore, matching sketch and photo directly using low-level visual clues are
unsufficient, since a common low-level subspace that traverses semantically

studies do not directly tackle this cross-modal problem. This naturally
motivates us to explore the effectiveness of cross-modal retrieval methods in

is that the actuators travel over the links to a given joint and adjust the
relative angle between the two adjacent links. The joints passively preserve
their angles until one of the actuators moves them again. This actuation can be
applied to any serial robot with two or more links. This unique configuration

associated with hyper-redundant robots but with much fewer actuators. The robot
is modular and its size and geometry can be easily changed. We describe the

divergence on a different but rather ""simpler"" statistical model, which, in
turn, results in solving a system of linear equations. Reverse projection of
divergences are closely related to various estimation methods such as the
maximum likelihood estimation or its variants in robust statistics. We consider
projection theorems of three parametric families of divergences that are widely
used in robust statistics, namely the R\'enyi divergences (or the Cressie-Reed
power divergences), density power divergences, and the relative
$\alpha$-entropy (or the logarithmic density power divergences). We explore
these projection theorems from the usual likelihood maximization approach and
from the principle of sufficiency. In particular, we show the equivalence of
solving the estimation problems by the projection theorems of the respective
divergences and by directly solving the corresponding estimating equations. We
also derive the projection theorem for the density power divergences.

traditional complex elliptic genus. We construct a different, so-called chiral
Hodge-elliptic genus, which is expected to agree with the generic conformal
field theoretic Hodge-elliptic genus, in contrast to the complex Hodge-elliptic
genus as originally defined.
  For K3 surfaces X, the chiral Hodge-elliptic genus is shown to be independent
of all moduli. Moreover, employing Kapustin's results on infinite volume limits
it is shown that it agrees with the generic conformal field theoretic
Hodge-elliptic genus of K3 theories, while the complex Hodge-elliptic genus
does not. This new invariant governs part of the field content of K3 theories,
supporting the idea that all their spaces of states have a common subspace
which underlies the generic conformal field theoretic Hodge-elliptic genus, and
thereby the complex elliptic genus. Mathematically, this space is modelled by
the sheaf cohomology of the chiral de Rham complex of X. It decomposes into
irreducible representations of the N=4 superconformal algebra such that the
multiplicity spaces of all massive representations have precisely the
dimensions required in order to furnish the representation of the Mathieu group
M24 that is predicted by Mathieu Moonshine. This is interpreted as evidence in
favour of the ideas of symmetry surfing, which have been proposed by Taormina
and the author, along with the claim that the sheaf cohomology of the chiral de
Rham complex is a natural home for Mathieu Moonshine.
  These investigations also imply that the generic chiral algebra of K3
theories is precisely the N=4 superconformal algebra at central charge c=6, if
the usual predictions on infinite volume limits from string theory hold true.

that can communicate intelligently with human in natural language. Most
existing work on natural language learning relies heavily on training over a
pre-collected dataset with annotated labels, leading to an agent that
essentially captures the statistics of the fixed external training data. As the
training data is essentially a static snapshot representation of the knowledge
from the annotator, the agent trained this way is limited in adaptiveness and
generalization of its behavior. Moreover, this is very different from the
language learning process of humans, where language is acquired during
communication by taking speaking action and learning from the consequences of
speaking action in an interactive manner. This paper presents an interactive
setting for grounded natural language learning, where an agent learns natural
language by interacting with a teacher and learning from feedback, thus
learning and improving language skills while taking part in the conversation.
To achieve this goal, we propose a model which incorporates both imitation and
reinforcement by leveraging jointly sentence and reward feedbacks from the
teacher. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the

discretization, we developed a matrix vector multiply routine that does not
require any costly synchronizations or barriers. Our algorithm is able to
attain 80\% of peak bandwidth performance for higher order polynomials. This is
possible due to the data locality inherent in the HDG method. Very high

Case Points (UCP), especially when the historical dataset is absent. The first
versions of UCP effort estimation models used a fixed number or very limited
numbers of productivity ratios for all new projects. These approaches have not
been well examined over a large number of projects so the validity of these
studies was a matter for criticism. The newly available large software datasets
allow us to perform further research on the usefulness of productivity for
effort estimation of software development. Specifically, we studied the
relationship between project productivity and UCP environmental factors, as
they have a significant impact on the amount of productivity needed for a
software project. Therefore, we designed four studies, using various
classification and regression methods, to examine the usefulness of that
relationship and its impact on UCP effort estimation. The results we obtained
are encouraging and show potential improvement in effort estimation.
Furthermore, the efficiency of that relationship is better over a dataset that
comes from industry because of the quality of data collection. Our comment on
the findings is that it is better to exclude environmental factors from
calculating UCP and make them available only for computing productivity. The
study also encourages project managers to understand how to better assess the
environmental factors as they do have a significant impact on productivity

approaches due to their global perspective, which eliminates the danger of
getting stuck at local optima. However, for continuous optimisation problems or
problems with a large number of actions, bandit based approaches can be
hindered by slow learning. Gradient based approaches, on the other hand,
navigate quickly in high-dimensional continuous spaces through local
optimisation, following the gradient in fine grained steps. Yet, apart from
being susceptible to local optima, these schemes are less suited for online
learning due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error before the optimum
can be identified. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that unifies
the above two paradigms in one single framework, with the aim of combining
their advantages. At the heart of our approach we find a stochastic linear
approximation of the function to be optimised, where both the gradient and
values of the function are explicitly captured. This allows us to learn from
both noisy function and gradient observations, and predict these properties
across the action space to support optimisation. We further propose an
accompanying bandit driven exploration scheme that uses Bayesian credible
bounds to trade off exploration against exploitation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that by unifying bandit and gradient based learning, one obtains
consistently improved performance across a wide spectrum of problem
environments. Furthermore, even when gradient feedback is unavailable, the
flexibility of our model, including gradient prediction, still allows us
outperform competing approaches, although with a smaller margin. Due to the
pervasiveness of bandit based optimisation, our scheme opens up for improved
performance both in meta-optimisation and in applications where gradient
related information is readily available.

matter power spectrum on overlapping scales (0.02 Mpc$^{-1}$ < k < 0.7
Mpc$^{-1}$ [9-18]), while the Lyman-alpha forest reaches slightly smaller
scales (0.3 Mpc$^{-1} < k < 3$ Mpc$^{-1}$; [19]). These observations indicate
that the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant with amplitude
close to $2 \times 10^{-9}$, [5, 20-25]. They also strongly support Inflation
and motivate us to obtain constraints reaching to smaller scales on the
primordial curvature power spectrum and by implication on Inflation. One could
obtain limits to much higher values of $k < 10^5$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and with less
sensitivity even higher to $k < 10^{19}- 10^{23}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using limits from
CMB spectral distortions(SD)and on ultracompact minihalo objects(UCMHs)and
Primordial Black Holes(PBHs). In this paper, we revisit and collect all the
known constraints on both PBHs and UCMHs. We show that unless one uses SD, PBHs
give us very relaxed bounds on the primordial curvature perturbations. UCMHs
are very informative over a reasonable $k$ range($3 < k < 10^6$ Mpc$^{-1}$)and
lead to significant upper-bounds on the curvature spectrum. We review the
conditions under which the tighter constraints on the UCMHs could imply
extremely strong bounds on the fraction of Dark Matter that could be PBHs.
Failure to satisfy these conditions would lead to over production of the UCMHs,
which is inconsistent with the observations. Therefore, we can almost rule out
PBH within their overlap scales with the UCMHs. We consider the UCMH bounds
from experiments such as $\gamma$-rays, Neutrinos, Reionization, pulsar-timing
and SD. We show that they lead to comparable results independent of the form of
DM.

develop a method for defining a list of priorities of degrees, and for choosing
the right group of degrees to be strengthened or destroyed that minimizes the
total price of strengthening or destroying the entire network. We find that the
list of priorities of degrees is universal and independent of the network's
degree distribution, for all kinds of random networks. The list of priorities
is the same for both strengthening a network and for destroying a network with

between their p_c - the critical fraction of nodes that has to be functional,

and coincident with the optical emission, whereas the molecular gas forms a
complete Einstein ring, which shows strong differential magnification. The
de-lensed source structure is determined on 400-pc resolution using a
visibility-fitting lens modelling technique. The reconstructed molecular gas
velocity-field is consistent with a rotating disk with a maximum rotational
velocity of 280 km/s. From dynamical model fitting we find an enclosed mass
M(r<5 kpc)=(1.46+/-0.31)*10^11 M_sol. The molecular gas distribution is highly
structured, with clumps that are co-incident with higher gas velocity
dispersion regions 40-50 km/s and with the intensity peaks in the optical
emission, which are associated with sites of on-going turbulent star-formation.
The peak in the CO (2-1) distribution is not co-incident with the AGN, where
there is a paucity of molecular gas emission, possibly due to radiative
feedback from the central engine. The intrinsic molecular gas luminosity is
L'_CO=(1.2+/-0.3)*10^10 K km/s pc^2 and the inferred gas mass is
M(H2)=(8.3+/-3.0)*10^10 M_sol, which given its dynamical mass is consistent
with a CO-H2 conversion factor of alpha = 5.5+/-2.0 M_solar(K km/s pc^2)^-1.
This suggests that the star-formation efficiency is dependent on the host
galaxy morphology as opposed to the nature of the AGN. The far-infrared
continuum spectral energy distribution shows evidence for heated dust,
equivalent to an obscured star-formation rate of

by using approaches employed in studies of classical turbulence. We use the
Panfilov and the Aliev-Panfilov mathematical models for cardiac tissue. We show
that once electrical-wave turbulence has been initiated,there is a forward
cascade,in which spirals or scrolls form,interact,and break to yield a
turbulent state that is statistically steady and,far away from boundaries,is
statistically homogeneous and isotropic. For the transmembrane potential $V$
and the slow recovery variable $g$,which define our models,we define $E_V(k)$
and $E_g(k)$,the electrical-wave analogs of the fluid energy spectrum $E(k)$ in
fluid turbulence. We show that $E_V(k)$ and $E_g(k)$ are spread out over
several decades in $k$. Thus spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence involves a wide
range of spatial scales. $E_V(k)$ and $E_g(k)$ show approximate power laws,in
some range of $k$, however,their exponents cannot be determined as accurately
as their fluid-turbulence counterparts. The dimensionless ratio $L/\lambda$ is
a convenient control parameter like the Reynolds number for fluid
turbulence,where $L$ is the linear size of the domain and $\lambda$ the
wavelength of a plane wave in the medium. By comparing several other
statistical properties for spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence with their
fluid-turbulence counterparts,we show that,although spiral- and scroll-wave
turbulence have some statistical properties like those of fluid
turbulence,overall these types of turbulence are special and differ in
important ways from fluid turbulence.

uncertainty relations for quantum systems: incompatible observables can be
measured jointly or in sequence only with some unavoidable approximation, which
can be quantified in various ways. The relative entropy is the natural
theoretical quantifier of the information loss when a `true' probability
distribution is replaced by an approximating one. In this paper, we provide a
lower bound for the amount of information that is lost by replacing the
distributions of the sharp position and momentum observables, as they could be
obtained with two separate experiments, by the marginals of any smeared joint
measurement. The bound is obtained by introducing an entropic error function,
and optimizing it over a suitable class of covariant approximate joint
measurements. We fully exploit two cases of target observables: (1)
$n$-dimensional position and momentum vectors; (2) two components of position
and momentum along different directions. In (1), we connect the quantum bound
to the dimension $n$; in (2), going from parallel to orthogonal directions, we
show the transition from highly incompatible observables to compatible ones.
For simplicity, we develop the theory only for Gaussian states and

investigated in a Polyakov-loop enhanced linear sigma model of QCD at both zero

the dual sigma condensate (corresponding to the dressed Polyakov-loop) with $T$
is driven by the chiral transition, no matter whether the Polyakov-loop
dynamics is included or not. For $\mu_I>m_\pi/2$, the dual sigma condensate
shows abnormal thermal behavior which even decreases with $T$ below the melting
temperature $T_c^{I_3}$ of pion superfluidity; On the other hand, even the dual
pion condensate always increases with $T$, its maximum slope locates exactly at
$T_c^{I_3}$ rather than the deconfinement temperature $T_c^{P}$ determined by
the Polyakov-loop. All these are qualitatively consistent with the previous
results obtained in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models. The dual vector meson
condensate for $\mu_I>m_\pi/2$ is also calculated. This quantity is more
sensitive to the chiral transition when taking into account the Dirac-sea
contribution. Our study further suggests that it should be cautious to use dual

present a new outlier regularization framework to understand and analyze the

outlier regularization. (1) A key property of outlier regularization is that
how far an outlier lies away from its theoretically predicted value does not
affect the final regularization and analysis results. (2) Another important
feature of outlier regularization is that it has an equivalent continuous
representation that closely relates to L1 function. This provides a new way to
understand and analyze the robustness of L1 function. We apply our outlier
regularization framework to PCA and propose an outlier regularized PCA (ORPCA)
model. Comparing to the trace-normbased robust PCA, ORPCA has several benefits:
(1) It does not suffer singular value suppression. (2) It can retain small high
rank components which help retain fine details of data. (3) ORPCA can be

arbitrary $K,U$ and $D$, we define a set of $2$-tuples such that for every
$(a,b)$ in that set the rate $D+1+\frac{a}{b}$ is achieved by using vector
linear index codes over every field. We prove that the set
$\mathcal{\mathbf{S}}$ consists of $(a,b)$ such that the rate of constructed
vector linear index codes are at most $\frac{K~\text{mod}~(D+1)}{\left \lfloor
\frac{K}{D+1} \right \rfloor}$ away from a known lower bound on broadcast rate
of SUICP-SNI. The three known results on the exact capacity of the SUICP-SNI
are recovered as special cases of our results. Also, we give a low complexity
decoding procedure for the proposed vector linear index codes for the
SUICP-SNI.

inhibiting rumors. In practice, a tradeoff between the two strategies, which is
known as the TSRB strategy, may achieve a better cost-effectiveness. This paper
is devoted to assessing the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy. For that
purpose, an individual-level spreading model (the generic URQT model) capturing
the interaction between a rumor and the truth is established. Under the model,
a set of criteria for the dying out of a rumor is presented. These criteria
capture the combined influence of the basic parameters and the network
structures on the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy. Experimental results show
that, when the rumor dies out, the dynamics of a simplified URQT model (the
linear URQT model) fits well with the actual rumor-truth interacting process.
Therefore, the generic URQT model and sometimes the linear URQT model provide a
proper basis for assessing the effectiveness of the TSRB strategy.

g_{10}/g_4^4$ originating from the five-loop renormalization group (RG) series
are derived. Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for the sextic coupling have rapidly
diminishing coefficients, so addressing Pad\'e approximants yields proper
numerical results. Use of Pad\'e--Borel--Leroy and conformal mapping
resummation techniques further improves the accuracy leading to the values
$R_6^* = 1.6488$ and $R_6^* = 1.6490$ which are in a brilliant agreement with
the result of advanced lattice calculations. For the octic coupling the
numerical structure of the pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions is less favorable.
Nevertheless, the conform-Borel resummation gives $R_8^* = 0.868$, the number
being close to the lattice estimate $R_8^* = 0.871$ and compatible with the
result of 3D RG analysis $R_8^* = 0.857$. Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for
$R_{10}^*$ and $g_{10}^*$ are also found to have much smaller coefficients than
those of the original RG series. They remain, however, fast growing and big
enough to prevent obtaining fair numerical estimates.

towards a black hole as the central gravitating object. Modified Chaplygin gas
is a particular type of dark energy model which mimics of radiation era to
phantom era depending on the different values of its parameters. We compare the
drak energy accretion with the flow of adiabatic gas. An accretion disc flow
around a black hole is an example of a transonic flow. To make the model, we
consider three components of Navier Stokes' equation, the equation of
continuity and the modified Chaplygin gas's equation of state. As a transonic
flow passes through the sonic point, the velocity gradient being apparently
singular there, gives rise to two flow branches : one infalling, the accretion
and the other outgoing, the wind. We show that the wind curve is stronger and
wind speed reaches to that of light at a finite distance from the black hole
when dark energy is considered. Besides, if we increase the viscosity,
accretion disc is being shortened. This two process acting together deviates
much from adiabatic accretion case. It shows a weakening process for the
accretion procedure by the works of viscous system influenced angular momentum
transport and the repulsive force of the modified Chaplygin gas together.

revealing lower effective attenuation of the gas cell due to the heating and
subsequent gas density reduction in the beam path by the first pulse. This

the moment-generating function (MGF) or the probability density function (PDF)
of channel coefficients. However, these techniques fail for lognormal fading
channels because the Taylor series of the PDF of a lognormal random variable is
zero at the origin and the MGF does not have an explicit form. Although
lognormal fading model has been widely applied in wireless communications and
free-space optical communications, few analytical tools are available to
provide elegant performance expressions for correlated lognormal channels. In
this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the asymptotic outage
probabilities of selection combining (SC), equal-gain combining (EGC) and
maximum-ratio combining (MRC) over equally correlated lognormal fading
channels. Based on these closed-form results, we reveal the followings: i) the
outage probability of EGC or MRC becomes an infinitely small quantity compared
to that of SC at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); ii) channel correlation can
result in an infinite performance loss at large SNR. More importantly, the
analyses reveal insights into the long-standing problem of performance analyses
over correlated lognormal channels at high SNR, and circumvent the
time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation and numerical integration.
