authors conjectured that any connected graph other than $K_2$ admits a local
antimagic labelling. We prove this latter conjecture using the probabilistic
method. Thus the parameter of local antimagic chromatic number, introduced by
Arumugam et al., is well-defined for every connected graph other than $K_2$ .

algorithm, based on approximate message passing, which iteratively applies an
optimal singular value shrinker -- a nonconvex nonlinearity tailored
specifically for matrix estimation. Our algorithm typically converges
exponentially fast, offering a significant speedup over previously suggested
matrix recovery algorithms, such as iterative solvers for Nuclear Norm
Minimization (NNM). It is well known that there is a recovery tradeoff between
the information content of the object $X_0$ to be recovered (specifically, its
matrix rank $r$) and the number of linear measurements $n$ from which recovery
is to be attempted. The precise tradeoff between $r$ and $n$, beyond which
recovery by a given algorithm becomes possible, traces the so-called phase
transition curve of that algorithm in the $(r,n)$ plane. The phase transition
curve of our algorithm is noticeably better than that of NNM. Interestingly, it
is close to the information-theoretic lower bound for the minimal number of
measurements needed for matrix recovery, making it not only state-of-the-art in
terms of convergence rate, but also near-optimal in terms of the matrices it
successfully recovers.

we construct a family of covariant quantizations in flat spaces and Cartesian

$\theta\in\left( 1,0\right)$, which describes an ambiguity of the quantization.
We generalize this construction presenting covariant quantizations of theories
with flat configuration spaces but already with arbitrary curvilinear
coordinates. Then we construct a so-called minimal family of covariant
quantizations for theories with curved configuration spaces. This family of
quantizations is parametrized by the same function $\omega \left( \theta

consider a quantization of a non-relativistic particle moving in a curved

is a positive universal constant times the Gromov norm of $M$. The proof
combines TQFT techniques, geometric decomposition theory of 3-manifolds and

  We obtain topological criteria that can be used to check whether the growth

some $B>0$. We use these criteria to construct infinite families of hyperbolic
3-manifolds whose $SO(3)$ Turaev-Viro invariants grow exponentially. These

give applications of this result on the question of the extent to which
relations between the invariants $TV_r$ and hyperbolic volume are preserved

their complex infrastructure. The emergence of the Cyber-Physical-Social
Systems (CPSS) and context-aware technologies boost a growing interest in
analysing, extracting and eventually understanding city events which
subsequently can be utilised to leverage the citizen observations of their
cities. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using Twitter textual
streams for extracting city events. We propose a hierarchical multi-view deep
learning approach to contextualise citizen observations of various city systems
and services. Our goal has been to build a flexible architecture that can learn
representations useful for tasks, thus avoiding excessive task-specific feature
engineering. We apply our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of event
reports and tweets of over four months from San Francisco Bay Area dataset and
additional datasets collected from London. The results of our evaluations show
that our proposed solution outperforms the existing models and can be used for
extracting city related events with an averaged accuracy of 81% over all
classes. To further evaluate the impact of our Twitter event extraction model,
we have used two sources of authorised reports through collecting road traffic
disruptions data from Transport for London API, and parsing the Time Out London
website for sociocultural events. The analysis showed that 49.5% of the Twitter
traffic comments are reported approximately five hours prior to the authorities
official records. Moreover, we discovered that amongst the scheduled
sociocultural event topics; tweets reporting transportation, cultural and
social events are 31.75% more likely to influence the distribution of the
Twitter comments than sport, weather and crime topics.

(Marshall et al 2007, Tang 2012) through a construction that converts a special

to characterize the distribution of hospital charge and length of stay (LOS),
but the lack of connections between them makes the two models rarely used
together. We claim that our construction can make up this gap and make it
possible to take advantage of the two different models simultaneously. As a
consequence, we derive a measure of the ""price"" of staying in each medical
stage (identified with phases of a CPH model), which can't be approached
without considering the RGRST and CPH models together.A two-stage algorithm is
provided to generate consistent estimation of model parameters. Applying the

data processing if there are two alternative processing methods available with
different a priori unknown efficiencies. One should determine the most
effective method and provide its predominant application. To this end we use
the mirror descent algorithm (MDA). It is well-known that corresponding minimax
risk has the order $N^{1/2}$ with $N$ being the number of processed data. We
improve significantly the theoretical estimate of the factor using Monte-Carlo
simulations. Then we propose a parallel version of the MDA which allows
processing of data by packets in a number of stages. The usage of parallel
version of the MDA ensures that total time of data processing depends mostly on
the number of packets but not on the total number of data. It is quite
unexpectedly that the parallel version behaves unlike the ordinary one even if
the number of packets is large. Moreover, the parallel version considerably
improves control performance because it provides significantly smaller value of
the minimax risk. We explain this result by considering another parallel
modification of the MDA which behavior is close to behavior of the ordinary
version. Our estimates are based on invariant descriptions of the algorithms.
All estimates are obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. It's worth noting that
parallel version performs well only for methods with close efficiencies. If
efficiencies differ significantly then one should use the combined algorithm
which at initial sufficiently short control horizon uses ordinary version and
then switches to the parallel version of the MDA.

observations in colloidal suspensions that softer interactions lead to stronger
(less fragile) glass formers, we study the variation of relaxation dynamics
with density, rather than temperature, as a control parameter. We employ
density temperature scaling, analyzed in recent studies, to address the
question. We find that while employing inverse density in place of temperature
leads to the conclusion that softer interactions lead to stronger behaviour,
the use of scaled variables involving temperature and density lead to the
opposite conclusion, similarly to earlier investigations where temperature
variation of relaxation dynamics was analysed for the same systems. We
rationalize our results by considering the Adam-Gibbs (AG) fragility, which
incorporates the density dependence of the configurational entropy and an
activation energy that may arise from other properties of a glass former.
Within the framework of the Adam-Gibbs relation, by employing density
temperature scaling for the analysis, we find that softer particles make more
fragile glasses, as deduced from dynamical quantities, which is found to be
consistent with the Adam-Gibbs fragility.

Closed-form solutions for widely linear maximum ratio transmission (MRT), WL
zero-forcing (ZF), WL minimum mean square error (MMSE), and WL maximum signal
to leakage and noise ratio (MSLNR) precoding are obtained. It is shown that
widely linear processing can potentially double the number of simultaneous
users compared to the linear processing of one-dimensionally modulated signals.
Furthermore, to deal with the increasing number of communications devices a
user selection algorithm compatible with widely linear processing of
one-dimensionally modulated signals is proposed. The proposed user selection
algorithm can double the number of simultaneously selected users compared to
conventional user selection methods.

efficiently solving these large-scale optimization problems, which are often
ill-conditioned.
  In this paper, we present a new method called Linearize And Project (LAP)
that offers a flexible framework for solving inverse problems with coupled
variables. LAP is most promising for cases when the subproblem corresponding to
one of the variables is considerably easier to solve than the other. LAP is
based on a Gauss-Newton method, and thus after linearizing the residual, it
eliminates one block of variables through projection. Due to the linearization,
this block can be chosen freely. Further, LAP supports direct, iterative, and
hybrid regularization as well as constraints. Therefore LAP is attractive,
e.g., for ill-posed imaging problems. These traits differentiate LAP from
common alternatives for this type of problem such as variable projection
(VarPro) and block coordinate descent (BCD). Our numerical experiments compare
the performance of LAP to BCD and VarPro using three coupled problems whose
forward operators are linear with respect to one block and nonlinear for the

  Here, we design, implement, and evaluate Hybrid Modular Switch (HyMoS). The
hybrid hardware/software switch is designed to meet requirements for modern-day

PCI Express interface and CPU to act as line cards, switch fabric, and fabric

is turned into a non-blocking switch fabric with a throughput of hundreds of

regularized by the learned foreground/background knowledge in previous frames.
This makes our online MoG model highly robust, stable and adaptive to practical

concise probabilistic MAP model, which can be readily solved by EM algorithm.
We further embed an affine transformation operator into the proposed model,
which can be automatically adjusted to fit a wide range of video background
transformations and make the method more robust to camera movements. With using
the sub-sampling technique, the proposed method can be accelerated to execute
more than 250 frames per second on average, meeting the requirement of

using the front-tracking method, the steady/unsteady states as the terminal
ones at moderate/large Marangoni numbers are captured in a longer time scale
than the thermal diffusion time scale. In the terminal states, the
instantaneous velocity fields in the unsteady migration process at large

numbers. However, in view of the former instantaneous temperature fields, the
surface tension of the top surface of the droplet gradually becomes the main
component of the driving force on the droplet after the inflection point
appears. It is different from that the surface tension of the bottom surface of
the droplet is the main component of the driving force on the droplet for the
latter ones. The physical mechanism of thermocapillary droplet migration can be
described as the significance of the thermal convection around the droplet is
higher than/just as the thermal conduction across the droplet at large/moderate

on the critical density $ \rho=1 $, we analyze the large time behavior of the
front $ R(t) $ for the particle system, and obtain both the scaling exponent of
$R(t)$ and an explicit description of its random scaling limit. Our result
unveils a rarely seen phenomenon where the macroscopic scaling exponent is
sensitive to the amount of initial local fluctuations. Further, the scaling
limit demonstrates an interesting oscillation between instantaneous super- and
sub-critical phases. Our method is based on a novel monotonicity as well as
PDE-type estimates.

designed code may not be optimal for them. To address this drawback we propose
a data driven approach for learning the optimal aperture pattern to recover
depth map from a single coded image. We propose a two stage architecture where,
in the first stage we simulate coded aperture images from a training dataset of
all-focus images and depth maps and in the second stage we recover the depth
map using a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our learned aperture code
performs better than previously designed codes even on code design metrics

  Ph.D thesis of his student, J.~R.~Henderson [15], states that for an
$r$-uniform $r$-partite hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the inequality
$\tau(\mathcal{H})\le(r-1)\cdot \nu(\mathcal{H})$ always holds.
  This conjecture is widely open, except in the case of $r=2$, when it is
equivalent to K\H onig's theorem [18], and in the case of $r=3$, which was
proved by Aharoni in 2001 [3].
  Here we study some special cases of Ryser's conjecture. First of all the most
studied special case is when $\mathcal{H}$ is intersecting. Even for this
special case, not too much is known: this conjecture is proved only for $r\le
5$ in [10,21]. For $r>5$ it is also widely open.
  Generalizing the conjecture for intersecting hypergraphs, we conjecture the
following. If an $r$-uniform $r$-partite hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is
$t$-intersecting (i.e., every two hyperedges meet in at least $t<r$ vertices),
then $\tau(\mathcal{H})\le r-t$. We prove this conjecture for the case $t>
r/4$.
  Gy\'arf\'as [10] showed that Ryser's conjecture for intersecting hypergraphs
is equivalent to saying that the vertices of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph
can be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic components.
  Motivated by this formulation, we examine what fraction of the vertices can
be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic components of \emph{different} colors in an
$r$-edge-colored complete graph. We prove a sharp bound for this problem.
  Finally we prove Ryser's conjecture for the very special case when the
maximum degree of the hypergraph is two.

Towards this goal, we first develop a detector-based spectral clustering method
to mine the representative and discriminative mid-level patterns for detector
initialization. The advantage of the proposed pattern mining technology is that
the distance metric based on detectors only focuses on discriminative details,
and a set of such grouped detectors offer an effective way for consistent
pattern mining. Relying on the discovered patterns, we further formulate the
detector learning process as a confidence-loss sparse Multiple Instance
Learning (cls-MIL) task, which considers the diversity of the positive samples,
while avoid drifting away the well localized ones by assigning a confidence
value to each positive sample. The responses of the learned detectors can form
an effective mid-level image representation for both image classification and
object localization. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

in implicit solvation calculations of small molecules using surrogate models

perturbative expansion around a circular contour. In this work we show that for

procedure that does not rely on a perturbative expansion. This provides further
checks and applications of the integrability method. An interesting property of
the method is that it uses as data the Schwarzian derivative of the contour and
therefore it has manifest global conformal invariance. Finally, we apply Shanks

globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy. In order to understand the origin of
such abundance spreads, we numerically investigate GC formation from massive
molecular clouds (MCs) with fractal structures using our new hydrodynamical
simulations with star formation and feedback effects of supernovae (SNe) and
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We particularly investigate star formation
from gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different
initial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs
with multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical
star cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal
MCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation
efficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from
AGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within
the central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a
canonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars
formed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta
is rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by
SNe of the stars themselves. This result implies that the so-called mass budget
problem is much more severe than ever thought in the self-enrichment scenario
of GC formation. and thus that IMF for the second generation of stars should be
`top-light'.

observations of radiation and cosmic ray from galaxies or the intergalactic
medium (IGM). One possible origin of cosmic magnetic fields is the
magnetogenesis in the primordial universe. Such magnetic fields are called
primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), and are considered to affect the evolution
of matter density fluctuations and the thermal history of the IGM gas. Hence
the information of PMFs is expected to be imprinted on the anisotropies of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)
effect in the IGM. In this study, given an initial power spectrum of PMFs as
$P(k)\propto B_{\rm 1Mpc}^2 k^{n_{B}}$, we calculate dynamical and thermal
evolutions of the IGM under the influence of PMFs, and compute the resultant
angular power spectrum of the Compton $y$-parameter on the sky. As a result, we
find that two physical processes driven by PMFs dominantly determine the power
spectrum of the Compton $y$-parameter; (i) the heating due to the ambipolar
diffusion effectively works to increase the temperature and the ionization
fraction, and (ii) the Lorentz force drastically enhances the density contrast
just after the recombination epoch. These facts result in making the tSZ
angular power spectrum induced by the PMFs more remarkable at $\ell >10^4$ than
that by galaxy clusters even with $B_{\rm 1Mpc}=0.1$ nG and $n_{B}=-1.0$
because the contribution from galaxy clusters decreases with increasing $\ell$.
The measurement of the tSZ angular power spectrum on high $\ell$ modes can
provide the stringent constraint on PMFs.

first proposed using a Gaussian state as a quantum resource, while other
attempts were also made to improve performance by applying non-Gaussian

we present a formalism to evaluate teleportation fidelity as an expectation
value of an operator. Using this formalism, we prove that the optimal state
must be a form of photon-number entangled states. We further show that Gaussian

parameters of a computational model primarily drives the variance of the output
quantities of interest. Sobol' indices are now routinely applied in this
context when the input parameters are modelled by classical probability theory
using random variables. In many practical applications however, input
parameters are affected by both aleatory and epistemic (so-called polymorphic)
uncertainty, for which imprecise probability representations have become
popular in the last decade. In this paper, we consider that the uncertain input
parameters are modelled by parametric probability boxes (p-boxes). We propose
interval-valued (so-called imprecise) Sobol' indices as an extension of their
classical definition. An original algorithm based on the concepts of augmented
space, isoprobabilistic transforms and sparse polynomial chaos expansions is
devised to allow for the computation of these imprecise Sobol' indices at
extremely low cost. In particular, phantoms points are introduced to build an
experimental design in the augmented space (necessary for the calibration of
the sparse PCE) which leads to a smart reuse of runs of the original
computational model. The approach is illustrated on three analytical and
engineering examples which allows one to validate the proposed algorithms
against brute-force double-loop Monte Carlo simulation.

result in just a few sampling units from many unplanned subpopulations at the

satisfactory precision and evaluating their accuracy are serious challenges for
statisticians. To overcome the difficulties, statisticians resort to pooling
information across the small areas via suitable model assumptions,
administrative archives, and census data. In this paper, we develop an array of
small area quantile estimators. The novelty is the introduction of a

most effective when the response values are jointly normal. We also propose a

theoretically in the regimes where the doping mass becomes close to the total
mass of superfluid particles forming a vortex. Such formations are dynamically
stable and, possessing both vorticity and enhanced inertia, demonstrate
properties which are different from the pure vortex case. The goal of this
paper is to define and investigate the universal aspects of a heavily doped

The proposed 3D model is based on a system of coupled semiclassical matter wave
equations which are solved numerically in a wide range of physical parameters.
The size, geometry, solubility and binding energy of dopants in different
regimes are discussed. A coupled motion of a vortex-dopant complex and

Euclidean one or the injectivity radii is bounded from below, we prove a lower
bound of the $C^{\alpha} W^{1, q}$ harmonic radius for manifolds with bounded
Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature when the gradient of the potential is bounded.
Under these conditions, the regularity that can be imposed on the metrics under
harmonic coordinates is only $C^\alpha W^{1,q}$, where $q>2n$ and $n$ is the
dimension of the manifolds. This is almost 1 order lower than that in the
classical $C^{1,\alpha} W^{2, p}$ harmonic coordinates under bounded Ricci
curvature condition [And]. The loss of regularity induces some difference in
the method of proof, which can also be used to address the detail of $W^{2, p}$
convergence in the classical case.
  Based on this lower bound and the techniques in [ChNa2] and [WZ], we extend
Cheeger-Naber's Codimension 4 Theorem in [ChNa2] to the case where the
manifolds have bounded Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature when the gradient of the
potential is bounded. This result covers Ricci solitons when the gradient of
the potential is bounded.
  During the proof, we will use a Green's function argument and adopt a linear
algebra argument in [Bam]. A new ingradient is to show that the diagonal
entries of the matrices in the Transformation Theorem are bounded away from 0.
Together these seem to simplify the proof of the Codimension 4 Theorem, even in

presented. Virtual velocity fields take their values in a vector bundle \vbts
over the n-dimensional space manifold. A stress field of order k is represented
mathematically by an n-form valued in the dual of the vector bundle of k-jets
of \vbts. While only limited analysis can be performed on high order stresses
as such, they may be represented by non-holonomic hyper-stresses, n-forms
valued in the duals of iterated jet bundles. For non-holonomic hyper-stresses,
the analysis that applies to first order stresses may be iterated. In order to
determine a unique value for the tangent surface stress field on the boundary
of a body and the corresponding edge interactions, additional geometric
structure should be specified, that of a vector field transversal to the
boundary.

will be improved by reorganizing the activities of the ten assignments of the
original personal software process (PSP) course into a modified PSP having
fewer assignments (i.e., seven assignments). Method: The assignments were
developed by following a modified PSP with fewer assignments but including the
phases, forms, standards, and logs suggested in the original PSP. The
measurement of the quality of the software assignments was based on defect
density. Results: When the activities in the original PSP were reordered into
fewer assignments, as practitioners progress through the PSP training, the
defect density improved with statistical significance. Conclusions: Our
modified PSP could be applied in academy and industrial environments which are
concerned in the sense of reducing the PSP training time

problem, where given a graph $G$ and a source node $s$ the goal is to maintain
shortest distances between $s$ and all other nodes in $G$ under a sequence of
online adversarial edge deletions. In their seminal work, Even and Shiloach
[JACM 1981] presented an exact solution to the problem in unweighted graphs
with only $O(mn)$ total update time over all edge deletions. Their classic
algorithm was the state of the art for the decremental SSSP problem for three
decades, even when approximate shortest paths are allowed.
  A series of results showed how to improve upon $O(mn)$ if approximation is
allowed, culminating in a recent breakthrough of Henzinger, Krinninger and
Nanongkai [FOCS 14], who presented a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm for
undirected weighted graphs whose total update time is near linear:
$O(m^{1+o(1)}\log(W))$, where $W$ is the ratio of the heaviest to the lightest
edge weight in the graph. In this paper they posed as a major open problem the
question of derandomizing their result.
  Until very recently, all known improvements over the Even-Shiloach algorithm
were randomized and required the assumption of a non-adaptive adversary. In
STOC 2016, Bernstein and Chechik showed the first \emph{deterministic}
algorithm to go beyond $O(mn)$ total update time: the algorithm is also
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate, and has total update time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. In SODA
2017, the same authors presented an algorithm with total update time
$\tilde{O}(mn^{3/4})$. However, both algorithms are restricted to undirected,
unweighted graphs. We present the \emph{first} deterministic algorithm for
\emph{weighted} undirected graphs to go beyond the $O(mn)$ bound. The total
update time is $\tilde{O}(n^2 \log(W))$.

probe the internal rotation of thousands of evolved low-mass stars.
Subsequently, several studies showed that current stellar evolution codes are
unable to reproduce the low core rotation rates observed in these stars. These
results indicate that an additional angular momentum transport process is
necessary to counteract the spin up due to the core contraction during the
post-main sequence evolution. For several candidates, the transport induced by
internal gravity waves (IGW) could play a non-negligible role. In this work, we
investigate the effect of IGW generated by penetrative convection on the
internal rotation of low-mass stars from the subgiant branch to the beginning
of the red giant branch. We show that IGW can efficiently counteract the
contraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of
the radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of
the radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on
the evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates
inferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such
an agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation
mechanism driven by IGW. This result is obtained under the assumption of a
smooth rotation profile and holds true even if a wide range of values is
considered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red
giant branch, we find that IGW remain insufficient, on their own, to explain
the observations. We conclude that plume-induced IGW are able to efficiently
extract angular momentum from the core of subgiant stars and accordingly have
to be taken into account. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism
must likely be invoked.

time-periodic electric field is considered. The two fluids are bounded by
electrodes separated by a finite distance. By means of Floquet theory, the
marginal stability curves are obtained, thereby elucidating the dependency of
the critical voltage and wavenumber upon the fluid viscosities. The limit of
vanishing viscosities is shown to be in excellent agreement with the marginal
stability curves predicted by means of a Mathieu equation. The methodology to
obtain the marginal stability curves developed here is applicable to any
arbitrary but time periodic-signal, as demonstrated for the case of a signal
with two different frequencies. As a special case, the marginal stability
curves for an applied ac voltage biased by a dc voltage are depicted. It is
shown that the mode coupling caused by the normal stress at the interface due
to the electric field leads to appearance of harmonic modes and subharmonic
modes. This is in contrast to the application of a voltage with a single
frequency which always leads to a harmonic mode. Whether a harmonic or
subharmonic mode is the most unstable one depends on details of the excitation
signal. It is also shown that the electrode spacing has a distinct effect on
the stability bahavior of the system.

declines when the images are low-resolution and objects have severe occlusions.
Taking counting methods for example, almost all the recent state-of-the-art
counting methods bypass explicit detection and adopt regression-based methods
to directly count the objects of interest. Among regression-based methods,
density map estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the
integral of the density map over that subregion, is especially promising
because it preserves spatial information, which makes it useful for both
counting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved
steadily. The goal of this paper is to evaluate density maps generated by
density estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis tasks, including
counting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density
maps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the
downsample strides in the convolution/pooling operations. To produce an
original-resolution density map, we also evaluate a classical CNN that uses a
sliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the image.
We also consider a fully convolutional (FCNN) adaptation, with skip connections
from lower convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information
during upsampling. In our experiments, we found that the lower-resolution
density maps sometimes have better counting performance. In contrast, the
original-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection
and tracking, compared to bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density
maps. Finally, we also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a
density map, and relate them to experiment results on counting and
localization.

describes a completely automatic approach for sentiment analysis based on
unsupervised ensemble learning. The method consists of two phases. The first
phase is contextual analysis, which has five processes, namely (1) data
preparation; (2) spelling correction; (3) intensifier handling; (4) negation
handling and (5) contrast handling. The second phase comprises the unsupervised
learning approach, which is an ensemble of clustering classifiers using a
majority voting mechanism with different weight schemes. The base classifier of
the ensemble method is a modified k-means algorithm. The base classifier is
modified by extracting initial centroids from the feature set via using
SentWordNet (SWN). We also introduce new sentiment analysis problems of
Australian airlines and home builders which offer potential benchmark problems
in the sentiment analysis field. Our experiments on datasets from different
domains show that contextual analysis and the ensemble phases improve the
clustering performance in term of accuracy, stability and generalization
ability.

x-ray polarizations, we suceeded in disentangling the response of the
multiferroic cycloidal spin order from the sinusoidal antiferromagnetic order
in the time domain. This enables us to identify the transient magnetic phase
created by intense photoexcitation of the electrons and subsequent heating of
the spin system on a picosecond timescale. The transient phase is shown to be a
spin density wave, as in the adiabatic case, which nevertheless retains the
wave vector of the cycloidal long range order. Two different pump photon
energies, 1.55 eV and 3.1 eV, lead to population of the conduction band
predominantly via intersite $d$-$d$ transitions or intrasite $p$-$d$
transitions, respectively. We find that the nature of the optical excitation
does not play an important role in determining the dynamics of magnetic order
melting. Further, we observe that the orbital reconstruction, which is induced
by the spin ordering, disappears on a timescale comparable to that of the
cycloidal order, attesting to a direct coupling between magnetic and orbital
orders. Our observations are discussed in the context of recent theoretical
models of demagnetization dynamics in strongly correlated systems, revealing

they are over-parameterized, and (2) the recurrence matrix is ill-conditioned.
The former increases the sample complexity of learning and the training time.
The latter causes the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. We present a
flexible recurrent neural network model called Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU).
KRU achieves parameter efficiency in RNNs through a Kronecker factored
recurrent matrix. It overcomes the ill-conditioning of the recurrent matrix by
enforcing soft unitary constraints on the factors. Thanks to the small
dimensionality of the factors, maintaining these constraints is computationally
efficient. Our experimental results on seven standard data-sets reveal that KRU
can reduce the number of parameters by three orders of magnitude in the
recurrent weight matrix compared to the existing recurrent models, without
trading the statistical performance. These results in particular show that
while there are advantages in having a high dimensional recurrent space, the
capacity of the recurrent part of the model can be dramatically reduced.

represent a characteristic data set in terms of a reduced number of parameters.
Apparently, these methods have not found their way into the literature on
multibody systems dynamics. Multibody models can be considered parametric
models in terms of their dynamic parameters, and model selection techniques can
then be used to express these models in terms of a reduced number of
parameters. These parameter-reduced models are expected to have a smaller
computational complexity than the original one and still preserve the desired
level of accuracy. They are also known to be good candidates for parameter
estimation purposes.
  In this work, simulations of the actual model are used to define a data set
that is representative of the system's standard working conditions. A
parameter-reduced model is chosen and its parameter values estimated so that
they minimize the prediction error on these data. To that end, model selection
heuristics and normalized error measures are proposed.
  Using this methodology, two multibody systems with very different
characteristic mobility are analyzed. Highly considerable reductions in the
number of parameters and computational cost are obtained without compromising
the accuracy of the reduced model too much. As an additional result, a
generalization of the base parameter concept to the context of
parameter-reduced models is proposed.

importance for fundamental studies and the recent interest in carbon capture
and carbon-neutral fuels. The vibrational excitation of the CO2 molecule plays
an important role in the process. The complexity of the present state-to-state
(STS) models makes it difficult to find out the key parameters. In this paper
we propose as an alternative a numerical method based on the diffusion
formalism developed in the past for analytical studies. The non-linear
Fokker-Planck equation is solved by the time-dependent diffusion Monte Carlo
method. Transport quantities are calculated from STS rate coefficients. The
asymmetric stretching mode of CO2 is used as a test case. We show that the
method reproduces the STS results or a Treanor distribution depending on the
choice of the boundary conditions. A positive drift, whose energy onset is
determined by the vibrational to translational temperature ratio, brings
molecules from mid-energy range to dissociation. The high-energy fall of the
distribution is observed even neglecting VT processes which are normally
believed to be its cause. Our study explains several puzzling features of
previous studies, provides new insights into the control of the dissociation
rate and a much sought compression of the required data for modeling.

in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). A specially designed shock-tube
experiment was tested on the OMEGA laser facility to observe these two features
evolve at once and to assess thermodynamical and radiative properties. It is a
basic science experiment aimed at improving our understanding of shocked and
ablated matter which is critical to ICF design. At all time, these two moving
""interfaces"" separate the tube into three distinct zones where matter is either
ablated, shocked or unshocked. The {\it simple-flux} or {\it double-flux}
experiments, respectively one or two halfraum-plus-tube, have been thought up
to observe and image these zones using x-ray and visible image diagnostic. The
possibility of observing all three regions at once was instrumental in our new
radiographic image processing used to remove the backlighter background
otherwise detrimental to quantitative measurement. By so doing, after
processing the radiographic images of the 15 shots accumulated during the 2013
and 2015 campaigns, a quantitative comparison between experiments and our
radiative hydrocode simulations was made possible. Several points of the
principal Hugoniot of the aerogel used as a light material in the shock-tube

relative-transmission in the ablated region were observed during radiographic
irradiations while it remained constant in the shocked region. This effect
might be attributed to the spectral distribution variability of the backlighter
during the radiographic pulse. Numerically, that distribution is strongly
dependent upon NLTE models and it could potentially be used as a mean to
discriminate among them.

process of metamorphosis in image matching to the physical concept of order
parameter in the theory of complex fluids \cite{GBHR2013}. In particular, it
cast the concept of Lagrangian paths in imaging science as deterministically
evolving curves in the space of diffeomorphisms acting on image data structure,
expressed in Eulerian space. (In contrast, the landmarks in the standard LDDMM

developing stochastic Lie transport models for uncertainty quantification in
fluid dynamics in \cite{holm2015variational,CrFlHo2017}.

properties characterizing the jamming transition. Both isostaticity and the
critical behavior of the pair correlation function hold over the entire range

enhanced amorphous ordering inherited from the equilibrium fluid competes with,

that these theories are highly constrained: there are precisely four classes of
theories with this property involving only fundamental and adjoint matter, all
of which have a vanishing one-loop beta function and a matter content that fits
into supersymmetric multiplets. Our findings indicate that theories which have
maximal weight are highly constrained and point to the possibility that there
is a connection between maximal transcendental weight and superconformal
symmetry.

understand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the
tidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of
peculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal
dissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from
the pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial
stellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary
orbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in
Mathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating
stars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\odot$. In addition, we generalize the
work of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in
planets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of
stellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled
by the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS
it is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by
magnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the
rotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by
about four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized
dissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution
of the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure
and rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the
red-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong
consequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These
effects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the
planets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history.

distribution depends on the metallicity of their host star. We investigate here
whether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal
dissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting
effect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this
observed statistical trend.
  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital
evolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect
of a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We
consider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\odot}$ evolving
from the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.
  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar
parameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the
convective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal
poor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like
star, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\odot}$
star, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.
  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads
to different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an
initially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively
reproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the
metallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our
model to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations. Namely, we
need to improve the treatment of the rotation evolution in the orbital
evolution model and ultimately we need to consistently couple of the orbital
model to the stellar evolution model.

vary between studies. Recently, it has been recommended that the original
volume elements, voxels, of the imaging experiment should be used as the
network nodes to avoid artefacts and biases. However, this results in a large
numbers of nodes and links, and the sheer amount of detail may obscure
important network features that are manifested on larger scales. One fruitful
approach to detecting such features is to partition networks into modules, i.e.
groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but have few connections
between them. However, attempting to understand how functional networks differ
by simply comparing their individual modular structures can be a daunting task,
and results may be hard to interpret. We show that instead of comparing
different partitions, it is beneficial to analyze differences in the
connectivity between and within the very same modules in networks obtained
under different conditions. We develop a network coarse-graining methodology
that provides easily interpretable results and allows assessing the statistical
significance of observed differences. The feasibility of the method is
demonstrated by analyzing fMRI data recorded from 13 healthy subjects during

corresponding to the the two conditions yields few insights on their

objectives. Consequently, there has been a growing interest not only in

for solving those models. A wide variety of methods, e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA, IBEA,
scatter search, Pareto local search, and many others, have thus been proposed
over the years. Yet in principle, multi-objective problems can be efficiently
solved with existing tailored single-objective solvers -- this is the central
idea behind the well-known epsilon-constraint method (ECM). Despite its
theoretical properties and conceptual simplicity, the epsilon-constraint method
has been largely ignored in the domain of heuristics and remains associated
mostly with exact algorithms. In this article we dispel these preconceptions
and demonstrate that the epsilon-constraint framework can be a highly effective
way to directly leverage the existing research on single-objective optimization
for solving multi-objective problems.
  We propose an improved version of the classical ECM adapted to the challenges
and requirements specific to heuristic search. The resulting framework is
implemented with an existing state-of-the-art single-objective solver for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and tested on the VRP with Route
Balancing (VRPRB). Based on an extensive computational study, we show the added
value of our adaptations compared to the classical ECM, and demonstrate that
our simple epsilon-constraint algorithm significantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art multi-objective metaheuristics with respect to multiple
quality metrics. We conclude with a discussion of relevant success factors and
promising directions for further research.

boundary-curvature induced corrections will become more important as the cavity
size is further reduced. In this paper we summarize the various ray optics

to the differences that arise between chaotic vs. non-chaotic (integrable or

pattern in the chaotic case is known to be determined by the overlap of the

the ray dynamics. In particular we find clear indications for the presence of
attractors resulting from the non-Hamiltonian character of the extended ray
dynamics in phase space. We illustrate their impact on the far-field emission

of theoretical analyses of deep learning has revealed its high expressive power
and universal approximation capability. Although these analyses are highly
nonparametric, existing generalization error analyses have been developed
mainly in a fixed dimensional parametric model. To compensate this gap, we
develop an infinite dimensional model that is based on an integral form as
performed in the analysis of the universal approximation capability. This
allows us to define a reproducing kernel Hilbert space corresponding to each
layer. Our point of view is to deal with the ordinary finite dimensional deep
neural network as a finite approximation of the infinite dimensional one. The
approximation error is evaluated by the degree of freedom of the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space in each layer. To estimate a good finite dimensional
model, we consider both of empirical risk minimization and Bayesian deep
learning. We derive its generalization error bound and it is shown that there
appears bias-variance trade-off in terms of the number of parameters of the
finite dimensional approximation. We show that the optimal width of the
internal layers can be determined through the degree of freedom and the
convergence rate can be faster than $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate which has been shown
in the existing studies.

recovery remains a dominant cost even in highly optimised MPI applications

reducing rollback) is possible in message-passing runtimes, but extremely
complex to design and implement. Our work focuses on task-based runtimes, where
task dependencies are explicit and message passing is implicit. We see an
opportunity for reducing rollback for such runtimes: we explore task
dependencies in the rollback, which we call dependency-aware rollback. We also
design a new C/R technique, which is influenced by recursive decomposition of
tasks, and combine it with dependency-aware rollback. We expect the
dependency-aware rollback to cancel and recompute less tasks in the presence of
node failures. We describe, implement and validate the proposed protocol in a

nilpotent groups, and our main result shows that there is a polynomial upper
bound for twisted conjugacy separability. That allows us to study regular
conjugacy separability in the case of virtually nilpotent groups, where we
compute a polynomial upper bound as well. As another application, we improve
the work of the second author by giving a precise calculation of conjugacy
separability for finitely generated nilpotent groups of nilpotency class 2.

to detect invariant manifolds is simplified by introducing an alternative
definition for LDs. The definition is stated for $n$-dimensional systems with
general time dependence, however we rigorously prove that this method reveals
the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in four particular 2D
cases: a hyperbolic saddle point for linear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic
saddle point for nonlinear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for
linear nonautonomous systems and a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear
nonautonomous systems. We also discuss further rigorous results which show the
ability of LDs to highlight additional invariants sets, such as $n$-tori. These
results are just a simple extension of the ergodic partition theory which we
illustrate by applying this methodology to well-known examples, such as the
planar field of the harmonic oscillator and the 3D ABC flow. Finally, we
provide a thorough discussion on the requirement of the objectivity

essential building block for a wide range of algorithms in various scientific

well-developed. If matrices are sparse, with application-specific sparsity
patterns, the optimal implementation remains an open question. Here, we explore
the performance of communication reducing 2.5D algorithms and one-sided MPI
communication in the context of linear scaling electronic structure theory. In
particular, we extend the DBCSR sparse matrix library, which is the basic
building block for linear scaling electronic structure theory and low scaling
correlated methods in CP2K. The library is specifically designed to efficiently
perform block-sparse matrix-matrix multiplication of matrices with a relatively
large occupation. Here, we compare the performance of the original
implementation based on Cannon's algorithm and MPI point-to-point
communication, with an implementation based on MPI one-sided communications
(RMA), in both a 2D and a 2.5D approach. The 2.5D approach trades memory and
auxiliary operations for reduced communication, which can lead to a speedup if
communication is dominant. The 2.5D algorithm is somewhat easier to implement
with one-sided communications. A detailed description of the implementation is
provided, also for non ideal processor topologies, since this is important for
actual applications. Given the importance of the precise sparsity pattern, and
even the actual matrix data, which decides the effective fill-in upon
multiplication, the tests are performed within the CP2K package with
application benchmarks. Results show a substantial boost in performance for the
RMA based 2.5D algorithm, up to 1.80x, which is observed to increase with the

The
development of formal ontologies, and their important role in the Semantic Web

techniques and tools that help in ontology engineering. One of the main aims is
to refine and to improve axiomatizations for enabling automated reasoning tools
to efficiently infer reliable information. Defects in the axiomatization can
not only cause wrong inferences, but can also hinder the inference of expected
information, either by increasing the computational cost of, or even
preventing, the inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully automatic
white-box testing framework for first-order logic ontologies. Our methodology
is based on the detection of inference-based redundancies in the given
axiomatization. The application of the proposed testing method is fully
automatic since a) the automated generation of tests is guided only by the
syntax of axioms and b) the evaluation of tests is performed by automated
theorem provers. Our proposal enables the detection of defects and serves to
certify the grade of suitability --for reasoning purposes-- of every axiom. We
formally define the set of tests that are generated from any axiom and prove
that every test is logically related to redundancies in the axiom from which
the test has been generated. We have implemented our method and used this
implementation to automatically detect several non-trivial defects that were
hidden in various first-order logic ontologies. Throughout the paper we provide
illustrative examples of these defects, explain how they were found, and how
each proof --given by an automated theorem-prover-- provides useful hints on

examined in the light of recent molecular-dynamics simulations as well as
various theoretical developments within the two-temperature model. The
theoretical work since 1998 have led to the formulation of the $f$-sum version
of the Fermi Golden rule formula as the most convenient method for the
calculation of the rate of cooling of hot electrons where energy is transferred
to cold ions. The attempt to include relaxation via the ion-acoustic modes of
the two coupled subsystems, i.e., electrons and ions has led to a coupled-mode
formulation which has now been established by a variety of formal methods.
However, various simplified calculational models of the system with
coupled-modes, as well as sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations seem to
disagree. It is expected that coupled-mode calculations which use the simple
Coulomb potential $V_{ei}(r)=-|e|Z/r$ for the electron-ion interaction within
RPA will greatly over-estimate the coupled-mode contribution. A weak
pseudopotential $U_{ei}(r)$ would probably bring the estimated coupled-mode
contribution to agree with that obtained by simulations. It is suggested that
the available `reduced models' have been constructed without much attention to
the satisfaction of important sum rules, Kramers-Kr\""onig relations etc. We
also deal with the question of how strongly coupled ion-ion systems can be
addressed by an extension of the second-order linear response theory which is
the basis of current formulations of energy relaxation in warm-dense matter
systems. These are of interest in a variety of fields including hot-electron
semi-conductor devices, inertial-fusion studies of hot compressed hydrogen, as
well as in astrophysical applications.

via $\gamma \gamma \to J/\psi(\Upsilon)+\gamma+X$ in photon-photon collisions
at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), up to $\mathcal
O(\alpha^{3}\alpha_s)$. We find that this process at CEPC is quite ""clean"",
namely the direct photoproduction absolutely dominate over the single- and
double- resolved processes, at least 2 orders of magnitude larger. It is found
that the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections will significantly reduce
the results due to that the virtual corrections to $^3S_1^1$ is large and
negative. For $J/\psi$, as $p_t$ increases, the color octet (CO) processes will
provide increasingly important contributions to the total NLO results. Moreover
the inclusion of CO contributions will dramatically change the polarizations of
$J/\psi$ from toally transverse to longitudinal, which can be regarded as a
distinct signal for the CO mechanism. However, for the case of $\Upsilon$, the
effects of the CO processes are negligible, both for yields and polarizations.
For $J/\psi$, the dependence of the yields on the value of the renormalization
scale $\mu_r$ is moderate, while significant for the polarization. The impact
of the variation of $\mu_{\lambda}$ is found to be relatively slight. As for
the case of $\Upsilon$, the uncertainties of $\mu_{r}$ and $\mu_{\lambda}$ just

$\chi_d^t(G)$ of $G$, is the minimum number of colors among all total dominator
coloring of $G$. The neighbourhood corona of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ is
denoted by $G_1 \star G_2$ and is the graph obtained by taking one copy of
$G_1$ and $|V(G_1)|$ copies of $G_2$, and joining the neighbours of the $i$th
vertex of $G_1$ to every vertex in the $i$th copy of $G_2$. In this paper, we
study the total dominator chromatic number of the neighbourhood of two graphs
and investigate the total dominator chromatic number of $r$-gluing of two

$\mathscr{D}$ are considered. The semilinear term may have arbitrary polynomial
growth as long as it is continuous and monotone except perhaps near the origin.
Typical examples are the stochastic Allen--Cahn and Ginzburg--Landau equations.
The first main result of this article are $L^p$-estimates for such equations.
The $L^p$-estimates are subsequently employed in obtaining higher regularity.
This is motivated by ongoing work to obtain rate of convergence estimates for
numerical approximations to such equations. It is shown, under appropriate
assumptions, that the solution is continuous in time with values in the Sobolev
space $H^2(\mathscr{D}')$ and $\ell^2$-integrable with values in
$H^3(\mathscr{D}')$, for any compact $\mathscr{D}' \subset \mathscr{D}$. Using
results from $L^p$-theory of SPDEs obtained by Kim~\cite{kim04} we get
analogous results in weighted Sobolev spaces on the whole $\mathscr{D}$.
Finally it is shown that the solution is H\""older continuous in time of order
$\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{q}$ as a process with values in a weighted $L^q$-space,
where $q$ arises from the integrability assumptions imposed on the initial

aluminosilicates proceeds via hopping of Li ions, the nature of the various

elucidated. The difficulties associated with investigating the conduction have
to do with the presence of grains and grain boundaries of different
orientations in these usually polycrystalline materials. Herein, we use
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the ion conduction
mechanisms in -eucryptite, which is a prototypical lithium aluminosilicate. In
the absence of significant structural transitions in grain boundaries, we have
found that there are three conduction regimes for the one-dimensional ionic
motion along the c axis channels in the grains, and determined the activation
energies for each of these temperature regimes. Activation energies computed
from molecular statics calculations of the potential energy landscape
encountered by Li ions suggest that at temperatures below 440 {\deg}C
conduction proceeds via cooperative or correlated motion, in agreement with
established literature. Between 440 {\deg}C and 500{\deg}C, the activation
barriers extracted from EIS measurements are large and consistent with those
from atomistic calculations for uncorrelated Li ion hopping. Above 500 {\deg}C
the activation barriers decrease significantly, which indicates that after the
transition to the Li-disordered phase of -eucryptite, the Li ion motion largely
regains the correlated character.

if the background spacetime has a Killing symmetry and a compact spacelike
Cauchy surface. This failure, dubbed as {\it linearization instability}, shows
itself as non-integrability of the perturbative infinitesimal deformation to a
finite deformation of the background. Namely, the linearized field equations
have spurious solutions which cannot be obtained from the linearization of
exact solutions. In practice, one can show the failure of the linear
perturbation theory by showing that a certain quadratic (integral) constraint
on the linearized solutions is not satisfied. For non-compact Cauchy surfaces,
the situation is different and for example, Minkowski space having a
non-compact Cauchy surface, is linearization stable. Here we study, the
linearization instability in generic metric theories of gravity where
Einstein's theory is modified with additional curvature terms. We show that,
unlike the case of general relativity, for modified theories even in the
non-compact Cauchy surface cases, there are some theories which show
linearization instability about their anti-de Sitter backgrounds. Recent $D$
dimensional critical and three dimensional chiral gravity theories are two such
examples. This observation sheds light on the paradoxical behavior of vanishing
conserved charges (mass, angular momenta) for non-vacuum solutions, such as
black holes, in these theories.

models of the photospheric and nebular spectra and of the bolometric light
curve. SN2004aw is shown not to be ``broad-lined'', contrary to previous
claims, but rather a ``fast-lined'' SN Ic. The spectral resemblance to the
narrow-lined Type Ic SN1994I, combined with the strong nebular [O I] emission
and the broad light curve, point to a moderately energetic explosion of a
massive C+O star. The ejected 56Ni mass is ~0.2 Msun. The ejecta mass as
constrained by the models is ~3-5 Msun, while the kinetic energy is estimated
as KE ~3-6 e51 ergs. The ratio KE/Mej, the specific energy which influences the
shape of the spectrum, is therefore ~1. The corresponding zero-age
main-sequence mass of the progenitor star may have been ~23-28 Msun. Tests show
that a flatter outer density structure may have caused a broad-lined spectrum
at epochs before those observed without affecting the later epochs when data
are available, implying that our estimate of KE is a lower limit. SN2004aw may
have been powered by either a collapsar or a magnetar, both of which have been
proposed for gamma-ray burst-supernovae. Evidence for this is seen in the
innermost layers, which appear to be highly aspherical as suggested by the
nebular line profiles. However, any engine was not extremely powerful, as the
outer ejecta are more consistent with a spherical explosion and no gamma-ray
burst was detected in coincidence with SN2004aw.

cardinality constrained maximization problems. The defining characteristic of
our framework is that the cardinality/support of the solution is bounded by a
value $k\in\mathbb{N}$ that grows over time, and we allow the solution to be
extended one element at a time. We investigate the best-possible competitive
ratio of such an incremental solution, i.e., the worst ratio over all $k$
between the incremental solution after $k$ steps and an optimum solution of
cardinality $k$. We define a large class of problems that contains many
important cardinality constrained maximization problems like maximum matching,
knapsack, and packing/covering problems. We provide a general
$2.618$-competitive incremental algorithm for this class of problems, and show
that no algorithm can have competitive ratio below $2.18$ in general.
  In the second part of the paper, we focus on the inherently incremental
greedy algorithm that increases the objective value as much as possible in each
step. This algorithm is known to be $1.58$-competitive for submodular objective
functions, but it has unbounded competitive ratio for the class of incremental
problems mentioned above. We define a relaxed submodularity condition for the
objective function, capturing problems like maximum (weighted) ($b$-)matching
and a variant of the maximum flow problem. We show that the greedy algorithm
has competitive ratio (exactly) $2.313$ for the class of problems that satisfy
this relaxed submodularity condition.
  Note that our upper bounds on the competitive ratios translate to
approximation ratios for the underlying cardinality constrained problems.

under uncertainty, and is one of the most standard tools in Reinforcement
Learning (RL). Despite its widespread use, there is virtually no theoretical
understanding about the limitations or the actual benefits of this exploration
scheme. Does it drive exploration in a meaningful way? Is it prone to
misidentifying the optimal actions or spending too much time exploring the
suboptimal ones? What is the right tuning for the learning rate? In this paper,
we address several of these questions in the classic setup of stochastic
multi-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing that the Boltzmann
exploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence will induce
suboptimal behavior. As a remedy, we offer a simple non-monotone schedule that
guarantees near-optimal performance, albeit only when given prior access to key
problem parameters that are typically not available in practical situations
(like the time horizon $T$ and the suboptimality gap $\Delta$). More
importantly, we propose a novel variant that uses different learning rates for
different arms, and achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of order
$\frac{K\log^2 T}{\Delta}$ and a distribution-independent bound of order
$\sqrt{KT}\log K$ without requiring such prior knowledge. To demonstrate the
flexibility of our technique, we also propose a variant that guarantees the
same performance bounds even if the rewards are heavy-tailed.

meteorites on Earth. Aims. Our aim is to provide diameters and albedos of MCs

thermal model to find the best-fitting values of equivalent diameter and,
whenever possible, the infrared beaming parameter. With the diameter and
tabulated asteroid absolute magnitudes we also computed the visible geometric
albedos. Results. We determined the diameters and beaming parameters of 404
objects observed during the fully cryogenic phase of the WISE mission, most of
which have not been published elsewhere. We also obtained 1572 diameters from
data from the 3-Band and posterior non-cryogenic phases using a default value
of beaming parameter. The average beaming parameter is 1.2 +/- 0.2 for objects
smaller than 10 km, which constitute most of our sample. This is higher than
the typical value of 1.0 found for the whole main belt and is possibly related
to the fact that WISE is able to observe many more small objects at shorter
heliocentric distances, i.e. at higher phase angles. We argue that this is a
better default value for modelling Mars-crossing asteroids from the
WISE/NEOWISE catalogue and discuss the effects of this choice on the diameter
and albedo distributions. We find a double-peaked distribution for the visible
geometric albedos, which is expected since this population is compositionally
diverse and includes objects in the major spectral complexes. However, the
distribution of beaming parameters is homogeneous for both low- and high-albedo
objects.

the objective be finite and differentiable with known gradient Lipschitz
constant. FISTA is applicable to the more broad class of composite objectives
and is equipped with a line-search procedure for estimating the Lipschitz
constant. Nonetheless, FISTA cannot increase the step size and is unable to
take advantage of strong convexity. FGM and FISTA are very similar in form.
Despite this, they appear to have vastly differing convergence analyses. In
this work we generalize the previously introduced augmented estimate sequence
framework as well as the related notion of the gap sequence. We showcase the
flexibility of our tools by constructing a Generalized Accelerated Composite

deriving our method implies that both FGM and FISTA are amenable to a Lyapunov
analysis, common among optimization algorithms. We further showcase the
flexibility of our tools by endowing our method with monotonically decreasing
objective function values alongside a versatile line-search procedure. By
simultaneously incorporating the strengths of FGM and FISTA, our method is able
to surpass both in terms of robustness and usability. We support our findings
with simulation results on an extensive benchmark of composite problems. Our
experiments show that monotonicity has a stabilizing effect on convergence and
challenge the notion present in the literature that for strongly convex

subwavelength scale using hyperbolic phonons-polaritons (HPPs) of hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN). While propagating as waveguided modes HPPs can
concentrate the electric field in a chosen nano-volume. Such a behavior is at
the heart of many applications including subdiffraction imaging and sensing.
Here, we employ HPPs in heterostructures of h-BN and graphene as new
nano-optoelectronic platform by uniting the benefits of efficient hot-carrier
photoconversion in graphene and the hyperbolic nature of h-BN. We demonstrate
electrical detection of HPPs by guiding them towards a graphene pn-junction. We
shine a laser beam onto a gap in metal gates underneath the heterostructure,
where the light is converted into HPPs. The HPPs then propagate as confined
rays heating up the graphene leading to a strong photocurrent. This concept is
exploited to boost the external responsivity of mid-infrared photodetectors,
overcoming the limitation of graphene pn-junction detectors due to their small
active area and weak absorption. Moreover this type of detector exhibits
tunable frequency selectivity due to the HPPs, which combined with its high
responsivity paves the way for efficient high-resolution mid-infrared imaging.

learning a representation with models like recurrent neural network or

word-level semantics by linearly combining the words with attention weights and
the sentence-level semantics with BiLSTM and use it on text classification. We
apply the model on characters and our results show that our model is better
than all the other character-based and word-based convolutional neural network

vision, natural language processing, image processing, etc. Recent successes of
convolutional neural networks in various deep learning applications put even
higher demand on fast convolution. The high computation throughput and memory
bandwidth of graphics processing units (GPUs) make GPUs a natural choice for
accelerating convolution operations. However, maximally exploiting the
available memory bandwidth of GPUs for convolution is a challenging task. This
paper introduces a general model to address the mismatch between the memory
bank width of GPUs and computation data width of threads. Based on this model,
we develop two convolution kernels, one for the general case and the other for
a special case with one input channel. By carefully optimizing memory access
patterns and computation patterns, we design a communication-optimized kernel
for the special case and a communication-reduced kernel for the general case.
Experimental data based on implementations on Kepler GPUs show that our kernels
achieve 5.16X and 35.5% average performance improvement over the latest cuDNN

test different distribution functions and we conclude that the fractional
polarisation of dusty sources is well described by a log-normal distribution,
as determined in the radio band studies. For this distribution we estimate
{\mu}_{217GHz} = 0.3 \pm 0.5 (that would correspond to a median fractional

autocorrelations (pure dephasing) terms dominate the noise-induced exciton
mobility enhancement, followed by site energy-coupling cross-correlations for
specific triplets of pigments. Interestingly, several cross-correlations of the
latter kind, together with coupling-coupling cross-correlations, display clear
low-frequency signatures in their spectral densities in the region 30-70

elastic-network-model (ENM) analysis of the PE545 protein naturally spotlights
collective normal modes in this frequency range, that represent specific
concerted motions of the subnetwork of cysteines that are covalenty linked to

space define macro variables as function of x. Aggregations of transactions
between agents at point x and y determine functions of two variables (x,y) on

at point x to agents at point y and thus amount of Loans received by agents at
point y from agents at point x at moment t during time term dt. We model
evolution of macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like equations. Agents fill
macro domain on economic space that is bounded by minimum risk ratings of most
secure and maximum risk ratings of most risky agents. Economic and financial
shocks can disturb steady borders of macro domain and cause perturbations of
transactions. Such disturbances can generate waves that can propagate along
risk borders alike to surface waves in fluids. As example, we describe simple
model interactions between two transactions by hydrodynamic like equations in a
closed form. We introduce notions of ""macro accelerations"" and their potentials
that establish steady state distributions of transactions on economic space.
For this model in linear approximation we describe surface-like waves and show
that perturbations induced by surface-like waves can exponentially grow up
inside macro domain and induce macro instabilities in a low risk area.
Description of possible steady state distributions of transactions and

  Atmospheric Plasma",,,,,"q-bio.CB physics.med-ph q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling molecule in cancer cells.
However, the significant secretion of H2O2 by cancer cells have been rarely
observed. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a near room temperature ionized gas
composed of neutral particles, charged particles, reactive species, and
electrons. Here, we first demonstrated that breast cancer cells and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells generated micromolar level H2O2 during just 1 min of
direct CAP treatment on these cells. The cell-based H2O2 generation is affected
by the medium volume, the cell confluence, as well as the discharge voltage.
The application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in the cancer treatment has
been intensively investigated over the past decade. Several cellular responses
to the CAP treatment have been observed including the consumption of the
CAP-originated reactive species, the rise of intracellular reactive oxygen
species, the damage on DNA and mitochondria, as well as the activation of
apoptotic events. This is a new previously unknown cellular response to CAP,
which provides a new prospective to understand the interaction between CAP and
cells.

and relay selection algorithms for distributed beamforming. We propose joint
MMSE consensus relay and selection schemes with a total power constraint and
local communications among the relays for a network with cooperating sensors.
We also devise greedy relay selection algorithms based on the MMSE consensus
approach that optimize the network performance. Simulation results show that
the proposed scheme and algorithms outperform existing techniques for
distributed beamforming.
