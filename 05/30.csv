transitions, Herschel-PACS has revealed large reservoirs of warm (300 K) and
hot (700 K) molecular gas around low-mass protostars. We aim to shed light on
the excitation and origin of the CO ladder observed toward protostars, and on
the water abundance in different physical components using spectrally resolved
Herschel-HIFI data. Observations are presented of the highly excited CO line
J=16-15 with Herschel-HIFI toward 24 low-mass protostellar objects. The
spectrally resolved profiles show two distinct velocity components: a broad
component with an average FWHM of 20 km/s, and a narrower component with a FWHM
of 5 km/s that is often offset from the source velocity. The average rotational
temperature over the entire profile, as measured from comparison between CO
J=16-15 and 10-9 emission, is ~300 K. A radiative-transfer analysis shows that
the average H2O/CO column-density ratio is ~0.02, suggesting a total H2O
abundance of ~2x10^-6. Two distinct velocity profiles observed in the HIFI line
profiles suggest that the CO ladder observed with PACS consists of two
excitation components. The warm component (300 K) is associated with the broad
HIFI component, and the hot component (700 K) is associated with the offset
HIFI component. The former originates in either outflow cavity shocks or the
disk wind, and the latter in irradiated shocks. The ubiquity of the warm and
hot CO components suggests that fundamental mechanisms govern the excitation of
these components; we hypothesize that the warm component arises when H2 stops
being the dominant coolant. In this scenario, the hot component arises in
cooling molecular H2-poor gas just prior to the onset of H2 formation. High
spectral resolution observations of highly excited CO transitions uniquely shed
light on the origin of warm and hot gas in low-mass protostellar objects.

has the advantage to present a structure of infinite non-degenerate minima and
is amenable to an easy integration of high-energy modes. We show that, using

chosen at the cosmological scale does not influence the results at the
electroweak scale. We argue that other models can have similar properties both
at cosmological and electroweak scales, but with the MNI model one can complete
the theory towards low energies and easily perform the integration of modes up

adopting this strategy, conducting photometry with the CFHT MegaCam wide field

In this paper we present the results of the spectroscopic follow-up conducted
on a sample of 26 stars at the bright end of the magnitude range of the Survey

obtain spectrum access opportunities by helping with primary users' (PUs') data
transmissions. Currently, such kind of spectrum access is implemented via a
cooperative communications based link-level frame-based cooperative (LLC)
approach where individual SUs independently serve as relays for PUs in order to
gain spectrum access opportunities. Unfortunately, this LLC approach cannot
fully exploit spectrum access opportunities to enhance the throughput of CRNs
and fails to motivate PUs to join the spectrum sharing processes. To address
these challenges, we propose a network-level session-based cooperative (NLC)
approach where SUs are grouped together to cooperate with PUs session by
session, instead of frame by frame as what has been done in existing works, for
spectrum access opportunities of the corresponding group. Thanks to our
group-based session-by-session cooperating strategy, our NLC approach is able
to address all those challenges in the LLC approach. To articulate our NLC
approach, we further develop an NLC scheme under a cognitive capacity

design as a cross-layer optimization problem with constraints on primary
session selection, flow routing and link scheduling. To search for solutions to

(resp. atomic) hydrogen is $\log N$(H$_2$)=$21.21\pm0.02$ (resp. $\log

lines studies with H$_2$ column density as high as what is seen in
$^{13}$CO-selected clouds in the Milky-Way.
  We find that this system has one of the lowest metallicity detected among
H$_2$-bearing DLAs, with $\rm [Zn/H]=-1.52^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$. This can be the
reason for the marked differences compared to systems with similar H$_2$ column
densities in the local Universe: $(i)$ the kinetic temperature, $T\sim$120~K,
derived from the $J=0,1$ H$_2$ rotational levels is at least twice higher than
expected; $(ii)$ there is little dust extinction with A$_V < 0.1$; $(iii)$ no
CO molecules are detected, putting a constraint on the $X_{\rm CO}$ factor

gas. Low CO and high H$_2$ contents indicate that this system represents

classification, where each class is represented by a weight vector, a sample is
represented as a feature vector, and the feature vector has the largest
projection on the weight vector of the correct category when the model
correctly classifies a sample. To ensure generalization, weight decay that
shrinks the weight norm is often used as regularizer. Different from
traditional learning algorithms where features are fixed and only weights are
tunable, features are also tunable as representation learning in deep learning.
Thus, we propose feature incay to also regularize representation learning,
which favors feature vectors with large norm when the samples can be correctly
classified. With the feature incay, feature vectors are further pushed away
from the origin along the direction of their corresponding weight vectors,
which achieves better inter-class separability. In addition, the proposed
feature incay encourages intra-class compactness along the directions of weight
vectors by increasing the small feature norm faster than the large ones.
Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 demonstrate feature incay can

sequence of balls covering an infinite weighted graph. The proofs are based on
1-block and 2-blocks estimates utilizing the resistance structure of the graph;
the moving particle lemma established recently by the author; and discrete

systems. Improvements in manufacturing process technology have allowed DRAM
vendors to lower the DRAM supply voltage conservatively, which reduces some of
the DRAM energy consumption. We would like to reduce the DRAM supply voltage
more aggressively, to further reduce energy. Aggressive supply voltage
reduction requires a thorough understanding of the effect voltage scaling has
on DRAM access latency and DRAM reliability.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to understanding and
exploiting the latency and reliability characteristics of modern DRAM when the
supply voltage is lowered below the nominal voltage level specified by DRAM
standards. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, we perform an experimental
study of 124 real DDR3L (low-voltage) DRAM chips manufactured recently by three
major DRAM vendors. We find that reducing the supply voltage below a certain
point introduces bit errors in the data, and we comprehensively characterize
the behavior of these errors. We discover that these errors can be avoided by
increasing the latency of three major DRAM operations (activation, restoration,
and precharge). We perform detailed DRAM circuit simulations to validate and
explain our experimental findings. We also characterize the various
relationships between reduced supply voltage and error locations, stored data
patterns, DRAM temperature, and data retention.
  Based on our observations, we propose a new DRAM energy reduction mechanism,
called Voltron. The key idea of Voltron is to use a performance model to
determine by how much we can reduce the supply voltage without introducing
errors and without exceeding a user-specified threshold for performance loss.
Voltron reduces the average system energy by 7.3% while limiting the average
system performance loss to only 1.8%, for a variety of workloads.

based on the Two Projective Measurement (TPM) protocol which measures the
energies of the system before and after the process. However, it is well known
that projective measurements disregard quantum coherences of the system with
respect to the energy basis, thus removing potential quantum signatures in the
work distribution. Here we consider weak measurements of the system's energy
difference and establish corrections to work averages arising from initial
system coherences. We discuss two weak measurement protocols that couple the
system to a detector, prepared and measured either in the momentum or the
position eigenstates. Work averages are derived for when the system starts in
the proper thermal state versus when the initial system state is a pure state
with thermal diagonal elements and coherences characterised by a set of phases.
We show that by controlling only the phase differences between the energy
eigenstate contributions in the system's initial pure state, the average work
done during the same unitary process can be controlled. By changing the phases
alone one can toggle from regimes where the systems absorbs energy, i.e. a work
cost, to the ones where it emits energy, i.e. work can be drawn. This suggests
that the coherences are additional resources that can be used to manipulate or
store energy in a quantum system.

NGC 7793 P13, a known super-Eddington source, utilizing data from the

$XMM$-$Newton+NuSTAR$ spectrum of P13 is qualitatively similar to the rest of
the ULX sample with broadband coverage, suggesting that additional ULXs in the
known population may host neutron star accretors. Through time-averaged,
phase-resolved and multi-epoch studies, we find that two non-pulsed thermal
blackbody components with temperatures $\sim$0.5 and $\sim$1.5 keV are required
to fit the data below 10 keV, in addition to a third continuum component which
extends to higher energies and is associated with the pulsed emission from the
accretion column. The characteristic radii of the thermal components appear to
be similar, and are too large to be associated with the neutron star itself, so
the need for two components likely indicates the accretion flow outside the
magnetosphere is complex. We suggest a scenario in which the thick inner disc
expected for super-Eddington accretion begins to form, but is terminated by the
neutron star's magnetic field soon after its onset, implying a limit of $B
\lesssim 6 \times 10^{12}$ G for the dipolar component of the central neutron
star's magnetic field. Evidence of similar termination of the disc in other
sources may offer a further means of identifying additional neutron star ULXs.
Finally, we examine the spectrum exhibited by P13 during one of its unusual
'off' states. These data require both a hard powerlaw component, suggesting
residual accretion onto the neutron star, and emission from a thermal plasma,
which we argue is likely associated with the P13 system.

dozen different metrics we focus on the five most promising ones- two more
traditional metrics, and three novel ones which we propose here, adapted from
the domain of shape-matching. In addition to the novel multi-robot metrics, a
central contribution of this work are tools to analyze and predict the
effectiveness of metrics in the MRMP context. We identify a suite of possible
substructures in the configuration space, for which it is fairly easy (i) to
define a so-called natural distance which allows us to predict the performance
of a metric. This is done by comparing the distribution of its values for
sampled pairs of configurations to the distribution induced by the natural
distance; (ii) to define equivalence classes of configurations and test how
well a metric covers the different classes. We provide experiments that attest
to the ability of our tools to predict the effectiveness of metrics: those
metrics that qualify in the analysis yield higher success rate of the planner
with fewer vertices in the roadmap. We also show how combining several metrics
together leads to better results (success rate and size of roadmap) than using
a single metric.

This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be
also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this
end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CEN)---a class of
architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate,
simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for
intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play
the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation
tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers
two major advantages: (i) for each prediction valid, instance-specific
explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via
explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce
settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally.
Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks
demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art
methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be
valuable for decision support. We also show that while post-hoc methods may
produce misleading explanations in certain cases, CENs are consistent and allow
to detect such cases systematically.

  A causal network structure may be impossible to recover completely from data

Te, N2O2, R23 and O3N2 metallicity calibrators. We find that stochastic
sampling of the IMF leads to a systematic over-estimate of O/H in galaxies with
low star formation rates (< $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$/yr) when using the N2O2, R23
and O3N2 strong-line methods, and an under-estimate when using the Te method on
galaxies of sub-solar metallicity. We point out that while the
SFR(Ha)-to-SFR(UV) ratio can be used to identify systems where the initial mass
function might be insufficiently sampled, it does not provide sufficient
information to fully correct the metallicity calibrations at low star formation
rates. Care must therefore be given in the choice of metallicity indicators in
such systems, with the N2O2 indicator proving most robust of those tested by
us, with a bias of 0.08 dex for models with SFR = $10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$/yr and
solar metallicity.

population synthesis modelling by fitting absorption-line indices in the
ISM-free ultraviolet spectra of 10 Large-Magellanic-Cloud clusters. In doing
so, we find that neglecting stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass
function in these young ($\sim10$-100 Myr), low-mass clusters affects
negligibly ultraviolet-based age and metallicity estimates but can lead to
significant overestimates of stellar mass. Then, we proceed and develop a
simple approach, based on an idealized description of the main features of the
ISM, to compute in a physically consistent way the combined influence of
nebular emission and interstellar absorption on ultraviolet spectra of
star-forming galaxies. Our model accounts for the transfer of radiation through
the ionized interiors and outer neutral envelopes of short-lived stellar birth
clouds, as well as for radiative transfer through a diffuse intercloud medium.
We use this approach to explore the entangled signatures of stars, the ionized
and the neutral ISM in ultraviolet spectra of star-forming galaxies. We find
that, aside from a few notable exceptions, most standard ultraviolet indices
defined in the spectra of ISM-free stellar populations are prone to significant
contamination by the ISM, which increases with metallicity. We also identify
several nebular-emission and interstellar-absorption features, which stand out
as particularly clean tracers of the different phases of the ISM.

isolated galaxies in a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE
project spanning $M_{\star}=10^{6-11}M_{\odot}$. Gas becomes increasingly
rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest-mass galaxies
($M_{\star}<10^{8}M_{\odot}$), gas fails to form a morphological disk and is
primarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses
($M_{\star}=10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$), galaxies display a wide range of gas
kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating disks, to irregular spheroids
with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass
($M_{\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\odot}$) galaxies form rotationally supported gas
disks. Many of the halos whose galaxies fail to form disks harbor high angular
momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular
momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark-matter halo increases
significantly with galaxy mass, from $j_{\rm gas}/j_{\rm DM}\sim0.1$ at
$M_{\star}=10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ to $j_{\rm gas}/j_{\rm DM}\sim2$ at
$M_{\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\odot}$. The reduced rotational support in the
lowest-mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background
suppressing the accretion of high-angular momentum gas at late times, and (b)
stellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce
the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity,
size, and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of
disky, high-angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses
($M_{\star}=(10^{6}-2\times10^{7})M_{\odot}$). In our simulations, stars are
uniformly less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that
stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates
galaxies' stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.

an extra term that encodes the process of thermalization. This extra term has
properties that resemble a time-dependent `relative entropy'. We propose that

far-from-equilibrium excited states. We illustrate our findings with concrete
examples, including generic power-law and periodically driven quenches.

successful in producing a disc-dominated galaxy is the ability to regulate the
high-redshift SF (responsible for the formation of the bulge component), the

splittings of mixed modes in red giants, thereby providing an unprecedented
opportunity to probe the internal rotation of these stars. Asymmetries have
been detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is
unexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far
are found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces
symmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a
way of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show
that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy
effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and
mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using
both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy
effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the
observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative
approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet
asymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical $l=2$
multiplets of the Kepler young red giant KIC7341231 and obtain precise
estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed
asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms
that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected
multiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for
$l=2$ mixed modes all along the red giant branch (RGB). For $l=1$ modes, these
effects can be neglected only at the base of the RGB. They must therefore be
taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here,
they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.

is different in high- and low-density environments up to $z \sim 2$ with the
high-mass end ($M \gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) being enhanced in high-density
environments. On the contrary, for star-forming galaxies a difference between
the GSMF in high- and low density environments is present for masses $M
\lesssim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Star-forming galaxies in this mass range appear to
be more frequent in low-density environments up to $z < 1.5$. Differences in
the shape of the GSMF are not visible anymore at $z > 2$. Our results, in terms
of general trends in the shape of the GSMF, are in agreement with a scenario in

strong decay widths and comparing them to experiment. The main decay mechanism
is that of a string splitting into two strings. The corresponding total decay
width behaves as $\Gamma=\frac\pi2 ATL$ where $T$ and $L$ are the tension and
length of the string and $A$ is a dimensionless universal constant. We show
that this result holds for a bosonic string not only in the critical dimension.
The partial width of a given decay mode is given by
$\Gamma_i/\Gamma=\Phi_i\exp(-2\pi Cm_{sep}^2/T)$ where $\Phi_i$ is a phase
space factor, $m_{sep}$ is the mass of the ""quark"" and ""antiquark"" created at
the splitting point, and $C$ is a dimensionless coefficient close to unity.
Based on the spectra of hadrons we observe that their (modified) Regge
trajectories are characterized by a negative intercept. This implies a
repulsive Casimir force that gives the string a ""zero point length"". We fit the
theoretical decay width to experimental data for mesons on the trajectories of
$\rho$, $\omega$, $\pi$, $\eta$, $K^*$, $\phi$, $D$, and $D^*_s$, and of the
baryons $N$, $\Delta$, $\Lambda$, and $\Sigma$. We examine both the linearity
in $L$ and the exponential suppression factor. The linearity was found to agree
with the data well for mesons but less for baryons. The extracted coefficient
for mesons $A=0.095\pm0.015$ is indeed quite universal. The exponential
suppression was applied to both strong and radiative decays. We discuss the
relation with string fragmentation and jet formation. We extract the
quark-diquark structure of baryons from their decays. A stringy mechanism for
Zweig suppressed decays of quarkonia is proposed and is shown to reproduce the
decay width of $\Upsilon$ states. The dependence of the width on spin and
flavor symmetry is discussed. We further apply this model to the decays of

protoplanetary disk of their current planetary system. Observations have shown
that free-floating Jupiter-mass objects can exceed the number of stars in our
galaxy, implying that capture scenarios may not be so rare. To address this
issue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering
between a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound
planet. We distinguish between three different possible scattering outcomes,
where the free-floating planet may get captured after the interaction with the
binary, remain unbound, or ""kick-out"" the bound planet and replace it. The
simulation was performed for different masses of the free-floating planets and
stars, as well as different impact parameters, inclination angles and approach
velocities. The outcome statistics are used to construct an analytical
approximation of the cross section for capturing a free-floating planet by
fitting their dependence on the tested variables. The analytically approximated
cross section is used to predict the capture rate for these kinds of objects,
and to estimate that about 1\% of all stars are expected to experience a
temporary capture of a free-floating planet during their lifetime. Finally, we
propose additional physical processes that may increase the capture statistics

holographic c-function, that the curvature singularity of a black brane can be
thought of as a trivial IR fixed point. This is dual to the gapped nature of
the thermal state in the IR. So one can say that by taking one kind of low
energy limit in the thermal CFT we are probing the near-singularity region. But
there is another more conventional low energy limit which corresponds to
probing the near-horizon region. Now, instead of one, if we think in terms of
these two low-energy limits and take into account the fact that in AdS-CFT the
only observables are CFT correlators then we can get a completely different
interpretation of the curvature singularity. In a nutshell, the very long
wavelength degrees of freedom in the thermal CFT carry information of both the
near-horizon and the near-singularity regions, but, the field theory observer
cannot, in principle, disentangle the information of the near-horizon region
from the information of the near-singularity region using the the thermal CFT
correlators. This can be interpreted as a very specific form of holographic
""non-locality"" in a black hole background which relates the ""inside and the
outside"". We argue in the paper that owing to this ""non-locality"", the
space-like curvature singularity along with its problems, which are all local
in nature, completely disappear from the theory or get dissolved. But, the same
""non-locality"" now tells us that some of the ""$e^{-S}$-effects"" that one finds,
for example, in the late time thermal two-point function, can be thought of as
carrying complete information about ""Planck-scale effects near the
singularity"". From the local EFT point of view this may be called
""UV-IR-mixing"" which is caused by the ""non-locality"". We also comment on its
close relation to black hole complementarity.

Center. While the $Br_\gamma$ emission shows clear signs of tidal interaction,
the change in the observed luminosity is only of about a factor of 2, in
contention with all previous predictions.
  We present high resolution simulations performed with the moving mesh code,
RICH, together with simple analytical arguments that reproduce the observed
$Br_\gamma$ emission. In our model, G2 is a gas cloud that undergoes tidal
disruption in a dilute ambient medium. We find that during pericenter passage,
the efficient cooling of the cloud results in a vertical collapse, compressing
the cloud by a factor of $\sim5000$. By properly taking into account the
ionization state of the gas, we find that the cloud is UV starved and are able
to reproduce the observed $Br_\gamma$ luminosity.
  For densities larger than $\approx500\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ at pericenter, the
cloud fragments, due to cooling instabilities and the emitted radiation is
inconsistent with observations. For lower densities, the cloud survives the
pericenter passage intact and its emitted radiation matches the observed
lightcurve.
  From the duration of $Br_\gamma$ emission which contains both redshifted and
blueshifted components, we show that the cloud is not spherical but rather
elongated with a size ratio of 4 at year 2001. The simulated cloud's elongation
grows as it travels towards pericenter and is consistent with observations, due
to viewing angles. The simulation is also consistent with having a spherical

how to estimate the statistical uncertainty of the sum of weights in each bin

prescription including energy dissipation rates of different processes and
rates of processes that change the number densities of dark ions and atoms. In

approximate analytic formulas for energy loss rates due to Compton scattering,
bremsstrahlung, recombination, collisional ionization and collisional

In this paper, we seek to re-frame approximate Bayesian computing within a

called approximate confidence distribution computing, yielding theoretical
support for the use of non-sufficient summary statistics in likelihood-free

an appropriate data-dependent prior is also discussed and is shown to often
increase the computing speed while maintaining statistical inferential

grooved surfaces is intuitively developed in the limit where the grooves are

Along with this descriptive physical picture emerges an analytical dispersion

simplifying the theory in three distinguished propagation regimes, namely where
the Bloch wavenumber is respectively smaller than, close to, or larger than

dwarfs have received significant scrutiny recently because their shorter
orbital periods increase their chances of detection and characterization

improved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to
guide target selection. Here we use a 3-D climate system model, updated with
new water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database,
to study ocean covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late-M to
mid-K stars ($2600$ K <= Teff <= 4500K). Our results indicate that these
updated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to
previous studies, so the inner HZ around M-dwarfs is not as close as suggested
by earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating planets with background 1 bar
N2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with Teff > 3000K
undergo the classical ""moist-greenhouse"" (H2O mixing ratio > 10-3 in the
stratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (~ 280K) in our 3-D
model compared with 1-D climate models (~ 340K). This implies that some planets
around low mass stars can simultaneously undergo water-loss and remain
habitable. However, for star with Teff <= 3000K, planets at the inner HZ may
directly transition to a runaway state, while bypassing the moist greenhouse
water-loss entirely. We analyze transmission spectra of planets in a moist
green-house regime, and find that there are several prominent H2O features
within JWST instruments range. Thus, relying only upon standard Earth-analog
spectra with 24-hour rotation period around M-dwarfs for habitability studies
will miss the strong H2O features that one would expect to see on synchronously

quantum many-body systems, even for systems that thermalize. This is because
transport, entanglement, and operator spreading can be hindered by `Griffiths'
rare regions which locally resemble the many-body-localized phase and thus act
as weak links. We propose coarse-grained models for entanglement growth and for
the spreading of quantum operators in the presence of such weak links. We also
examine entanglement growth across a single weak link numerically. We show that
these weak links have a stronger effect on entanglement growth than previously
assumed: entanglement growth is sub-ballistic whenever such weak links have a
power-law probability distribution at low couplings, i.e. throughout the entire
thermal Griffiths phase. We argue that the probability distribution of the
entanglement entropy across a cut can be understood from a simple picture in
terms of a classical surface growth model. Surprisingly, the four length scales
associated with (i) production of entanglement, (ii) spreading of conserved
quantities, (iii) spreading of operators, and (iv) the width of the `front' of
a spreading operator, are characterized by dynamical exponents that in general
are all distinct. Our numerical analysis of entanglement growth between weakly
coupled systems may be of independent interest.

exchange is bidirectional and of arbitrary duration. The multi-modal multi-step
setting allows agents to develop an internal communication significantly closer
to natural language, in that they share a single set of messages, and that the
length of the conversation may vary according to the difficulty of the task. We
examine these properties empirically using a dataset consisting of images and
textual descriptions of mammals, where the agents are tasked with identifying
the correct object. Our experiments indicate that a robust and efficient
communication protocol emerges, where gradual information exchange informs
better predictions and higher communication bandwidth improves generalization.

Gram matrix $\Theta = \frac{1}{n} X'X$ is non-sparse, but it is approximately
the sum of two components, a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, where neither

where all but a small fraction of the entries of $\beta$ are nonzero, and the
nonzero entries are relatively small individually. The goal is to rank the
variables in a way so as to maximize the area under the ROC curve.
  We propose Factor-adjusted Covariate Assisted Ranking (FA-CAR) as a two-step
approach to variable ranking. In the FA-step, we use PCA to reduce the linear
model to a new one where the Gram matrix is approximately sparse. In the
CAR-step, we rank variables by exploiting the local covariate structures.
  FA-CAR is easy to use and computationally fast, and it is effective in
resolving signal cancellation, a challenge we face in regression models. FA-CAR
is related to the recent idea of Covariate Assisted Screening and Estimation
(CASE), but two methods are for different goals and are thus very different.
  We compare the ROC curve of FA-CAR with some other ranking ideas on numerical
experiments, and show that FA-CAR has several advantages. Using a Rare/Weak
signal model, we derive the convergence rate of the minimum sure-screening
model size of FA-CAR. Our theoretical analysis contains several new

evolution of human bipedal locomotion. The stiff and propulsive human foot has
two distinct arches, the longitudinal and transverse. By contrast, the feet of
non-human primates are flat and softer. Current understanding of foot stiffness
is based on studies that focus solely on the longitudinal arch, and little is
known about the mechanical function of the transverse arch. However, common
experience suggests that transverse curvature dominates the stiffness; a
drooping dollar bill stiffens significantly upon curling it along the
transverse direction, not the longitudinal. We derive a normalized curvature
parameter that encapsulates the geometric principle underlying the transverse
curvature-induced stiffness. We show that the transverse arch accounts for
almost all the difference in stiffness between human and monkey feet (vervet
monkeys and pig-tailed macaques) by comparing transverse curvature-based
predictions against published data on foot stiffness. Using this functional
interpretation of the transverse arch, we trace the evolution of hominin feet
and show that a human-like stiff foot likely predates Homo by $\sim 1.5$
million years, and appears in the $\sim 3.4$ million year old fossil from
Burtele. A distinctly human-like transverse arch is also present in early
members of Homo, including Homo naledi, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus.
However, the $\sim 3.2$ million year old Australopithecus afarensis is
estimated to have possessed a transitional foot, softer than humans and stiffer
than other extant primates. A foot with human-like stiffness probably evolved
around the same time as other lower limb adaptations for regular bipedality,
and well before the emergence of Homo, the longitudinal arch, and other
adaptations for endurance running.

repositories and versioned text collections --- has become an important problem
since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for
repetitive texts is $r$, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform
(BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length
FM-index, used $O(r)$ space and was able to efficiently count the number of
occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in the text (in loglogarithmic time per
pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the
positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of
$r$. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures
of repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size
of the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton
recognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating,
but not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close
this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so
that it can locate the $occ$ occurrences efficiently within $O(r)$ space (in
loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time $O(m+occ)$ within
$O(r\log(n/r))$ space, on a RAM machine of $w=\Omega(\log n)$ bits. Within
$O(r\log (n/r))$ space, our index can also count in optimal time $O(m)$.
Raising the space to $O(r w\log_\sigma(n/r))$, we support count and locate in
$O(m\log(\sigma)/w)$ and $O(m\log(\sigma)/w+occ)$ time, which is optimal in the
packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also
describe a structure using $O(r\log(n/r))$ space that replaces the text and

from a metal nanotip where its radius and geometry towards a counter electrode
determines the field distribution and the emission voltage. A higher emission
is often connected to faster electrons with smaller de Broglie wavelengths,
requiring larger pattern magnification after matter wave diffraction or

varies after emission. With a Wien filter measurement and a contrast

for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However,
model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question.
In this work, we apply a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a
Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help
explain the data. We demonstrate that our prior prevents the BNN from
under-fitting even when the number of nodes required is grossly over-estimated.
Moreover, this model selection over the number of nodes doesn't come at the
expense of predictive or computational performance; in fact, we learn smaller
networks with comparable predictive performance to current approaches.

field in the quiet Sun, where small-scale eruptions and network flares are
commonly seen. Aims: The aim of this paper is (1) to describe the
characteristics of the flows that lead to these energy releases, (2) to
quantify the energy build up due to photospheric flows acting on the magnetic
field, and (3) to assess its contribution to the energy of small-scale,
short-lived X-ray flares in the quiet Sun. Methods: We used photospheric and
X-ray data from the SoHO and Hinode spacecraft combined with tracking
algorithms to analyse the evolution of five network flares. The energy of the
X-ray emitting thermal plasma is compared with an estimate of the energy built
up due to converging and sheared flux. Results: Quiet-Sun network flares occur
above sites of converging opposite-polarity magnetic flux that are often found
on the outskirts of network cell junctions, sometimes with observable
vortex-like motion. In all studied flares the thermal energy was more than an
order of magnitude higher than the magnetic free energy of the converging flux
model. The energy in the sheared field was always higher than in the converging
flux but still lower than the thermal energy. Conclusions: X-ray network flares
occur at sites of magnetic energy dissipation. The energy is probably built up
by supergranular flows causing systematic shearing of the magnetic field. This
process appears more efficient near the junction of the network lanes. Since
this work relies on 11 case studies, our results call for a follow-up
statistical analysis to test our hypothesis throughout the quiet Sun.

generalization of the $b$-Matching and Knapsack problems. Here, we are given a
graph with vertex capacities, edge profits, and asymmetric demands on the
edges. The goal is to find a maximum-profit subset of edges so the demands of
chosen edges do not violate vertex capacities. This problem is APX-hard and
constant-factor approximations are known.
  Our results fall into two categories. First, using iterated relaxation and
various filtering strategies, we show with an efficient rounding algorithm if
an additional matroid structure $\mathcal M$ is given and we further only allow
sets $F \subseteq E$ that are independent in $\mathcal M$, the natural LP
relaxation has an integrality gap of at most $\frac{25}{3} \approx 8.333$. This
can be improved in various special cases, for example we improve over the
15-approximation for the previously-studied Coupled Placement problem [Korupolu
et al. 2014] by giving a $7$-approximation.
  Using similar techniques, we show the problem of computing a minimum-cost
base in $\mathcal M$ satisfying vertex capacities admits a $(1,3)$-bicriteria
approximation. This improves over the previous $(1,4)$-approximation in the
special case that $\mathcal M$ is the graphic matroid over the given graph
[Fukanaga and Nagamochi, 2009].
  Second, we show Demand Matching admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme
in graphs that exclude a fixed minor. If all demands are polynomially-bounded
integers, this is somewhat easy using dynamic programming in bounded-treewidth
graphs. Our main technical contribution is a sparsification lemma allowing us
to scale the demands to be used in a more intricate dynamic programming
algorithm, followed by randomized rounding to filter our scaled-demand solution
to a feasible solution.

quadratic equations of the form $y_i=|\langle{a}_i,x\rangle|^2$ for $1\le i \le
m$, which is also known as phase retrieval and is NP-hard in general. We put
forth a novel procedure for minimizing the amplitude-based least-squares
empirical loss, that starts with a weighted maximal correlation initialization
obtainable with a few power or Lanczos iterations, followed by successive
refinements based upon a sequence of iteratively reweighted (generalized)
gradient iterations. The two (both the initialization and gradient flow) stages
distinguish themselves from prior contributions by the inclusion of a fresh
(re)weighting regularization technique. The overall algorithm is conceptually
simple, numerically scalable, and easy-to-implement. For certain random
measurement models, the novel procedure is shown capable of finding the true
solution $x$ in time proportional to reading the data $\{(a_i;y_i)\}_{1\le i
\le m}$. This holds with high probability and without extra assumption on the
signal $x$ to be recovered, provided that the number $m$ of equations is some
constant $c>0$ times the number $n$ of unknowns in the signal vector, namely,
$m>cn$. Empirically, the upshots of this contribution are: i) (almost) $100\%$
perfect signal recovery in the high-dimensional (say e.g., $n\ge 2,000$) regime
given only an information-theoretic limit number of noiseless equations,
namely, $m=2n-1$ in the real-valued Gaussian case; and, ii) (nearly) optimal
statistical accuracy in the presence of additive noise of bounded support.
Finally, substantial numerical tests using both synthetic data and real images
corroborate markedly improved signal recovery performance and computational
efficiency of our novel procedure relative to state-of-the-art approaches.

synchronization in networks with random communication delays, measurement noise
and communication dropouts. Three different types of the drift correction
algorithm are introduced, based on different kinds of local time increments.
Under nonrestrictive conditions concerning network properties, it is proved
that all the algorithm types provide convergence in the mean square sense and
with probability one (w.p.1) of the corrected drifts of all the nodes to the
same value (consensus). An estimate of the convergence rate of these algorithms
is derived. For offset correction, a new algorithm is proposed containing a
compensation parameter coping with the influence of random delays and special
terms taking care of the influence of both linearly increasing time and drift
correction. It is proved that the corrected offsets of all the nodes converge
in the mean square sense and w.p.1. An efficient offset correction algorithm
based on consensus on local compensation parameters is also proposed. It is
shown that the overall time synchronization algorithm can also be implemented
as a flooding algorithm with one reference node. It is proved that it is
possible to achieve bounded error between local corrected clocks in the mean
square sense and w.p.1. Simulation results provide an additional practical
insight into the algorithm properties and show its advantage over the existing
methods.

encoding method in two ways. First, we present ""discriminative rank pooling"" in
which the shared weights of our video representation and the parameters of the
action classifiers are estimated jointly for a given training dataset of
labelled vector sequences using a bilevel optimization formulation of the
learning problem. When the frame level features vectors are obtained from a
convolutional neural network (CNN), we rank pool the network activations and
jointly estimate all parameters of the model, including CNN filters and
fully-connected weights, in an end-to-end manner which we coined as ""end-to-end
trainable rank pooled CNN"". Importantly, this model can make use of any
existing convolutional neural network architecture (e.g., AlexNet or VGG)
without modification or introduction of additional parameters. Then, we extend
rank pooling to a high capacity video representation, called ""hierarchical rank
pooling"". Hierarchical rank pooling consists of a network of rank pooling
functions, which encode temporal semantics over arbitrary long video clips
based on rich frame level features. By stacking non-linear feature functions
and temporal sub-sequence encoders one on top of the other, we build a high
capacity encoding network of the dynamic behaviour of the video. The resulting
video representation is a fixed-length feature vector describing the entire
video clip that can be used as input to standard machine learning classifiers.

an in-depth understanding of such dielectric effects is required. We report on
the modulations of excitonic transitions in TMD-MLs through the effect of
dielectric environments including low-k and high-k dielectric materials. We
present absolute tuning ranges as large as 37 meV for the optical band gaps of
WSe 2 and MoSe 2 MLs and relative tuning ranges on the order of 30% for the
binding energies of neutral excitons in WSe 2 MLs. The findings suggest the
possibility to reduce the electronic band gap of WSe 2 MLs by 120 meV, paving
the way towards dielectrically defined lateral heterojunctions.

do not arise in time-invariant Gaussian signals. The most commonly used of
these employ the bispectrum. Recently, other measures of cross-frequency
dependence have drawn interest in EEG literature, in particular those which
address phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Here we demonstrate a close
relationship between the bispectrum and popular measures of PAC, which we
relate to smoothings of the signal bispectrum, making them fundamentally
bispectral estimators. Viewed this way, however, conventional PAC measures
exhibit some unfavorable qualities, including poor bias properties, lack of
correct symmetry and artificial constraints on the spectral range and
resolution of the estimate. Moreover, information obscured by smoothing in
measures of PAC, but preserved in standard bispectral estimators, may be
critical for distinguishing nested oscillations from transient signal features
and other non-oscillatory causes of ""spurious"" PAC. We propose guidelines for
gauging the nature and origin of cross-frequency coupling with bispectral
statistics. Beyond clarifying the relationship between PAC and the bispectrum,
the present work lays out a general framework for the interpretation of the
bispectrum, which extends to other higher-order spectra. In particular, this
framework holds promise for the detailed identification of signal features
related to both nested oscillations and transient phenomena. We conclude with a
discussion of some broader theoretical implications of this framework and

circuitry design as a binary constrained optimization problem. We use
CoilDesigner, a simulation and design tool of air to refrigerant heat
exchangers, in order to simulate the performance of different refrigerant
circuitry designs. We treat CoilDesigner as a black-box system since the exact
relationship of the objective function with the decision variables is not
explicit. Derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms are suitable for
solving this black-box model since they do not require explicit functional
representations of the objective function and the constraints. The aim of this
paper is twofold. First, we compare four mixed-integer constrained DFO solvers

formulation is suitable for optimizing the circuitry configuration of heat
exchangers. We apply the DFO solvers to 17 heat exchanger design problems.

in health- and child-care settings, with serial outbreaks also frequently
observed aboard cruise ships. The relative contributions of environmental and
direct person-to-person transmission of norovirus has hitherto not been
quantified. Objective: We employ a novel mathematical model of norovirus
transmission, and fit the model to daily incidence data from a major norovirus
outbreak on a cruise ship, and examine the relative efficacy of potential
control strategies aimed at reducing environmental and/or direct transmission.
Results: The reproduction number for environmental and direct transmission
combined is Rtot = 11.0 [9.4,15.6], and of environmental transmission alone is
Renviron = 0.85 [0.18,2.04]. Direct transmission is overwhelmingly due to 0
passenger-to-passenger contacts, but crew can act as a reservoir of infection
from cruise-to-cruise. Implications: This is the first quantification of the
relative roles of environmental and direct transmission of norovirus. While
environmental transmission has the potential to maintain a sustained series of
outbreaks aboard a cruise ship in the absence of strict sanitation practices,
direct transmission dominates. Quarantine of ill passengers and cleaning are
likely to have little impact on final outbreak size, but intensive promotion of
good hand washing practices can prevent outbreaks.

method to transfer pretrained deep representations to unseen domains. Our
method is easy to implement and can be viewed as an effective baseline for
unsupervised re-ID feature learning. Specifically, PUL iterates between 1)
pedestrian clustering and 2) fine-tuning of the convolutional neural network
(CNN) to improve the original model trained on the irrelevant labeled dataset.
Since the clustering results can be very noisy, we add a selection operation
between the clustering and fine-tuning. At the beginning when the model is
weak, CNN is fine-tuned on a small amount of reliable examples which locate
near to cluster centroids in the feature space. As the model becomes stronger
in subsequent iterations, more images are being adaptively selected as CNN
training samples. Progressively, pedestrian clustering and the CNN model are
improved simultaneously until algorithm convergence. This process is naturally
formulated as self-paced learning. We then point out promising directions that
may lead to further improvement. Extensive experiments on three large-scale

X-ray properties. Even if a small fraction ($10-20\%$) of the total mechanical
power is injected into CRs, a significant fraction of the ram pressure at the
reverse shock can be transferred to CRs. The energy transfer becomes efficient

the goal is to verify that $A \times B=C$ without carrying out the
computationally costly operations of matrix multiplication and comparing the
product $A \times B$ with $C$, term by term. This is especially important when
some or all of these matrices are very large, and when the computing
environment is prone to soft errors. Here we extend Freivalds' algorithm to a
Gaussian Variant of Freivalds' Algorithm (GVFA) by projecting the product $A
\times B$ as well as $C$ onto a Gaussian random vector and then comparing the
resulting vectors. The computational complexity of GVFA is consistent with that
of Freivalds' algorithm, which is $O(n^{2})$. However, unlike Freivalds'
algorithm, whose probability of a false positive is $2^{-k}$, where $k$ is the
number of iterations. Our theoretical analysis shows that when $A \times B \neq

arithmetic. When we introduce round-off error and floating point arithmetic
into our analysis, we can show that the larger this error, the higher the
probability that GVFA avoids false positives. Moreover, by iterating GVFA $k$
times, the probability of a false positive decreases as $p^k$, where $p$ is a
very small value depending on the nature of the fault on the result matrix and
the arithmetic system's floating-point precision. Unlike deterministic

  Crowdsource Data","41 pages, 19 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has seen a
breakthrough progress in natural image recognition because of three points:
universal approximation ability via DCNN, large-scale database (such as
ImageNet), and supercomputing ability powered by GPU. The remote sensing field
is still lacking a large-scale benchmark compared to ImageNet and Place2. In
this paper, we propose a remote sensing image classification benchmark (RSI-CB)
based on massive, scalable, and diverse crowdsource data. Using crowdsource
data, such as Open Street Map (OSM) data, ground objects in remote sensing
images can be annotated effectively by points of interest, vector data from
OSM, or other crowdsource data. The annotated images can be used in remote
sensing image classification tasks. Based on this method, we construct a
worldwide large-scale benchmark for remote sensing image classification. This
benchmark has two sub-datasets with 256 by 256 and 128 by 128 sizes because
different DCNNs require different image sizes. The former contains 6 categories
with 35 subclasses of more than 24,000 images. The latter contains 6 categories
with 45 subclasses of more than 36,000 images. This classification system of
ground objects is defined according to the national standard of land-use
classification in China and is inspired by the hierarchy mechanism of ImageNet.
Finally, we conduct many experiments to compare RSI-CB with the SAT-4, SAT-6,
and UC-Merced datasets on handcrafted features, such as scale-invariant feature
transform, color histogram, local binary patterns, and GIST, and classical DCNN
models, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

system. The Deep-LMS is important for crosstalk cancellation in the novel

described by a mixed quantum state but not a pure quantum state. Although there
are some attempts to clarify the complementarity principle for mixed quantum
systems, it is still unclear how the mixedness affects the complementary
relation. Here, we give a ternary complementary relation (TCR) among wave,
particle and mixedness aspects for arbitrary multi-state systems, which are
respectively quantified by the $l_1$ measure for quantum coherence, the
which-path predictability, and the linear entropy. In particular, we show how a
WWD can transform entropy into predictability and coherence. Through modifying
the POVM (positive-operator valued measure) measurement on WWD, our TCR can be
simplified as the wave-mixedness and particle-mixedness duality relations.

relevant high-density domain, which reaches beyond the saturation density of
symmetrical nuclear matter. These issues include uncertainties in the
three-nucleon (3N) interaction and in the effects of strong short-range

self-energies and interactions. A survey of existing solutions to the gap
equations in the triplet channel shows that the separate or combined impacts of
3N forces, coupled channels, and mass renormalization range from moderate to
strong to devastating, thus motivating a detailed analysis of the competing
effects. In the present work we track the effects of the 3N force and in-medium
modifications in the representative case of the $^3P_2$ channel, based on the
Argonne V18 two-nucleon (2N) interaction supplemented by 3N interactions of the
Urbana IX family. Sensitivity of the results to the input interaction is
clearly demonstrated, while consistency issues arise with respect to the
simultaneous treatment of 3N forces and in-medium effects. We consider this
pilot study as the first step towards a systematic and comprehensive

of Internet of Things (IoT) vision. M2M solutions allow billions of multi-role
devices to communicate with each other or with the underlying data transport
infrastructure without, or with minimal, human intervention. Current solutions
for wireless transmissions originally designed for human-based applications
thus require a substantial shift to cope with the capacity issues in managing a
huge amount of M2M devices. In this paper, we consider the multiple access
techniques as promising solutions to support a large number of devices in
cellular systems with limited radio resources. We focus on non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) where, with the aim to increase the channel efficiency,
the devices share the same radio resources for their data transmission. This
has been shown to provide optimal throughput from an information theoretic
point of view.We consider a realistic system model and characterise the system
performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency in a NOMA scenario
with a random packet arrival model, where we also derive the stability
condition for the system to guarantee the performance.

that the orthogonality of eigenmodes and the unitary phase relation of the

approximating the neural activation extent by thresholds of the field solution.
Methods: Open-source solutions for solving the field equation in volume
conductor models of deep brain stimulation and computing the neural activation
are embedded into a Python package to estimate the neural activation dependent
on the dielectric tissue properties and axon parameters by employing a
spatially adaptive scheme. Feasibility of the approximation of the neural
activation extent by field thresholds is investigated to further reduce the
computational expense. Results: The varying extents of neural activation for
different patient-specific dielectric properties were estimated with the
adaptive scheme. The results revealed the strong influence of the dielectric
properties of the encapsulation layer in the acute and chronic phase after
surgery. The computational time required to determine the neural activation
extent in each studied model case was substantially reduced. Conclusion: The
neural activation extent is altered by patient-specific parameters. Threshold
values of the electric potential and electric field norm facilitate a
computationally efficient method to estimate the neural activation extent.
Significance: The presented adaptive scheme is able to robustly determine
neural activation extents and field threshold estimates for varying dielectric
tissue properties and axon diameters while reducing substantially the

from $^{2}E_{g}$-state to $^{2}A_{2u}$-state where the corresponding
$a_{2u}$-level lies deeply inside the diamond valence band. Therefore, the
transition is broadened by the diamond band. At higher excitation power of 10
mW we indicate signs of a parity-conserving transition at ~2.03 eV supported by
saturation measurements. For GeV$^{-}$ we demonstrate that the PLE spectrum is
in good agreement with the mirror image of the PL spectrum of the zero-phonon

a transition wavelength of 460 nm. The observed PL spectra are identical,
independent of excitation wavelength, suggesting a rapid decay to $^{2}E_{u}$

paradigm we are going to call Quantum Low Entropy based Associative Reasoning
or QLEAR learning. The approach is based on the idea that classification can be
understood as supervised clustering, where a quantum entropy in the context of
the quantum probabilistic model, will be used as a ""capturer"" (measure, or
external index), of the ""natural structure"" of the data. By using quantum
entropy we do not make any assumption about linear separability of the data
that are going to be classified. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a
query sample and then use relative change in the quantum entropy as a measure
of similarity of the newly arrived sample with the representatives of interest.
In other words, method is based on calculation of quantum entropy of the
referent system and its relative change with the addition of the newly arrived
sample. Referent system consists of vectors that represent individual classes
and that are the most similar, in Euclidean distance sense, to the vector that
is analyzed. Here, we analyze the classification problem in the context of
measuring similarities to prototype examples of categories. While nearest
neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem
of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited
sampling. Alternatively, one could use machine learning techniques (like
support vector machines) but they involve time-consuming optimization. Here we
propose a hybrid of nearest neighbor and machine learning technique which deals
naturally with the multi-class setting, has reasonable computational complexity
both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice.

response of the other two polymorphs to hydrostatic pressure is non isotropic.
Additionally we found that at all pressures beta MgSO4 has a largest enthalpy
than alpha MgSO4. This indicates that beta MgSO4 is thermodynamically unstable
versus alpha MgSO4 and predicts the occurrence of a beta alpha phase transition
under moderate compression. Our calculations also predict the existence under
pressure of additional phase transitions to two new polymorphs of MgSO4, which
we named as delta MgSO4 and epsilon MgSO4. The alpha delta transition is
predicted to occur at 17.5 GPa, and the delta epsilon transition at 35 GPa,
pressures that nowadays can be experimentally easily achieved. All the
predicted structural transforma ions are characterized as first order
transitions. This suggests that they can be non reversible, and therefore the
new polymorphs could be recovered as metastable polymorphs at ambient
conditions. The crystal structure of the two new polymorphs is reported. In
them, the coordination number of sulfur is four as in the previously known
polymorphs, but the coordination number of magnesium is eight instead of six.

discriminative model, aiming to mine signals from labelled and unlabelled data,
provides guidance to train the generative model towards fitting the underlying

generates difficult examples for the discriminative model in an adversarial way

over documents via the signals from the discriminative model, and (ii) the
discriminative model is able to exploit the unlabelled data selected by the
generative model to achieve a better estimation for document ranking. Our

ground-based adaptive-optics camera SPHERE at ESO VLT allows us to assess, for
the very first time, the cratering record of medium-sized (D~100-200 km)
asteroids from the ground, opening the prospect of a new era of investigation
of the asteroid belt's collisional history. Aims. We investigate here the
collisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may
be the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites
found on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as
part of the science verification of the instrument. Combined with earlier
adaptive-optics images and optical light curves, we model the spin and
three-dimensional (3D) shape of Hebe and check the consistency of the derived
model against available stellar occultations and thermal measurements. Results.
Our 3D shape model fits the images with sub-pixel residuals and the light
curves to 0.02 mag. The rotation period (7.274 47 h), spin (343 deg,+47 deg),
and volume-equivalent diameter (193 +/- 6km) are consistent with previous
determinations and thermophysical modeling. Hebe's inferred density is 3.48 +/-
0.64 g.cm-3 , in agreement with an intact interior based on its H-chondrite
composition. Using the 3D shape model to derive the volume of the largest
depression (likely impact crater), it appears that the latter is significantly
smaller than the total volume of close-by S-type H-chondrite-like asteroid
families. Conclusions. Our results imply that (6) Hebe is not the most likely
source of H chondrites. Over the coming years, our team will collect similar
high-precision shape measurements with VLT/SPHERE for ~40 asteroids covering
the main compositional classes, thus providing an unprecedented dataset to
investigate the origin and collisional evolution of the asteroid belt.

in models of stellar dynamos. Thanks to helioseismology, rotation in the Sun is
characterized well, but the interior rotation profiles of other Sun-like stars
are not so well constrained. Until recently, measurements of rotation in
Sun-like stars have focused on the mean rotation, but little progress has been
made on measuring or even placing limits on differential rotation. Using
asteroseismic measurements of rotation we aim to constrain the radial shear in
five Sun-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission: KIC004914923,
KIC005184732, KIC006116048, KIC006933899, and KIC010963065. We used stellar
structure models for these five stars from previous works. These models provide
the mass density, mode eigenfunctions, and the convection zone depth, which we
used to compute the sensitivity kernels for the rotational frequency splitting
of the modes. We used these kernels as weights in a parametric model of the
stellar rotation profile of each star, where we allowed different rotation
rates for the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This parametric
model was incorporated into a fit to the oscillation power spectrum of each of
the five Kepler stars. This fit included a prior on the rotation of the
envelope, estimated from the rotation of surface magnetic activity measured
from the photometric variability. The asteroseismic measurements without the
application of priors are unable to place meaningful limits on the radial
shear. Using a prior on the envelope rotation enables us to constrain the
interior rotation rate and thus the radial shear. In the five cases that we
studied, the interior rotation rate does not differ from the envelope by more
than approximately +/-30%. Uncertainties in the rotational splittings are too
large to unambiguously determine the sign of the radial shear.

is bounded. This conjecture was supported by several result, most notably by a
result of Csirmaz and Ligeti saying that the complexity of graphs with girth at
least six and no neighboring high degree vertices is strictly below 2. In this
paper we refute the above conjecture. First, a family of $d$-regular graphs is
defined iteratively such that the complexity of these graphs is the largest
possible $(d+1)/2$ allowed by Stinson's bound. This part extends earlier
results of van Dijk and Blundo et al, and uses the so-called entropy method.
Second, using combinatorial arguments, we show that this family contains graphs
with arbitrary large girth. In particular, we obtain the following purely
combinatorial result, which might be interesting on its own: there are
$d$-regular graphs with arbitrary large girth such that any fractional
edge-cover by stars (or by complete multipartite graphs) must cover some vertex

emission, focusing on the galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and star
formation efficiencies (SFEs). Our sample is composed of the 260 ETGs from the
ATLAS3D survey, from which we use the cold gas measurements (HI and CO). The
SFRs are estimated from stellar, PAH and dust fits to spectral energy
distributions created from new AKARI measurements and literature data from WISE
and 2MASS. The mid-infrared luminosities of non-CO-detected galaxies are well
correlated with their stellar luminosities, showing that they trace
(circum)stellar dust emission. CO-detected galaxies show an excess above these
correlations, uncorrelated with their stellar luminosities, indicating that
they likely contain PAHs and dust of interstellar origin. PAH and dust
luminosities of CO-detected galaxies show tight correlations with their
molecular gas masses, and the derived current SFRs are typically 0.01-1
Msun/yr. These SFRs systematically decrease with stellar age at fixed stellar
mass, while they correlate nearly linearly with stellar mass at fixed age. The
majority of local ETGs follow the same star-formation law as local star-forming
galaxies, and their current SFEs do not depend on either stellar mass or age.
Our results clearly indicate that molecular gas is fueling current star
formation in local ETGs, that appear to acquire this gas via mechanisms
regulated primarily by stellar mass. The current SFEs of local ETGs are similar
to those of local star-forming galaxies, indicating that their low SFRs are
likely due to smaller cold gas fractions rather than a suppression of star
formation.

Lillicrap et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in
high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting.
  We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first general-purpose
policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees
for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to
train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making
guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are
based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a
bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence
between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated
robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by
safety.

L5 region of Mars could have formed in a collision. We estimate the size
distribution index from available information on family members; model the
orbital dispersion of collisional fragments; and carry out a formal calculation
of the collisional lifetime as a function of size. We find that, as initially
conjectured by Rivkin et al (2003), the collisional lifetime of objects the
size of (5261) Eureka is at least a few Gyr, significantly longer than for
similar-sized Main Belt asteroids. In contrast, the observed degree of orbital
compactness is inconsistent with all but the least energetic family-forming
collisions. Therefore, the family asteroids may be ejecta from a cratering
event sometime in the past ~1 Gyr if the orbits are gradually dispersed by
gravitational diffusion and the Yarkovsky effect (Cuk et al, 2015). The
comparable sizes of the largest family members require either negligible target
strength or a particular impact geometry under this scenario (Durda et al,
2007; Benavidez et al, 2012). Alternatively, the family may have formed by a
series of YORP-induced fission events (Pravec.et.al, 2010). The shallow size
distribution of the family is similar to that of small MBAs (Gladman et al,
2009) interpreted as due to the dominance of this mechanism for
Eureka-family-sized asteroids (Jacobson et al, 2014). However, our population
index estimate is likely a lower limit due to the small available number of
family asteroids and observational incompleteness. Future searches for fainter
family members, further observational characterisation of the known Trojans'
physical properties as well as orbital and rotational evolution modelling will
help distinguish between different formation models.

enforcement of boundary conditions. Recently, there has been an increasing
interest in generalised SBP operators both in the finite difference and the
discontinuous Galerkin spectral element framework. However, if generalised SBP
operators are used, the treatment of the boundaries becomes more difficult
since some properties of the continuous level are no longer mimicked discretely
--- interpolating the product of two functions will in general result in a
value different from the product of the interpolations. Thus, desired
properties such as conservation and stability are more difficult to obtain.
Here, new formulations are proposed, allowing the creation of discretisations
using general SBP operators that are both conservative and stable. Thus,
several shortcomings that might be attributed to generalised SBP operators are

suggested by observations and theoretical arguments, as a consequence of
intrinsic properties of the central engine (accretion disc + black hole) and
external medium. On the other hand, the one-component jet approaches are
heavily challenged by the various observed properties of plasmoids in radio
jets (knots), often associated with internal shocks. Given that such a
transverse stratification plays an important role on the jets acceleration,
stability, and interaction with the external medium, it should also induce
internal shocks with various strengths and configurations, able to describe the
observed knots behaviours. By establishing a relation between the transverse
stratification of the jets, the internal shock properties, and the multiple
observed AGN jet morphologies and behaviours, our aim is to provide a
consistent global scheme of the various AGN jet structures. Working on a large
sample of AGN radio jets monitored in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
by the MOJAVE collaboration, we determined the consistency of a systematic
association of the multiple knots with successive re-collimation shocks. We
then investigated the re-collimation shock formation and the influence of
different transverse stratified structures by parametrically exploring the two
relativistic outflow components with the specific relativistic hydrodynamic
(SRHD) code AMRVAC. We were able to link the different spectral classes of AGN
with specific stratified jet characteristics, in good accordance with their

function. The dependence of the number of quasars on the redshift, both in the

boundary in the Schechter function. The normalization of the truncated
Schechter function is forced to be the same as that for the Schechter function,
and an analytical form for the average value is derived. Three astrophysical
applications for QSOs are provided: deduction of the parameters at low
redshifts, behavior of the average absolute magnitude at high redshifts, and
the location (in redshift) of the photometric maximum as a function of the
selected apparent magnitude. The truncated Schechter function with the double
power law and an improved Schechter function are compared as luminosity

most sparsity-based approaches use a single dictionary in focused feature space

the patches from a given training set can be sparsely represented by a couple
of overcomplete dictionaries related to the focused and blurred categories of
images and that a sparse approximation based on such coupled dictionary leads
to a more flexible and therefore better fusion strategy than the one based on
just selecting the sparsest representation in the original image estimate. In
addition, to improve the fusion performance, we employ a coupled dictionary
learning approach that enforces pairwise correlation between atoms of
dictionaries learned to represent the focused and blurred feature spaces. We
also discuss the advantages of the fusion approach based on coupled dictionary
learning, and present efficient algorithms for fusion based on coupled

the strongly interacting regime where the scattering length between fermions is
on the same order as the inter-particle spacing, the pairing energy in the
normal phase significantly exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the
system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing
in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body

method to transform coding schemes based on linear rank-metric codes, with
certain properties, to schemes with lower communication overheads. By applying
this method to pairs of Gabidulin codes, we obtain coding schemes with optimal
information rate with respect to their security and rank error correction
capability, and with universally optimal communication overheads, when $ n \leq

guarantee that any Eve interacting with her interface of the resource obtains a
(quantum) system $E$ such that the conditional (smooth) min-entropy of $X$
given $E$ is lower bounded by some $k$. This (abstract) resource specification
encompasses any setting that results in the honest players holding such a
string (or aborting). For example, it could be constructed from, e.g., noisy
channels, quantum key distribution (QKD), or a violation of Bell inequalities,
which all may be used to derive bounds on the min-entropy of $X$.
  As a first application, we use this min-entropy resource to modularize key
distribution (KD) schemes by dividing them in two parts, which may be analyzed
separately. In the first part, a KD protocol constructs a min-entropy resource
given the (physical) resources available in the specific setting considered. In
the second, it distills secret key from the min-entropy resource---i.e., it
constructs a secret key resource. We prove security for a generic key
distillation protocol that may use any min-entropy resource. Since the notion
of resource construction is composable---security of a composed protocol
follows from the security of its parts--- this reduces proving security of a KD
protocol (e.g., QKD) to proving that it constructs a min-entropy resource.
  As a second application, we provide a composable security proof for the
recent Fehr-Salvail protocol [EUROCRYPT 2017] that authenticates classical
messages with a quantum message authentication code (Q-MAC), and recycles all
the key upon successfully verifying the authenticity of the message. This
protocol uses (and recycles) a non-uniform key, which we model as consuming and

the absence of net magnetization and stray fields eliminates crosstalk between
neighbouring devices and the absence of a primary macroscopic magnetization

exceedingly high magnetic fields, and antiferromagnetic order cannot be

special features that preclude a naive direct evaluation of these corrections,
so we follow two different approaches. The first one exploits that the BTZ
black hole belongs to the spectrum of Brown-Henneaux as well as soft hairy
boundary conditions, so that the respective log corrections are related through
a suitable change of the thermodynamic ensemble. In the second approach the
analogue of modular invariance is considered for dual theories with anisotropic
scaling of Lifshitz type with dynamical exponent z at the boundary. On the
gravity side such scalings arise for KdV-type boundary conditions, which
provide a specific 1-parameter family of multi-trace deformations of the usual
AdS3/CFT2 setup, with Brown-Henneaux corresponding to z=1 and soft hairy
boundary conditions to the limiting case z=0. Both approaches agree in the case
of BTZ black holes for any non-negative z. Finally, for soft hairy boundary
conditions we show that not only the leading term, but also the log corrections
to the entropy of black flowers endowed with affine u(1) soft hair charges
exclusively depend on the zero modes and hence coincide with the ones for BTZ
black holes.

uncertain inputs to be presented in a statistically meaningful manner. However,
these uncertainties are currently computed assuming no correlations between the
physical quantities that enter those calculations. This is not always an
appropriate assumption. Astrophysically important reactions are often dominated
by resonances, whose properties are usually normalized to a well-known
reference resonance. This insight provides a basis from which to develop a
flexible framework for including correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate
calculations. Aims. The aim of this work is to develop and test a method for
including correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate calculations when the input
has been normalized to a common reference. Methods. A mathematical framework is
developed for including correlations between input parameters in Monte Carlo
reaction rate calculations. The magnitude of those correlations is calculated
from the uncertainties typically reported in experimental papers, where full
correlation information is not available. The method is applied to four
illustrative examples: a fictional 3-resonance reaction,
$^{27}$Al(p,$\gamma$)$^{28}$Si, $^{23}$Na(p,$\alpha$)$^{20}$Ne, and
$^{23}$Na($\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al. Results. Reaction rates at low temperatures
that are dominated by a few isolated resonances are found to minimally impacted
by correlation effects. However, reaction rates determined from many
overlapping resonances can be significantly affected. Uncertainties in the
$^{23}$Na($\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al reaction, for example, increase by up to a
factor of 5. This highlights the need to take correlation effects into account
in reaction rate calculations, and provide insight into which cases are
expected to be most affected by them. The impact of correlation effects on
nucleosynthesis is also investigated.

extracted from data on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) using
the simplifying assumption that it is proportional to the Sivers function for
that flavour. In a recent paper we suggested that the consistency of this
assumption could be tested using information on so-called difference
asymmetries, i.e. the difference between the asymmetries in the production of
particles and their anti-particles.
  In this paper, using the SIDIS COMPASS deuteron data on the
$\langle\cos\phi_h\rangle$, $\langle\cos 2 \phi_h\rangle$ and Sivers difference
asymmetries, we carry out two independent consistency tests of the assumption
of proportionality, but here applied to the sum of the valence-quark
contributions. We find that such an assumption is compatible with the data. We
also show that the proportionality assumptions made in the existing
parametrizations of the BM functions are not compatible with our analysis,
which suggests that the published results for the Boer-Mulders functions for
individual flavours are unreliable.
  The $\langle\cos\phi_h\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 2 \phi_h\rangle$ asymmetries
receive contributions also from the, in principle, calculable Cahn effect. We
succeed in extracting the Cahn contributions from experiment (we believe for
the first time) and compare with their calculated values, with interesting
implications.

the two-time nonequilibrium Green's functions technique to calculate the
time-dependent electron current flowing across the devices. We find that
whenever a sudden change occurs in the device, the current takes time to react
to the abrupt change, overshoots, oscillates, and eventually settles down to a
steady value. With dynamical electron-phonon interactions, the interaction
gives rise to a net resistance that reduces the flow of current across the
device when a source-drain bias potential is attached. In the presence of
dynamical electron-photon interactions, the photons drive the electrons to
flow. The direction of flow, however, depends on the frequencies of the
incident photons. Furthermore, the direction of electron flow in one lead is
exactly opposite to the direction of flow in the other lead thereby resulting
in no net change in current flowing across the device.

framework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all
stakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage
re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric
variables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad

the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia

validate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the
publisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by
slightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers

and studied numerically on scale free networks with power-law degree ($k$)
distribution, {\em i.e.}: $P_k\sim k^{-\alpha}$. In this model, upon toppling
of a critical node sand grains are given one to each of the neighbouring nodes
with highest and lowest degrees instead of two randomly selected neighbouring
nodes as in a stochastic sandpile model. The critical behaviour of the model is
determined by characterizing various avalanche properties at the steady state
varying the network structure from scale free to random, tuning $\alpha$ from
$2$ to $5$. The model exhibits mean field scaling on the random networks,
$\alpha>4$. However, in the scale free regime, $2<\alpha<4$, the scaling
behaviour of the model not only deviates from the mean-field scaling but also
the exponents describing the scaling behaviour are found to decrease
continuously as $\alpha$ decreases. In this regime, the critical exponents of
the present model are found to be different from those of the two state
stochastic sandpile model on similar networks. The preferential sand
distribution thus has non-trivial effects on the sandpile dynamics which leads
the model to a new universality class.

to the need for jointly learning underlying correlations between heterogeneous

to more accurately interpret the visual semantics, e.g. disclosing meaningful
visual groups with similar high-level concepts, and recovering missing tags for

our model is able to discover more accurate semantic correlation between

example of possible uses, UCLCHEM is used to explore the effect of protostellar
collapse on commonly observed molecules and to study the behaviour of molecules
in C-type shocks. We find the collapse of a simple Bonnor-Ebert sphere
successfully reproduces most of the behaviour of CO,CS and NH$_3$ from cores
observed by \citet{Tafalla2004} but cannot predict the behaviour of N$_2$H$^+$.
In the C-shock application, we find that molecules can be categorized so that
they can be useful observational tracers of shocks and their physical
properties. Whilst many molecules are enhanced in shocked gas, we identify two
groups of molecules in particular. A small number of molecules are enhanced by
the sputtering of the ices as the shock propagates and then remain high in
abundance throughout the shock. A second, larger set are also enhanced by
sputtering but then are destroyed as the gas temperature rises. Through these
applications the general applicability of UCLCHEM is demonstrated.

mechanics (wave mechanics) reproduces Newton laws of motion in terms of
expectation values. Remarkably, the contrary is considered elusive and, indeed,
many authors have tried to obtain wave mechanics starting from other
alternative frameworks of classical mechanics (for instance, Hamilton-Jacobi
theory). Despite this common opinion, we present here a simple method to make
Newtonian dynamics develop naturally into Schrodinger representation. The proof
is based on the assumption of matter waves and is laid out in three fundamental
steps. First, the role of classical density functions is underlined in view of
their use to define constants of the motion for massive particles. Thanks to
this preparatory step, density functions generate wave functions whose spatial
and time variables obey Newton laws of motion. The resulting wave equation is
defined in dependence on a parameter that plays the identical role of the
constant K introduced by Schrodinger in the original formulation of his theory.
In the final step, the classical wave equation is treated under the hypothesis
of conservative forces common to the Eherenfest theorem and, after some
algebra, the Schrodinger equation emerges by means of the identification of the
classical momentum with de Broglie momentum of matter waves.

and subsequent contributions by J. Bourgain and H. Queffelec that successively
improved lower estimates on $\mathcal{S}$. These articles rely on a link to the
theory of power sums of complex numbers. A probabilistic or number theoretic
analysis of such inequalities is employed to prove the existence of $T$ with
growing $\mathcal{S}$ but the explicit construction of such $T$ remains an open

also obtain new upper estimates on the resolvent when the spectrum is given.
This yields new upper bounds on $\left\Vert T^{-1}\right\Vert$ in terms of the
eigenvalues of $T$ which slightly refine Schaeffer's original estimate.

energies can be obtained using various sophisticated electronic structure
methods that can now be applied to periodic systems. The adsorption energy of
water on boron nitride substrates, going from zero to 2-dimensional
periodicity, is particularly interesting as it calls for an accurate treatment
of polarizable electrostatics and dispersion interactions, as well as posing a
practical challenge to experiments and electronic structure methods. Here, we
present reference adsorption energies, static polarizabilities, and dynamic
polarizabilities, for water on BN substrates of varying size and dimension.
Adsorption energies are computed with coupled cluster theory, fixed-node
quantum Monte Carlo (FNQMC), the random phase approximation (RPA), and second
order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) theory. These explicitly correlated methods are
found to agree in molecular as well as periodic systems. The best estimate of
the water/h-BN adsorption energy is $-107\pm7$ meV from FNQMC. In addition, the
water adsorption energy on the BN substrates could be expected to grow
monotonically with the size of the substrate due to increased dispersion
interactions but interestingly, this is not the case here. This peculiar
finding is explained using the static polarizabilities and molecular dispersion
coefficients of the systems, as computed from time-dependent density functional
theory (DFT). Dynamic as well as static polarizabilities are found to be highly
anisotropic in these systems. In addition, the many-body dispersion method in
DFT emerges as a particularly useful estimation of finite size effects for
other expensive, many-body wavefunction based methods.

order ~30 have been observed for dielectrics. We present the first ab-initio
multi-scale simulation of solid-state high-harmonic generation. We find that
mesoscopic effects of the extended system, in particular the realistic sampling
of the entire Brillouin zone, the pulse propagation in the dense medium, and
the inhomogeneous illumination of the crystal have a strong effect on the
formation of clean harmonic spectra. Our results provide a novel explanation
for the formation of clean harmonics and have implications for a wide range of
non-linear optical processes in dense media.

The area has received extensive attention over four decades, but many problems
remain unsolved, especially for directed graphs. A directed graph is
2-edge-connected (resp., 2-vertex-connected) if the removal of any edge (resp.,
vertex) leaves the graph strongly connected. In this paper we present improved
algorithms for computing the maximal 2-edge- and 2-vertex-connected subgraphs
of a given directed graph. These problems were first studied more than 35 years
ago, with $\widetilde{O}(mn)$ time algorithms for graphs with m edges and n
vertices being known since the late 1980s. In contrast, the same problems for
undirected graphs are known to be solvable in linear time. Henzinger et al.
[ICALP 2015] recently introduced $O(n^2)$ time algorithms for the directed
case, thus improving the running times for dense graphs. Our new algorithms run
in time $O(m^{3/2})$, which further improves the running times for sparse
graphs.
  The notion of 2-connectivity naturally generalizes to k-connectivity for
$k>2$. For constant values of k, we extend one of our algorithms to compute the
maximal k-edge-connected in time $O(m^{3/2} \log{n})$, improving again for
sparse graphs the best known algorithm by Henzinger et al. [ICALP 2015] that
runs in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.

sky density based association methods and, using one or more priors (e.g.,
colors, magnitudes), weights the probability that sources from two or more
catalogues are simultaneously associated on the basis of their observable
characteristics. Here, counterparts have been determined using a WISE

specific parameterised functional forms for the variation of physical
quantities within the cluster, and instead allows for a 'free-form'
reconstruction, but one for which the level of complexity is determined
automatically by the observational data and may depend on position within the
cluster. This is achieved by representing each independent cluster property as
some interpolating or approximating function that is specified by a set of
control points, or 'nodes', for which the number of nodes, together with their
positions and amplitudes, are allowed to vary and are inferred in a Bayesian
manner from the data. We illustrate our nodal approach in the case of a
spherical cluster by modelling the electron pressure profile Pe(r) in analyses
both of simulated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data from the Arcminute MicroKelvin
Imager (AMI) and of real AMI observations of the cluster MACS J0744+3927 in the

supported by the data in the reconstructed Pe(r), and that one may constrain
two very important quantities in such an analysis: the cluster total volume
integrated Comptonisation parameter (Ytot) and the extent of the gas
distribution in the cluster (rmax). The approach is also well-suited to
detecting clusters in blind SZ surveys.

incorporates individual memory of exposure to a contagious entity (e.g., a
rumor or disease), variable magnitudes of exposure (dose sizes), and
heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals. Through analysis and
simulation, we examine in detail the case where individuals may recover from an
infection and then immediately become susceptible again (analogous to the
so-called SIS model). We identify three basic classes of contagion models which
we call \textit{epidemic threshold}, \textit{vanishing critical mass}, and
\textit{critical mass} classes, where each class of models corresponds to
different strategies for prevention or facilitation. We find that the
conditions for a particular contagion model to belong to one of the these three
classes depend only on memory length and the probabilities of being infected by
one and two exposures respectively. These parameters are in principle
measurable for real contagious influences or entities, thus yielding empirical
implications for our model. We also study the case where individuals attain
permanent immunity once recovered, finding that epidemics inevitably die out
but may be surprisingly persistent when individuals possess memory.

supply technologies such as batteries limit many applications due to their low
specific energy. Photovoltaics typically requires large bulky panels and is
dependent on varying solar insolation and therefore requires backup power
sources. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising
alternative, because they are clean, quiet and operate at high efficiency.
However challenges remain in achieving long lives due to factors such as
catalyst degradation and hydrogen storage. In this work, we devise a framework
for designing fuel cells power supplies for field sensor networks to achieve
long lives and utilize lithium hydride hydrogen storage technology that offers
high energy density of up to 5,000 Wh/kg. Using this design framework, we
identify operating conditions to maximize the life of the power supply, meet
the required power output and minimize fuel consumption. We devise a series of
controllers to achieve this capability and demonstrate it using a bench-top
experiment that operated for 5,000 hours. The laboratory experiments point
towards a pathway to design and scale these fuel cell power supplies for
various field applications. Our studies show the proposed PEM fuel cell hybrid

nodes self-organize to be either weak or strong to failure which captures the
trade-off between degradation and reinforcement of nodes inherent in many
network systems. If strong nodes cannot fail, this leads to power law
distributions of failure sizes with so-called ""Black Swan"" rare events. In
contrast, if strong nodes fail once a sufficient fraction of their neighbors
fail, this leads to ""Dragon Kings"", which are massive failures caused by
mechanisms distinct from smaller failures. In our model, we find that once an
initial failure size is above a critical value, the Dragon King mechanism kicks
in, leading to piggybacking system-wide failures. We demonstrate that the size
of the initial failed weak cluster predicts the likelihood of a Dragon King
event with high accuracy and we develop a simple control strategy which also
reveals that a random upgrade can inadvertently make the system more
vulnerable. The Dragon Kings observed are self-organized, existing throughout

positive and negative signs are created from nothing and produce two types of
branes with opposite quantum numbers and different numbers of timing
dimensions. Coincidence with the birth of these branes, various derivatives of
bosonic fields emerge in the action of the system which produce the $r$ GUP for
bosons. These branes interact with each other, compact and various derivatives
of spinor fields appear in the action of the system which leads to the creation
of the GUP for fermions. The previous predicted entropy of branes in the GUP is
corrected as due to the emergence of higher orders of derivatives and different

extreme conditions. Due to the longer range coulomb repulsion between protons,
the system has structural inhomogeneities. Several interactions tailored to
reproduce nuclear matter plus screened Coulomb term reproduce these
inhomogeneities known as nuclear pasta. These structural inhomogeneities,
located in the crust of neutron stars, can also arise in expanding systems
depending on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...)
and the expansion velocity. Purpose: We aim to find the dynamics of the
fragments formation for expanding systems simulated according to the little big
bang model. This expansion resembles the evolution of neutron stars merger.
Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with semiclassical molecular
dynamics models. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the
system homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very
low final densities). We study, with four different cluster recognition
algorithms, the fragment distribution throughout this expansion and the
dynamics of the cluster formation. Results: Studying the topology of the
equilibrium states, before the expansion, we reproduced the known pasta phases
plus a novel phase we called pregnocchi, consisting of proton aggregates
embedded in a neutron sea. We have identified different fragmentation regimes,
depending on the initial temperature and fragment velocity. In particular, for
the already mentioned pregnocchi, a neutron cloud surrounds the clusters during
the early stages of the expansion, resulting in systems that give rise to
configurations compatibles with the emergence of r-proccess. Conclusions: These
calculations pave the way to a comparision between Earth experiments and
neutron star studies.

communication quality of service (QoS) among the agents. Utilizing a Gaussian

desired motion controller by solving a joint optimization problem on motion
planning and wireless communication, in which both the STL specifications and
the wireless communication conditions are encoded as mixed integer-linear

find that the data set with $\bar{\mathrm{p}}/\mathrm{p}$ data can remove the

giving freedom of movement to the user, as well as by providing a real-time

AirScript provides a recognition module to predict the content of the document
created in air. To do so, we present a novel approach based on deep learning,
which uses the sensor data and the visualizations created by 2-DifViz. The
recognition module consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks. The output from these three networks is
fused to get the final prediction about the characters written in air.
AirScript can be used in highly sophisticated environments like a smart
classroom, a smart factory or a smart laboratory, where it would enable people
to annotate pieces of texts wherever they want without any reference surface.
We have evaluated AirScript against various well-known learning models (HMM,
KNN, SVM, etc.) on the data of 12 participants. Evaluation results show that
the recognition module of AirScript largely outperforms all of these models by
achieving an accuracy of 91.7% in a person independent evaluation and a 96.7%

nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) with plane wave solutions and with an
external potential. The NLSE is discretized in space by the symmetric interior
penalty discontinuous Galerkin (SIPG) method. The resulting system of
Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations are integrated in time by the
energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The mass and energy
preserving reduced order model (ROM) is constructed by proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) Galerkin projection. The nonlinearities are computed for
the ROM efficiently by discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Preservation of the semi-discrete energy and
mass are shown for the full order model (FOM) and for the ROM which ensures the
long term stability of the solutions. Numerical simulations illustrate the
preservation of the energy and mass in the reduced order model for the two
dimensional NLSE with and without the external potential. The POD-DMD makes a
remarkable improvement in computational speed-up over the POD-DEIM. Both
methods approximate accurately the FOM, whereas POD-DEIM is more accurate than
the POD-DMD.

and warehousing costs, reduction of source material waste, and reduced
environmental impact. AM is extremely useful for making prototypes and has
demonstrated the ability to manufacture complex parts not possible (or
prohibitively expensive) with conventional machining. Scientists and
manufactures are finding increased uses for AM in creation of all types of
finished products including those built from polymers, biological material, and
metals. Although companies such as GE have been using 3D printing for Additive
Manufacturing for over thirty years to make mandrels for light bulb
manufacturing, application areas of Additive Manufacturing have increased
substantially in recent years, particularly due to the reduction in cost of 3D
printers. Like most emergent technologies, there are bound to be growing pains
with AM. This paper looks at the software that supports AM and 3D printing and
their vulnerability to cyber-attacks, intellectual property theft, defect rates
of AM software (which can cause undesired consequences themselves and also
create vulnerabilities that a hacker may exploit), part reliability and safety
of devices incorporating 3D printed parts (when making mission critical parts),
and security/throughput issues of computer networks. Literature searches,
consulting with technical experts and a relatively new hazard analysis
technique will be used, one especially developed for software intensive systems
called Systemic Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). The purpose of this white
paper is to identify risks (or hazards for mission critical parts) for AM in
this emergent stage so that mitigations can be applied before accidents occur.
A second purpose of this white paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of STPA
as a hazard analysis technique in a field that is still relatively new.

well-established process in which the face is detected and identified out of

basis of who we are. In our proof of concept of a smart door we have used a
live HD camera on the front side of setup attached to a display monitor
connected to the camera to show who is standing in front of the door, also the
whole system will be able to give voice outputs by processing text them on the
Raspberry Pi ARM processor used and show the answers as output on the screen.
We are using a set of electromagnets controlled by the microcontroller, which
will act as a lock. So a person can open the smart door with the help of facial
recognition and at the same time also be able to interact with it. The facial
recognition is done by Microsoft face API but our state of the art desktop
application operating over Microsoft Visual Studio IDE reduces the
computational time by detecting the face out of the photo and giving that as
the output to Microsoft Face API, which is hosted over Microsoft Azure cloud
support.

of the electron-positron field gives rise to dependence of the speed of light

epoch, even at very high temperatures, such for example which exist in the star
interiors, the temperature-dependent correction to the speed of light proves to
be extremtly small. But in the cosmological model of the hot Universe, in the
first instances after the Big Bang the temperature was so high that the speed
of light exceeded its present value by many orders of magnitude. The effect of
dependence of the speed of light on temperature must be important for
understanding the early evolution of the Universe.

  Composite-Hadron Spectroscopy","52 pages, 2 figures; added a detailed table of contents",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most important problem in hadron physics is to establish the
Lorentz-invariant classification scheme of composite hadrons, extending the
framework of non-relativistic quark model. We present an attempt, by developing
proper-time $\tau$ quantum mechanics on a multi-quark system in particle frame
(with constant boost velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$). We start from the variational
method on a classical mechanics action where a constituent quark has Pauli-type
$SU(2)_{\sigma}$ spin. Then the $SU(2)_{\mathfrak{m}}$ symmetry, concerning the
sign-reversal on quark mass, has arisen with the basic vectors, the normal
Dirac spinor with $J^{P}=(1/2)^{+}$ and the chiral one with $J^{P}=(1/2)^{-}$,
appearing as a ""shadow"" of the former. Herewith, the mass reversal between
these basic vectors become equivalent to the chirality, which is a symmetry of
the standard gauge theory. We describe the role of chirality in hadron
spectroscopy and regard it as attribute {$\chi$} of ""elementary"" hadrons in
addition to {$J, P, C$}. A novel feature of our hadron spectroscopy is, in the
example of $q\bar{q}$ meson system, that the ""Regge trajectories"", are given by
mass-squared vs. the number of quantum $N$ ; where $M^2 =M_{0}^2 +2N\Omega$
($N=2n$, $n$ the radial quantum number, $\Omega$ the oscillator quantum), and
the intrinsic spin of hadrons $\boldsymbol{J}$ comes only from quark spin
$\boldsymbol{S}$, $\boldsymbol{J}=\boldsymbol{S}$. Some phenomenological facts
crucial to its validity are pointed out on the light-through-heavy quarkonium
system.

on Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation with reticular free energy.
We have put forward two $L^2$ stable schemes to simulate simplified TDGL
equation. In numerical experiments, we observe that simulating the whole
process of phase separation requires a considerably long time. We also notice
that the total free energy changes significantly in initial time and varies
slightly in the following time. Based on these properties, we introduce an
adaptive strategy based on one of stable scheme mentioned. It is found that the
introduction of the time adaptivity cannot only resolve the dynamical changes
of the solution accurately but also can significantly save CPU time for the
long time simulation.
