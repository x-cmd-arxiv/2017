several application scenarios, ranging from object recognition, image
retrieval, and forensic applications. Due to limited bandwidth in distributed
systems, efficient coding of local visual features has in fact been an active
topic of research. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to obtain a
compact representation of high-dimensional visual data using sensor fusion
techniques. We convert the problem of visual analysis in resource-limited
scenarios to a multi-view representation learning, and we show that the key to
finding properly compressed representation is to exploit the position of
cameras with respect to each other as a norm-based regularization in the
particular signal representation of sparse coding. Learning the representation
of each camera is viewed as an individual task and a multi-task learning with
joint sparsity for all nodes is employed. The proposed representation learning
scheme is referred to as the multi-view task-driven learning for visual sensor
network (MT-VSN). We demonstrate that MT-VSN outperforms state-of-the-art in
various surveillance recognition tasks.

detections in low-level and tracklets in high-level. At each step of the
hierarchy, the confidence of candidates is measured by using a new scoring
system, ConfRank, that considers the quality and the quantity of its
neighborhood. The output of the first stage is a collection of safe tracklets
and unlinked high-confidence detections. For each individual detection, we
determine if it belongs to an existing or is a new tracklet. We show the effect
of our framework to recover missed detections and reduce switch identity. The
proposed tracker is referred to as TVOD for multi-target tracking using the
visual tracker and generic object detector. We achieve competitive results with
lower identity switches on several datasets comparing to state-of-the-art.

of the Klein-Gordon equation from Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates, producing
frame-lagging terms that are important especially at large scales, and if not

numerical linear algebra, such as regression. In the overconstrained regression
problem, one is given an $n \times d$ matrix $A$, with $n \gg d$, as well as an
$n \times 1$ vector $b$, and one wants to find a vector $\hat{x}$ so as to
minimize the residual error $\|Ax-b\|_2$. Using the sketch and solve paradigm,
one first computes $S \cdot A$ and $S \cdot b$ for a randomly chosen matrix
$S$, then outputs $x' = (SA)^{\dagger} Sb$ so as to minimize $\|SAx' - Sb\|_2$.
  The sketch-and-solve paradigm gives a bound on $\|x'-x^*\|_2$ when $A$ is
well-conditioned. Our main result is that, when $S$ is the subsampled
randomized Fourier/Hadamard transform, the error $x' - x^*$ behaves as if it
lies in a ""random"" direction within this bound: for any fixed direction $a\in
\mathbb{R}^d$, we have with $1 - d^{-c}$ probability that
  \[
  \langle a, x'-x^*\rangle \lesssim
\frac{\|a\|_2\|x'-x^*\|_2}{d^{\frac{1}{2}-\gamma}}, \quad (1)
  \]
  where $c, \gamma > 0$ are arbitrary constants.
  This implies $\|x'-x^*\|_{\infty}$ is a factor $d^{\frac{1}{2}-\gamma}$
smaller than $\|x'-x^*\|_2$. It also gives a better bound on the generalization
of $x'$ to new examples: if rows of $A$ correspond to examples and columns to
features, then our result gives a better bound for the error introduced by
sketch-and-solve when classifying fresh examples. We show that not all
oblivious subspace embeddings $S$ satisfy these properties. In particular, we
give counterexamples showing that matrices based on Count-Sketch or leverage
score sampling do not satisfy these properties.
  We also provide lower bounds, both on how small $\|x'-x^*\|_2$ can be, and
for our new guarantee (1), showing that the subsampled randomized
Fourier/Hadamard transform is nearly optimal.

sections are needed in their spectral models, they have been computed for
isoelectronic sequences with electron number $12\leq N\leq 18$ using a
multi-channel method. Target representations are obtained with the atomic
structure code AUTOSTRUCTURE, and ground-state cross sections are computed with
the Breit--Pauli $R$-matrix method (BPRM) in intermediate coupling, including
damping (radiative and Auger) effects. The contributions from channels
associated with the 2s-hole $[2{\rm s}]\mu$ target configurations and those
containing 3d orbitals are studied in the Mg and Ar isoelectronic sequences.
Cross sections for the latter ions are also calculated in the
isolated-resonance approximation as implemented in AUTOSTRUCTURE and compared
with BPRM to test their accuracy. It is confirmed that the collisional channels
associated with the $[2{\rm s}]\mu$ target configurations must be taken into
account owing to significant increases in the monotonic background cross
section between the L and K edges. Target configurations with 3d orbitals give
rise to fairly conspicuous unresolved transition arrays in the L-edge region,
but to a much lesser extent in the K-edge which is our main concern; therefore,
they have been neglected throughout owing to their computationally intractable
channel inventory, thus allowing the computation of cross sections for all the
ions with $12\leq N\leq 18$ in intermediate coupling with BPRM. We find that
the isolated-resonance approximations performs satisfactorily.

concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive (i.e.
foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can
be useful in systems that have to interact with humans and provide
justifications for their uncertainty. As a demonstration of the system, we
apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another
advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values
for counterfactual statements. Counterfactuals are statements that an agent
knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals are useful when
systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for
counterfactuals fall out naturally from our system.
  Efficient reasoning in just simple first-order logic is a hard problem.
Resolution-based first-order reasoning systems have made significant progress
over the last several decades in building systems that have solved non-trivial
tasks (even unsolved conjectures in mathematics). We present a sketch of a
novel algorithm for reasoning that extends first-order resolution.

logics, first-order logics and propositional modal logics, there has been very
little work in building systems of uncertainty for first-order modal logics.

alleviate the burden of the backhaul networks. Generally, popularity-based
caching is not a system-wide optimal strategy, especially for user mobility
scenarios. Motivated by this observation, we consider optimal caching with
presence of mobility. A cost-optimal caching problem (COCP) for
device-to-device (D2D) networks is modelled, in which the impact of user
mobility, cache size, and total number of encoded segments are all accounted
for. Compared with the related studies, our investigation guarantees that the
collected segments are non-overlapping, takes into account the cost of
downloading from the network, and provides a rigorous problem complexity
analysis. The hardness of the problem is proved via a reduction from the
satisfiability problem. Next, a lower-bounding function of the objective
function is derived. By the function, an approximation of COCP (ACOCP)
achieving linearization is obtained, which features two advantages. First, the
ACOCP approach can use an off-the-shelf integer linear programming algorithm to
obtain the global optimal solution, and it can effectively deliver solutions
for small-scale and mediumscale system scenarios. Second, and more importantly,
based on the ACOCP approach, one can derive the lower bound of global optimum
of COCP, thus enabling performance benchmarking of any suboptimal algorithm. To
tackle large scenarios with low complexity, we first prove that the optimal
caching placement of one user, giving other users' caching placements, can be
derived in polynomial time. Then, based on this proof, a mobility aware
user-by-user (MAUU) algorithm is developed. Simulation results verify the
effectivenesses of the two approaches by comparing them to the lower bound of
global optimum and conventional caching algorithms.

  This paper provides a novel collection of technical and theoretical tools for
studying the geometry of singular subspaces using the two-to-infinity norm.
Motivated by preliminary deterministic Procrustes analysis, we consider a
general matrix perturbation setting in which we derive a new Procrustean matrix
decomposition. Together with flexible machinery developed for the
two-to-infinity norm, this allows us to conduct a refined analysis of the
induced perturbation geometry with respect to the underlying singular vectors
even in the presence of singular value multiplicity. Our analysis yields
singular vector entrywise perturbation bounds for a range of popular matrix
noise models, each of which has a meaningful associated statistical inference
task. In addition, we demonstrate how the two-to-infinity norm is the preferred
norm in certain statistical settings. Specific applications discussed in this
paper include covariance estimation, singular subspace recovery, and multiple
graph inference.
  Both our Procrustean matrix decomposition and the technical machinery
developed for the two-to-infinity norm may be of independent interest.

CdEr$_2$Se$_4$ is reported to have the Pauling entropy characteristic of a spin
ice, but its dynamics are three-orders of magnitude faster than the canonical
spin ice Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. In this letter we use diffuse neutron scattering to
show that both CdEr$_2$Se$_4$ and CdEr$_2$S$_4$ support a dipolar spin ice

Coulomb gases have similar parameters to that in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, i.e. dilute
and uncorrelated, so cannot provide three-orders faster dynamics through a
larger monopole population alone. We investigate the monopole dynamics using ac
susceptometry and neutron spin echo spectroscopy, and verify the crystal
electric field Hamiltonian of the Er$^{3+}$ ions using inelastic neutron
scattering. A quantitative calculation of the monopole hopping rate using our
Coulomb gas and crystal electric field parameters shows that the fast dynamics
in CdEr$_2$X$_4$ (X = Se, S) are primarily due to much faster monopole hopping.

modulated on longer time scales. Drawing from dynamo theory together with
empirical results of past solar activity and of similar phenomena on solar-like
stars, we show that the variability of the solar cycle can be essentially
understood in terms of a weakly nonlinear limit cycle affected by random noise.
In contrast to ad-hoc `toy models' for the solar cycle, this leads to a generic
normal-form model, whose parameters are all constrained by observations. The
model reproduces the characteristics of the variable solar activity on time
scales between decades and millennia, including the occurrence and statistics

  To overcome this issue, we first introduce the concept of ""leakage control""
which puts a bar on the natural information leakage rate and greatly helps in
increasing both the usability and security standards. Not just prevention, but
also, by introducing the threat detection strategy (based on the concept of
honeyword), our scheme ""lights two candles"". It not only eliminates the long

with threat detection from the client side, it is capable of protecting the
secret at the server side under the distributed framework, and thus,

population transfer via delayed pulses. Our results indicate that the existence
of VIC leads to the generation of a mixed state in the excited state manifold,

internal structure of a graph, and contains even other specializations from
other sciences like the Jones polynomial in Knot theory, the partition function
of the Pott model in statistical physics, and the reliability polynomial in
network theory. In this article, we study the Tutte polynomial associated to
more general objects which are the arrangements of hyperplanes. Indeed
determining the Tutte polynomial of a graph is equivalent to determining the
Tutte polynomial of a special hyperplane arrangement called graphic
arrangement. In 2007 Ardila computed the Tutte polynomials of the hyperplane
arrangements associated to the classical Weyl groups, and the characteristic
polynomials of the Catalan arrangements. The charateristic polynomial is also a
specialization of the Tutte polynomial. In 2012 Seo computed the characteristic

characteristic polynomials of the $\mathcal{I}_n$ arrangements in the plane and
in the space. We aim to bring a more general result by introducing a wider

arrangements. We compute the Tutte polynomial of a symmetric hyperplane

five different varieties of Spanish: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Spain.
We compare our LDR method with common state-of-the-art representations and show
an increase in accuracy of ~35%. Furthermore, we compare LDR with two reference
distributed representation models. Experimental results show competitive
performance while dramatically reducing the dimensionality --and increasing the
big data suitability-- to only 6 features per variety. Additionally, we analyse
the behaviour of the employed machine learning algorithms and the most

robustness of our low dimensionality representation with another set of similar

study is focused on the configuration produced when two long parallel filaments
of silicone oil, which are placed upon a glass substrate previously coated with
a fluorinated solution, are crossed perpendicularly by another pair of long
parallel filaments. A remarkable feature of this kind of grids is that there
are two qualitatively different types of drops. While one set is formed at the
crossing points, the rest are consequence of the breakup of shorter filaments
formed between the crossings. Here, we analyze the main geometric features of
all types of drops, such as shape of the footprint and contact angle
distribution along the drop periphery. The formation of a series of short
filaments with similar geometric and physical properties allows us to have
simultaneously quasi identical experiments to study the subsequent breakups. We
develop a simple hydrodynamic model to predict the number of drops that results
from a filament of given initial length and width. This model is able to yield
the length intervals corresponding to a small number of drops and its
predictions are successfully compared with the experimental data as well as
with numerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes equation that provide a
detailed time evolution of the dewetting motion of the filament till the
breakup into drops. Finally, the prediction for finite filaments is contrasted

Exploring the requirements posed to supercells, we show that the distortion
field of a single N atom must be allowed to decrease so far, that it does not

interactions between translational symmetric atoms, allowing to compute band
gaps in very good agreement with experimentally derived reference values. These

its origin in the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems is not
fully understood. A strong consensus is emerging around the idea that the
stationary thermodynamic entropy is the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a
large subsystem embedded in an infinite system. Also motivated by cold-atom
experiments, here we consider the generalisation to Renyi entropies. We develop
a new technique to calculate the diagonal Renyi entropy in the quench action
formalism. In the spirit of the replica treatment for the entanglement entropy,
the diagonal Renyi entropies are generalised free energies evaluated over a
thermodynamic macrostate which depends on the Renyi index and, in particular,
it is not the same describing the von Neumann entropy. The technical reason for
this, maybe surprising, result is that the evaluation of the moments of the
diagonal density matrix shifts the saddle point of the quench action. An
interesting consequence is that different Renyi entropies encode information
about different regions of the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian. Our
approach provides a very simple proof of the long-standing issue that, for
integrable systems, the diagonal entropy is half of the thermodynamic one and
it allows us to generalise this result to the case of arbitrary Renyi entropy.

bound by $\frac{\alpha_G}{\alpha} \le 10^{-34}$, using structure formation
arguments which involve the fine structure constant $\alpha$ and the
gravitational constant $\alpha_G$. Previously we showed that the requirement of
vacuum domination epoch occuring after matter radiation equality time, places a
bound on vacuum energy in terms of the density perturbation parameter Q. Here
we impose a further condition: we require that at equality time the size of the
gas cloud which forms a galaxy at virialization time, be smaller than the
horizon size. The latter condition leads to an intriguing relation whereby
vacuum energy is bound by a power law function of the hierarchy of forces. The
constraint introduced by the hierarchy of forces on the amount of dark energy
is suggestive of an unknown microphysical mechanism that relates vacuum energy

semi-independent, task-based solution of sets of partial differential
equations, typically manifesting as updates to a collection of `patches' in
space-time. A hybrid MPI/OpenMP execution model is adopted, where work tasks
are controlled by a rank-local `dispatcher' which selects, from a set of tasks
generally much larger than the number of physical cores (or hardware threads),
tasks that are ready for updating. The definition of a task can vary, for
example, with some solving the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD),
others non-ideal MHD, radiative transfer, or particle motion, and yet others
applying particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Tasks do not have to be grid-based,
while tasks that are, may use either Cartesian or orthogonal curvilinear
meshes. Patches may be stationary or moving. Mesh refinement can be static or
dynamic. A feature of decisive importance for the overall performance of the
framework is that time steps are determined and applied locally; this allows
potentially large reductions in the total number of updates required in cases
when the signal speed varies greatly across the computational domain, and
therefore a corresponding reduction in computing time. Another feature is a
load balancing algorithm that operates `locally' and aims to simultaneously
minimise load and communication imbalance. The framework generally relies on
already existing solvers, whose performance is augmented when run under the
framework, due to more efficient cache usage, vectorisation, local
time-stepping, plus near-linear and, in principle, unlimited OpenMP and MPI
scaling.

scattering of DM on the thermal bath particles is suppressed. This leads to the

independent discussion is illustrated within a theory of Abelian vector dark

approximation of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) picture. We find that the
angular momentum shortly after the collision (up to times ~ 1/Q_s, where Q_s is
the saturation scale) is carried by the ""beta-type"" flow of the initial
classical gluon field, introduced by some of us earlier. beta^i ~ mu_1 nabla^i
mu_2 - mu_2 nabla^i mu_1 (i=1,2) describes the rapidity-odd transverse energy
flow and emerges from Gauss' Law for gluon fields. Here mu_1 and mu_2 are the
averaged color charge fluctuation densities in the two nuclei, respectively.
Interestingly, strong coupling calculations using AdS/CFT techniques also find
an energy flow term featuring this particular combination of nuclear densities.
In classical CGC the order of magnitude of the initial angular momentum per
rapidity in the reaction plane, at a time 1/Q_s, is |dL_2/d eta| ~ R_A/Q_s^3
epsilon_0/2 at midrapidity, where R_A is the nuclear radius, and epsilon_0 is
the average initial energy density. This result emerges as a cancellation
between a vortex of energy flow in the reaction plane aligned with the total
angular momentum, and energy shear flow opposed to it. We discuss in detail the
process of matching classical Yang-Mills results to fluid dynamics. We will
argue that dissipative corrections should not be discarded to ensure that
macroscopic conservation laws, e.g. for angular momentum, hold. Viscous fluid
dynamics tends to dissipate the shear flow contribution that carries angular
momentum in boost-invariant fluid systems. This leads to small residual angular
momentum around midrapidity at late times for collisions at high energies.

the Virgo TFR match those of field galaxies, while scatter differences likely
reflect distinct evolutionary histories. The velocities minimizing scatter for
the TFR and FP are measured at large apertures where the baryonic fraction
becomes subdominant. While TFR residuals remain independent of any galaxy
parameters, FP residuals (i.e. the FP ""tilt"") correlate strongly with the
dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio, yielding stringent galaxy formation
constraints. Furthermore, we construct a stellar-to-total mass relation (STMR)
for ETGs and LTGs and find linear but distinct trends over the range $M_{*} =

extended dark matter halo, can be scaled down to masses estimated within the
optical radius, showing a tight match with the Virgo STMR at low masses;
however, possibly inadequate halo abundance matching prescriptions and broad
radial scalings complicate this comparison at all masses. While ETGs appear to
be more compact than LTGs of the same stellar mass in projected space, their
mass-size relations in physical space are identical. The trends reported here

($\varrho(E) \sim |E|^{1/n}$), this anisotropic semimetal (ASM) is stable
against weak short-range interactions. However, for stronger interactions the
direct DSM-BI transition can either $(i)$ become a first-order transition, or
$(ii)$ get avoided by an intervening broken-symmetry phase (BSP). We perform a
renormalization group analysis by perturbing away from the one-dimensional
limit with the small parameter $\epsilon = 1/n$, augmented with a $1/n$
expansion (parametrically suppressing quantum fluctuations in higher
dimension). We identify charge density wave (CDW), antiferromagnet (AFM) and
singlet s-wave superconductor as the three dominant candidates for the BSP. The
onset of any such order at strong coupling $(\sim \epsilon)$ takes place
through a continuous quantum phase transition across multicritical point. We
also present the phase diagram of an extended Hubbard model for the ASM,
obtained via the controlled deformation of its counterpart in one dimension.
The latter displays spin-charge separation and instabilities to CDW, spin
density wave, and Luther-Emery liquid phases at arbitrarily weak coupling. The
spin density wave and Luther-Emery liquid phases deform into pseudospin
SU(2)-symmetric quantum critical points separating the ASM from the AFM and
superconducting orders, respectively. Our results can be germane for a
uniaxially strained honeycomb lattice or organic compound
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2\text{I}_3$.

the local anti-correlation between galaxy density and AGN activity, so there is
an enhancement of AGN in high-redshift protoclusters. We compare the properties

This allows us to estimate the size of the energetically dominant regions. We
find half-light radii from 30 pc to 1.7 kpc. The 33 GHz flux density correlates
well with the IR emission, and we take these sizes as indicative of the size of
the region that produces most of the energy. Combining our 33 GHz sizes with
unresolved measurements, we estimate the IR luminosity and star formation rate
per area, and the molecular gas surface and volume densities. These quantities
span a wide range (4 dex) and include some of the highest values measured for
any galaxy (e.g., $\mathrm{\Sigma_{SFR}^{33GHz} \leq 10^{4.1} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}

with observations of normal disk galaxies suggests a nonlinear and likely
multi-valued relation between SFR and molecular gas surface density, though
this result depends on the adopted CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor and the
assumption that our 33 GHz sizes apply to the gas. 11 sources appear to exceed
the luminosity surface density predicted for starbursts supported by radiation
pressure and supernovae feedback, however we note the need for more detailed
observations of the inner disk structure. U/LIRGs with higher surface

hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies, which include a
self-consistent, physical model for the formation and dynamical evolution of
the cluster population and account for the variation of cluster disruption in
time and space. We show that the downward slope of the cluster age distribution
due to disruption cannot be reproduced with a single functional form, because
the disruption rate exhibits systematic trends with cluster age (the `cruel
cradle effect'). This problem is resolved by using the median cluster age to
trace cluster disruption. Across 120 independent galaxy snapshots and simulated
cluster populations, we perform two-dimensional power law fits of the median
cluster age to various macroscopic physical quantities and find that it scales
as $t_{\rm med}\propto \Sigma^{-0.51\pm0.03}\sigma_{\rm

gas velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm 1D}$, and minimum cluster mass $M_{\rm

indicates disruption by impulsive tidal shocks from the interstellar medium.
The term $M_{\rm min}^\gamma$ provides a model-independent way to measure the
mass dependence of the cluster disruption time $\gamma$. Finally, the
ensemble-average cluster lifetime depends on the gas density less strongly than
the instantaneous disruption time of single clusters. These results reflect the
variation of cluster disruption in time and space. We provide quantitative ways
of accounting for these physics in cluster population studies.

of the SDSS in an appropriately cleaned subsample of groups from the Yang

satellite high ends, yet higher ratios of characteristic satellite to central

fractions of groups with large and small magnitude gaps as well as the Tremaine

These gap statistics, which naturally depend on the size of the subsamples, and
also on the maximum projected radius, $R_{\rm max}$, for defining the 2nd
brightest galaxy, can only be reproduced with two-component CLFs if we allow
small gap groups to preferentially have two central galaxies, as expected when
groups merge. Finally, we find that the trend of higher gap for higher group
velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm v}$, at given richness, discovered by Hearin

Hamiltonian. We analyze their interplay using a weak-coupling renormalization
group approach. In the clean case, the Coulomb interaction has been found to be
marginally irrelevant, leading to Fermi liquid behavior. We extend the analysis
to incorporate the effects of disorder. The nodal line structure gives rise to
kinematical constraints similar to that for a two-dimensional Fermi surface,
which plays a crucial role in the one-loop renor- malization of the disorder
couplings. For a two-fold degenerate nodal loop (Weyl loop), we show that
disorder flows to strong coupling along a unique fixed trajectory in the space
of symmetry inequiv- alent disorder couplings. Along this fixed trajectory, all
symmetry inequivalent disorder strengths become equal. For a four-fold
degenerate nodal loop (Dirac loop), disorder also flows to strong coupling,
however the strengths of symmetry inequivalent disorder couplings remain
different. We show that feedback from disorder reverses the sign of the beta
function for the Coulomb interaction, causing the Coulomb interaction to flow
to strong coupling as well. However, the Coulomb interac- tion flows to strong
coupling asymptotically more slowly than disorder. Extrapolating our results to
strong coupling, we conjecture that at low energies nodal line semimetals

model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the
California-Kepler-Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is
shown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6
Rearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models
previously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley
results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the
longest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only
a few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes
lighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for
tenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the
planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,
therefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with
double the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the
first 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.
The observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are
clustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few
percent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.
Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,
while the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the
photoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if
these planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for
planet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets.

making up all of the DM for both delta-function and extended mass functions.
However the stellar microlensing event rate depends on the density and velocity
distribution of the compact objects along the line of sight to the Magellanic
Clouds. We study the dependence of the constraints on the local dark matter
density and circular speed and also consider models where the velocity
distribution varies with radius. We find that the largest mass constrained by
stellar microlensing can vary by an order of magnitude. In particular the
constraints are significantly weakened if the velocity dispersion of the
compact objects is reduced. The change is not sufficiently large to remove the
tension between the stellar microlensing and dynamical constraints. However
this demonstrates that it is crucial to take into account astrophysical
uncertainties when calculating and comparing constraints. We also confirm the
recent finding that the tension between the constraints is in fact increased
for realistic, finite width mass functions.

their dense-gas mass when their volume density profile is that of an isothermal
sphere, i.e. $\rho_{clump}(r) \propto r^{-2}$. Dense gas is defined as gas
whose volume density is higher than a threshold
$\rho_{th}=700\,M_{\odot}.pc^{-3}$, i.e. HCN(1-0)-mapped gas. We divide the
clump into two regions: a dense inner region (where $\rho_{clump}(r) \geq
\rho_{th}$), and low-density outskirts (where $\rho_{clump}(r) < \rho_{th}$).
We find that the total star formation rate of clumps scales linearly with the
mass of their dense inner region, even when more than half of the clump star
formation activity takes place in the low-density outskirts. We therefore
emphasize that a linear star formation relation does not necessarily imply that
star formation takes place exclusively in the gas whose mass is given by the
star formation relation. The linearity of the star formation relation is
strengthened when we account for the mass of dense fragments (e.g. cores,
fibers) seeding star formation in the low-density outskirts, and which our
adopted clump density profile $\rho_{clump}(r)$ does not resolve. We also find
that the star formation relation is significantly tighter when considering the
dense gas than when considering all the clump gas, as observed for molecular
clouds of the Galactic plane. When the clumps have no low-density outskirts
(i.e. they consist of dense gas only), the star formation relation becomes
superlinear and progressively wider.

a variety of private empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithms, using them
to ""search"" the space of privacy levels to find the empirically strongest one

number of privacy levels searched. The privacy analysis of our algorithm leads
naturally to a version of differential privacy where the privacy parameters are
dependent on the data, which we term ex-post privacy, and which is related to
the recently introduced notion of privacy odometers. We also give an ex-post

three-age division of prehistory into the stone, bronze, and iron ages.
References to our present time as the information age or silicon age epitomizes
the important role that this semiconducting material came to play in the
development of computers and devices that permeate our daily lives. Here we
show that the electronic states in silicon have nontrivial topological
structures that are captured by a network of Berry flux lines that link at
points of high symmetry in the Brillouin zone. This complex network has
ice-nodal points where fluxes satisfy ice rules, making silicon a ""nodal-chain
insulator"". Fixing the longitudinal momentum parallel to such flux lines yields
a two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian for the transverse degrees of freedom. This
complex Berry-flux network implies a topologically stable two-fold degeneracy
along the X-W direction in all of silicon bands, a fact that is supported by
crystal symmetry arguments as well as direct inspection of the vast literature
on silicon band structures. Similarly to nodal-chain semimetals, we find
drumhead-like states in the regions that are delimited by the projections of
the bulk Berry flux network on the surface Brillouin zone.

Peccei-Quinn scalar might be identified with the complex dilaton field. Scale
invariance, together with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, is broken spontaneously
near the Planck scale before inflation, which is driven by the Standard Model
Higgs field. We present a set of general conditions which makes this scenario
viable and an explicit example of an effective theory possessing spontaneous
breaking of scale invariance. We show that this description works both for
inflation and low-energy physics in the electroweak vacuum. This scenario can
provide a self-consistent inflationary stage and, at the same time,
successfully avoid the cosmological bounds on the axion. Our general
predictions are the existence of coloured TeV mass fermion and the QCD axion.
The latter has all the properties of the KSVZ axion but does not contribute to
dark matter. This axion can be searched via it's mixing to a photon in an

using a combination of radial velocity and [Fe/H] measurements, and we found
the cluster to have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of +99.76 km s^-1
(sigma = 7.44 km s^-1). We derived a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.54 dex
(sigma = 0.08 dex), but the cluster's small dispersion in [Fe/H] and low
[La/Eu] abundance preclude it from being an iron-complex cluster. NGC 5986 has
<[Eu/Fe]> = +0.76 dex (sigma = 0.08 dex), which is among the highest ratios
detected in a Galactic cluster. NGC 5986 exhibits classical globular cluster
characteristics, such as uniformly enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, a small
dispersion in Fe-peak abundances, and (anti-)correlated light element
variations. Similar to NGC 2808, we find evidence that NGC 5986 may host at
least 4-5 populations with distinct light element compositions, and the
presence of a clear Mg-Al anti-correlation along with an Al-Si correlation
suggests that the cluster gas experienced processing at temperatures >65-70 MK.
However, the current data do not support burning temperatures exceeding ~100
MK. We find some evidence that the first and second generation stars in NGC
5986 may be fully spatially mixed, which could indicate that the cluster has
lost a significant fraction of its original mass. [abridged]

principles molecular dynamics by Car and Parrinello [Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf

molecular dynamics overcomes several shortcomings of regular, direct
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, while improving or maintaining important
features of Car-Parrinello simulations. The accuracy of the electronic degrees
of freedom in extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, with
respect to the exact Born-Oppenheimer solution, is of second order in the size
of the integration time step and of fourth order in the potential energy
surface. Improved stability over recent formulations of extended Lagrangian
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics is achieved by generalizing the theory to
finite temperature ensembles, using fractional occupation numbers in the
calculation of the inner-product kernel of the extended harmonic oscillator
that appears as a preconditioner in the electronic equations of motion.
Materials systems that normally exhibit slow self-consistent field convergence
can be simulated using integration time steps of the same order as in direct
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, but without the requirement of an
iterative, non-linear electronic ground state optimization prior to the force
evaluations and without a systematic drift in the total energy. In combination
with proposed low-rank and on-the-fly updates of the kernel, this formulation
provides an efficient and general framework for quantum based Born-Oppenheimer

($L_{\rm IR}=10^{10}-10^{12}\,L_\odot$); 3) IR luminous galaxies spanning
$z=0.5-3$ from GOODS and Spitzer xFLS ($L_{\rm IR}>10^{11}\,L_\odot$). All
samples have Spitzer mid-IR spectra, and Herschel and ground-based
submillimeter imaging covering the full IR spectral energy distribution,
allowing us to robustly measure $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}$,
$T_{\rm dust}$, and $M_{\rm dust}$ for every galaxy. Despite similar infrared
luminosities, $z>0.5$ dusty star forming galaxies have a factor of 5 higher
dust masses and 5K colder temperatures. The increase in dust mass is linked
with an increase in the gas fractions with redshift, and we do not observe a
similar increase in stellar mass or star formation efficiency.
$L_{160}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}/L_{70}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}$, a proxy
for $T_{\rm dust}$, is strongly correlated with $L_{\rm
IR}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\rm dust}$ independently of redshift. We
measure merger classification and galaxy size for a subsample, and there is no
obvious correlation between these parameters and $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm
\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\rm dust}$ or $L_{160}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle
SF}/L_{70}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}$. In dusty star forming galaxies, the
change in $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\rm dust}$ can fully
account for the observed colder dust temperatures, suggesting that any change
in the spatial extent of the interstellar medium is a second order effect.

is possible via dispersive waves through soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation.
However, this potentially powerful technique has not been used for extending

increasing the total Kerr-comb bandwidth as well.

that bank-forming discharge varied at both 10m stratigraphic (10$^2$ - 10$^6$
yr) and $\sim$100 m stratigraphic (10$^3$ - 10$^9$ yr) scales. Because these
variations are correlated across the basin, they record a change in basin-scale
forcing, rather than smaller-scale internal feedbacks. Changing sediment input
leading to a change in characteristic slopes and/or drainage area could be
responsible, and another possibility is changing climate ($\pm$50 W/m$^2$ in
peak energy available for snow/ice melt).

dissipation in superconducting, superfluid, and cold atom systems. While the
dynamics of vortices is fairly well described, phase slips occurring in
quasi-one dimensional superconducting wires still elude understanding. The main
reason is that phase slips are strongly non-linear time-dependent phenomena
that cannot be cast in terms of small perturbations of the superconducting
state. Here we study phase slips occurring in superconducting weak links.
Thanks to partial suppression of superconductivity in weak links, we employ a
weakly nonlinear approximation for dynamic phase slips. This approximation is
not valid for homogeneous superconducting wires and slabs. Using the numerical
solution of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and bifurcation
analysis of stationary solutions, we show that the onset of phase slips occurs
via an infinite period bifurcation, which is manifested in a specific
voltage-current dependence. Our analytical results are in good agreement with
simulations.

  ""Wandering Towards a Goal""",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What does it take for a system, biological or not, to have goals? Here, this
question is approached in the context of in silico artificial evolution. By
examining the informational and causal properties of artificial organisms
('animats') controlled by small, adaptive neural networks (Markov Brains), this
essay discusses necessary requirements for intrinsic information, autonomy, and
meaning. The focus lies on comparing two types of Markov Brains that evolved in
the same simple environment: one with purely feedforward connections between
its elements, the other with an integrated set of elements that causally
constrain each other. While both types of brains 'process' information about
their environment and are equally fit, only the integrated one forms a causally
autonomous entity above a background of external influences. This suggests that
to assess whether goals are meaningful for a system itself, it is important to
understand what the system is, rather than what it does.

Clouds in VIJHKs bands and optical and near-infrared Wesenheit indices we
determine the effect of metallicity on Cepheid P-L relations by comparing the
relative distance between LMC and SMC as determined from the Cepheids to the
distance difference between the Clouds which has been derived with very high
accuracy from late-type eclipsing binary systems. Within an uncertainty of 3%
which is dominated by the uncertainty on the mean metallicity difference
between the Cepheid populations in LMC and SMC we find metallicity effects
smaller than 2% in all bands and in the Wesenheit indices, consistent with a
zero metallicity effect. This result is valid for the metallicity range from
-0.35 dex to -0.75 dex corresponding to the mean [Fe/H] values for classical
Cepheids in LMC and SMC, respectively. Yet most Cepheids in galaxies beyond the
Local Group and located in the less crowded outer regions of these galaxies do
fall into this metallicity regime, making our result important for applications
to determine the distances to spiral galaxies well beyond the Local Group. Our
result supports previous findings which indicated a very small metallicity
effect on the near-infrared absolute magnitudes of classical Cepheids, and
resolves the dispute about the size and sign of the metallicity effect in the
optical spectral range. It also resolves one of the most pressing problems in
the quest towards a measurement of the Hubble constant with an accuracy of 1%

the development of cancer phenotype. We challenge this current view by means of
bioinformatic data analysis and computational modelling approaches. Not all the
mutations are equally important for the development of metastasis. The survival
of cancer cells from the primary tumour site to the secondary seeding sites
depends on the occurrence of very few driver mutations promoting oncogenic cell
behaviours and on the order with which these mutations occur. We introduce a
model in the framework of Cellular Automata to investigate the effects of
metabolic mutations and mutation order on cancer stemness and tumour cell
migration in bone metastasised breast cancers. The metabolism of the cancer
cell is a key factor in its proliferation rate. Bioinformatics analysis on a
cancer mutation database shows that metabolism-modifying alterations constitute
an important class of key cancer mutations. Our approach models three types of
mutations: drivers, the order of which is relevant for the dynamics, metabolic
which support cancer growth and are estimated from existing databases, and
non--driver mutations. Our results provide a quantitative basis of how the
order of driver mutations and the metabolic mutations in different cancer
clones could impact proliferation of therapy-resistant clonal populations and
patient survival. Further mathematical modelling of the order of mutations is
presented in terms of operators. We believe our work is novel because it
quantifies two important factors in cancer spreading models: the order of
driver mutations and the effects of metabolic mutations.

for a population to relax back to equilibrium and the linewidth measured in a

violations of Mathiessen$'$s rule. In this work, we examine whether looking at

the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an
online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent
has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery
location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled

Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a
realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a
centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated
warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD
algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary
concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents

start by developing our main tool: the No Arbitrariness Principle, that we

Subsequently, we introduce the presence of the observer, analysing then the
relation objective-subjective and seeking objectivity going across
subjectivity. We take special care of establishing the precedence among all
contributions to mechanics, something that can be better appreciated by
considering the consequences of removing them: (a) the consequence of
renouncing logic and the laws of understanding is not being able to understand

time and space leads to a dissociation between everyday life and physics, the

long-standing research topic for automatic speech recognition that stills
remains an important challenge. Data-driven supervised approaches, including
ones based on deep neural networks, have recently emerged as potential
alternatives to traditional unsupervised approaches and with sufficient
training, can alleviate the shortcomings of the unsupervised methods in various
real-life acoustic environments. In this light, we review recently developed,
representative deep learning approaches for tackling non-stationary additive
and convolutional degradation of speech with the aim of providing guidelines
for those involved in the development of environmentally robust speech
recognition systems. We separately discuss single- and multi-channel techniques
developed for the front-end and back-end of speech recognition systems, as well
as joint front-end and back-end training frameworks.

supersoft source (SSS) since 1979, with effective temperature exceeding 40 eV
and variable X-ray luminosity, oscillating between a few times 10(35) erg/s and
a few times 10(37) erg/s. The optical, infrared and ultraviolet colors of the
optical object are consistent with an an accretion disk around a compact object
companion, which may either be a white dwarf, or a black hole, depending on the
system parameters. If the origin of the luminous supersoft X-rays is the
atmosphere of a white dwarf that is burning hydrogen in shell, it is as hot and
luminous as post-thermonuclear flash novae, yet no major optical outburst has
ever been observed, suggesting that the white dwarf is very massive (m>1.2
M(sol)) and it is accreting and burning at the high rate
(mdot>10(-8)M(sol)/year) expected for type Ia supernovae progenitors. In this
case, the X-ray variability may be due to a very short recurrence time of only
mildly degenerate thermonuclear flashes.

development since the previous release has been exporting the atomic data into
external data files. This greatly simplifies updates and maintenance of the
data. Many large datasets have been incorporated with the result that we can
now predict well over an order of magnitude more emission lines when all
databases are fully used. The use of such large datasets is not realistic for
most calculations due to the time and memory needs, and we describe the limited
subset of data we use by default. Despite the fact that we now predict
significantly more lines than the previous Cloudy release, this version is
faster because of optimization of memory access patterns and other tuning. The
size and use of the databases can easily be adjusted in the command-line
interface. We give examples of the accuracy limits using small models, and the
performance requirements of large complete models. We summarize several
advances in the H- and He-like iso-electronic sequences. We use our complete
collisional-radiative models of the ionization of these one and two-electron
ions to establish the highest density for which the coronal or interstellar
medium (ISM) approximation works, and the lowest density where Saha or local
thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed. The coronal approximation fails at
surprisingly low densities for collisional ionization equilibrium but is valid
to higher densities for photoionized gas clouds. Many other improvements to the
physics have been made and are described. These include the treatment of
isotropic continuum sources such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in
the reported output, and the ability to follow the evolution of cooling
non-equilibrium clouds.

pathologic event and the onset of symptoms. For typhoid fever, polio, measles,
leukemia and many other diseases, the incubation period is highly variable.
Some affected people take much longer than average to show symptoms, leading to
a distribution of incubation periods that is right skewed and often
approximately lognormal. Although this statistical pattern was discovered more
than sixty years ago, it remains an open question to explain its ubiquity. Here
we propose an explanation based on evolutionary dynamics on graphs. For simple
models of a mutant or pathogen invading a network-structured population of
healthy cells, we show that skewed distributions of incubation periods emerge
for a wide range of assumptions about invader fitness, competition dynamics,
and network structure. The skewness stems from stochastic mechanisms associated
with two classic problems in probability theory: the coupon collector and the
random walk. Unlike previous explanations that rely crucially on heterogeneity,
our results hold even for homogeneous populations. Thus, we predict that two
equally healthy individuals subjected to equal doses of equally pathogenic
agents may, by chance alone, show remarkably different time courses of disease.

large internal dynamo magnetic field generates a gigantic magnetosphere, which
is strongly rotational driven and possesses large plasma sources located deeply
within the magnetosphere. The combination of the latter two effects is the
primary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the
only known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a
mini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two
auroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to
the one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfv\'en wings
similar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within
0.1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres
presented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain
these magnetospheres. Jupiter's magnetospheric field is approximately
time-periodic at the locations of Jupiter's moons and induces secondary
magnetic fields in electrically conductive layers such as subsurface oceans. In
the case of Ganymede, these secondary magnetic fields influence the oscillation
of the location of its auroral ovals. Based on dedicated Hubble Space Telescope
observations, an analysis of the amplitudes of the auroral oscillations
provides evidence that Ganymede harbors a subsurface ocean. Callisto in
contrast does not possess a mini-magnetosphere, but still shows a perturbed

is different compared to the other Galilean satellites as it is primarily been
generated by solar photons compared to magnetospheric electrons.

November 15, 2014 (multi-chord). Our observations rule out an oblate spheroid
solution for 2003~AZ$_{84}$'s shape. Instead, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium,
we find that a Jacobi triaxial solution with semi axes $(470 \pm 20) \times
(383 \pm 10) \times (245 \pm 8)$~km % axis ratios $b/a= 0.82 \pm 0.05$ and
$c/a= 0.52 \pm 0.02$, can better account for all our occultation observations.
Combining these dimensions with the rotation period of the body (6.75~h) and
the amplitude of its rotation light curve, we derive a density $\rho=0.87 \pm
0.01$~g~cm$^{-3}$ a geometric albedo $p_V= 0.097 \pm 0.009$. A grazing chord
observed during the 2014 occultation reveals a topographic feature along
2003~AZ$_{84}$'s limb, that can be interpreted as an abrupt chasm of width
$\sim 23$~km and depth $> 8$~km or a smooth depression of width $\sim 80$~km
and depth $\sim 13$~km (or an intermediate feature between those two extremes).

correlations need to be taken into account to allow for valid inference.
Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-estimated
resulting in increased false-positive rates. Serial correlations in fMRI data
are commonly characterized in terms of a first-order autoregressive (AR)
process and then removed via pre-whitening. The required noise model for the
pre-whitening depends on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition
time (TR). Here we investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided
by simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in fMRI
time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate the optimal AR
model order for a sequence with a TR of less than 600 ms providing whole brain
coverage. We show that physiological noise modelling successfully reduces the
required AR model order, but remaining serial correlations necessitate an
advanced noise model. We conclude that commonly used noise models, such as the
AR(1) model, are inadequate for modelling serial correlations in fMRI using
sub-second TRs. Rather, physiological noise modelling in combination with
advanced pre-whitening schemes enable valid inference in single-subject
analysis using fast fMRI sequences.

applications toward gaining better and more rigorous error bars for tasks such
as parameter estimation (eg. magnetometry), tomography, and randomized
benchmarking. We start by providing a summary of the standard phenomenological
model of the NV optical process in terms of Lindblad jump operators. This model
is used to derive random variables describing emitted photons during
measurement, to which finite visibility, dark counts, and imperfect state
preparation are added. NV spin-state measurement is then stated as an abstract
statistical inference problem consisting of an underlying biased coin
obstructed by three Poisson rates. Relevant frequentist and Bayesian estimators
are provided, discussed, and quantitatively compared. We show numerically that
the risk of the maximum likelihood estimator is well approximated by the
Cramer-Rao bound, for which we provide a simple formula. Of the estimators, we
in particular promote the Bayes estimator, owing to its slightly better risk
performance, and straight-forward error propagation into more complex
experiments. This is illustrated on experimental data, where Quantum
Hamiltonian Learning is performed and cross-validated in a fully Bayesian
setting, and compared to a more traditional weighted least squares fit.

  Relationship",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clause Learning is one of the most important components of a conflict driven
clause learning (CDCL) SAT solver that is effective on industrial instances.
Since the number of learned clauses is proved to be exponential in the worse
case, it is necessary to identify the most relevant clauses to maintain and
delete the irrelevant ones. As reported in the literature, several learned
clauses deletion strategies have been proposed. However the diversity in both
the number of clauses to be removed at each step of reduction and the results
obtained with each strategy creates confusion to determine which criterion is
better. Thus, the problem to select which learned clauses are to be removed
during the search step remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to identify the most relevant learned clauses without favoring
or excluding any of the proposed measures, but by adopting the notion of
dominance relationship among those measures. Our approach bypasses the problem
of the diversity of results and reaches a compromise between the assessments of
these measures. Furthermore, the proposed approach also avoids another
non-trivial problem which is the amount of clauses to be deleted at each
reduction of the learned clause database.

human-level artificial intelligence, connectionist networks have been shown
successful in a broad range of applications due to their capacity for robust
learning and flexible inference under uncertainty. The idea of representing
symbolic knowledge in connectionist networks has been well-received and
attracted much attention from research community as this can establish a
foundation for integration of scalable learning and sound reasoning. In
previous work, there exist a number of approaches that map logical inference
rules with feed-forward propagation of artificial neural networks (ANN).
However, the discriminative structure of an ANN requires the separation of
input/output variables which makes it difficult for general reasoning where any
variables should be inferable. Other approaches address this issue by employing
generative models such as symmetric connectionist networks, however, they are
difficult and convoluted. In this paper we propose a novel method to represent
propositional formulas in restricted Boltzmann machines which is less complex,
especially in the cases of logical implications and Horn clauses. An
integration system is then developed and evaluated in real datasets which shows
promising results.

the bulk of the spectrum is strongly self-averaging, the first Lyapunov
exponent self-averages only weakly and at a rate that depends on the length
scale of the intermolecular forces; short-range repulsive forces quantitatively
dominate longer range attractive forces, which act as a weak perturbation that
slows the convergence to the thermodynamic limit. Regardless of intermolecular
forces, the fluctuations in the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate diverge, as one
expects for an extensive quantity, and the spontaneous fluctuations of these
dynamical observables obey fluctuation-dissipation like relationships.
Together, these results are a representation of the van der Waals picture of
fluids and another lens through which we can view the liquid state.

physics and the structure of their parent bodies, since their physical
properties have not changed much since their birth. Families have different
properties such as age, size, taxonomy, collision severity and others, and
understanding the effect of those properties on our observations of the
size-frequency distribution (SFD) of family fragments can give us important
insights into the hypervelocity collision processes at scales we cannot achieve
in our laboratories. Here we take as an example the very young Datura family,
with a small 8-km parent body, and compare its size distribution to other
families, with both large and small parent bodies, and created by both
catastrophic and cratering formation events. We conclude that most likely
explanation for the shallower size distribution compared to larger families is
a more pronounced observational bias because of its small size. Its size
distribution is perfectly normal when its parent body size is taken into
account. We also discuss some other possibilities. In addition, we study
another common feature: an offset or ""bump"" in the distribution occurring for a
few of the larger elements. We hypothesize that it can be explained by a newly
described regime of cratering, ""spall cratering"", which controls the majority
of impact craters on the surface of small asteroids like Datura.

research on barocaloric materials is receiving a deal of attention due to the
demonstration of giant barocaloric effects in shape-memory alloys. Regarding
polymers, there is still a lack of literature, despite their high caloric
potential. Thus, we present here giant barocaloric effects in natural rubber, a
low-cost and environmental friendly elastomer polymer. The maximum values of
entropy and temperature changes are larger than those previously reported for
any promising barocaloric material. Moreover, the huge normalized temperature
change and refrigerant capacity exhibited by natural rubber confirm its high
potential for cooling applications. We also verify a relevant dependence of the
barocaloric effect on the glass transition in natural rubber. Our findings
suggest that commercial refrigeration devices based on barocaloric effects from
elastomer polymers can be envisaged in the near future.

and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is considered to play a key role in
offsetting cooling. However, how AGN jets heat and suppress cooling flows
remains highly debated. Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,
we study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent
powerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex
gasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which
reverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas
moves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and
adiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer
regions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster
core, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas
accumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing
outflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later
times, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central
cooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback. We thus
envisage a picture of cool cluster cores going through cycles of
cooling-induced contraction and AGN-induced expansion. This picture naturally
predicts an anti-correlation between the gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) of
cool cores and the central gas entropy, which may be tested by X-ray
observations.

Corrections to the thermodynamical potential that go beyond the large-$N_c$
(LN) approximation are taken into account, and the region of the phase diagram
corresponding to intermediate chemical potentials and very low temperatures is
explored. The simultaneous presence of both the quark-antiquark and diquark
condensates can cause the system to behave as a fluid composed of a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) or a color superconductor one, in the form of a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid. The BEC-BCS crossover is then
studied in the nonperturbative OPT scheme. The results obtained in the context
of the OPT method are then contrasted with those obtained in the LN

to quark-quark and quark-antiquark interactions where the corrections beyond LN
brought by the OPT method can influence the behavior of the diquark condensate
and the effective quark mass as a function of the baryon chemical potential.
These changes in the behavior of the phase structure of the model modify the
location of the critical point related to the phase structure as a whole of the

that the nature of the phase transition can change as well, shifting the ratio

this work, we consider the problem of saving a critical subset of nodes from

the problem is para-NP-hard when parameterized by the size of the critical set.
We also show that it is fixed-parameter tractable on general graphs when

running times on trees and establish that the problem is unlikely to admit a
polynomial kernelization (even when restricted to trees). Our work is the first

that the problem of saving a critical set parameterized by the number of

significantly lower mid-infrared (MIR) to radio continuum intensity ratios. We

We locate 76 new Galactic SNR candidates in the THOR and VGPS combined survey

52 previously-known SNRs. The candidate SNRs have a similar spatial

candidates are on average smaller in angle compared to the known regions,
6.4'+/-4.7' versus 11.0'+/-7.8', and have lower integrated flux densities. If
the 76 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, for example using radio

matches the data, is in general non-convex. In this paper, we develop novel
theoretical results that provide performance guarantees for an approach to
solve these problems. Our solution decomposes this problem into two
sub-problems, for which efficient solutions are known. Specifically, a graph
topology inference (GTI) step is employed to select a feasible graph topology,
i.e., one having the desired property. Then, a graph weight estimation (GWE)
step is performed by solving a generalized graph Laplacian estimation problem,
where edges are constrained by the topology found in the GTI step. Our main
result is a bound on the error of the GWE step as a function of the error in
the GTI step. This error bound indicates that the GTI step should be solved
using an algorithm that approximates the similarity matrix by another matrix
whose entries have been thresholded to zero to have the desired type of graph
topology. The GTI stage can leverage existing methods (e.g., state of the art
approaches for graph coloring) which are typically based on minimizing the
total weight of removed edges. Since the GWE stage is formulated as an inverse
covariance estimation problem with linear constraints, it can be solved using
existing convex optimization methods. We demonstrate that our two step approach
can achieve good results for both synthetic and texture image data.

as a dimer-Mott (DM) insulator and exhibits a nonmagnetic transition at 25 K,
whereas the $\delta'_C$-type salt with a 3/4-filled band shows a charge
ordering (CO) transition just above room temperature and becomes nonmagnetic
below 20 K. The optical spectra of the $\delta_P'$-type salt are composed of
two characteristic bands due to intra- and interdimer charge transfers,
supporting the DM insulating behavior arising from the strong on-site Coulomb
interaction. By contrast, in the $\delta'_C$-type salt, a single band
characterizing the formation of CO arising from the off-site Coulomb
interactions is observed. Upon lowering the temperature, the shape of the
optical spectra in the $\delta_C'$-type salt becomes asymmetric and shifts to
much lower frequencies, suggesting the emergence of domain-wall excitations
with fractional charges expected in a one-dimensional CO chain. The temperature
dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the $\delta_P'$-type salt is well
described by a 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFM model on an anisotropic square
lattice in the dimerized picture, while in the $\delta_C'$-type salt, it can be
explained by a 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFM model on an anisotropic honeycomb

contained in the intersection of two curves, which do not share a common

  This implies that if $q$ is odd then an arc of size at least

of size at least $q-\sqrt{q}+\frac{7}{2}$ is contained in a conic if $q$ is

since then there are examples of arcs, not contained in a conic, of size

  These bounds improve on previously known bounds when $q$ is an odd square and

associate an algebraic curve in the dual plane containing the tangents to an

single phonon in a diamond mechanical resonator can be perfectly absorbed and
emitted by the NV centers ensemble (NVE) with adiabatically tuning the
microwave driving. An optical laser drives the NVE to the excited states, which
have much larger coupling strength to the mechanical mode. By adiabatically
eliminating the excited states under large detuning limit, the effective
coupling between the mechanical mode and the NVE can be used for QND
measurement of the single phonon state. Under realistic experimental

(maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing), and derive achievable spectral

Specifically, as influence propagation may take time, we assume that the
underlying social network may evolve during influence propagation.
Consequently, PROTEUSIM aims to select seeds in the current network to maximize
influence spread in the future instance of the network at the end of influence
propagation process without assuming complete topological knowledge of the
future network. We propose a greedy and a Reverse Reachable (RR) set-based
algorithms called PROTEUS-GENIE and PROTEUS-SEER, respectively, to address this
problem. Our algorithms utilize the state-of-the-art Forest Fire Model for
modeling network evolution during influence propagation to find superior
quality seeds. Experimental study on real and synthetic social networks shows
that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art classical
IM algorithms with respect to seed set quality.

feature of many collaborative efforts that lead to the new social value. The
underlying empirical data thus offer a unique opportunity to study the origin
of self-organised criticality in social systems. In contrast to physical
systems in the laboratory, various human attributes of the actors play an
essential role in the process along with the contents (cognitive, emotional) of
the communicated artefacts. As a prototypal example, we consider the social
endeavour of knowledge creation via Questions\ \& Answers (Q\&A). Using a large
empirical dataset from one of such Q\&A sites and theoretical modelling, we
examine the temporal correlations at all scales and the role of cognitive
contents to the avalanches of the knowledge creation process. Our analysis
shows that the long-range correlations and the event clustering are primarily
determined by the universal social dynamics, providing the external driving of
the system by the arrival of new users. While the involved cognitive contents
(systematically annotated in the data and observed in the model) are crucial
for a fine structure of the developing knowledge networks, they only affect the
values of the scaling exponents and the geometry of large avalanches and shape
the multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the level of the activity
of the communities that share the knowledge correlates with the fluctuations of
the innovation rate, implying that the increase of innovation may serve as the
active principle of self-organisation. To identify relevant parameters and
unravel the role of the network evolution underlying the process in the social
system under consideration, we compare the social avalanches to the avalanche
sequences occurring in the field-driven physical model of disordered solids.

Indeed,
no proper dynamics in known to start with and we still lack the mathematical
tools to study its would-be continuum limit. In the present PhD dissertation,
we will investigate some coarse-graining methods that should become helpful in
this enterprise. We concentrate on two aspects of the theory's coarse-graining:
finding natural large scale observables on one hand and studying how the
dynamics of varying graphs could be cast onto fixed graphs on the other hand.
  To determine large scale observables, we study the case of hyperbolic
tetrahedra and their natural description in a language close to loop quantum
gravity. The surface holonomies in particular play an important role. This
highlights the structure of double spin networks, which consist in a graph and
its dual, which seems to also appear in works from Freidel et al. To solve the
problem of varying graphs, we consider and define loopy spin networks. They
encode the local curvature with loops around an effective vertex and allow to
describe different graphs by hidding them in a coarse-graining process.
Moreover, their definition gives a natural procedure for coarse-graining
allowing to relate different scales.
  Together, these two results constitute the foundation of a coarse-graining
programme for diffeomorphism invariant theories.

extensively studied for image or video search in recent years. Benefit from
recent advances in deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising
results for image retrieval. However, there are some limitations of previous
deep hashing methods (e.g., the semantic information is not fully exploited).
In this paper, we develop a deep supervised discrete hashing algorithm based on
the assumption that the learned binary codes should be ideal for
classification. Both the pairwise label information and the classification
information are used to learn the hash codes within one stream framework. We
constrain the outputs of the last layer to be binary codes directly, which is
rarely investigated in deep hashing algorithm. Because of the discrete nature
of hash codes, an alternating minimization method is used to optimize the
objective function. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

phases of some solar flares. Synthetic X-ray line spectra of the distributions
composed of the distribution of shock reflected electrons and the background
Maxwellian distribution are calculated in the approximation of non-Maxwellian
ionization, recombination, excitation and de-excitation rates. The distribution
of shock reflected electrons is determined analytically. We found that the
distribution of electrons reflected at the nearly-perpendicular shock
resembles, at its high-energy part, the so called n-distribution. Therefore it
could be able to explain the enhanced intensities of Si XIId satellite lines.
However, in the region immediately in front of the shock its effect is small
because electrons in background Maxwellian plasma are much more numerous there.
Therefore, we propose a model in which the shock reflected electrons propagate
to regions with smaller densities and different temperatures. Combining the
distribution of the shock-reflected electrons with the Maxwellian distribution
having different densities and temperatures we found that spectra with enhanced
intensities of the satellite lines are formed at low densities and temperatures
of the background plasma when the combined distribution is very similar to the
n-distribution also in its low-energy part. In these cases, the distribution of
the shock-reflected electrons controls the intensity ratio of the allowed Si
XIII and Si XIV lines to the Si XIId satellite lines. The high electron
densities of the background plasma reduce the effect of shock-reflected
electrons on the composed electron distribution function, which leads to the
Maxwellian spectra.

always exhibit a positive deflection if the energy conditions are satisfied
(nonexotic matter content). In contrast, if the energy conditions are violated
(exotic matter), the net deflection of a light ray may be positive, negative or
even zero, depending on values of the metric and impact parameters. This
prompts us to introduce a surface defined by a turning point value at which the
net deflection of a light ray is equal to zero, even though we have a curved
spacetime geometry. We argue that the existence of such a surface may be linked
to exotic/energy condition violating matter. Wormholes in modified gravity with
matter satisfying the energy conditions do not seem to have such a zero

field in a system of finite volume is studied within statistical field theory.
The canonical ensemble, corresponding to a fixed total integrated order
parameter, is obtained as a special case of the theory. A perturbative
expansion is developed which allows one to systematically determine the
constraint-induced finite-volume corrections to the free energy and to
correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the Landau-Ginzburg model in
a film geometry (i.e., a rectangular parallelepiped with a small aspect ratio)
with periodic, Dirichlet, or Neumann boundary conditions in the transverse
direction and periodic boundary conditions in the remaining, lateral
directions. Within the expansion in terms of $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the
spatial dimension of the bulk, the finite-size contribution to the free energy
and the associated critical Casimir force are calculated to leading order in
$\epsilon$ and are compared to the corresponding expressions for an
unconstrained (grand canonical) system. The constraint restricts the
fluctuations within the system and it accordingly modifies the residual
finite-size free energy. The resulting Casimir force is shown to depend on
whether it is defined by assuming a fixed transverse area or a fixed total
volume. In the former case, the constraint is typically found to significantly
enhance the attractive character of the force as compared to the grand
canonical case. In contrast to the grand canonical Casimir force, which, for
supercritical temperatures, vanishes in the limit of thick films, the canonical
Casimir force defined for fixed transverse area attains for thick films a
negative value for all boundary conditions studied here. Typically, the
dependence of the Casimir force both on the temperature- and on the field-like
scaling variables is different in the two ensembles.

ranging from testing theories of gravity to detecting gravitational waves. Also
an external reference system suitable for autonomous space navigation can be
defined by pulsars, using them as natural navigation beacons, not unlike the

measured on-board a spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at a reference
location (e.g. the solar system barycenter), the spacecraft position can be
determined autonomously and with high accuracy everywhere in the solar system

hysteresis in the state equation leads to difficulties concerning the analysis

First, neuronal cells may form dense clusters, making it difficult to correctly

segmentation results of the known FCN-type models are not accurate enough.
Second, pixel-wise ground truth is difficult to obtain. Only a limited amount

Unfortunately, thermal convection has never been touched in transformation
theories due to the lack of a suitable theory, thus limiting applications
associated with heat transfer through fluids (liquid or gas). Here, we develop,
for the first time, a general theory of transformation thermal convection by
considering the convection-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation, and
the Darcy law. By introducing porous media, we get a set of coupled equations
keeping their forms under coordinate transformation. As model applications, the
theory helps to show the effects of cloaking, concentrating, and camouflage.
Our finite element simulations confirm the theoretical findings. This work
offers a general transformation theory for thermal convection, thus revealing
some novel behaviors of thermal convection; it not only provides new hints on
how to control heat transfer by combining thermal conduction, thermal
radiation, and thermal convection, but also benefits the study of mass
diffusion and other related fields that contain a set of equations and need to

transfer based on the Volume-of-Fluid methodology. The implementation has been
accomplished using a second-order finite volume method with support for

such as efficient and ultrabroadband emitters of terahertz electromagnetic
radiation. So far, predominantly standard ferromagnetic materials have been
exploited. Here, by introducing a suitable figure of merit, we systematically
compare the strength of terahertz emission from X/Pt bilayers with X being a
complex ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnetic metal, that is, dysprosium cobalt
(DyCo$_5$), gadolinium iron (Gd$_{24}$Fe$_{76}$), Magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$) and
iron rhodium (FeRh). We find that the performance in terms of spin-current
generation not only depends on the spin polarization of the magnet's conduction
electrons but also on the specific interface conditions, thereby suggesting
terahertz emission spectroscopy to be a highly surface-sensitive technique. In
general, our results are relevant for all applications that rely on the optical
generation of ultrafast spin currents in spintronic metallic multilayers.

in the electron-doped cuprate superconductors is investigated based on the t-J
model. The experimentally observed momentum dependence of the electron
quasiparticle scattering rate is qualitatively reproduced, where the scattering
rate is highly anisotropic in momentum space, and is intriguingly related to
the charge-order gap. Although the scattering strength appears to be weakest at
the hot spots, the scattering in the antinodal region is stronger than that in
the nodal region, which leads to the original electron Fermi surface is broken
up into the Fermi pockets and their coexistence with the Fermi arcs located
around the nodal region. In particular, this electron Fermi surface instability
drives the charge-order correlation, with the charge-order wave vector that
matches well with the wave vector connecting the hot spots, as the charge-order
correlation in the hole-doped counterparts. However, in a striking contrast to
the hole-doped case, the charge-order wave vector in the electron-doped side
increases in magnitude with the electron doping. The theory also shows the
existence of a quantitative link between the single-electron fermiology and the
collective response of the electron density.

or frequency leads to an inevitable Rate-Energy (RE) trade-off in the presence
of simultaneous Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). In echoing Varshney's seminal
concept of jointly transmitting both information and energy, we propose the
so-called Generalised Precoded Spatial Modulation (GPSM) aided Integrated
Wireless Information and Power Transfer (IWIPT) concept employing a power-split
receiver. The principle of GPSM is that a particular subset of Receive Antennas
(RA) is activated and the activation pattern itself conveys useful information.
Hence, the novelty of our GPSM aided IWIPT concept is that RA pattern-based
information transfer is used in addition to the conventional waveform-based
information carried by the classic M-ary modulation. Following the Radio
Frequency (RF) to Direct Current (DC) power conversion invoked for WPT at the
power-split receiver, the non-coherent detector simply compares the remaining
received power accumulated by each legitimate RA pattern for the sake of
identifying the most likely RA. This operation is then followed by
down-conversion and conventional Base Band (BB) M-ary detection. Both our
analysis and simulations show that the RA pattern based information transfer
represented in the Spatial Domain (SD) exhibits a beneficial immunity to any
potential power conversion induced performance degradation and hence improves
the overall RE trade-off when additionally the waveform-based information
transfer is also taken into account. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
realistic imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) as well
as that of the antenna correlations encountered. Finally, the system's
asymptotic performance is characterised in the context of large-scale Multiple

in clinical decision-making that otherwise may not be available. We demonstrate
how bivariate meta-analysis (BVMA) can be used to predict unreported estimate
of a treatment effect enabling implementation of multi-state Markov model,
which otherwise needs to be simplified. To illustrate this, we used an example
of cost-effectiveness analysis for docetaxel in combination with prednisolone
in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (mHRPC). BVMA was used to
model jointly available data on treatment effects on overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) to predict the unreported effect on PFS in a
study evaluating docetaxel. Predicted treatment effect on PFS allowed
implementation of a three-state Markov model comprising of stable disease,
progressive disease and death states, whilst lack of the estimate restricted
the model to two-state model (stable disease and death states). The two-state
and three-state models were compared by calculating incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios, which was much lower in the three-state model:
{\pounds}21966 per QALY gained compared to {\pounds}30026 obtained from the
two-state model. In contrast to the two-state model, the three-state model has
the advantage of distinguishing patients who progressed from those who did not
progress. The use of advanced meta-analytic technique helped to obtain relevant
parameter estimate to populate a model which describes natural history more
accurately, and at the same helped to prevent valuable clinical data from being

Software quality tool vendors have responded to this need by positioning their
tools to detect and manage technical debt. While these tools bundle a number of
rules, it is hard for users to understand which rules identify design issues,
as opposed to syntactic quality. This is important, since previous studies have
revealed the most significant technical debt is related to design issues. Other
research has focused on comparing these tools on open source projects, but

on the orientation of the upstream magnetic field with respect to the local
normal to the shock front (quasi-parallel/quasi-perpendicular) is debated.
Cassini spacecraft observations at Saturn's bow shock has revealed examples of
electron acceleration under quasi-perpendicular conditions, and the first in
situ evidence of electron acceleration at a quasi-parallel shock. Here we use
Cassini data to make the first comparison between energy spectra of locally
accelerated electrons under these differing upstream magnetic field regimes. We
present data taken during a quasi-perpendicular shock crossing on 2008 March 8
and during a quasi-parallel shock crossing on 2007 February 3, highlighting
that both were associated with electron acceleration to at least MeV energies.
The magnetic signature of the quasi-perpendicular crossing has a relatively
sharp upstream-downstream transition, and energetic electrons were detected
close to the transition and immediately downstream. The magnetic transition at
the quasi-parallel crossing is less clear, energetic electrons were encountered
upstream and downstream, and the electron energy spectrum is harder above ~100
keV. We discuss whether the acceleration is consistent with diffusive shock
acceleration theory in each case, and suggest that the quasi-parallel spectral

distributions. Over the years, many mathematical, statistical and algorithmic

various incoherence assumptions. Bresler gave an algorithm for learning general
Ising models on bounded degree graphs. His approach was based on a structural
result about mutual information in Ising models.
  Here we take a more conceptual approach to proving lower bounds on the mutual
information through setting up an appropriate zero-sum game. Our proof
generalizes well beyond Ising models, to arbitrary Markov random fields with
higher order interactions. As an application, we obtain algorithms for learning
Markov random fields on bounded degree graphs on $n$ nodes with $r$-order
interactions in $n^r$ time and $\log n$ sample complexity. The sample
complexity is information theoretically optimal up to the dependence on the

dielectrics. Here, we explore de-ionized (DI) water as a solution top gate for
field-effect switching of layered semiconductors including SnS2, MoS2, and
black phosphorus. The DI water gate is easily fabricated, can sustain rapid
bias changes, and its efficient coupling to layered materials provides high
on-off current ratios, a near-ideal sub-threshold swing, and enhanced
shortchannel behavior even for FETs with thick, bulk-like channels. Screening
by the high-k solution gate eliminates hysteresis due to surface and interface
trap states and substantially enhances the field-effect mobility. The onset of
water electrolysis sets the ultimate limit to DI water gating at large negative
gate bias. Measurements in this regime show promise for aqueous sensing,
demonstrated here by the amperometric detection of glucose in aqueous solution.
DI water gating of layered semiconductors can be harnessed in research on novel
materials and devices, and it may with further development find broad
applications in microelectronics and sensing.

Augmented Lagrangian (AL) algorithm used to solve convex optimization problems
involving globally coupled linear constraints. Our method relies on the
Accelerated Distributed Augmented Lagrangian (ADAL) algorithm, which can handle
the coupled linear constraints in a distributed manner based on local estimates
of the AL. We show that the theoretical complexity of ADAL to reach an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution both in terms of suboptimality and infeasibility is
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations. Moreover, we provide a valid upper bound
for the optimal dual multiplier which enables us to explicitly specify these
complexity bounds. We also show how to choose the stepsize parameter to
minimize the bounds on the convergence rates. Finally, we discuss a motivating
example, a model predictive control (MPC) problem, involving a finite number of
subsystems which interact with each other via a general network.

Interdependencies between both concepts are proved in topological vector spaces
by means of Gerstewitz functionals. The investigation includes proper
efficiency notions introduced by Henig and by Nehse and Iwanow. In contrary to
Henig's notion, proper efficiency by Nehse and Iwanow is defined as efficiency
with respect to certain convex sets which are not necessarily cones. For the
finite-dimensional case, we turn to Geoffrion's proper efficiency as a special
case of Henig's proper efficiency. It is characterized as efficiency with
regard to subclasses of the set of polyhedral cones. Conditions for the

commits to an adaptive decision pertaining only to the past and locally

optimal elastic moduli by fitting numerically generated axisymmetric shapes
optimally to an experimental image. For each digitized image of a deflated
capsule elastic moduli can be determined, if another image of its undeformed
reference shape is provided. Within this paper, we focus on nonlinear Hookean
elasticity because of its low computational cost its wide applicability, but
also discuss and implement alternative constitutive laws. For Hookean
elasticity, Young's surface modulus (or, alternatively, area compression
modulus) and Poisson's ratio are determined; for Mooney-Rivlin elasticity, the
Rivlin modulus and a dimensionless shape parameter are determined; for
neo-Hookean elasticity, only the Rivlin modulus is determined, using a fixed
dimensionless shape parameter. Comparing results for different models we find
that nonlinear Hookean elasticity is adequate for most capsules. If series of
images are available, these moduli can be evaluated as a function of the
capsule volume to analyze hysteresis or aging effects depending on the
deformation history. An additional wrinkling wavelength measurement allows the
user to determine the bending modulus, from which the layer thickness can be
derived. We verify the method by analyzing several materials, compare the
results to available rheological measurements, and review several applications.

three-dimensional QED with two flavors of two-component fermions. The
dependence of $C^f_J$ on the scale is weak with a tendency to be below the free
field value at intermediate distances. Our numerical data suggests that the
flavor-triplet fermion current and the topological current correlators become
degenerate within numerical errors in the infra-red limit, thereby supporting
an enhanced O(4) symmetry predicted by strong self-duality. Further, we
demonstrate that fermion dynamics is necessary for the scale-invariant behavior
of parity-invariant three-dimensional QED by showing that the pure gauge theory
with non-compact gauge action has non-zero bilinear condensate.

NS-imploding dark matter forms $\sim 10^{-10}$ solar mass or smaller black
holes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into
$\sim$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers

less than the explosion energy. This finding is compatible with the jet

clustering at scales of 500 Mpc and greater has a periodic time component
induced by oscillations in the scale factor at a frequency of approximately 7
cycles over one Hubble time. The scale factor oscillations were discovered in
previous work by analyzing the Hubble diagram for type 1a SNe data. In the
present work we analyze galaxy number count data from SDSSIII-BOSS, DR9 using a
simple oscillating expanding space model and also perform a Fourier analysis of
the same SDSSIII data set . The number distribution of galaxies on these scales
should be relatively smooth. However, a DR9 plot of galaxy number count per
0.01 redshift bin as a function of redshift shows significant bumps to redshift
0.5. Later releases show the same behavior. Our model fits essentially all
bumps at 99.8% confidence once the oscillation is included. A Fourier analysis
of the same number count vs. redshift data (processed only to convert redshift
to equal time bins) clearly shows the dominant 7-cycle signal at 15/1
signal-to-noise ratio. The DR9 galaxy number count peaks near redshift 0.5 and
then falls off due to target magnitude limitations. In our model we assume
ideal observation to all redshifts. The oscillation model displays a matching
peak at redshift 0.5, then falls, but continues on to rise predicting a second
peak at redshift 0.64. Confirmation of the second peak from future SDSSIV data
to higher redshift would further support our observation of oscillations in the

in days, an asymptotic approximation is proposed for the distribution of the
maximum daily precipitation volume within a wet period. This approximation has
the form of a scale mixture of the Frechet distribution with the gamma mixing
distribution and coincides with the distribution of a positive power of a
random variable having the Snedecor-Fisher distribution. The proof of this
result is based on the representation of the negative binomial distribution as
a mixed geometric (and hence, mixed Poisson) distribution and limit theorems
for extreme order statistics in samples with random sizes having mixed Poisson
distributions. Some analytic properties of the obtained limit distribution are
described. In particular, it is demonstrated that under certain conditions the
limit distribution is mixed exponential and hence, is infinitely divisible. It
is shown that under the same conditions the limit distribution can be
represented as a scale mixture of stable or Weibull or Pareto or folded normal
laws. The corresponding product representations for the limit random variable
can be used for its computer simulation. Several methods are proposed for the
estimation of the parameters of the distribution of the maximum daily
precipitation volume. The results of fitting this distribution to real data are
presented illustrating high adequacy of the proposed model. The obtained

  winds, snow and drought",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The chance (or probability) of a dam failure can change for various reasons
such as structural degradation, the impacts of climate change and land-use
change. Similarly the consequences of dam failure (flooding) can change for
many reasons such as growth in the population in areas below a dam.
Consequently both the chance that a dam might fail and the likely consequences
of that failure can change over time. It is therefore crucial that reservoir
safety risk analysis methods and decision-making processes are able to support
(as a minimum) what-if testing (or sensitivity testing) to take into account
these changes over time to gauge their effect on the estimated risk of dam
failure. The consequences of a dam failure relate to the vulnerability and
exposure of the receptors (for example, people, property and environment) to
floodwater. Also the probability of dam failure varies with age, design and
construction of the dam. Spillway failure may be caused by the dissipation of
energy from water flowing down the spillway, and embankment erosion (scour) may
be caused by a dam overtopping. The occurrence of these events depends upon the
dam design and the likelihood of extreme rainfall, also in the case of
overtopping wind-driven waves on the reservoir surface. In this study the
meteorological situations of notable recent events i.e. the Boltby, North
Yorkshire incident, 19 June 2005 in which the dam almost overtopped, and the
spillway failure of the Ulley Dam near Rotherham at the end of June 2007, are
studied. The WRF numerical model will be used to indicate how these
meteorological situations might be maximized, and be coupled with the
occurrence of other failure modes such as the likelihood of internal dam
failure assessed from previous work by government panel engineers.

In this paper we
propose a self-feedback scheme to control birhythmicity. To establish the
efficacy and generality of the proposed control scheme, we apply it on three
birhythmic oscillators from diverse fields of natural science, namely, an
energy harvesting system, the p53-Mdm2 network for protein genesis (the OAK
model) and a glycolysis model (modified Decroly-Goldbeter model). Using the
harmonic decomposition technique and energy balance method we derive the
analytical conditions for the control of birhythmicity. A detailed numerical
bifurcation analysis in the parameter space establishes that the control scheme
is capable of eliminating birhythmicity and it can also induce transitions
between different forms of bistability. As the proposed control scheme is quite
general, it can be applied for control of several real systems, particularly in
biochemical and engineering systems.

sensor data. We design a locally differentially private recovery algorithm for
the 1-dimensional, discrete heat source location problem and analyse its
performance in terms of the Earth Mover Distance error. Our work indicates that
it is possible to produce locally private sensor measurements that both keep
the exact locations of the heat sources private and permit recovery of the
""general geographic vicinity"" of the sources. We also discuss the relationship
between the property of an inverse problem being ill-conditioned and the amount
of noise needed to maintain privacy.

Recognition of automated brain tumor in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a

automatic method detects all the type of cancer present in the body. Previous
methods for tumor are time consuming and less accurate. In the present work,
statistical analysis morphological and thresholding techniques are used to
process the images obtained by MRI. Feed-forward back-prop neural network is
used to classify the performance of tumors part of the image. This method
results high accuracy and less iterations detection which further reduces the

implementation of bank policies and offering financial products. This paper
uses cluster analysis of behaviour of credit card accounts to help assess
credit risk level. Account behaviour is modelled parametrically and we then
implement the behavioural cluster analysis using a recently proposed
dissimilarity measure of statistical model parameters. The advantage of this
new measure is the explicit exploitation of uncertainty associated with
parameters estimated from statistical models. Interesting clusters of real
credit card behaviours data are obtained, in addition to superior prediction
and forecasting of account default based on the clustering outcomes.

equal values, xt1 = xt2, t1 = t2, were neglected and only inequalities between
the xt were considered. Since then, this measure has been modified and
extended, in particular in cases when the amount of equal values in the series
can not be neglected, (i.e. heart rate variability (HRV) time series). We
review the different existing methodologies that treats this subject by
classifying them according to their different strategies. In addition, a novel
Bayesian Missing Data Imputation is presented that proves to outperform the
existing methodologies that deals with type of time series. All this facts are
illustrated by simulations and also by distinguishing patients suffering from
Congestive Heart Failure from a (healthy) control group using HRV time series
