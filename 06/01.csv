component of end-to-end neural machine translation models. However, previous
attention models always refer to some source words when predicting a target
word, which contradicts with the fact that some target words have no
corresponding source words. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel
attention model that has the capability of determining when a decoder should
attend to source words and when it should not. Experimental results on NIST
Chinese-English translation tasks show that the new model achieves an
improvement of 0.8 BLEU score over a state-of-the-art baseline.

of certain random planar maps converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity
($\gamma$-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized
matings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\gamma$ ranges from $0$ to
$2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated
space-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling
SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa =16/\gamma^2$ (in the annealed sense) and that
simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the
quenched sense).
  This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal embedding of
a random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been
conjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained
approximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps,
bipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for
proving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well.
  To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting)
theorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE. There is a natural
way to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into ""cells"" corresponding to
vertices of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the
origin-containing cell, in particular proving moments for the ratio of its
squared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the
origin-containing cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire
configuration. Ultimately, we use these properties to show (with the help of a
general theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells
converges to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte
embedding result.

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side are studied. The gas is assumed to be
sufficiently dilute so that the pairing of atoms can be considered effective
only in s-wave between fermions of different internal state. The order
parameter at equilibrium is determined by the mean-field approximation, while
the properties of the collective modes are calculated within a Gaussian
approximation for the fluctuations of the order parameter. In particular we
investigate the effects of asymmetry between the populations of the two
different components and of temperature on the frequency and damping of
collective modes. It is found that the temperature does not much affect the
frequency and the damping of the modes, whereas an increase of the imbalance
shifts the frequency toward lower values and enhances the damping sensitively.
Besides the Bogoliubov-Anderson phonons, we observe modes at zero frequency for
finite values of the wave-number. These modes indicate that an instability
develops driving the system toward two separate phases, normal and superfluid.

re-detection module is activated only when the correlation response of the

proposals which are temporally filtered using a Gaussian mixture probability
hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter to find the detection proposal with the
maximum weight as the target state estimate by removing the other detection
proposals as clutter. Finally, we learn a scale correlation filter for
estimating the scale of a target by constructing a target pyramid around the

that a good understanding of the EBL is included. In this work, an
investigation into the imprint of the EBL on the observed spectra of high
redshift Fermi-LAT AGN is presented. By fitting the spectrum below $\sim$10
GeV, an estimation of the un-absorbed intrinsic source spectrum is obtained; by
applying this spectrum to data up to 300 GeV, it is then possible to derive a
scaling factor for different EBL models. A second approach uses 5 sources (PKS
0426-380, 4C +55.17, Ton 116, PG 1246+586 and RBS 1432) which were found to
exhibit very high energy emission ($E_{\gamma}>100$ GeV). Through Monte Carlo

computational & autonomous complexity respectively. Subsequently, building on

allows for a representation of both, biological & synthetic systems in a common

embodiment: (i) biological consciousness, (ii) synthetic consciousness, (iii)
group consciousness (resulting from group interactions), & (iv) simulated

windows and 208 normal windows. We did 100 cycles of cross validation where we
shuffled training sets between cycles. For all the division between training
and evaluation was 70%-30%.
  We found and evaluated a 5-dimenstional vector with four features from the
time domain and one from the spectrum domain. We evaluated several classifiers
and found SVM with a Radial Basis Function Kernel to perform best. Our approach
had a precision of 86% and recall of 84% for classifying a crackle in a window,

low-dimensional feature vector makes the SVM very fast. The model can be
trained on a regular computer in 1.44 seconds, and 319 crackles can be
classified in 1.08 seconds.

crystals of bismuth, which is a semi metal with extremely low carrier density.
At such low density, we argue that conventional electron-phonon coupling is too
weak to be responsible for the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. We study
a dynamically screened Coulomb interaction with effective attraction generated
on the scale of the collective plasma modes. We model the electronic states in
bismuth to include three Dirac pockets with high velocity and one hole pocket
with a significantly smaller velocity. We find a weak coupling instability,
which is greatly enhanced by the presence of the hole pocket. Therefore, we
argue that bismuth is the first material to exhibit superconductivity driven by
retardation effects of Coulomb repulsion alone. By using realistic parameters
for bismuth we find that the acoustic plasma mode does not play the central
role in pairing. We also discuss a matrix element effect, resulting from the
Dirac nature of the conduction band, which may affect $T_c$ in the $s$-wave
channel without breaking time-reversal symmetry.

not presuppose knowledge of which elements are important for distinguishing
stars in chemical space. We use ~16,000 red-giant and red-clump H-band spectra

components with high signal in the wavelength regions most important for
distinguishing between stars. Different subsamples of red-giant and red-clump
stars are all consistent with needing about 10 principal components to
accurately model the spectra above the level of the measurement uncertainties.
The dimensionality of stellar chemical space that can be investigated in the
H-band is therefore $\lesssim 10$. For APOGEE observations with typical
signal-to-noise ratios of 100, the number of chemical space cells within which
stars cannot be distinguished is approximately $10^{10\pm2} \times (5\pm

primary driver of the cosmic evolution of [OIII]/H$\beta$ and [NII]/H$\alpha$.
For [SII]/H$\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\alpha$, this applies only to redshifts above
$z=1.5$, the evolution at lower redshift being driven in roughly equal parts by
nebular emission from AGN and post-AGB stars. Instead, changes in the hardness
of ionizing radiation, ionized-gas density, the prevalence of BH accretion
relative to star formation and the dust-to-metal mass ratio (whose impact on
the gas-phase N/O ratio we model at fixed O/H) play at most a minor role in the

stellar population scaling relations and the dependence of the population
properties on local environment, extended to the low-{\sigma} regime of dEs.
The ages in our sample show more scatter at lower {\sigma} values, indicative
of less massive galaxies being affected by the environment to a higher degree.
The shape of the age-{\sigma} relation for cluster vs. non-cluster galaxies
suggests that cluster environment speeds up the placing of galaxies on the red
sequence. While the scaling relations are tighter for cluster than for the
field/group objects, we find no evidence for a difference in average population
characteristics of the two samples. We investigate the properties of our sample
in the Virgo cluster as a function of number density (rather than simple
clustrocentric distance) and find that dE ages negatively correlate with the
local density, likely because galaxies in regions of lower density are later
arrivals to the cluster or have experienced less pre-processing in groups, and
consequently used up their gas reservoir more recently. Overall, dE properties
correlate more strongly with density than those of massive ETGs, which was
expected as less massive galaxies are more susceptible to external influences.

limit our discussion to the flat-band regime. We find in this limit that the
diffusion pole which would normally obtain at finite energy is pushed to zero
energy resulting in a vanishing of the diffusion constant. This occurs even in
the presence of interactions in certain limits, indicating the robustness of
this result to the inclusion of a scale in the problem. Consequently,
scale-invariance precludes any reasonable definition of the diffusion constant.
Nonetheless, we do find that a scale can be defined, all be it, irrelevant to
diffusion, which is the product of the squared band velocity and the density of

places fundamental constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.
Previously, the disk's structure has been studied in terms of populations
defined geometrically and/or chemically, but a decomposition based on stellar
ages provides a more direct connection to the history of the disk, and stronger
constraint on theory. Here, we use positions, abundances and ages for 31,244
red giant branch stars from the SDSS-APOGEE survey, spanning $3 <
R_{\mathrm{gc}} < 15$ kpc, to dissect the disk into mono-age and mono-[Fe/H]
populations at low and high [$\alpha$/Fe]. For each population, with $\Delta
\mathrm{age} < 2$ Gyr and $\Delta \mathrm{[Fe/H]} < 0.1$ dex, we measure the
structure and surface-mass density contribution. We find that low [$\alpha$/Fe]
mono-age populations are fit well by a broken exponential, which increases to a
peak radius and decreases thereafter. We show that this profile becomes broader
with age, interpreted here as a new signal of disk heating and radial
migration. High [$\alpha$/Fe] populations are well fit as single exponentials
within the radial range considered, with an average scale length of $1.9\pm
0.1$ kpc. We find that the relative contribution of high to low [$\alpha$/Fe]
populations at $R_0$ is $f_\Sigma = 18\% \pm 5\%$; high [$\alpha$/Fe]
contributes most of the mass at old ages, and low [$\alpha$/Fe] at young ages.
The low and high [$\alpha$/Fe] populations overlap in age at intermediate
[Fe/H], although both contribute mass at $R_{0}$ across the full range of
[Fe/H]. The mass weighted scale height $h_Z$ distribution is a smoothly
declining exponential function. High [$\alpha$/Fe] populations are thicker than
low [$\alpha$/Fe], and the average $h_Z$ increases steadily with age, between
200 and 600 pc.

holes. Our bound relates transport data --- including the electrical
resistivity and the shear viscosity --- to the local equilibration time, even

between the ISM and ICM. We found that hot coronae evaporate on $\sim 10^2$ Myr
timescales, significantly shorter than the $\sim 10^3$ Myr gas loss times due
to ram pressure stripping. No tails of stripped gas are formed. This is in
tension with the observed ubiquity and implied longevity of compact X-ray
coronae and stripped ISM tails, and requires the suppression of evaporation,
possibly due to magnetic fields and anisotropic conduction. We perform a series
of wind tunnel simulations similar to Paper I, now including ISM and ICM
magnetic fields. We simulate the effect of anisotropic conduction for a range
of extreme magnetic field configurations: parallel and perpendicular to the ICM
wind, and continuous and completely disjoint between the ISM and ICM. We find
that when conduction is anisotropic, gas loss due to evaporation is severely
reduced; the overall gas loss rates with and without anisotropic conduction do
not differ by more than $10 - 20\%$. Magnetic fields also prevent stripped
tails from evaporating in the ICM by shielding, and providing few pathways for
heat transport between the ICM and ISM. The morphology of stripped tails and
magnetic fields in the tails and wakes of galaxies are sensitive to the initial

supports two distinct broken-symmetry MBL phases at strong disorder that either
break the ${\mathbb{Z}_3}$ clock symmetry or a ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$ chiral
symmetry. In a dual formulation, our results indicate the existence of a stable
finite-temperature topological phase with MBL-protected parafermionic end zero
modes. While we find a thermal symmetry-preserving regime for weak disorder,
scaling analysis at strong disorder points to an infinite-randomness critical
point between two distinct broken-symmetry MBL phases.

researched applications of quantum computing. The majority of quantum
algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using $N$ Gaussian
orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with ${\cal O}(N^4)$ second-quantized terms.
We avoid this overhead and extend methods to the condensed phase by utilizing a
dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator,
leading to a Hamiltonian representation with ${\cal O}(N^2)$ second-quantized
terms. Using this representation we can implement single Trotter steps of the
Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the
basis allow us to deploy Trotter and Taylor series based simulations with
respective circuit depths of ${\cal O}(N^{7/2})$ and $\widetilde{\cal
O}(N^{8/3})$ for fixed charge densities - both are large asymptotic
improvements over all prior results. Variational algorithms also require
significantly fewer measurements to find the mean energy in this basis,
ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. We conclude with a proposal
to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low depth variational
ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices. From these results we identify
simulations of low density jellium as a promising first setting to explore
quantum supremacy in electronic structure.

Telluric features are corrected to the noise level. We place a 5-sigma upper

show that only 1 transit with ESPRESSO would be sufficient to detect water
vapor on HD189733b-like hot Jupiter with a cloud-free atmosphere. Upcoming
near-IR spectrographs will be even more efficient and sensitive to a wider
range of molecular species. Moreover, the detection of the same molecular
species in different bands (e.g. visible and IR) is key to constrain the

the main results obtained from the analysis of hard X-ray and gamma-ray data of
the AGILE mission that repeatedly observed the GW170104 localization region
(LR). At the LVC detection time $T_0$ AGILE observed about 36% of the LR. The
gamma-ray imaging detector did not reveal any significant emission in the
energy range 50 MeV--30 GeV. Furthermore, no significant gamma-ray transients
were detected in the LR that was repeatedly exposed over timescales of minutes,
hours, and days. We also searched for transient emission using data near $T_0$
of the omnidirectional detector MCAL operating in the energy band 0.4--100 MeV.
A refined analysis of MCAL data shows the existence of a weak event (that we
call ""E2"") with a signal-to-noise ratio of $4.4\,\sigma$ lasting about 32 ms
and occurring $0.46\,\pm\,0.05 \,\rm s$ before $T_0$. A study of the MCAL
background and of the false-alarm rate of E2 leads to the determinination of a
post-trial significance between $2.4\,\sigma$ and $2.7\,\sigma$ for a temporal
coincidence with GW170104. We note that E2 has characteristics similar to those
detected from the weak precursor of the short GRB 090510. The candidate event
E2 is worth consideration for simultaneous detection by other satellites. If
associated with GW170104, it shows emission in the MeV band of a short burst
preceding the final coalescence by 0.46 sec and involving $\sim 10^{-7}$ of the
total rest mass energy of the system.

accuracy relative to explicit or implicit schemes when the cooling time is
short. We compare results with different time integrators for gas cooling in
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the temperature of the gas
in filaments before accreting into dark matter halos to form stars, obtained
with the exact cooling integration, lies close to the equilibrium where
radiative cooling balances heating from the UV background. For comparison, the
gas temperature without the exact integrator shows substantial deviations from
the equilibrium relation. Galaxy stellar masses with the exact cooling
technique agree reasonably well, but are systematically lower than the results
obtained by the other integration schemes, reducing the need for feedback to
suppress star formation. Our implementation of the exact cooling technique is
provided and can be easily incorporated into any hydrodynamic code.

improves upon the previous-best $14$-approximation~\cite{Zenklusen15}. Notably,
our analysis is also significantly simpler and cleaner than the one

an involved analysis to extract a good interdiction set from an over-budget

capture algebraically the presence of state in history-sensitive strategies in
game semantics, by imposing a causality relation on the tensor product of
games. Coalgebras for the functor $A \oslash \_$ - i.e. morphisms from $S$ to
$A \oslash S$ - may be viewed as state transformers: if $A \oslash \_$ has a
final coalgebra, $!A$, then the anamorphism of such a state transformer
encapsulates its explicit state, so that it is shared only between successive
invocations.
  We study the conditions under which a final coalgebra $!A$ for $A \oslash \_$
is the carrier of a cofree commutative comonoid on $A$. That is, it is a model
of the exponential of linear logic in which we can construct imperative objects
such as reference cells coalgebraically, in a game semantics setting. We show
that if the tensor decomposes into the sequoid, the final coalgebra $!A$ may be
endowed with the structure of the cofree commutative comonoid if there is a
natural isomorphism from $!(A \times B)$ to $!A \otimes !B$. This condition is
always satisfied if $!A$ is the bifree algebra for $A \oslash \_$, but in
general it is necessary to impose it, as we establish by giving an example of a
sequoidally decomposable category of games in which plays will be allowed to
have transfinite length. In this category, the final coalgebra for the functor
$A \oslash \_$ is not the cofree commutative comonoid over A: we illustrate
this by explicitly contrasting the final sequence for the functor $A \oslash
\_$ with the chain of symmetric tensor powers used in the construction of the
cofree commutative comonoid as a limit by Melli\'es, Tabareau and Tasson.

the solution to the field transformation expressing one of the new fields in
terms of the Yang-Mills field is a certain type of the Wilson line. More
precisely, it is a straight infinite gauge link with a slope extending to the
light-cone minus and the transverse direction. One of the consequences of that
fact is that certain MHV vertices reduced partially on-shell are gauge
invariant -- a fact discovered before using conventional light-front
perturbation theory. We also analyze the diagrammatic content of the field
transformations leading to the MHV action. We found that the diagrams for the

differ only by light-front energy denominators. Further, we investigate the

is a degenerate critical point of the action functional under the mass

holds for any $N \geq 3$ and arbitrary subcritical power nonlinearity. It gives
a precise dynamical characterization of the previous result of Adami {\em et

consists of recommending items to users over time in an online fashion based on
positive ratings only. This problem arises when users respond only occasionally
to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We
study the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation,
p_f, on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of ratings required to make
`good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative
ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. Both
questions arise in the design of recommender systems. We introduce a simple
probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based
CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where
recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this
algorithm makes---up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating
the user's preferences---perfect recommendations. The number of ratings
required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1/p_f, and that for
updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of p_f. As a
consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of
only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial
exploration by a factor of 1/p_f, which can be significant.

spherically-symmetric, one-dimensional simulations routinely fail to explode,
yet multi-dimensional simulations often explode. Numerical investigations
suggest that turbulence eases the condition for explosion, but how is not fully
understood. We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and
show that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about
30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we
identify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Contrary to prior
suggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the
condition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram
pressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent
dissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant
thermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source of this
TD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from
the higher potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a
turbulence model in conjunction with an explosion condition enables insight
that is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex multi-dimensional
simulations. An explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain why
stars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to explore how turbulence
enables explosion. Though we find that turbulent dissipation is a significant
contributor to successful supernova explosions, it is important to note that
this work is to some extent qualitative. Therefore, we suggest ways to further
verify and validate our predictions with multi-dimensional simulations.

fundamental role in this, especially for the case of algebraic geometry. On the

In this paper we address four basic questions on tropical polynomials closely
related to their computational properties:
  1. Given a polynomial with a certain support (set of monomials) and a
(finite) set of inputs, when is it possible for the polynomial to vanish on all
these inputs?
  2. A more precise question, given a polynomial with a certain support and a
(finite) set of inputs, how many roots can this polynomial have on this set of

  3. Given an integer $k$, for which $s$ there is a set of $s$ inputs such that
any non-zero polynomial with at most $k$ monomials has a non-root among these
inputs?
  4. How many integer roots can have a one variable polynomial given by a

semi-major axes in the range of 0.1-1 AU) probably form in-situ, or arrive in
their observed orbits through disk migration. However, both in-situ formation
and disk migration, in their simplest flavors, predict WJs to be in
low-eccentricity orbits, in contradiction with many observed WJs that are
moderately eccentric (e=0.2-0.7). This paper examines the possibility that the
WJ eccentricities are raised by secular interactions with exterior giant planet
companions, following in-situ formation or migration on a circular orbit.
Eccentricity growth may arise from an inclined companion (through Lidov-Kozai
cycles), or from an eccentric, nearly coplanar companion (through apsidal
precession resonances). We quantify the necessary conditions (in terms of the
eccentricity, semi-major axis and inclination) for external perturbers of
various masses to raise the WJ eccentricity. We also consider the sample of
eccentric WJs with detected outer companions, and for each system, identify the
range of mutual inclinations needed to generate the observed eccentricity. For
most systems, we find that relatively high inclinations (at least $\sim
40^\circ$) are needed so that Lidov-Kozai cycles are induced; the observed
outer companions are typically not sufficiently eccentric to generate the
observed WJ eccentricity in a low-inclination configuration. The results of
this paper place constraints on possibly unseen external companions to
eccentric WJs. Observations that probe mutual inclinations of giant planet
systems will help clarify the origin of eccentric WJs and the role of external
companions.

execution of desired processes and the control signals (additive control
biases). This relationship is also used to specify optimal control policies to
achieve a desired probability of activation for processes. We observe that
there are boundary cases when finding such control policies which leads us to

and chemical evolution of galaxies but direct measurements of gas flows are
diffcult to make. Young massive stars and HII regions in the halos of galaxies
are potential tracers for accretion and/or outflows of gas. Gas phase
abundances of three HII regions in the lower halos of the edge-on galaxies NGC
3628 and NGC 4522 are determined by analysing optical long-slit spectra. The
observed regions have projected distances to the midplane of their host from
1.4 to 3 kpc. With the measured flux densities of the optical nebular emission
lines, we derive the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) for the three extraplanar
HII regions. The analysis is based on one theoretical and two empirical
strong-line calibration methods. The resulting oxygen abundances of the
extraplanar HII regions are comparable to the disk HII regions in one case and
a little lower in the other case. Since our results depend on the accuracy of
the metallicity determinations, we critically discuss the difference of the
calibration methods we applied and confirm previously noted offsets. From our
measurements, we argue that these three extraplanar HII regions were formed in
the disk or at least from disk material. We discuss the processes that could
transport disk material into the lower halo of these systems and conclude that
gravitational interaction with a companion galaxy is most likely for NGC 3628
while ram pressure is favoured in the case of NGC 4522.

resolve due to size-dependent membrane behavior and the experimental resolution
limits imposed by optical diffraction. Recent advances in nanoengineering and
super-resolution techniques have enabled new capabilities for creating and
observing curvature. In particular, draping supported lipid bilayers over
lithographically patterned substrates provides a model system for endocytic
pits. The experiments and simulations presented below describe the possible
detection of membrane curvature through fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single
particle tracking (SPT), and polarized localization microscopy (PLM). FRAP and
FCS depend on diffraction-limited illumination and detection. In particular, a
simulation of FRAP shows no effects on lipids diffusion due to a 50 nm diameter
membrane bud at any stage in the budding process. Simulated FCS demonstrated
small effects due to a 50 nm radius membrane bud that was amplified with
curvature-dependent lipid mobility changes. However, PLM and SPT achieve
sub-diffraction-limited resolution of membrane budding and lipid mobility
through the identification of the single-lipid positions with <15 nm spatial
and <20 ms temporal resolution. By mapping the single-lipid step lengths to
locations on the membrane, the effects of curvature on lipid behavior have been
resolved.

heterogeneous data types: continuous, discrete and categorical. Here a matrix

The strength of an information flow is evaluated by applying the combinatorial

illustrated through five data sets. In each illustrative case, an information
flow is demonstrated as an organization of discovered knowledge loci via
emergent visible and readable heterogeneity. This unified approach
fundamentally resolves many long standing issues, including statistical
modeling, multiple response, renormalization and feature selections, in data

  https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/kbfc17",,"10.1093/mnras/sty852",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new model for the structure and evolution of the gas in
galactic discs. In the model the gas is in vertical pressure and energy
balance. Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and
non-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally
gravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship
between galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and
rotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and
rates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered
primarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the
two. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation
feedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide
range of observations, including the star formation law measured in both
spatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star
formation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow.
The agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local
dwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshifts discs. We apply the model to
galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and show that it predicts a
transition from mostly gravity-driven turbulence at high redshift to star
formation-driven turbulence at low redshift. This transition, and the changes
in mass transport rates that it produces, naturally explain why galaxy bulges
tend to form at high redshift and discs at lower redshift, and why galaxies
tend to quench inside-out.

infrastructure sharing among multiple cellular operators whose networks are
powered by a combination of conventional and renewable sources of energy. Under
the proposed framework, the virtual network formed by unifying radio access
infrastructures of all operators is optimized for minimum energy consumption by
deactivating base stations (BSs) with low traffic loads. The users initially
associated to those BSs are off-loaded to neighboring active ones. A fairness
criterion for collaboration based on roaming prices is introduced to cover the
additional energy costs incurred by host operators. The framework also ensures
that any collaborating operator is not negatively affected by its participation
in the proposed virtualization. A multi-objective linear programming problem is
formulated to achieve energy and cost efficiency of the networks' operation by
identifying the set of inter-operator roaming prices. For the case when
collaboration among all operators is infeasible due to profitability, capacity,
or power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to determine the
groups of operators that can viably collaborate. Results show significant
energy savings using the proposed virtualization as compared to the standalone
case. Moreover, collaborative operators exploiting locally generated renewable
energy are rewarded more than traditional ones.

determination of many elements in many stars. A common perception is that
deriving more than a few elemental abundances ([Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], perhaps
[C/H], [N/H]) requires medium-to-high spectral resolution, $R \gtrsim 10,000$,
mostly to overcome the effects of line blending. In recent work (Rix et al.
2016; Ting et al. 2016) we presented an efficient and practical way to model
the full stellar spectrum, even when fitting a large number of stellar labels
simultaneously. In this paper we quantify to what precision the abundances of
many different elements can be recovered, as a function of spectroscopic
resolution and wavelength range. In the limit of perfect spectral models and
spectral normalization, we show that the precision of elemental abundances is
nearly independent of resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of
detector pixels; low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel
and generally larger wavelength range in a single setting. We also show that
estimates of most stellar labels are not strongly correlated with one another
once $R \gtrsim 1,000$. Modest errors in the line spread function, as well as
small radial velocity errors, do not affect these conclusions, and data driven
models indicate that spectral (continuum) normalization can be achieved well
enough in practice. These results, to be confirmed with an analysis of observed
low-resolution data, open up new possibilities for the design of large
spectroscopic stellar surveys and for the re-analysis of archival
low-resolution datasets.

theory related to the need of reducing inter-node communication in the system.
A large number of recent papers addressed the problem of optimizing the total
amount of information downloaded for repair of a single failed node (the repair
bandwidth) by accessing information on $d$ {\em helper nodes}, where $k\le d\le
n-1.$ By the so-called cut-set bound (Dimakis et al., 2010), the repair
bandwidth of an $(n,k=n-r)$ MDS code using $d$ helper nodes is at least
$dl/(d+1-k),$ where $l$ is the size of the node. Also, a number of known
constructions of MDS array codes meet this bound with equality. In a related
but separate line of work, Guruswami and Wootters (2016) studied repair of
Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that these codes can be repaired using a
smaller bandwidth than under the trivial approach. At the same time, their work
as well as follow-up papers stopped short of constructing RS codes (or any
scalar MDS codes) that meet the cut-set bound with equality, which has been an
open problem in coding theory. In this work we present a solution to this
problem, constructing RS codes of length $n$ over the field $q^l,
l=\exp((1+o(1))n\log n)$ that meet the cut-set bound. We also prove an almost
matching lower bound on $l$, showing that the super-exponential scaling is both
necessary and sufficient for achieving the cut-set bound using linear repair
schemes. More precisely, we prove that for scalar MDS codes (including the RS
codes) to meet this bound, the sub-packetization $l$ must satisfy $l \ge
\exp((1+o(1)) k\log k).$

of >~ 2000 cold extra-galactic sub-millimeter sources, i.e. with colours
indicative of z >~ 2, almost all of which appear to be over-densities of
star-forming galaxies. They are thus considered as proto-cluster candidates.
Their number densities (or their flux densities) are far in excess of
expectations from the standard scenario for the evolution of large-scale
structure. Simulations based on a physically motivated galaxy evolution model
show that essentially all cold peaks brighter than S_{545GHz} = 500 mJy found
in Planck maps after having removed the Galactic dust emission can be
interpreted as positive Poisson fluctuations of the number of high-z dusty
proto-clusters within the same Planck beam, rather then being individual clumps
of physically bound galaxies. This conclusion does not change if an empirical
fit to the luminosity function of dusty galaxies is used instead of the
physical model. The simulations accurately reproduce the statistic of the
Planck detections and yield distributions of sizes and ellipticities in
qualitative agreement with observations. The redshift distribution of the
brightest proto-clusters contributing to the cold peaks has a broad maximum at
1.5 <~ z <~ 3. Therefore follow-up of Planck proto-cluster candidates will
provide key information on the high-z evolution of large scale structure.

impact of climate change on design rainfall using global and regional climate
model (RCM) predictions, to date, there has been no comprehensive comparison or
evaluation of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) statistics at regional scale,
considering both stationary versus nonstationary models for the future climate.
To understand how extreme precipitation may respond to future IDF curves, we
used an ensemble of three RCMs participating in the North-American (NA)-CORDEX
domain over eight rainfall stations across Southern Ontario, one of the most
densely populated and major economic region in Canada. The IDF relationships
are derived from multi-model RCM simulations and compared with the
station-based observations. We modeled precipitation extremes, at different
durations using extreme value distributions considering parameters that are
either stationary or nonstationary, as a linear function of time. Our results
showed that extreme precipitation intensity driven by future climate forcing
shows a significant increase in intensity for 10-year events in 2050s
(2030-2070) relative to 1970-2010 baseline period across most of the locations.
However, for longer return periods, an opposite trend is noted. Surprisingly,
in term of design storms, no significant differences were found when comparing
stationary and nonstationary IDF estimation methods for the future (2050s) for
the larger return periods. The findings, which are specific to regional
precipitation extremes, suggest no immediate reason for alarm, but the need for
progressive updating of the design standards in light of global warming.

interconnected system of dependent processes which shape cortical structure so
as to produce an efficient information processing system. Indeed, the
cooperation of these processes is associated with robust, stable, adaptable
networks with characteristic features of activity and synaptic topology.
However, combining the actions of these mechanisms in models has proven
exceptionally difficult and to date no model has been able to do so without
significant hand-tuning. Until such a model exists that can successfully
combine these mechanisms to form a stable circuit with realistic features, our
ability to study neuroplasticity in the context of (more realistic) dynamic
networks and potentially reap whatever rewards these features and mechanisms
imbue biological networks with is hindered. We introduce a model which combines
five known plasticity mechanisms that act on the network as well as a unique
metaplastic mechanism which acts on other plasticity mechanisms, to produce a
neural circuit model which is both stable and capable of broadly reproducing
many characteristic features of cortical networks. The MANA (metaplastic
artificial neural architecture) represents the first model of its kind in that
it is able to self-organize realistic, nonrandom features of cortical networks,

linear bandits, has been popular and successful in recent years. However,
existing GLBs scale poorly with the number of rounds and the number of arms,
limiting their utility in practice. This paper proposes new, scalable solutions
to the GLB problem in two respects. First, unlike existing GLBs, whose
per-time-step space and time complexity grow at least linearly with time $t$,
we propose a new algorithm that performs online computations to enjoy a
constant space and time complexity. At its heart is a novel Generalized Linear
extension of the Online-to-confidence-set Conversion (GLOC method) that takes
\emph{any} online learning algorithm and turns it into a GLB algorithm. As a
special case, we apply GLOC to the online Newton step algorithm, which results
in a low-regret GLB algorithm with much lower time and memory complexity than
prior work. Second, for the case where the number $N$ of arms is very large, we
propose new algorithms in which each next arm is selected via an inner product
search. Such methods can be implemented via hashing algorithms (i.e.,
""hash-amenable"") and result in a time complexity sublinear in $N$. While a
Thompson sampling extension of GLOC is hash-amenable, its regret bound for
$d$-dimensional arm sets scales with $d^{3/2}$, whereas GLOC's regret bound
scales with $d$. Towards closing this gap, we propose a new hash-amenable
algorithm whose regret bound scales with $d^{5/4}$. Finally, we propose a fast
approximate hash-key computation (inner product) with a better accuracy than
the state-of-the-art, which can be of independent interest. We conclude the
paper with preliminary experimental results confirming the merits of our
methods.

online visual tracking filed due to its simplicity and efficiency. These
methods utilize a periodic assumption of the training samples to construct a
circulant data matrix, which implicitly increases the training samples and
reduces both storage and computational complexity.The periodic assumption also
introduces unwanted boundary effects. Recently, Spatially Regularized
Correlation Filters (SRDCF) solved this issue by introducing penalization on
correlation filter coefficients depending on their spatial location. However,
SRDCF's efficiency dramatically decreased due to the breaking of circulant
structure.
  We propose Faster Spatially Regularized Discriminative Correlation Filters

  Fading Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, outage performance of hybrid automatic repeat request with
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) is analyzed. Unlike prior analyses,
time-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channel is considered. The outage analysis
thus involves the probability distribution analysis of a product of multiple
correlated shifted Gamma random variables and is more challenging than prior
analyses. Based on the finding of the conditional independence of the received
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the outage probability is exactly derived by
using conditional Mellin transform. Specifically, the outage probability of
HARQ-IR under time-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channels can be written as a
weighted sum of outage probabilities of HARQ-IR over independent Nakagami
fading channels, where the weightings are determined by a negative multinomial
distribution. This result enables not only an efficient truncation
approximation of the outage probability with uniform convergence but also
asymptotic outage analysis to further extract clear insights which have never
been discovered for HARQ-IR even under fast fading channels. The asymptotic
outage probability is then derived in a simple form which clearly quantifies
the impacts of transmit powers, channel time correlation and information
transmission rate. It is proved that the asymptotic outage probability is an
inverse power function of the product of transmission powers in all HARQ
rounds, an increasing function of the channel time correlation coefficients,
and a monotonically increasing and convex function of information transmission
rate. The simple expression of the asymptotic result enables optimal power
allocation and optimal rate selection of HARQ-IR with low complexity. Finally,
numerical results are provided to verify our analytical results and justify the
application of the asymptotic result for optimal system design.

a resonant polariton fluid created in a solid-state microcavity. By tracking
the vortices on picosecond time scales, we reveal the role of nonlinearity, as
well as of density and phase gradients, in driving their rotational dynamics.
Such effects are also responsible for the split of composite spin-vortex
molecules into elementary half-vortices, when seeding opposite vorticity
between the two spinorial components. Remarkably, we also observe that vortices
placed in close proximity experience a pull-push scenario leading to unusual
scattering-like events that can be described by a tunable effective potential.

variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants
of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of
receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution.
Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient
diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates,
whereas species such as B.~thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex
glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide
opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another
important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such
fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information
about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often
adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular
carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake
receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to
control the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring
relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence.
Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation
to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning
studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory
wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify
environmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in
cellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect
those broad concepts to testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of B12,
siderophores and glycans.

a single sign and of vortex sheets with finite angular momentum. Building on

universes with different properties. For instance, the conformal structure of
spacetime directly depends on $\Lambda$: null infinity $\mathcal{I}$ is a
spacelike, null, or timelike hypersurface, if $\Lambda>0$, $\Lambda=0$, or
$\Lambda<0$, respectively. Recent observations of distant supernovae have
taught us that our universe expands at an accelerated rate, and this can be
accounted for by choosing $\Lambda>0$ in Einstein's theory of general
relativity. A quantity that depends on the conformal structure of spacetime,
especially on the nature of $\mathcal{I}$, is the Bondi mass which in turn
dictates the mass loss of an isolated gravitating system due to energy carried
away by gravitational waves. This problem of extending the Bondi mass to a

techniques for software security requirements (countermeasures) find a subset
of higher-priority security requirements ignoring lower-priority requirements

requirements however, may on one hand leave some of the security threats
(vulnerabilities) unattended and on the other hand influence other security
requirements that rely on the ignored or postponed requirements. To address
this, we have proposed considering partial satisfaction of security
requirements when tolerated rather than ignoring those requirements or
postponing them to the future. In doing so, we have contributed a goal-based
framework that enables prioritization and partial selection of security
requirements with respect to security goals. The proposed framework helps
reduce the number of ignored (postponed) security requirements and consequently
reduce the adverse impacts of ignoring security requirements in software

Coulombic efficiency, namely, CE. Particularly, it is key to quantitatively and
qualitatively resolve CE alterations and evolutions by the various Li-Si
structural changes over longer cycling. However, such work is surprisingly
scarce. Here, we provide new findings that iterating the hysteretic
amorphous-crystalline Li-Si phase transformations accumulatively governs CE
evolutions, the manner of which is numerically distinguished from incremental
amorphous Li-Si volume changes. The iterations, usually featured as capacity
degradation factors, can form the most efficient CE profiles over hundreds of

given Li-Si reaction sequences. Combined with atomistic probing methodologies,
we show that the iteration drastically alters electrochemical and structural
characteristics, which is synchronised with the CE behaviours.

over the next 3 nights, with a spectrum revealing a blue featureless continuum.

2.6$\sigma$. A long, soft GRB within a redshift range of $1 \lesssim z \lesssim

have been issues of intense discussion and uncertainty. Using our Herschel
Space Observatory data, we report a tendency for this so-called associated

that the gas winds likely occur on the kiloparsec scale and would then have a
strong impact on the interstellar medium of the galaxy. This correlation
moreover would imply that the unusually high cold dust luminosities in these

analyze if and how strongly this size dependence affects the ability of
non-empirical tuning approaches to predict accurate IPs for $\pi$-conjugated

different non-empirical tuning procedures for the $G_0W_0$ starting point to
calculate the IP of polyene oligomers up to 22 repeat units and compare the
results to highly accurate coupled-cluster calculations. We find that, despite
its size dependence, using an IP-tuned hybrid functional as a starting point

particles has become an important direction in soft matter physics because of
the promising applications in fabrication of dynamic responsive functional
materials. Here using computer simulations, we found that in the mixture of
passive colloids and eccentric self-propelled active particles, when the
eccentricity and self-propulsion of active particles are high enough, the
eccentric active particles can push passive colloids to form a large dense
dynamic cluster, and the system undergoes a novel dynamic demixing transition.
Our simulations show that the dynamic demixing occurs when the eccentric active
particles move much faster than the passive particles such that the dynamic
trajectories of different active particles can overlap with each other while
passive particles are depleted from the dynamic trajectories of active
particles. Our results suggest that this is in analogy to the entropy driven
demixing in colloid-polymer mixtures, in which polymer random coils can overlap
with each other while deplete the colloids. More interestingly, we find that by
fixing the passive colloid composition at certain value, with increasing the
density, the system undergoes an intriguing re-entrant mixing, and the demixing
only occurs within certain intermediate density range. This suggests a new way
of designing active matter to drive the self-assembly of passive colloids and
fabricate dynamic responsive materials.

caused by tainted program input. Although fuzzers have helped uncover a
majority of taint-style vulnerabilities in software to date, they are limited
by (i) extent of test coverage; and (ii) the availability of fuzzable test
cases. Therefore, fuzzing alone cannot provide a high assurance that all
taint-style vulnerabilities have been uncovered. In this paper, we use static
template matching to find recurrences of fuzzer-discovered vulnerabilities. To
compensate for the inherent incompleteness of template matching, we implement a
simple yet effective match-ranking algorithm that uses test coverage data to
focus attention on those matches that comprise untested code. We prototype our
approach using the Clang/LLVM compiler toolchain and use it in conjunction with
afl-fuzz, a modern coverage-guided fuzzer. Using a case study carried out on
the Open vSwitch codebase, we show that our prototype uncovers corner cases in
modules that lack a fuzzable test harness. Our work demonstrates that static
analysis can effectively complement fuzz testing, and is a useful addition to
the security assessment tool-set. Furthermore, our techniques hold promise for
increasing the effectiveness of program analysis and testing, and serve as a

and empty space. No constraint on the sharpness of C2R's edges is available. A
1$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim 20$ m is derived for the equivalent width of
narrow (physical width <4 km) rings up to distances of 12,000 km, counted in
the ring plane.

since these kind of results are not common in the literature. Furthermore, the
few results found in this direction usually meet one of the following reasons:
too many vertices compared with the number of edges; too many edges compared

the sets $J$ and $J^\star$. Whether these two sets are always equal is one of
the main open questions in the field. We prove equality when the map acts
hyperbolically on the a priori smaller set $J^\star$, under the additional
hypothesis of substantial dissipativity. This result was claimed, without using
the additional assumption, in the paper [For06], but the proof is incomplete.
Our proof closely follows ideas from [For06], deviating at two points where
substantial dissipativity is used.
  We show that $J = J^\star$ also holds when hyperbolicity is replaced by one
of two weaker conditions. The first is quasi-hyperbolicity, introduced in
[BS02], a natural generalization of the one dimensional notion of
semi-hyperbolicity. The second is the existence of a dominated splitting on
$J^\star$. Substantially dissipative H\'enon maps admitting a dominated
splitting on the possibly larger set $J$ were recently studied in in [LP14].

intricate problem. Twenty years ago Stewart published the first consistent
theory with purely inelastic impacts and an impulsive friction model analogous
to Coulomb friction. In this paper we demonstrate that the consistent impact
model can exhibit multiple solutions with a varying degree of dissipation even
in the single-contact case. Replacing the impulsive friction model based on
Coulomb friction by a model based on the maximum dissipation principle resolves
the non-uniqueness in the single-contact impact problem. The paper constructs
the alternative impact model and presents integral equations describing
rigid-body dynamics with a non-impulsive and non-compliant contact model and an
associated purely inelastic impact model maximizing dissipation. An analytic
solution is derived for the single-contact impact problem. The models are then
embedded into a time-stepping scheme. The macroscopic behaviour is compared to
Coulomb friction in a large-scale granular flow problem.

Beyond the Standard Model physics require a highly performant CLIC detector. In
particular the vertex detector must provide a single point resolution of only a
few micrometers while not exceeding the envisaged material budget of around
0.2% X0 per layer. Beam-beam interactions and beamstrahlung processes impose an
additional requirement on the timestamping capabilities of the vertex detector
of about 10 ns. These goals can only be met by using novel techniques in the
sensor and ASIC design as well as in the detector construction.
  The R\&D program for the CLIC vertex detector explores various technologies
in order to meet these demands. The feasibility of planar sensors with a
thickness of 50-150 um, including different active edge designs, are evaluated
using Timepix3 ASICs. First prototypes of the CLICpix readout ASIC, implemented
in 65 nm CMOS technology and with a pixel size of 25x25 um^2, have been
produced and tested in particle beams. An updated version of the ASIC with a
larger pixel matrix and improved precision of the time-over-threshold and
time-of-arrival measurements has been submitted. Different hybridization
concepts have been developed for the interconnection between the sensor and
readout ASIC, ranging from small-pitch bump bonding of planar sensors to
capacitive coupling of active HV-CMOS sensors. Detector simulations based on
Geant4 and TCAD are compared with experimental results to assess and optimize
the performance of the various designs.
  This contribution gives an overview of the R&D program undertaken for the
CLIC vertex detector and presents performance measurements of the prototype
detectors currently under investigation.

ADR1) at 148 MHz and LOFAR's first all-sky survey, the Multifrequency Snapshot
Sky Survey (MSSS) at 140 MHz. We find a scaling relation $P_{\rm cav} \propto
L_{148}^{\beta}$, with a logarithmic slope of $\beta = 0.51 \pm 0.14$, which is
in good agreement with previous results based on data at 327 MHz. The large
scatter present in this correlation confirms the conclusion reached at higher
frequencies that the total radio luminosity at a single frequency is a poor
predictor of the total jet power. We show that including measurements at 148
MHz alone is insufficient to reliably compute the bolometric radio luminosity
and reduce the scatter in the correlation. For a subset of four well-resolved
sources, we examine the detected extended structures at low frequencies and
compare with the morphology known from higher frequency images and Chandra
X-ray maps. In Perseus we discuss details in the structures of the radio
mini-halo, while in the 2A 0335+096 cluster we observe new diffuse emission
associated with multiple X-ray cavities and likely originating from past
activity. For A2199 and MS 0735.6+7421, we confirm that the observed
low-frequency radio lobes are confined to the extents known from higher

Given two initially posed clouds, it firstly establishes the forward
correspondence for each point in the data shape and calculates the value of
binary variable, which can indicate whether this point correspondence is
located in the overlapping areas or not. Then, it establishes the bilateral
correspondence and computes bidirectional distances for each point in the
overlapping areas. Based on the ratio of bidirectional distances, the
exponential function is selected and utilized to calculate the probability
value, which can indicate the reliability of the point correspondence.
Subsequently, both the values of hard and soft assignments are embedded into
the proposed objective function for registration of partially overlapping point
clouds and a novel variant of ICP algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal
rigid transformation. The proposed approach can achieve good registration of
point clouds, even when their overlap percentage is low. Experimental results

optimization problems lacking coercivity, [1] proposed a notion of generalized
solution x for this system, called {\it limit solution,} associated to
measurable u and v, and with u of possibly unbounded variation in [0,T]. As
shown in [1], when u and x have bounded variation, such a solution (called in
this case BV simple limit solution) coincides with the most used graph
completion solution (see e.g. [6]). This correspondence has been extended in
[24] to BV_loc u and trajectories (with bounded variation just on any [0,t]
with t<T). Starting with an example of optimal control where the minimum does
not exist in the class of limit solutions, we propose a notion of extended
limit solution x, for which such a minimum exists. As a first result, we prove
that extended and original limit solutions coincide in the special cases of BV

ordinary control v also appears in the non-drift terms. For the associated

be reducible, and others irreducible, to such local properties. This dichotomy
persists despite the steady increase in data availability and resolution, which
actually determines an even stronger need for filtering techniques aimed at
discerning essential links from non-essential ones. Here we introduce a
rigorous method that, for any desired level of statistical significance,
outputs the network backbone that is irreducible to the local properties of
nodes, i.e. their degrees and strengths. Unlike previous approaches, our method
employs an exact maximum-entropy formulation guaranteeing that the filtered
network encodes only the links that cannot be inferred from local information.
Extensive empirical analysis confirms that this approach uncovers essential
backbones that are otherwise hidden amidst many redundant relationships and
inaccessible to other methods. For instance, we retrieve the hub-and-spoke
skeleton of the US airport network and many specialised patterns of
international trade. Being irreducible to local transportation and economic
constraints of supply and demand, these backbones single out genuinely
higher-order wiring principles.

mode of growth represents a sequence of layer-by-layer or Frank-van der Merwe
growth followed by the formation of three-dimensional (3D) islands or
Volmer-Weber growth. The occurrence of both growth modes mentioned above is in
compliance with the wettability criterion of Bauer. The positive wetting
function required for the occurrence of the Volmer-Weber growth is originated
by the vertical displacements of the atoms close to the edges of the
two-dimensional (2D) islands as a result of the relaxation of the lattice
misfit. The monolayer high islands become unstable against bilayer islands,
bilayer islands in turn become unstable against trilayer islands, etc. beyond
some critical islands sizes. Monolayer islands appear as necessary precursors
of three-dimensional (3D) islands. The critical island size for mono-bilayer
transformation increases steeply with decreasing lattice misfit and diverges at
a critical value of the misfit. This value divides the regions of Frank-van der
Merwe and Stranski-Krastanov modes in a phase diagram of coordinates
wetting-misfit. The transformation of monolayer to multilayer islands takes
place either by consecutive nucleation and growth of 2D islands (layer-by-layer
transformation), or by nucleation and lateral (2D) growth of multilayer islands
(multilayer 2D transformation). The former occurs in the case of ""stiff""
overlayer materials and mostly in compressed overlayers. The latter takes place
in the case of ""soft"" materials like Pb and In, mostly in tensile overlayers.
Tensile films show non-nucleation transformation compared with the
nucleation-like behavior of compressed films.

also consistent with those before the glitch. The observed long-term evolution
of the spin-down rate and the gamma-ray flux indicates that the glitch
triggered a mode change in the global magnetosphere. We speculate that the
glitch changed the local magnetic field structure around the polar cap and/or
the inclination angle of the dipole axis, leading to a change in the electric
current circulating in the magnetosphere.

outflow. The outflow is launched from the torus inner edge by UV radiation and
expands in solid angle as it ascends; IR radiation continues to drive the
wide-angle outflow outside the central hole. The dusty outflow obscures the
central source in soft X-rays, the IR, and the UV over three quarters of solid
angle, and each decade in column density covers roughly equal solid angle
around the central source; these obscuration properties are similar to what
observations imply.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG math.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving symmetric positive definite linear problems is a fundamental
computational task in machine learning. The exact solution, famously, is
cubicly expensive in the size of the matrix. To alleviate this problem, several
linear-time approximations, such as spectral and inducing-point methods, have
been suggested and are now in wide use. These are low-rank approximations that
choose the low-rank space a priori and do not refine it over time. While this
allows linear cost in the data-set size, it also causes a finite, uncorrected
approximation error. Authors from numerical linear algebra have explored ways
to iteratively refine such low-rank approximations, at a cost of a small number
of matrix-vector multiplications. This idea is particularly interesting in the
many situations in machine learning where one has to solve a sequence of
related symmetric positive definite linear problems. From the machine learning
perspective, such deflation methods can be interpreted as transfer learning of
a low-rank approximation across a time-series of numerical tasks. We study the
use of such methods for our field. Our empirical results show that, on
regression and classification problems of intermediate size, this approach can
interpolate between low computational cost and numerical precision.

operator superalgebra of $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ at an admissible level $k$. We
use a Jacobi form decomposition to see that this is a vertex operator

a positive integer $k$, we get a regular vertex operator superalgebra and this

  The interplay of the theory of vertex algebra extensions and modular data of
the vertex operator subalgebra allows us to classify all simple local

and to obtain their super fusion rules. The latter are obtained in a second way
from Verlinde's formula for vertex operator superalgebras. Finally, using again
the theory of vertex algebra extensions, we find all simple modules and their
fusion rules of the parafermionic coset $C_k = \text{Com}\left(V_L,
L_k\left(\mathfrak{osp}(1 | 2)\right)\right)$ where $V_L$ is the lattice vertex

as the accepted standard to monitor treatment efficacy in lung cancer. However,
the time intervals between consecutive computerized tomography scans might be
too long to allow early identification of treatment failure. This study
examines the use of breath sampling to monitor responses to anticancer
treatments in patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 143
breath samples were collected from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer. The
exhaled breath signature, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
and a nanomaterial-based array of sensors, was correlated with the response to
therapy assessed by RECIST: complete response, partial response, stable
disease, or progressive disease. RESULTS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
analysis identified three volatile organic compounds as significantly
indicating disease control (PR/stable disease), with one of them also
significantly discriminating PR/stable disease from progressive disease. The
nanoarray had the ability to monitor changes in tumor response across therapy,
also indicating any lack of further response to therapy. When one-sensor
analysis was used, 59% of the follow-up samples were identified correctly.
There was 85% success in monitoring disease control (stable disease/partial
response). CONCLUSION: Breath analysis, using mainly the nanoarray, may serve
as a surrogate marker for the response to systemic therapy in lung cancer. As a
monitoring tool, it can provide the oncologist with a quick bedside method of
identifying a lack of response to an anticancer treatment. This may allow
quicker recognition than does the current RECIST analysis. Early recognition of
treatment failure could improve patient care.

generation mechanism are fairly well understood by now, the broadband
components are not. This calls to further the understanding of the broadband
noise generation in the fan stage. This article introduces the cyclostationary
stochastic hybrid (CSH) method, which accommodates in-depth studies of the
impact of cyclostationary wake characteristics on the broadband noise in the
fan stage. The Random Particle Mesh (RPM) method is used to synthesize a
turbulence field in the stator domain using a URANS simulation characterized by
time-periodic turbulence and mean flow. The rotor-stator interaction noise is
predicted by a two-dimensional CAA computation of the stator cascade. The
impact of cyclostationarity is decomposed into various effects investigated
separately. This leads to the finding that the periodic turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE) and periodic flow have only a negligible effect on the radiated
sound power. The impact of the periodic integral length scale (TLS) is,
however, substantial. The limits of a stationary representation of the TLS are
demonstrated making the CSH method indispensable when background and wake TKE
are of comparable level. Good agreement of the CSH method with measurements
obtained from the 2015 AIAA Fan Broadband Noise Prediction Workshop are also
shown.

atmospheric escape to investigate how the statistical imprints of evaporation
depend on the bulk composition of planetary cores (rocky vs. icy). We find that
the population-wide imprints like the location of the ""evaporation valley"" in
the distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution
clearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with
the observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in
low-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition.
Combined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that
low-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still
undergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets
losing all primordial H/He. For planets in this ""triangle of evaporation"" in
the distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the
observed diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with
increasing radius (R/R_Earth<1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; >3: H/He).
The mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and
evolution. Its characteristic broken V-shape reveals the transitions from solid
planets to low-mass core-dominated planets with H/He and finally to
gas-dominated giants. Evaporation causes density and orbital distance to be
anti-correlated for low-mass planets, in contrast to giants, where closer-in
planets are less dense, likely due to inflation. The temporal evolution of the
statistical properties reported here will be of interest for the PLATO 2.0
mission which will observe the temporal dimension.

radiative transfer simulations of gravitationally unstable discs in order to
assess the validity of GIs in such objects, and constrain optimal targets for
future observations. We utilise the radiative transfer code LIME to produce
continuum emission maps of a $0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating

methods to improve upon the default gridding. We use CASA to produce synthetic
observations of 270 continuum emission maps generated across different

of our protosolar-like disc model is distinguishable across the majority of our
parameter space after 1 hour of observation, and is especially prominent at
230$\,$GHz due to the favourable combination of angular resolution and
sensitivity. Disc mass derived from the observations is sensitive to the
assumed dust opacities and temperatures, and therefore can be underestimated by
a factor of at least 30 at 850$\,$GHz and 2.5 at 90$\,$GHz. As a result, this
effect could retrospectively validate GIs in discs previously thought not
massive enough to be gravitationally unstable, which could have a significant

through the evaluation of the equation of state (EOS) of symmetric and pure
neutron matter going beyond the mean-field scheme and using a functional
defined up to next-to-leading order (NLO), that we will call NLO EDF. A
Skyrme-like interaction is constructed based on the condition of
renormalizibility and on a power counting on $k_F/\Lambda_{hi}$, where $k_F$ is
the Fermi momentum and $\Lambda_{hi}$ is the breakdown scale of our expansion.
To absorb the divergences present in beyond mean-field diagrams, counter
interactions are introduced for the NLO EDF and determined through
renormalization conditions. In particular, three scenarios are explored and all
of them lead to satisfactory results. These counter interactions contain also
parameters which do not contribute to the EOS of matter and may eventually be
determined through future adjustments to properties of some selected finite
nuclei. Our work serves as a simple starting point for constructing a
well-defined power counting within the EDF framework.

d), defined by means of the family of all its real-valued uniformly continuous
functions. We call it the Samuel realcompactification, according to the well
known Samuel compactification associated to the family of all the bounded
real-valued uniformly continuous functions. Among many other things, we study
the corresponding problem of the Samuel realcompactness for metric spaces. At
this respect, we prove that a result of Kat\v{e}tov-Shirota type occurs in this
context, where the completeness property is replaced by Bourbaki-completeness
(a notion recently introduced by the authors) and the closed discrete subspaces
are replaced by the uniformly discrete ones. More precisely, we see that a
metric space (X, d) is Samuel realcompact iff it is Bourbaki-complete and every
uniformly discrete subspace of X has non-measurable cardinal. As a consequence,
we derive that a normed space is Samuel realcompact iff it has finite
dimension. And this means in particular that realcompactness and Samuel
realcompactness can be very far apart. The paper also contains results relating
this realcompactification with the so-called Lipschitz realcompactification
(also studied here), with the classical Hewitt-Nachbin realcompactification and
with the completion of the initial metric space.

volume shock capturing method for the numerical solution of compressible Euler
equations of gas dynamics. Both isentropic and full Euler equations are
considered. The equations are discretized on a staggered grid. This simplifies
flux computation and guarantees a natural central discretization in the low
Mach limit, thus dramatically reducing the excessive numerical diffusion of
upwind discretizations. Furthermore, second order accuracy in space is
automatically guaranteed. For the time discretization we adopt an
Semi-IMplicit/EXplicit (S-IMEX) discretization getting an elliptic equation for
the pressure in the isentropic case and for the energy in the full Euler
equations. Such equations can be solved linearly so that we do not need any
iterative solver thus reducing computational cost. Second order in time is
obtained by a suitable S-IMEX strategy taken from Boscarino et al. in [6].
Moreover, the CFL stability condition is independent of the Mach number and
depends essentially on the fluid velocity. Numerical tests are displayed in one
and two dimensions to demonstrate performances of our scheme in both
compressible and incompressible regimes.

properties of abundant, large-scale dynamic jets observable in the solar
atmosphere: the macrospicules (MS). These jets are observationally more
distinct phenomena than their little, and perhaps more ubiquitous, cousins, the
spicules. Investigation of long-term variation of the properties of
macrospicules may help to a better understanding of their underlying physics of
generation and role in coronal heating. Taking advantage of the high temporal
and spatial resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a new dataset, with
several hundreds of macrospicules, was constructed encompassing a period of
observations over six years. Here, we analyse the measured properties and
relations between these properties of macrospicules as function of time during
the observed time interval. We found that cross-correlations of several of
these macrospicule properties display a strong oscillatory pattern. Next,
wavelet analysis is used to provide more detailed information about the
temporal behaviour of the various properties of MS. For coronal hole
macrospicules, a significant peak is found at around 2-year period. This peak
also exists partially or is shifted to longer period, in the case of quiet Sun
macrospicules. These observed findings may be rooted in the underlying
mechanism generating the solar magnetic field, i.e. the global solar dynamo.

probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds
living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the
estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those
arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal
transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were
specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle
such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using
OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i)
the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack
of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these
losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first
tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an
optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key
ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that
can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic
(automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations
result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with
streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses
interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus
allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable
high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient
estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard
deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss
function.

analysis give conditions on the parameter space for the establishment of this
bi-stability. In the parametric zone of bi-stability, weak-noise amplitudes may
strongly inhibit the neuron's spiking activity. Surprisingly, increasing the
noise strength leads to a minimum in the spiking activity, after which the
activity starts to increase monotonically with increase in noise strength. We
investigate this inhibition and modulation of neural oscillations by weak-noise
amplitudes by looking at the variation of the mean number of spikes per unit
time with the noise intensity. We show that this phenomenon always occurs when
the initial conditions lie in the basin of attraction of the stable limit
cycle. For initial conditions in the basin of attraction of the stable fixed
point, the phenomenon however disappears, unless the time-scale separation

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and smart cities, in general.
High-speed and low-latency wireless communication links will allow

cloud-driving solutions to drastically reduce traffic jams and air pollution.
To achieve these goals, vehicles need to be equipped with a wide range of
sensors generating and exchanging high rate data streams. Recently, millimeter
wave (mmWave) techniques have been introduced as a means of fulfilling such
high data rate requirements. In this paper, we model a highway communication
network and characterize its fundamental link budget metrics. In particular, we
specifically consider a network where vehicles are served by mmWave Base
Stations (BSs) deployed alongside the road. To evaluate our highway network, we
develop a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario where
heavy vehicles (such as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct Line-of-Sight
(LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes and, hence, act as blockages. Using tools
from stochastic geometry, we derive approximations for the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) outage probability, as well as
the probability that a user achieves a target communication rate (rate coverage
probability). Our analysis provides new design insights for mmWave highway
communication networks. In considered highway scenarios, we show that reducing
the horizontal beamwidth from $90^\circ$ to $30^\circ$ determines a minimal
reduction in the SINR outage probability (namely, $4 \cdot 10^{-2}$ at
maximum). Also, unlike bi-dimensional mmWave cellular networks, for small BS
densities (namely, one BS every $500$ m) it is still possible to achieve an
SINR outage probability smaller than $0.2$.

flows are investigated with direct numerical simulation and biglobal stability
analysis for rectangular cavities with aspect ratios of $L/D=2$ and 6. This
study examines the behavior of instabilities with respect to stable/unstable
steady states in the laminar regimes for subsonic and transonic conditions
where compressibility plays an important role. It is observed that an increase
in Mach number destabilizes the flow in the subsonic regime and stabilizes the
flow in the transonic regime. Biglobal stability analysis is conducted to
extract 2D and 3D eigenmodes for prescribed spanwise wavelengths about the 2D
steady state. The properties of 2D eigenmodes agree well with those observed in
the 2D nonlinear simulations. In the analysis of 3D eigenmodes, it is found
that an increase of Mach number stabilizes dominant 3D eigenmodes. For a short
cavity with $L/D=2$, the 3D eigenmodes primarily stem from centrifugal
instabilities. For a long cavity with $L/D=6$, other types of eigenmodes appear
whose structures extend from the aft-region to the mid-region of the cavity. A
selected number of 3D DNS are performed at $M_\infty=0.6$. For $L/D=2$, the
properties of 3D structures present in the 3D nonlinear flow correspond closely
to those obtained from linear stability analysis. However, for $L/D=6$, the 3D
eigenmodes cannot be clearly observed in the 3D DNS, due to the strong
nonlinearity that develops over the length of the cavity. In addition, it is
noted that three-dimensionality in the flow helps alleviate violent
oscillations for the long cavity. The analysis performed in this paper can
provide valuable insights for designing effective flow control strategies to
suppress undesirable aerodynamic and pressure fluctuations in compressible
open-cavity flows.

attacker who has the technical capability to breach a system in a stealthy
fashion. Key questions arising are when the attack takes place, and when a
defensive move should be initiated to reset the system resource to a known safe
state.
  In our work, we study a more complex scenario called Time-Based Security in
which we combine three main notions: protection time, detection time, and
reaction time. Protection time represents the amount of time the attacker needs
to execute the attack successfully. In other words, protection time represents
the inherent resilience of the system against an attack. Detection time is the
required time for the defender to detect that the system is compromised.
Reaction time is the required time for the defender to reset the defense
mechanisms in order to recreate a safe system state.
  In the first part of the paper, we study the VERIS Community Database (VCDB)
and screen other data sources to provide insights into the actual timing of
security incidents and responses. While we are able to derive distributions for
some of the factors regarding the timing of security breaches, we assess the
state-of-the-art regarding the collection of timing-related data as
insufficient.
  In the second part of the paper, we propose a two-player game which captures
the outlined Time-Based Security scenario in which both players move according
to a periodic strategy. We carefully develop the resulting payoff functions,
and provide theorems and numerical results to help the defender to calculate
the best time to reset the defense mechanism by considering protection time,
detection time, and reaction time.

measured at the surface of the PDMS substrate under steady-state sliding. Then,
the corresponding contact pressure and frictional stress distributions are
determined from an inversion procedure. Using this approach, we show that the
local frictional stress $\tau$ is proportional to the local stretch ratio
$\lambda$ at the rubber surface. Additional data using a triangular flat punch
indicate that $\tau(\lambda)$ relationship is independent on the contact
geometry. From friction experiments using pre-stretched PDMS substrate, it is
also found that the stretch-dependence of the frictional stress is isotropic,
i.e. it does not depend on the angle between stretching and sliding directions.
Potential physical explanations for this phenomenon are provided within the
framework of Schallamach's friction model. Although the present experiments are
dealing with smooth contact interfaces, the reported $\tau(\lambda)$ dependence
is also relevant to the friction of statistically rough contact interfaces,

as the topological $BF$ theory with a specific constraint, the Plebanski
constraint. $BF$ theory is expected to be the classical limit of the
Crane-Yetter~(CY) topological state sum. In the Euclidean case, the Plebanski
constraint could be lifted in an elegant way to a quantum version in the CY
state sum, called the simplicity condition. The constrained state sum is known
as the Barrett-Crane~(BC) model. In this note we investigate this condition
from the topological field theory side. Since the condition is in fact imposed
on the faces, we want to understand it from the viewpoint of the surface
theory. Essentially this condition could be thought of as resulting from the
boundary-bulk dualtiy, or more precisely from the recent ""bulk=center""
proposal. In the language of topological phases, it corresponds to the diagonal
anyon condensation, with the BC model being the condensed phase.
  The CY state sum, and correspondingly the BC model, is usually constructed
with a modular tensor category~(MTC) from representations of a quantum group at
roots of unity. The category of representations of quantum group and that of
modules of the corresponding affine Lie algebra are known to be equivalent as
MTCs. This equivalence, together with the simplicity condition in the BC model,
guarantees the construction of a full 2d rational conformal field theory

how spatial transformer layers can be employed to compute the flow field

solar wind streams from coronal holes. Improved estimates of precipitating
fluxes of energetic electrons are derived from measurements on board the
NOAA/POES 18 satellite using a new analysis technique. These fluxes are used to
quantify the direct impact of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) during
solar minimum on middle atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) measured from the Aura
satellite. During winter, localized longitudinal density enhancements in the OH
are observed over northern Russia and North America at corrected geomagnetic
latitudes poleward of 55$^{\circ}$. Although the northern Russia OH enhancement
is closely associated with increased EEP at these longitudes, the strength and
location of the North America enhancement appear to be unrelated to EEP. This
OH density enhancement is likely due to vertical motion induced by atmospheric
wave dynamics that transports air rich in atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen
downward into the middle atmosphere, where it plays a role in the formation of
OH. In the Southern Hemisphere, localized enhancements of the OH density over
West Antarctica can be explained by a combination of enhanced EEP due to the
local minimum in Earth's magnetic field strength and atmospheric dynamics. Our
findings suggest that even during solar minimum, there is substantial
EEP-driven OH production. However, to quantify this effect, a detailed
knowledge of where and when the precipitation occurs is required in the context
of the background atmospheric dynamics.

renewable energy sources (RES) drag electricity prices down and discourage
investments in flexible productions that are needed to compensate for the lack
of dispatchability of the new RES. The energy transition thus discourages the
investments that are required for its own harmonious expansion. To investigate
how this paradox can be overcome, we argue that, under certain assumptions,
future electricity prices are rather accurately modeled from the residual load
obtained by subtracting non-flexible productions from the load. Armed with the
resulting economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for European power
plants with various degree of flexibility. We find that, if neither carbon
taxes nor fuel prices change, flexible productions would be financially
rewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more
or less constant total production, i.e. by reducing the production of thermal
power plants at the same rate as the RES production increases. Less flexible
productions, on the other hand, would see their revenue grow more moderately.
Our results indicate that a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal
of thermal power plants would reward flexible productions faster.

achieved. The near-reliable communications link is used in a data acquisition
(DAQ) system for the next generation of extremely intense neutron source,
European Spallation Source. This paper presents measurements of UDP performance
and reliability as achieved by employing several optimizations. The
measurements were performed on Xeon E5 based CentOS (Linux) servers. The
measured data rates are very close to the 10 Gb/s line rate, and zero packet
loss was achieved. The performance was obtained utilizing a single processor
core as transmitter and a single core as receiver. The results show that
support for transmitting large data packets is a key parameter for good
performance.
  Optimizations for throughput are: MTU, packet sizes, tuning Linux kernel
parameters, thread affinity, core locality and efficient timers.

fluid dynamics since the nineteenth century. Hydrodynamic instabilities were
regarded as a cause for the onset of turbulence, but their theoretical
investigation led to paradoxical results. I focus on studies about the
instability of laminar boundary-layer flow along a flat plate. The experimental
discovery of boundary-layer oscillations (Tollmien-Schlichting waves) in the
USA during World War II vindicated a long-disputed theory developed in Germany
in the 1920s and 1930s. However, the instability which causes these
oscillations marks only the initial phase of the onset of turbulence;
higher-order instabilities had to be assumed in order to extend the analysis to
the regions of the transition zone where more complex phenomena (such as
""turbulent spots"") mark the onset of turbulence. There is still no theory to
describe these processes in a satisfactory manner. The emphasis on the
fundamental character of the problem, however, tends to obscure the practical
interests which motivated the study of boundary-layer instabilities throughout
its long history. The disputed theories played a role in the quest for ""laminar
airfoils"" and other practical applications. Theory and practice are entangled
more intimately than it would appear from the rhetoric about the fundamental
character of the ""turbulence problem"".

challenging topic. In order to address issues in this field, we can take
inspiration from nature, by studying human locomotion. The Spring-Loaded
Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has shown to be a good model for this purpose.
However, the human musculoskeletal system enables us to actively modulate leg
stiffness, for example when walking in rough terrain with irregular and
unexpected height variations of the walking surface. This ability of varying
leg stiffness is not considered in conventional SLIP-based models, and
therefore this paper explores the potential role of active leg stiffness
variation in bipedal locomotion. It is shown that the conceptual SLIP model can
be iteratively extended to more closely resemble a realistic (i.e., non-ideal)
walker, and that feedback control strategies can be designed that reproduce the
SLIP behavior in these extended models. We show that these extended models
realize a cost of transport comparable to human walking, which indicates that
active leg stiffness variation plays an important role in human locomotion that
was previously not captured by the SLIP model. The results of this study show
that active leg stiffness adaptation is a promising approach for realizing more
energy-efficient and robust bipedal walking robots.

determined by their basin of attraction. Characterizing the structure of these
basins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality.
Recent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed
points of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated
basins of attraction [D. A. Wiley {\it et al.} Chaos {\bf 16}, 015103 (2006),
P. J. Menck {\it et al.} Nat. Phys. {\bf 9}, 89 (2013)]. Here we revisit this
issue and propose an efficient numerical method to estimate these volumes. The
algorithm first identifies stable fixed points. Second, a set of initial
conditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of
hypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are
dynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally
determined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the
fixed point. Armed with this algorithm, we revisit the problem considered by
Wiley et al. in a seminal paper [D. A. Wiley {\it et al.} Chaos {\bf 16},
015103 (2006)] that inspired the title of the present manuscript, and consider
the equal-frequency Kuramoto model on a cycle. Fixed points of this model are
characterized by an integer winding number $q$ and the number $n$ of
oscillators. We find that the basin volumes scale as $(1-4q/n)^n$, contrasting
with the Gaussian behavior postulated in Wiley et al.'s paper. Finally, we show
the applicability of our method to complex models of coupled oscillators with
different natural frequencies and on meshed networks.

Fixed-order diagrammatic calculations capture all effects at a given order and
yield accurate results for scales of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles that are
not separated too much from the weak scale. Effective field theory calculations
allow a resummation of large logarithmic contributions up to all orders and
therefore yield accurate results for a high SUSY scale. A hybrid approach,
where both methods have been combined, is implemented in the computer code
FeynHiggs. So far, however, at large scales sizeable differences have been
observed between FeynHiggs and other pure EFT codes. In this work, the various
approaches are analytically compared with each other in a simple scenario in
which all SUSY mass scales are chosen to be equal to each other. Three main
sources are identified that account for the major part of the observed
differences. Firstly, it is shown that the scheme conversion of the input
parameters that is commonly used for the comparison of fixed-order results is
not adequate for the comparison of results containing a series of higher-order
logarithms. Secondly, the treatment of higher-order terms arising from the
determination of the Higgs propagator pole is addressed. Thirdly, the effect of
different parametrizations in particular of the top Yukawa coupling in the
non-logarithmic terms is investigated. Taking into account all of these
effects, in the considered simple scenario very good agreement is found for
scales above 1 TeV between the results obtained using the EFT approach and the
hybrid approach of FeynHiggs.

scenario that a packet needs to be transmitted within a strict delivery
deadline D ($D \geq 1$) (in unit of slot) since its arrival at the head of
queue, we consider the successful delivery probability (SDP) of a packet as

that maximizes the SDP for any $1 \leq M < N$ and any $D \geq 1$, and show it
can be computed by a fixed-point iteration. In particular, the case for D = 1

Based on these theoretical results, for real-life scenarios where N may be

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in dynamic
scenarios, with near-optimal performance.

High Energy Physics electron-positron collider to operate as a dedicated
synchrotron light source for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)
and to conduct accelerator physics research as a test accelerator, capable of
studying topics relevant to future damping rings, colliders and light sources.
Some of the specific topics that were targeted for the initial phase of
operation of the storage ring in this mode, labeled CesrTA (CESR as a Test
Accelerator), included 1) tuning techniques to produce low emittance beams, 2)
the study of electron cloud development in a storage ring and 3) intra-beam
scattering effects. The complete conversion of CESR to CesrTA occurred over a
several year period, described elsewhere. As a part of this conversion the CESR
beam position monitoring (CBPM) system was completely upgraded to provide the
needed instrumental capabilities for these studies. This paper describes the
new CBPM system hardware, its function and representative measurements
performed by the upgraded system.

emotional intensity is a major driving force for polarization that can lead to
a spontaneous onset of collective behavior at a certain degree of homophily and

to a polarization transition, marked by a sudden increase in the degree of

extreme transient responses, is quantified through i) either a few carefully
selected simulations or ii) through the use of effective measures (effective
stiffness and damping). The developed approach is able to accurately capture
the extreme response statistics orders of magnitude faster compared with direct

a primary structural system. Specifically, we consider the problem of
suppression of extreme responses in two prototype ocean engineering systems.
First, we consider linear and cubic springs and perform parametric optimization

generic, possibly asymmetric, piecewise linear spring and optimize its
nonlinear characteristics. The resulting asymmetric spring design far
outperforms the optimal cubic energy sink and the linear tuned mass dampers.

gravitational wave from the astrophysical black hole binaries. In this article,
we model the matter field around the intermediate-mass binary black holes by
means of an axion-like scalar field and investigate their joint evolution. In
details, we consider the equal mass binary black holes surrounded by a shell of
axion-like scalar field both in spherical symmetric and non-spherical symmetric
cases, and with different strength of the scalar field. Our result shows that
the environmental scalar field could essentially modify the dynamics. Firstly,
in the spherical symmetric case, with increasing of the scalar field strength,
the number of circular orbit of the binary black hole is reduced. It means that
the scalar field could significantly accelerate the merger process. Secondly,
once the scalar field strength exceeds certain critical value, the scalar field
could collapse into a third black hole with its mass being larger than the
binary. Consequently, the new black hole collapsed from the environmental
scalar field could accrete the binary promptly and the binary collides head-on
between each other. In this process, there is almost no any quadrupole signal
produced, namely the gravitational wave is greatly suppressed. Thirdly, when
the scalar field strength is relatively smaller than the critical value, the
black hole orbit could develop eccentricity through the accretion of the scalar
field. Fourthly, during the initial stage of the inspire, the gravitational
attractive force from the axion-like scalar field could induce a sudden turn in
the binary orbits, hence result in a transient wiggle in the gravitational
waveform. Finally, in the non-spherical case, the scalar field could
gravitationally attract the binary moving toward the mass center of the scalar
field and slow down the merger process.

We obtain Bogomolnyi equations for this phase transition, and show that
Bogomolnyi bound determines all important features of this bag model, including
its stable shape.
  In particular, for stationary KN solution the BPS-bound provides stability of
the ellipsoidal form of the bag and formation of the ring-string structure at
its border, while for the periodic electromagnetic excitations of the KN
solution, the BPS-bound controls deformation of the surface of the bag,
reproducing the known flexibility of bag models.

machine learning and pattern recognition. Through these advancements, variable
ranking has emerged as an active and growing research area and it is now
beginning to be applied to many new problems. The rationale behind this fact is
that many pattern recognition problems are by nature ranking problems. The main
objective of a ranking algorithm is to sort objects according to some criteria,
so that, the most relevant items will appear early in the produced result list.
Ranking methods can be analyzed from two different methodological perspectives:
ranking to learn and learning to rank. The former aims at studying methods and
techniques to sort objects for improving the accuracy of a machine learning
model. Enhancing a model performance can be challenging at times. For example,
in pattern classification tasks, different data representations can complicate
and hide the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. In
particular, hand-crafted features contain many cues that are either redundant
or irrelevant, which turn out to reduce the overall accuracy of the classifier.
In such a case feature selection is used, that, by producing ranked lists of
features, helps to filter out the unwanted information. Moreover, in real-time
systems (e.g., visual trackers) ranking approaches are used as optimization
procedures which improve the robustness of the system that deals with the high
variability of the image streams that change over time. The other way around,
learning to rank is necessary in the construction of ranking models for
information retrieval, biometric authentication, re-identification, and
recommender systems. In this context, the ranking model's purpose is to sort
objects according to their degrees of relevance, importance, or preference as
defined in the specific application.

Examplar-based methods use a color image as source of such information. Then
the colors of the source image are transferred to the gray-scale image. In the
literature, this transfer is mainly guided by texture descriptors. Face images
usually contain few texture so that the common approaches frequently fail. In
this paper we propose a new method based on image morphing. This technique is
able to compute a correspondence map between images with similar shapes. It is
based on the geometric structure of the images rather than textures which is
more reliable for faces. Our numerical experiments show that our morphing based
approach clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  Optical OFDM Transmission","9 pages,9 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Capacity is the eternal pursuit for communication systems due to the
overwhelming demand of bandwidth hungry applications. As the backbone
infrastructure of modern communication networks, the optical fiber transmission
system undergoes a significant capacity growth over decades by exploiting
available physical dimensions (time, frequency, quadrature, polarization and
space) of the optical carrier for multiplexing. For each dimension, stringent
orthogonality must be guaranteed for perfect separation of independent
multiplexed signals. To catch up with the ever-increasing capacity requirement,
it is therefore interesting and important to develop new multiplexing
methodologies relaxing the orthogonal constraint thus achieving better spectral
efficiency and more flexibility of frequency reuse. Inspired by the idea of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, here we propose a digital domain
power division multiplexed (PDM) transmission technology which is fully
compatible with current dual polarization (DP) coherent optical communication
system. The coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(CO-OFDM) modulation has been employed owing to its great superiority on high
spectral efficiency, flexible coding, ease of channel estimation and robustness
against fiber dispersion. And a PDM-DP-CO-OFDM has been theoretically and
experimentally demonstrated with 100Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
transmission over 1440km standard single mode fibers (SSMFs). Two baseband
quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) OFDM signals are overlaid together with
different power levels. After IQ modulation, polarization multiplexing and long
distance fiber transmission, the PDM-DP-CO-OFDM signal has been successfully
recovered in the typical polarization diversity coherent receiver by successive
interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm.
