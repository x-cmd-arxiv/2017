in Java subtyping is interesting and intricate due to the existence of wildcard
types and, accordingly, the existence of three subtyping rules for generic
types: covariant subtyping, contravariant subtyping and invariant subtyping.
Supporting bounded type variables also adds to the complexity of the subtyping
relation in Java and in other generic nominally-typed OO languages such as C#
and Scala. In this paper we explore defining an operad to model the
construction of the subtyping relation in Java and in similar generic
nominally-typed OO programming languages. Operads, from category theory, are
frequently used to model self-similar phenomena. The Java subtyping operad, we
hope, will shed more light on understanding the type systems of generic
nominally-typed OO languages.

developers to reason about these notions instead of the high-level concurrency
models they chose.
  This paper proposes a concurrency-agnostic debugger protocol that decouples
the debugger from the concurrency models employed by the target application. As
a result, the underlying language runtime can define custom breakpoints,
stepping operations, and execution events for each concurrency model it
supports, and a debugger can expose them without having to be specifically
adapted.
  We evaluated the generality of the protocol by applying it to SOMns, a
Newspeak implementation, which supports a diversity of concurrency models
including communicating sequential processes, communicating event loops,
threads and locks, fork/join parallelism, and software transactional memory. We
implemented 21 breakpoints and 20 stepping operations for these concurrency
models. For none of these, the debugger needed to be changed. Furthermore, we
visualize all concurrent interactions independently of a specific concurrency
model. To show that tooling for a specific concurrency model is possible, we
visualize actor turns and message sends separately.

case of axions. It is known that this leads to an instability, with exponential
amplification of gauge fields, controlled by the parameter $\xi=
\dot{\phi}/(2fH)$, which can strongly affect the generation of cosmological
perturbations and even the background. We show that scattering rates involving
gauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very
large occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature
$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller
scales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue
that previous constraints on $\xi$ are alleviated. If the gauge fields have
Standard Model interactions, which naturally provides reheating, they
thermalize already at $\xi\gtrsim2.9$, before perturbativity constraints and
also before backreaction takes place. In absence of SM interactions (i.e. for a
dark photon), we find that gauge fields and inflaton perturbations thermalize
if $\xi\gtrsim3.4$; however, observations require $\xi\gtrsim6$, which is above
the perturbativity and backreaction bounds and so a dedicated study is
required. After thermalization, though, the system should evolve non-trivially
due to the competition between the instability and the gauge field thermal
mass. If the thermal mass and the instabilities equilibrate, we expect an
equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq} \simeq \xi H/\bar{g}$ where $\bar{g}$ is the
effective gauge coupling. Finally, we estimate the spectrum of perturbations if
$\phi$ is thermal and find that the tensor to scalar ratio is suppressed by
$H/(2T)$, if tensors do not thermalize.

test the static and dynamic ordered choice model specifications and can cover
infinite support distributions for e.g. count data. The traditional approach
for specification testing of discrete response models is based on probability
integral transforms of a jittered discrete data which leads to continuous
uniform iid series under the true conditional distribution. Then, standard
specification testing techniques for continuous variables could be applied to
the transformed series, but the extra randomness from jitters affects the power
properties of these methods. We investigate in this paper an alternative
transformation based only on original discrete data that avoids any
randomization. We analyze the asymptotic properties of goodness-of-fit tests
based on this new transformation and explore the properties in finite samples

$\pi_d(X)$ of a topological space $X$. For the computational version of the
problem, it is well known that there is no algorithm to decide whether the
fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ of a given finite simplicial complex $X$ is
trivial. On the other hand, there are several algorithms that, given a finite
simplicial complex $X$ that is simply connected (i.e., with $\pi_1(X)$
trivial), compute the higher homotopy group $\pi_d(X)$ for any given $d\geq 2$.
%The first such algorithm was given by Brown, and more recently, \v{C}adek et
al.
  However, these algorithms come with a caveat: They compute the isomorphism
type of $\pi_d(X)$, $d\geq 2$ as an \emph{abstract} finitely generated abelian
group given by generators and relations, but they work with very implicit
representations of the elements of $\pi_d(X)$. Converting elements of this
abstract group into explicit geometric maps from the $d$-dimensional sphere
$S^d$ to $X$ has been one of the main unsolved problems in the emerging field
of computational homotopy theory.
  Here we present an algorithm that, given a~simply connected space $X$,
computes $\pi_d(X)$ and represents its elements as simplicial maps from a
suitable triangulation of the $d$-sphere $S^d$ to $X$. For fixed $d$, the
algorithm runs in time exponential in $size(X)$, the number of simplices of
$X$. Moreover, we prove that this is optimal: For every fixed $d\geq 2$, we
construct a family of simply connected spaces $X$ such that for any simplicial

the Pierre Auger Observatory, which indicates a metal-rich cosmic-ray
composition at ultrahigh energies, we investigate the fate of UHECR nuclei
loaded in TDE jets. First, we consider the production and survival of UHECR
nuclei at internal shocks, external forward and reverse shocks, and
nonrelativistic winds. Based on the observations of Swift J1644+57, we show
that the UHECRs can survive for external reverse and forward shocks, and disk
winds. On the other hand, UHECR nuclei are significantly disintegrated in
internal shocks, although they could survive for low-luminosity TDE jets.
Assuming that UHECR nuclei can survive, we consider implications of different
composition models of TDEs. We find that the tidal disruption of main sequence
stars or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs does not successfully reproduce UHECR
observations, namely the observed composition or spectrum. The observed mean
depth of the shower maximum and its deviation could be explained by
oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, but they may be too rare to be the sources

the signal to be recovered is periodic and comprised of atomic distributions
arranged homogeneously in the unit cell of the crystal. The crystallographic
problem is both the leading application and one of the hardest forms of phase
retrieval. We have constructed a graded set of benchmark problems for
evaluating algorithms that perform this type of phase retrieval. The data,
publicly available online, is provided in an easily interpretable format. We
also propose a simple and unambiguous success/failure criterion based on the
actual needs in crystallography. Baseline runtimes were obtained with an
iterative algorithm that is similar but more transparent than those used in
crystallography. Empirically, the runtimes grow exponentially with respect to a
new hardness parameter: the sparsity of the signal autocorrelation. We also
review the algorithms used by the leading software packages. This set of
benchmark problems, we hope, will encourage the development of new algorithms
for the phase retrieval problem in general, and crystallography in particular.

temperatures, densities, disk masses and protostellar accretion rates, are
discussed in detail. The new 2+1D model yields systematically colder disks,
while the in-falling parental clouds are warmer. Both effects act to increase
the strength of disk gravitational instability and, as a result, the number of
gravitationally bound fragments that form in the disk via gravitational
fragmentation as compared to the purely 2D thin-disk simulations with a
simplified thermal balance calculation.

particles, curvature-driven coarsening leads to shrinking and disappearance of
the first A-rich layer, leaving a layer of the non-preferred component in

taking a spatial gradient of both image and phantom, and (3) a
region-of-interest (ROI) Hotelling observer (HO) for
signal-known-exactly/background-known-exactly (SKE/BKE) and
signal-known-exactly/background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) detection tasks.
Two simulation studies are performed using the aforementioned metrics, varying
voxel aspect ratio and regularization strength for two types of Tikhonov
regularized least-squares optimization. The RMSE metrics are applied to a 2D
test phantom and the ROI-HO metric is applied to two tasks relevant to DBT:
large, low contrast lesion detection and small, high contrast
microcalcification detection. The RMSE metric trends are compared with visual
assessment of the reconstructed test phantom. The ROI-HO metric trends are
compared with 3D reconstructed images from ACR phantom data acquired with a
Hologic Selenia Dimensions DBT system. Sensitivity of image RMSE to mean pixel
value is found to limit its applicability to the assessment of DBT image
reconstruction. Image gradient RMSE is insensitive to mean pixel value and
appears to track better with subjective visualization of the reconstructed
bar-pattern phantom. The ROI-HO metric shows an increasing trend with
regularization strength for both forms of Tikhonov-regularized least-squares;
however, this metric saturates at intermediate regularization strength
indicating a point of diminishing returns for signal detection. Visualization
with reconstructed ACR phantom images appears to show a similar dependence with

candidates and keeping good candidates for further investigation. While DFT has
been widely successfully for the former, often times good candidates are lost
due to the uncertainty associated with the DFT-predicted material properties.
Uncertainty associated with DFT predictions has gained prominence and has led
to the development of exchange correlation functionals that have built-in error
estimation capability. In this work, we demonstrate the use of built-in error
estimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional for
quantifying the uncertainty associated with the magnetic ground state of
solids. We demonstrate this approach by calculating the uncertainty estimate
for the energy difference between the different magnetic states of solids and
compare them against a range of GGA exchange correlation functionals as is done
in many first principles calculations of materials. We show that this estimate
reasonably bounds the range of values obtained with the different GGA
functionals. The estimate is determined as a post-processing step and thus
provides a computationally robust and systematic approach to estimating
uncertainty associated with predictions of magnetic ground states. We define a
confidence value (c-value) that incorporates all calculated magnetic states in
order to quantify the concurrence of the prediction at the GGA level and argue
that predictions of magnetic ground states from GGA level DFT is incomplete
without an accompanying c-value. We demonstrate the utility of this method
using a case study of Li and Na-ion cathode materials and the c-value metric
correctly identifies that GGA level DFT will have low predictability for
NaFePO$_4$F.

the non-convergence of the cooling boundary for fragmentation reported in the
literature. We run SPH simulations with two different artificial viscosity
implementations, and compare them with MFM, which does not employ any
artificial viscosity. With MFM we demonstrate convergence of the critical
cooling time scale for fragmentation at \beta_{crit} =3.. Non-convergence
persists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes
having reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &
Dehnen 2010). We show how the non-convergence problem is caused by artificial
fragmentation triggered by excessive dissipation of angular momentum in domains
with large velocity derivatives. With increased resolution such domains become
more prominent. Vorticity lags behind density due to numerical viscous
dissipation in these regions, promoting collapse with longer cooling times.
Such effect is shown to be dominant over the competing tendency of artificial
viscosity to diminish with increasing resolution. When the initial conditions
are first relaxed for several orbits, the flow is more regular, with lower
shear and vorticity in non-axisymmetric regions, aiding convergence. Yet MFM is
the only method that converges exactly. Our findings are of general interest as
numerical dissipation via artificial viscosity or advection errors can also
occur in grid-based codes. Indeed for the FARGO code values of \beta_{crit}
significantly higher than our converged estimate have been reported in the
literature. Finally, we discuss implications for giant planet formation via
disk instability.

function (LF) extending out to redshifts z~5, with resulting implications for
the level of dust-obscured star-formation density in the young Universe. To
achieve this we have exploited recent advances in sub-mm/mm imaging with
SCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), which together provide unconfused
imaging with sufficient dynamic range to provide meaningful coverage of the
luminosity-redshift plane out to z>4. Our results support previous indications
that the faint-end slope of the far-IR LF is sufficiently flat that comoving
luminosity-density is dominated by bright objects (~L*). However, we find that
the number-density/luminosity of such sources at high redshifts has been
severely over-estimated by studies that have attempted to push the
highly-confused Herschel SPIRE surveys beyond z~2. Consequently we confirm
recent reports that cosmic star-formation density is dominated by UV-visible
star formation at z>4. Using both direct (1/Vmax) and maximum likelihood
determinations of the LF, we find that its high-redshift evolution is well
characterized by continued positive luminosity evolution coupled with negative
density evolution (with increasing redshift). This explains why bright sub-mm
sources continue to be found at z>5, even though their integrated contribution
to cosmic star-formation density at such early times is very small. The
evolution of the far-IR galaxy LF thus appears similar in form to that already
established for active galactic nuclei, possibly reflecting a similar
dependence on the growth of galaxy mass.

weak lensing (WL) mass profiles unaffected by cluster member dilution from the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program (HSC-SSP). The ongoing
HSC-SSP survey will uncover thousands of galaxy clusters to $z\lesssim1.5$. In
deriving cluster masses via WL, a critical source of systematics is
contamination and dilution of the lensing signal by cluster {members, and by
foreground galaxies whose photometric redshifts are biased}. Using the
first-year CAMIRA catalog of $\sim$900 clusters with richness larger than 20
found in $\sim$140 deg$^2$ of HSC-SSP data, we devise and compare several
source selection methods, including selection in color-color space (CC-cut),
and selection of robust photometric redshifts by applying constraints on their
cumulative probability distribution function (PDF; P-cut). We examine the
dependence of the contamination on the chosen limits adopted for each method.
Using the proper limits, these methods give mass profiles with minimal dilution
in agreement with one another. We find that not adopting either the CC-cut or
P-cut methods results in an underestimation of the total cluster mass
($13\pm4\%$) and the concentration of the profile ($24\pm11\%$). The level of
cluster contamination can reach as high as $\sim10\%$ at $R\approx 0.24$
Mpc/$h$ for low-z clusters without cuts, while employing either the P-cut or
CC-cut results in cluster contamination consistent with zero to within the 0.5%
uncertainties. Our robust methods yield a $\sim60\sigma$ detection of the
stacked CAMIRA surface mass density profile, with a mean mass of
$M_\mathrm{200c} = (1.67\pm0.05({\rm {stat}}))\times 10^{14}\,M_\odot/h$.

using an Eddington ratio threshold introduces less bias into the sample by
selecting the full range of growing black holes, despite the challenge of
selecting low mass black holes. We find that selecting AGN using these various

micron quiet, therefore good starless candidates. Our sample of 18 clumps has
masses 300 < M < 3000 M_sun, radius 0.54 < R < 1.00 pc, surface densities Sigma
> 0.05 g cm^-2 and luminosity/mass ratio L/M < 0.3. We show that half of these
70 micron quiet clumps embed faint 24 micron sources. Comparison with GLIMPSE
counterparts shows that 5 clumps embed young stars of intermediate stellar mass
up to ~5.5 M_sun. We study the clump dynamics with observations of N2H+ (1-0),
HNC (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) made with the IRAM 30m telescope. Seven clumps have
blue-shifted spectra compatible with infall signatures, for which we estimate a
mass accretion rate 0.04 < M_dot < 2.0 x 10^-3 M_sun yr^-1, comparable with
values found in high-mass protostellar regions, and free-fall time of the order
of t_ff = 3 x 10^5 yr. The only appreciable difference we find between objects
with and without embedded 24 micron sources is that the infall rate appears to
increase from 24 micron dark to 24 micron bright objects. We conclude that all
70 micron quiet objects have similar properties on clump scales, independently
of the presence of an embedded protostar. Based on our data we speculate that
the majority, if not all of these clumps may already embed faint, low-mass
protostellar cores. If these clumps are to form massive stars, this must occur
after the formation of these lower mass stars.

identify memory effects, we first show quasi-steady state currents form in
finite, isolated Bose and Fermi Hubbard models driven by interaction imbalance
and they become steady-state currents in the thermodynamic limit. By comparing
the steady state currents from different initial states or ramping rates of the
imbalance, long-time memory effects can be quantified. While the memory effects
of initial states are more ubiquitous, the memory effects of switching
protocols are mostly visible in interaction-induced transport in lattices. Our
simulations suggest the systems enter a regime governed by a generalized Fick's

basis of R\'enyi entropy and its relative versions. In this framework, we
define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy, and
fundamental quantum thermodynamical inequalities are deduced. In the context of
R\'enyi's thermodynamics, the variational Helmholtz principle is stated and the
condition of equilibrium is analyzed. The R\'enyi maximum entropy principle is
formulated and the equality case is discussed. The obtained results reduce to
the von Neumann ones when the R\'enyi entropic parameter $\alpha$ approaches 1.
The Heisenberg and Schr\""odinger uncertainty principles on the measurements of
quantum observables are revisited. The presentation is self-contained and the
proofs only use standard matrix analysis techniques.

(2015), we reported the first direct evidence for a quasar
accretion disk wind driving a massive molecular outflow. The target was
F11119+3257, an ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) with unambiguous type-1
quasar optical broad emission lines. The energetics of the accretion disk wind
and molecular outflow were found to be consistent with the predictions of
quasar feedback models where the molecular outflow is driven by a hot
energy-conserving bubble inflated by the inner quasar accretion disk wind.
However, this conclusion was uncertain because the energetics were estimated
from the optically thick OH 119 um transition profile observed with Herschel.
Here, we independently confirm the presence of the molecular outflow in
F11119+3257, based on the detection of broad wings in the CO(1-0) profile
derived from ALMA observations. The broad CO(1-0) line emission appears to be
spatially extended on a scale of at least ~7 kpc from the center. Mass outflow
rate, momentum flux, and mechanical power of (80-200) R_7^{-1} M_sun/yr,
(1.5-3.0) R_7^{-1} L_AGN/c, and (0.15-0.40)% R_7^{-1} L_AGN are inferred from
these data, assuming a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor appropriate for a ULIRG (R_7
is the radius of the outflow normalized to 7 kpc and L_AGN is the AGN
luminosity). These rates are time-averaged over a flow time scale of 7x10^6
yrs. They are similar to the OH-based rates time-averaged over a flow time
scale of 4x10^5 yrs, but about a factor 4 smaller than the local
(""instantaneous""; <10^5 yrs) OH-based estimates cited in Tombesi et al. The
implications of these new results are discussed in the context of time-variable
quasar-mode feedback and galaxy evolution. The need for an energy-conserving
bubble to explain the molecular outflow is also re-examined.

by an X-ray free electron laser. A range of pulse parameters is explored and
the effects on the predicted Fe XVII 3C and 3D line intensity ratio are
calculated. In order to investigate the behavior of the predicted line
intensity ratio, a particular pair of A-values for the 3C and 3D transitions
was chosen (2.22 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ and 6.02 $\times$ 10$^{12}$

of the precise values. We also reaffirm the conclusions from Oreshkina et
al.(2014, 2015): the non-linear effects in the density matrix are important and
the reduction in the Fe XVII 3C/3D line intensity ratio is sensitive to the
laser pulse parameters, namely pulse duration, pulse intensity, and laser
bandwidth. It is also shown that for both models the lowering of the 3C/3D line
intensity ratio below the expected time-independent oscillator strength ratio
has a significant contribution due to the emission from the plasma after the
laser pulse has left the plasma volume. Laser intensities above $\sim 1\times
10^{12}$ W/cm$^{2}$ are required for a reduction in the 3C/3D line intensity
ratio below the expected time independent oscillator strength ratio.

standard photometric observations in an optically very stable configuration,
only moving the telescope across the sky, with variations in its configuration
parameters limited to scan speed and sampling rate. This and the scarcity of
features in the data that require special processing steps made this dataset
very attractive for producing an expert reduced catalog of point sources that
is being described in this document. The Catalog was extracted from a total of
6878 unmodified SPIRE scan map observations. The photometry was obtained by a
systematic and homogeneous source extraction procedure, followed by a rigorous
quality check that emphasized reliability over completeness. Having to exclude
regions affected by strong Galactic emission, that pushed the limits of the
four source extraction methods that were used, this catalog is aimed primarily
at the extragalactic community. The result can serve as a pathfinder for ALMA

paper, we generalize the definition of the Markov states to arbitrary

important property of the Markov states: If the initial state of the whole
system-environment is a Markov state, then each localized dynamics of the whole
system-environment reduces to a localized subdynamics of the system. This
provides us a necessary condition for entanglement revival in an open quantum
system: Entanglement revival can occur only when the system-environment state
is not a Markov state. To illustrate (a part of) our results, we consider the
case that the environment is modeled as classical. In this case, though the
correlation between the system and the environment remains classical during the
evolution, the change of the state of the system-environment, from its initial
Markov state to a state which is not a Markov one, leads to the entanglement
revival in the system. This shows that the non-Markovianity of a state is not
equivalent to the existence of non-classical correlation in it, in general.

experimental evidence for the long-sought Weyl fermions. Beyond fundamental
relevance, their high mobility, strong magnetoresistance, and the possible
existence of even more exotic effects, such as the chiral anomaly, make Weyl
semimetals a promising platform to develop radically new technology. Fully
exploiting their potential requires going beyond the mere identification of
materials and calls for a detailed characterization of their functional
response, which is severely complicated by the coexistence of surface- and
bulk-derived topologically protected quasiparticles, i.e., Fermi arcs and Weyl
points, respectively. Here, we focus on the type-II Weyl semimetal class where
we find a stoichiometry-dependent phase transition from a trivial to a
non-trivial regime. By exploring the two extreme cases of the phase diagram, we
demonstrate the existence of a universal response of both surface and bulk
states to perturbations. We show that quasi-particle interference patterns
originate from scattering events among surface arcs. Analysis reveals that
topologically non-trivial contributions are strongly suppressed by spin
texture. We also show that scattering at localized impurities generate
defect-induced quasiparticles sitting close to the Weyl point energy. These
give rise to strong peaks in the local density of states, which lift the Weyl
node significantly altering the pristine low-energy Weyl spectrum. Visualizing
the microscopic response to scattering has important consequences for
understanding the unusual transport properties of this class of materials.
Overall, our observations provide a unifying picture of the Weyl phase diagram.

pronounced reduction of the cooling power achievable with the recently

that the cooling power can be boosted significantly by carefully engineering

renewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper
spatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit this
heterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of renewable
electricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal
portfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal
distributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs
of backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current
cost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind,
particularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average
electricity costs that are up to 11% lower than for a homogeneous reference
distribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load. The
reduction becomes even larger, namely 18%, once the transmission capacities are
put to zero in the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to
distribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar capacity
factors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to fully optimised
renewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits of transparency and
comprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results to changing costs of solar
generation and gas supply as well as to the possible cross-sectoral usage of
unavoidable curtailment energy are also examined.

important mechanism for limiting star cluster formation through the heating and
ionization of the surrounding gas. We explore the degree to which radiative
feedback affects early ($\lesssim$5 Myr) cluster formation in GMCs having
masses that range from 10$^{4-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ using the FLASH code. The
inclusion of radiative feedback lowers the efficiency of cluster formation by
20-50\% relative to hydrodynamic simulations. Two models in particular ---
5$\times$10$^4$ and 10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ --- show the largest suppression of the
cluster formation efficiency, corresponding to a factor of $\sim$2. For these
clouds only, the internal energy, a measure of the energy injected by radiative
feedback, exceeds the gravitational potential for a significant amount of time.
We find a clear relation between the maximum cluster mass, M$_{cl,max}$, formed
in a GMC of mass M$_{GMC}$; M$_{cl,max}\propto$ M$_{GMC}^{0.81}$. This scaling
result suggests that young globular clusters at the necessary scale of $10^6
M_{\odot}$ form within host GMCs of masses near $\sim 5 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$.
We compare simulated cluster mass distributions to the observed embedded
cluster mass function ($dlog(N)/dlog(M) \propto M^{\beta}$ where $\beta$ = -1)
and find good agreement ($\beta$ = -0.99$\pm$0.14) only for simulations
including radiative feedback, indicating this process is important in
controlling the growth of young clusters. However, the high star formation
efficiencies, which range from 16-21\%, and high star formation rates compared
to locally observed regions suggest other feedback mechanisms are also
important during the formation and growth of stellar clusters.

acceleration regions. This requires a finite guide field so that particles may
move quickly along the flux rope axis. We show that greatest energetic electron
production occurs when the guide field is of the same order as the reconnecting
component: large enough to facilitate strong transport, but not so large as to
throttle the dominant Fermi mechanism responsible for efficient electron
acceleration. This suggests a natural explanation for the envelope of electron
acceleration during the impulsive phase of eruptive flares.

perform two updates: (i) a verification in which they check-in a randomized

collaboration with space-based observations, the microlens parallax can be
routinely measured. In addition, space-based observations can provide
opportunities to verify the microlens parallax measured from ground-only
observations and to find a unique solution of the lensing lightcurve analysis.
However, since most space-based observations cannot cover the full lightcurves
of lensing events, it is also necessary to verify the reliability of the
information extracted from fragmentary space-based lightcurves. We conduct a
test based on the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0168 created by a binary

using the space-based lightcurve even though the observations are fragmentary.
Since space-based observatories will frequently produce fragmentary lightcurves

schemes that encode a message into $n$ shares, assigned to $n$ nodes, so that

any information about the message. In the event of node failures so that shares
held by the failed nodes are lost, the system needs to be repaired by
reconstructing and reassigning the lost shares to the failed (or replacement)
nodes. This can be achieved trivially by a trustworthy third-party that
receives the shares of the available nodes, recompute and reassign the lost
shares. The interesting question, studied in the paper, is how to repair
without a trustworthy third-party. The main issue that arises is repair
security: how to maintain the requirement that any colluding $z$ nodes,
including the failed nodes, cannot learn any information about the message,
during and after the repair process? We solve this secure repair problem from
the perspective of secure multi-party computation. Specifically, we design
generic repair schemes that can securely repair any (scalar or vector) linear
secret sharing schemes. We prove a lower bound on the repair bandwidth of
secure repair schemes and show that the proposed secure repair schemes achieve
the optimal repair bandwidth up to a small constant factor when $n$ dominates
$z$, or when the secret sharing scheme being repaired has optimal rate. We
adopt a formal information-theoretic approach in our analysis and bounds. A
main idea in our schemes is to allow a more flexible repair model than the
straightforward one-round repair model implicitly assumed by existing secure
regenerating codes. Particularly, the proposed secure repair schemes are simple

two types of bonds are intrinsically immiscible without co-solvents. Here we
design and fabricate a hybrid polymer network by crosslinking randomly branched
polymers carrying motifs that can form both reversible hydrogen bonds and
permanent covalent crosslinks. The randomly branched polymer links such two
types of bonds and forces them to mix on the molecular level without
co-solvents. This allows us to create a hybrid dry elastomer that is very tough
with a fracture energy $13,500J/m^2$ comparable to that of natural rubber;
moreover, the elastomer can self-heal at room temperature with a recovered

the STELLAR evolution code developed by Yorke & Bodenheimer with recent
modifications by Hosokawa et al. The mass accretion rates were taken from
numerical hydrodynamics models of Vorobyov & Basu computing the circumstellar
disk evolution starting from the gravitational collapse of pre-stellar cloud
cores of various mass and angular momentum. The resulting stellar evolution
tracks were compared with the isochrones and isomasses calculated using
non-accreting models. We find that mass accretion in the initial several Myr of
protostellar evolution can have a strong effect on the subsequent evolution of
young stars and brown dwarfs. The disagreement between accreting and
non-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar
radius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency
of accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central
object. The largest mismatch is found for the cold accretion case, in which
essentially all accretion energy is radiated away. The relative deviations in
L_st and R_st in this case can reach 50% for 1.0-Myr-old objects and remain
notable even for 10-Myr-old objects. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in
which a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement
between accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still
remains notable for 1.0-Myr-old objects. These disagreements may lead to the
wrong age estimate for objects of (sub-)solar mass when using the isochrones

stellar models that is characterized by five independent parameters: model mass
and age, initial metallicity ($\zini$), initial helium ($\yini$), and mixing
length parameter ($\alpha_{mlt}$). Using this grid relaxes assumptions used in
all previous GBM work where the initial composition is determined by a single
parameter and that $\alpha_{mlt}$ is fixed to a solar-calibrated value. The new
grid allows us to study, for example, the impact of different galactic chemical
enrichment models on the determination of stellar parameters such as mass
radius and age. Also, it allows to include new results from stellar atmosphere
models on $\alpha_{mlt}$ in the GBM analysis in a simple manner. Alternatively,
it can be tested if global asteroseismology is a useful tool to constraint our
ignorance on quantities such as $\yini$ and $\alpha_{mlt}$. Initial findings
show that mass determination is robust with respect to freedom in the latter
quantities, with a 4.4\% maximum deviation for extreme assumptions regarding
prior information on $\yini-\zini$ relations and $\alpha_{mlt}$. On the other
hand, tests carried out so far seem to indicate that global seismology does not

enable robots to learn and complete a manipulation task cooperatively. With
this method, a vision system is involved in both the task demonstration and
reproduction stages. An expert first demonstrates how to use tools to perform a
task, while the tool motion is observed using a vision system. The
demonstrations are then encoded using a statistical model to generate a
reference motion trajectory. Equipped with the same tools and the learned
model, the robot is guided by vision to reproduce the task. The task
performance was evaluated in terms of both accuracy and speed. However, simply
increasing the robot's speed could decrease the reproduction accuracy. To this
end, a dual-rate Kalman filter is employed to compensate for latency between
the robot and vision system. More importantly, the sampling rates of the
reference trajectory and the robot speed are optimised adaptively according to
the learned motion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
performing two tasks: a trajectory reproduction task and a bimanual sewing
task. We show that using our vision-based approach, the robots can conduct
effective learning by demonstrations and perform accurate and fast task
reproduction. The proposed approach is generalisable to other manipulation
tasks, where bimanual or multi-robot cooperation is required.

not make use of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing

are a compressing algorithm, a dissimilarity measure and a threshold, needed to
accept or reject the authorship of the questioned document. Due to its
compactness, our method performs very fast and can be reimplemented with
minimal effort. In addition, the method can handle complicated AV cases where
both, the questioned and the reference document, are not related to each other

existence of a branch of target pattern solutions that bifurcates from the
spatially homogeneous state when $\varepsilon$, the strength of the

linearization about the homogeneous state is a convolution operator of
diffusive type and hence not invertible on the usual Sobolev spaces. Second, a
regular perturbation expansion in $\varepsilon$ does not provide a good ansatz
for applying the implicit function theorem since the nonlinearities play a
major role in determining the relevant approximation, which also needs to be
""correct"" to all orders in $\varepsilon$. We overcome these two points by
proving Fredholm properties for the linearization in appropriate Kondratiev
spaces and using a refined ansatz for the approximate solution, which obtained
using matched asymptotics.

representation system based on the category of sets and relations. It is
inspired by Spivak and Kent's olog, a recent categorical framework for
knowledge representation. Relational ologs interpolate between ologs and
description logic, the dominant formalism for knowledge representation today.
In this paper, we investigate relational ologs both for their own sake and to
gain insight into the relationship between the algebraic and logical approaches
to knowledge representation. On a practical level, we show by example that
relational ologs have a friendly and intuitive--yet fully precise--graphical
syntax, derived from the string diagrams of monoidal categories. We explain
several other useful features of relational ologs not possessed by most
description logics, such as a type system and a rich, flexible notion of
instance data. In a more theoretical vein, we draw on categorical logic to show
how relational ologs can be translated to and from logical theories in a
fragment of first-order logic. Although we make extensive use of categorical
language, this paper is designed to be self-contained and has considerable
expository content. The only prerequisites are knowledge of first-order logic
and the rudiments of category theory.

edge-colouring such that any $k$ vertices of $G$ lie on a rainbow cycle in $G$.
The $k$-$rainbow$ $cycle$ $index$ of $G$, denoted by $crx_{k}(G)$, is the
minimum number of colours needed in a $k$-rainbow cycle colouring of $G$. In
this paper, we restrict our attention to the computational aspects of
$k$-rainbow cycle colouring. First, we prove that the problem of deciding
whether $crx_1=3$ can be solved in polynomial time, but that of deciding
whether $crx_1 \leq k$ is NP-Complete, where $k\geq 4$. Then we show that the
problem of deciding whether $crx_2=3$ can be solved in polynomial time, but
those of deciding whether $crx_2 \leq 4$ or $5$ are NP-Complete. Furthermore,
we also consider the cases of $crx_3=3$ and $crx_3 \leq 4$. Finally, We prove
that the problem of deciding whether a given edge-colouring (with an unbounded
number of colours) of a graph is a $k$-rainbow cycle colouring, is NP-Complete
for $k=1$, $2$ and $3$, respectively. Some open problems for further study are

of codimension two is determined by the moduli of its second fundamental forms.
More precisely, given a nonsingular subvariety $X^n \subset {\mathbb P}^{n+2}$,
the second fundamental form $II_{X,x}$ at a point $x \in X$ is a pencil of
quadrics on $T_x(X)$, defining a rational map $\mu^X$ from $X$ to a suitable
moduli space of pencils of quadrics on a complex vector space of dimension $n$.
The question raised by Griffiths and Harris was whether the image of $\mu^X$
determines $X$. We study this question when $X^n \subset {\mathbb P}^{n+2}$ is
a nonsingular intersection of two quadric hypersurfaces of dimension $n >4$. In
this case, the second fundamental form $II_{X,x}$ at a general point $x \in X$
is a nonsingular pencil of quadrics. Firstly, we prove that the moduli map
$\mu^X$ is dominant over the moduli of nonsingular pencils of quadrics. This
gives a negative answer to Griffiths-Harris's question. To remedy the
situation, we consider a refined version $\widetilde\mu^X$ of the moduli map
$\mu^X$, which takes into account the infinitesimal information of $\mu^X$. Our
main result is an affirmative answer in terms of the refined moduli map: we
prove that the image of $\widetilde\mu^X$ determines $X$, among nonsingular
intersections of two quadrics.

methods either do not conduct domain transfer learning or can not handle large
missing area. For example, the inpainting approach tends to blur the generated

exploit the potential of deep learning networks in filling large missing region

high-fidelity in cross domains. We propose the recursive generation by
bidirectional transformation networks (r-BTN) that recursively generates a

the cross domain challenge make it difficult to generate satisfactory results
using a unidirectional cross-domain learning structure. On the other hand, a
forward and backward bidirectional learning between the face and sketch domains
would enable recursive estimation of the missing region in an incremental
manner (Fig. 1) and yield appealing results. r-BTN also adopts an adversarial
constraint to encourage the generation of realistic faces/sketches. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance from
r-BTN as compared to existing potential solutions.

unwanted couplings in the superconductor. Here, we propose a scheme to probe
fractional DC Josephson effect of semiconductor nanowire-based topological
Josephson junction through 4{\pi} phase slip. By exploiting a topological RF
SQUID system we find that the dominant contribution for Josephson coupling
comes from the interaction of Majorana Fermions, resulting the resonant

two orders of magnitude shorter than the poisoning time of nonequilibrium

introduction of smart cities has been widely demonstrated. This positive thrust
however is faced with several delaying factors, one of which is the volatility
and unpredictability of the potential benefit (or utilization) of ride-sharing
at different times, and in different places. In this work the following
research questions are posed: (a) Is ride-sharing utilization stable over time
or does it undergo significant changes? (b) If ride-sharing utilization is
dynamic, can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and
(c) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be predicted ahead of time?
We analyze a dataset of over 14 Million taxi trips taken in New York City. We
propose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the
potential ride-sharing utilization over time, showing it to be highly volatile.
In order to model the utilization's dynamics we propose a network-centric
approach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods
into a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied
by this traffic. This feature space is then used to model the dynamics of
ride-sharing utilization over time. The results of our analysis demonstrate the
significant volatility of ride-sharing utilization over time, indicating that
any policy, design or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static
paradigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient
resources. We show that using our suggested approach it is possible to model
the potential utilization of ride sharing based on the topological properties
of the rides network. We also show that using this method the potential
utilization can be forecasting a few hours ahead of time.

rotational symmetry about the axis of precession. This implies that in the
adiabatic limit the spin current is absent and that spin pumping is entirely a

on the underlying knowledge representation formalism. When Classical Logic is
used, updates are typically performed by manipulating the knowledge base on the
model-theoretic level. On the opposite side of the spectrum stand the semantics
for updating Answer-Set Programs that need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a
unifying perspective that could embrace both these branches of research is of
great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods
and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and
further development.
  This paper bridges the seemingly irreconcilable approaches to updates. It
introduces a novel monotonic characterisation of rules, dubbed RE-models, and
shows it to be a more suitable semantic foundation for rule updates than
SE-models. Then it proposes a generic scheme for specifying semantic rule
update operators, based on the idea of viewing a program as the set of sets of
RE-models of its rules; updates are performed by introducing additional
interpretations - exceptions - to the sets of RE-models of rules in the
original program. The introduced scheme is used to define rule update operators
that are closely related to both classical update principles and traditional
approaches to rules updates, and serve as a basis for a solution to the
long-standing problem of state condensing, showing how they can be equivalently
defined as binary operators on some class of logic programs.
  Finally, the essence of these ideas is extracted to define an abstract
framework for exception-based update operators, viewing a knowledge base as the
set of sets of models of its elements, which can capture a wide range of both
model- and formula-based classical update operators, and thus serves as the
first firm formal ground connecting classical and rule updates.

which could provide useful SF implementation information for models of massive
galaxy formation and evolution. We aim at determining the K-S law parameters
for the first time for a well-selected, statistical sample of SMGs. We used
ALMA to conduct a 0.2"" resolution, 870 $\mu$m imaging survey of 40 SMGs in
COSMOS, which were initially selected at 1.1 mm. We analysed a sample of 32/40
target SMGs, for which our new ALMA 870 $\mu$m data provide information about
the spatial extent of dust emission, and all of which have dust-obscured SFR
and dust-based gas mass estimates available from our previous study. We divided
our sample into equally large subsamples of main-sequence objects and
starbursts, and found their K-S relations to be of the form $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}
\propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^{0.81\pm0.01}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto
\Sigma_{\rm gas}^{0.84\pm0.39}$, respectively. The slightly sub-linear K-S
slopes we derived suggest that the SF efficiency is nearly constant across the
$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ range probed. Under the assumption of a Galactic CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor for the whole sample, the MS SMGs obey a constant global SFE
of about 21% per 100 Myr, while that of starburst SMGs is about 27%. The
corresponding gas depletion times are $\sim480$ Myr and 370 Myr. On average,
our SMGs have $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\gtrsim10^{3.9}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, which
suggests that they are Eddington-limited. This is consistent with the
theoretical expectation of a linear K-S relation for such systems. However,
size measurements of the CO-emitting regions of SMGs, and the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$
values of SMGs are needed to further constrain their $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ values.

directly measure. Various analytic models and numerical codes exist but their
results often drastically differ. Thus a critical comparison of the modeled
magnetic field lines with the observed coronal loops is strongly required to
establish the credibility of the model. Here we compare two different
non-potential extrapolation codes, a non-linear force-free field code
(CESE-MHD-NLFFF) and a non-force-free field (NFFF) code in modeling a solar
active region (AR) that has a sigmoidal configuration just before a major flare
erupted from the region. A 2D coronal-loop tracing and fitting method is
employed to study the 3D misalignment angles between the extrapolated magnetic
field lines and the EUV loops as imaged by SDO/AIA. It is found that the
CESE-MHD-NLFFF code with preprocessed magnetogram performs the best, outputting
a field which matches the coronal loops in the AR core imaged in AIA 94 {\AA}
with a misalignment angle of ~10 degree. This suggests that the CESE-MHD-NLFFF
code, even without using the information of coronal loops in constraining the
magnetic field, performs as good as some coronal-loop forward-fitting models.
For the loops as imaged by AIA 171 {\AA} in the outskirts of the AR, all the
codes including the potential-field give comparable results of mean
misalignment angle (~30 degree). Thus further improvement of the codes is
needed for a better reconstruction of the long loops enveloping the core
region.

have the advantages of using the Bayesian framework even when information about
the parameters of a model is not available. The usual objective approaches work
off the chosen statistical model and in the majority of cases the resulting
prior is improper, which can pose limitations to a practical implementation,
even when the complexity of the model is moderate. In this paper we propose to
take a novel look at the construction of objective prior distributions, where
the connection with a chosen sampling distribution model is removed. We explore
the notion of defining objective prior distributions which allow one to have
some degree of flexibility, in particular in exhibiting some desirable
features, such as being proper, or centered on specific values which would be
of interest in nested model comparisons. The basic tool we use are proper
scoring rules and the main result is a class of objective prior distributions
that can be employed in scenarios where the usual model based priors fail, such
as mixture models and model selection via Bayes factors. In addition, we show
that the proposed class of priors is the result of minimising the information

class of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a
special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical
GRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield
significant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with
the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope
on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by
multi-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws,
and we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the
spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large
ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another
ultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of
the host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8
days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,
the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9
days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be
exceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic
rebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and
are not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow
parameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for
these parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that
of classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A
resulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.

address in order to mitigate the disastrous effects of hydrocarbons on aquatic
ecosystems. A rational approach to address the problem of marine oil water
separation is to disperse the oil with the aid of surfactants in order to
minimize the formation of large slicks at the water surface and to maximize the
oil-water interfacial area. Here we investigate the fundamental wetting and
transport behavior of such surfactant-stabilized droplets and the flow
conditions necessary to perform sieving and separation of these stabilized
emulsions. We show that, for water soluble surfactants, such droplets are
completely repelled by a range of materials (intrinsically underwater
superoleophobic) due to the detergency effect; therefore, there is no need for
surface micro/nanotexturing or chemical treatment to repel the oil and prevent
fouling of the filter. We then simulate and experimentally investigate the
effect of emulsion flow rate on the transport and impact behavior of such
droplets on rigid meshes to identify the minimum pore opening (w) necessary to
filter a droplet with a given diameter (d) in order to minimize the pressure
drop across the mesh and therefore maximize the filtering efficiency, which is
strongly dependent on w. We define a range of flow conditions and droplet sizes
where minimum droplet deformation is to be expected and therefore find that the
condition of is sufficient for efficient separation. With this new
understanding, we demonstrate the use of a commercially available
filter--without any additional surface engineering or functionalization--to
separate oil droplets from a surfactant stabilized emulsion with a flux of
11,000 L m$^{-2}$ hr$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$. We believe these findings can inform
the design of future oil separation materials.

than the zone of magmatic emplacement to form the oceanic crust. Magma is
focused into this zone by lateral transport. This focusing has typically been
explained by dynamic pressure gradients associated with corner flow, or by a
sub-lithospheric channel sloping upward toward the ridge axis. Here we discuss
a novel mechanism for magmatic focusing: lateral transport driven by gradients
in compaction pressure within the asthenosphere. These gradients arise from the
co-variation of melting rate and compaction viscosity. The compaction
viscosity, in previous models, was given as a function of melt fraction and
temperature. In contrast, we show that the viscosity variations relevant to
melt focusing arise from grain-size variability and non-Newtonian creep. The
asthenospheric distribution of melt fraction predicted by our models provides
an improved ex- planation of the electrical resistivity structure beneath one
location on the East Pacific Rise. More generally, although grain size and
non-Newtonian viscosity are properties of the solid phase, we find that in the
context of mid-ocean ridges, their effect on melt transport is more profound
than their effect on the mantle corner-flow.

if the new mesons contain two-quarks and two-antiquarks (tetraquarks), while

objects, just as in the case of normal hadrons, but with more constituents, or
loosely bound ""molecules"" similar to the deuteron, but formed from two mesons,

field acts as off-resonant excitation with photon energy below the lattice
phonons and the interband transitions. Differently from optical and infrared

tunneling with a negligible entropy deposition. In previous experiments the
temporal dynamics of IMT in VO2 could be only indirectly inferred. We
disentangle the electronic and lattice contributions to the IMT on a
sub-picosecond timescale. Near the critical temperature the IMT becomes
dissipative and the terahertz field concludes the lattice-assisted metallic
nucleation initiated by heating. The method of strong-field induced phase
transition presented here is applicable to a wide class of strongly correlated

and space limitation. As a result, the concept of shared ESS enabling all users
charge/discharge to/from a common ESS has become appealing. In this paper, we
study the energy management problem of a group of users with renewable energy
sources and controllable (i.e., demand responsive) loads that all share a
common ESS so as to minimize their sum weighted energy cost. Specifically, we
propose a distributed algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which
iteratively derives the optimal values of charging/discharging to/from the
shared ESS, while only limited information is exchanged between users and a
central controller; hence, the privacy of users is preserved. With the optimal
charging and discharging values obtained, each user needs to independently
solve a simple linear programming (LP) problem to derive the optimal energy
consumption of its controllable loads over time as well as that of purchased
from the grid. Using simulations, we show that the shared ESS can achieve lower
energy cost compared to the case of distributed ESSs, where each user owns its
ESS and does not share it with others. Next, we propose online algorithms for
the real-time energy management, under non-zero prediction errors of load and
renewable energy. The proposed algorithms differ in complexity and the
information required to be shared between the users and central controller,

for some time and been the object of intense study. This includes the study of

be observed in stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication
(SLOCC). An important aspect of both of these areas is the computation of
complete sets of invariants polynomials. For local unitary equivalence as well
as $n$-qubit SLOCC invariants, complete descriptions of these invariants exist.
However, these descriptions give infinite sets; of great interest is finding
generating sets of invariants. In this regard, degree bounds are highly sought
after to limit the possible sizes of such generating sets. In this paper we
give new upper bounds on the degrees of the invariants, both for a certain

invariants of density operators in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, of dimension
$d$, which are generated by invariants of degree at most $d^4$. This in turn
allows us to show that the $n$-qubit SLOCC invariants are generated by

capillary forces originating from the extension of the liquid bridge turn out
to be more important at large separations. In addition, we are able to infer

thermodynamic equilibrium analysis leads to derive a column density equal to
(2.0$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ for HCNH$^+$ and
(1.5$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{11}$cm$^{-2}$ for HC$_3$NH$^+$. We also present
non-LTE analysis of five transitions of HC$_3$N, three transitions of
H$^{13}$CN and one transition of HN$^{13}$C, all of them linked to the

(3.6$\pm$0.9)$\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$, and
(3.0$\pm$1.0)$\times$10$^{14}$cm$^{-2}$, respectively. We used the gas-grain
chemical code Nautilus to predict the abundances all these species across the
pre-stellar core. Comparison of the observations with the model predictions
suggests that the emission from HCNH$^+$ and HC$_3$NH$^+$ originates in the
external layer where non-thermal desorption of other species was previously
observed. The observed abundance of both ionic species
([HCNH$^+$]$\,\simeq3\times10^{-10}$ and
[HC$_3$NH$^+$]$\,\simeq[1.5-3.0]\times10^{-12}$, with respect to H$_2$) cannot
be reproduced at the same time by the chemical modelling, within the error bars
of the observations only. We discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancy
and suggest that the current chemical models are not fully accurate or
complete. However, the modelled abundances are within a factor of three
consistent with the observations, considering a late stage of the evolution of
the pre-stellar core, compatible with previous observations.

single wavenumber scheme and the unsteady non-helical or helical Euler scheme.
The results are also compared with high resolution data obtained with the
negative viscosity scheme. A fine-grained characterization of anisotropy,
consisting in measuring some quantities related to the two-point velocity
correlations, is used: we perform a modal decomposition of the spectral
velocity tensor into energy, helicity and polarization spectra. Moreover, we
include the explicit dependence of these three spectra on the wavevector
direction. The conditions that allow anisotropy to develop in the small scales
due to forcing alone are clearly identified. It is shown that, in turbulent
flows expected to be isotropic, the ABC forcing yields significant energy and
helicity directional anisotropy down to the smallest resolved scales, like the
helical Euler scheme when an unfavourable forcing scale is used. The
direction-and scale-dependent anisotropy is then studied in rotating
turbulence. It is first shown that, in the ABC-forced simulations the slope of
the energy spectrum is altered and the level of anisotropy is similar to that
obtained at lower Rossby number in Euler-forced runs, a result due both to the
nature of the forcing itself and to the fact that it allows an inverse cascade
to develop. Second, we show that, even at low rotation rate, the natural
anisotropy induced by the Coriolis force is visible at all scales. Finally, we
identify two different wavenumber ranges in which anisotropy behaves
differently, and show that if the Rossby number is not too low the
characteristic lenghscale separating them is the one at which rotation and
dissipation effects balance.

observables are usually measured along dynamic trajectories and then averaged
over an ensemble (""bundle"") of trajectories. Under stationary conditions, the
time-evolution of such averages is described by the generalized Langevin
equation. In contrast, if the dynamics is not stationary, it is not a priori
clear which form the equation of motion for an averaged observable has. We
employ the formalism of time-dependent projection operator techniques to derive
the equation of motion for a non-equilibrium trajectory-averaged observable as
well as for its non-stationary auto-correlation function. The equation is
similar in structure to the generalized Langevin equation, but exhibits a
time-dependent memory kernel as well as a fluctuating force that implicitly
depends on the initial conditions of the process. We also derive a relation
between this memory kernel and the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating
force that has a structure similar to a fluctuation-dissipation relation. In
addition, we show how the choice of the projection operator allows to relate
the Taylor expansion of the memory kernel to data that is accessible in MD
simulations and experiments, thus allowing to construct the equation of motion.
As a numerical example, the procedure is applied to Brownian motion initialized

spectrum analysis alone will not provide a complete description of its
properties. Here, we consider an additional metric which could be derived from
tomographic imaging data, namely the bubble size distribution of ionized
regions. We study three methods that have previously been used to characterize
bubble size distributions in simulation data for the hydrogen ionization
fraction - the spherical-average, mean-free-path and friends-of-friends methods
- and apply them to simulated 21-cm data cubes. Our simulated data cubes have
the (sensitivity-dictated) resolution expected for the SKA1-Low reionization

distortion effects. To identify ionized regions in the 21-cm data we introduce
a new, self-adjusting thresholding approach based on the K-Means algorithm. We
find that the fraction of ionized cells identified in this way consistently
falls below the mean volume-averaged ionized fraction. From a comparison of the
three bubble size methods, we conclude that all three methods are useful, but
that the mean-free-path method performs best in terms of tracking the progress
of reionization and separating different reionization scenarios. The light-cone
effect is found to affect data spanning more than about 10~MHz in frequency

  studies","GlobalSIP 2017 (to appear)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solutions to network optimization problems have greatly benefited from
developments in nonlinear analysis, and, in particular, from developments in
convex optimization. A key concept that has made convex and nonconvex analysis
an important tool in science and engineering is the notion of asymptotic
function, which is often hidden in many influential studies on nonlinear
analysis and related fields. Therefore, we can also expect that asymptotic
functions are deeply connected to many results in the wireless domain, even
though they are rarely mentioned in the wireless literature. In this study, we
show connections of this type. By doing so, we explain many properties of
centralized and distributed solutions to wireless resource allocation problems
within a unified framework, and we also generalize and unify existing
approaches to feasibility analysis of network designs. In particular, we show
sufficient and necessary conditions for mappings widely used in wireless
communication problems (more precisely, the class of standard interference
mappings) to have a fixed point. Furthermore, we derive fundamental bounds on
the utility and the energy efficiency that can be achieved by solving a large
family of max-min utility optimization problems in wireless networks.

challenges for policymakers and important questions for researchers. To

instance, migrants have more diverse contacts and move around the city with a
larger radius than locals after they settle down. By distinguishing new
migrants (who recently moved to Shanghai) from settled migrants (who have been
in Shanghai for a while), we demonstrate the integration process of new
migrants in their first three weeks. Moreover, we formulate classification
problems to predict whether a person is a migrant. Our classifier is able to
achieve an F1-score of 0.82 when distinguishing settled migrants from locals,

reaction networks (CRNs) when they are built in natural ways from smaller
oscillatory networks. The main results describe four important ways in which a
CRN can be enlarged while preserving its capacity for oscillation. The results
are for general CRNs, not necessarily fully open, but lead to an important
corollary for fully open networks: if a fully open CRN R with mass action
kinetics admits a nondegenerate (resp., linearly stable) periodic orbit, then
so do all such CRNs which include R as an induced subnetwork. This claim holds
for other classes of kinetics, but fails, in general, for CRNs which are not
fully open. Where analogous results for multistationarity can be proved using
the implicit function theorem alone, the results here call on regular and
singular perturbation theory. Equipped with these results and with the help of
some analysis and numerical simulation, lower bounds are put on the proportion
of small fully open CRNs capable of stable oscillation under various
assumptions on the kinetics. This exploration suggests that small oscillatory
motifs are an important source of oscillation in CRNs.

weight sharing can be crucial, from an optimization point of view. We explore
different notions of the frequency, of the target function, proving necessity
of the target function having some low frequency components. This necessity is
not sufficient - only with weight sharing can it be exploited, thus
theoretically separating architectures using it, from others which do not. Our

interleaving those aspects in broader families of tasks.

Approaches that can rapidly target subpopulations for surveillance and control

By employing a spatially explicit meta-population epidemic model derived from

human mobility and interactions, and we analyse their relevance in identifying
the highest risk sub-population of individuals, as the best candidates for
isolation countermeasures. The approaches presented in this paper provide
further evidence that mobile phone data can be effectively exploited to
facilitate our understanding of individuals' spatial behaviour and its
relationship with the risk of infectious diseases' contagion. In particular, we
show that CDRs-based indicators of individuals' spatial activities and
interactions hold promise for gaining insight of contagion heterogeneity and
thus for developing containment strategies to support decision-making during

contour integration in the complex plane to obtain the eigenvectors of a matrix
for the eigenvalues that are located in any user-defined search interval. By
computing small numbers of eigenvalues in specific regions of the complex
plane, FEAST is able to naturally parallelize the solution of eigenvalue
problems by solving for multiple eigenpairs simultaneously. The traditional
FEAST algorithm is implemented by directly solving collections of shifted
linear systems of equations; in this paper, we describe a variation of the
FEAST algorithm that uses iterative Krylov subspace algorithms for solving the
shifted linear systems inexactly. We show that this iterative FEAST algorithm
(which we call IFEAST) is mathematically equivalent to a block Krylov subspace
method for solving eigenvalue problems. By using Krylov subspaces indirectly
through solving shifted linear systems, rather than directly for projecting the
eigenvalue problem, IFEAST is able to solve eigenvalue problems using very
large dimension Krylov subspaces, without ever having to store a basis for
those subspaces. IFEAST thus combines the flexibility and power of Krylov
methods, requiring only matrix-vector multiplication for solving eigenvalue
problems, with the natural parallelism of the traditional FEAST algorithm. We
discuss the relationship between IFEAST and more traditional Krylov methods,
and provide numerical examples illustrating its behavior.

problems associated with a discrete space-time model. One problem it solves is
maintaining isotropy in discrete space. The second problem it solves is the
commonly perceived incompatibility of the model's concept of an immutable

relativity. With the new distance formula, it is shown that the Lorentz
contraction of the atom of space does not occur regardless of the relative

microscopy and spectroscopy. The deposition of several monolayers of Pt on
Ge(110) followed by annealing at 1100 K results in the formation of
three-dimensional metallic Pt-Ge nanocrystals. The outermost layer of these
crystals exhibits a honeycomb structure. The honeycomb structure is composed of
two hexagonal sub-lattices that are displaced vertically by 0.2 {\AA} with
respect to each other. The nearest-neighbor distance of the atoms in the
honeycomb lattice is 2.5${\pm}$0.1 {\AA}, i.e. very close to the predicted
nearest-neighbor distance in germanene (2.4 {\AA}). Scanning tunneling
spectroscopy reveals that the atomic layer underneath the honeycomb layer is
more metallic than the honeycomb layer itself. These observations are in line
with a model recently proposed for metal di-(silicides/)germanides: a hexagonal
crystal with metal layers separated by semiconductor layers with a honeycomb
lattice. Based on our observations we propose that the outermost layer of the
Ge2Pt nanocrystal is a germanene layer.

real numbers share the same tail in their continued fraction expansions iff
they belong to the same orbit under the projective action of PGL(2,Z). This
result was first formulated in Serret's Cours d'alg\`ebre sup\'erieure, so
we'll refer to it as to the Serret theorem.
  Notwithstanding the abundance of continued fraction algorithms in the
literature, a uniform treatment of the Serret result seems missing. In this
paper we show that there are finitely many possibilities for the subgroups
Sigma of PGL(2,Z) generated by the branches of the Gauss maps in a large family
of algorithms, and that each Sigma-equivalence class of reals is partitioned in
finitely many tail-equivalence classes, whose number we bound. Our approach is
through the finite-state transducers that relate Gauss maps to each other. They
constitute opfibrations of the Schreier graphs of the groups, and their
synchronizability ---which may or may not hold--- assures the a.e. validity of
the Serret theorem.

increasing interest. While fully supervised systems have gained much attention
lately, full annotation of each action within the video is costly and
impractical for large amounts of video data. Thus, weakly supervised action
detection and temporal segmentation methods are of great importance. While most
works in this area assume an ordered sequence of occurring actions to be given,
our approach only uses a set of actions. Such action sets provide much less
supervision since neither action ordering nor the number of action occurrences
are known. In exchange, they can be easily obtained, for instance, from
meta-tags, while ordered sequences still require human annotation. We introduce
a system that automatically learns to temporally segment and label actions in a
video, where the only supervision that is used are action sets. An evaluation
on three datasets shows that our method still achieves good results although
the amount of supervision is significantly smaller than for other related
methods.

preventable, but the key to prevention is to identify at-risk individuals
before adverse events. For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media
thickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable,
offering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However,
each CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each
of these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic
ultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI)
in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the
media-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT. These operations are
tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the
widespread utilization of CIMT in clinical practice. To overcome this
limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate CIMT video
interpretation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The superior
performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) coupled with our informative image representation and
effective post-processing of the CNN outputs, which are uniquely designed for
each of the above three operations.

the reliability of a power network by ensuring that a single failure does not

formulating the problem in different modalities, e.g. preventive or corrective,

important direction, and analyze the economic cost of incorporating security
constraints in economic dispatch. Inspired by existing inefficiency metrics in
game theory and computer science, we introduce notion of price of security as a
metric that formally characterizes the economic inefficiency of
security-constrained economic dispatch as compared to the original problem
without security constraints. Then, we focus on the preventive approach in a
simple topology comprising two buses and two lines, and investigate the impact
of generation availability and demand distribution on the price of security.
Moreover, we explicitly derive the worst-case input instance that leads to the
maximum price of security. By extensive experimental study on two test-cases,

identifies the conditions that must be met if such a self-organizing society is
to emerge. It demonstrates that the key enabling requirement for a
self-organizing society is consequence-capture. Broadly this means that all
agents in the society must capture sufficient of the benefits (and harms) that
are produced by their actions on the goals of the society. Consequence-capture
can be organized in a society by appropriate management (systems of evolvable
constraints) that suppresses free riders and supports pro-social actions. In
human societies these constraints include institutions such as systems of
governance and social norms. The paper identifies ways of organizing societies
so that effective governance will also self-organize. This will produce a fully
self-organizing society in which the interests of all agents (including
individuals, associations, firms, multi-national corporations, political
organizations, institutions and governments) are aligned with the interests of
the society as a whole.

that classical hydrodynamic theory predicts the transverse dynamics at relative

viscosity, and here we find that the transverse dynamics are independent of the
dissipative and random shear force contributions to the stress. For high
temperatures, the spectrum for the longitudinal dynamics is dominated by the
Brillouin peak for large length scales and the relaxation is therefore governed
by sound wave propagation and is athermal. This contrasts the results at lower
temperatures and small length scale, where the thermal process is clearly
present in the spectra. The Landau-Placzek ratio is lower than the classical

transport phenomena for over a century. The foundation of Brownian motion, laid
by Einstein, has generally been accepted to be far from being complete since
the late 1960s, because it fails to take important hydrodynamic effects into
account. The hydrodynamic effects yield a time dependence of the diffusion
coefficient, and this extends the ordinary hydrodynamics. However, the time
profile of the diffusion coefficient across the kinetic and hydrodynamic
regions is still absent, which prohibits a complete description of Brownian
motion in the entire course of time. Here we close this gap. We manage to
separate the diffusion process into two parts: a kinetic process governed by
the kinetics based on molecular chaos approximation and a hydrodynamics process
described by linear hydrodynamics. We find the analytical solution of vortex
backflow of hydrodynamic modes triggered by a tagged particle. Coupling it to
the kinetic process we obtain explicit expressions of the velocity
autocorrelation function and the time profile of diffusion coefficient. This
leads to an accurate account of both kinetic and hydrodynamic effects. Our
theory is applicable for fluid and Brownian particles, even of irregular-shaped
objects, in very general environments ranging from dilute gases to dense
liquids. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical
experiments.

learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization
techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its
accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of
first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not
exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data
distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed
in Gregor and Le Cun (2010), which showed empirically that one could achieve
high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the
proximal splitting appropriately.
  In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical
analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the
Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel
with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this
factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys
an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version.
Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly
at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical
experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries
where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.

functions in the ground state of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model

numerically exact at half filling where the fermion sign problem is absent.
Away from half-filling, we employ the constrained path AFQMC approach to
eliminate the exponential computational scaling from the sign problem. The
constraint employs unrestricted Hartree-Fock trial wave-functions with an
effective interaction strength U , which is optimized self-consistently within
AFQMC. Large supercells are studied, with twist averaged boundary conditions as
needed, to reach the thermodynamic limit. We find that the nearest-neighbor
spin correlation always increases with the interaction strength U , contrary to
the finite-temperature behavior where a maximum is reached at a finite U value.
We also observe a change of sign in the next nearest neighbor spin correlation
with increasing density, which is a consequence of the buildup of the
long-range anti-ferromagnetic correlation. We expect the results presented in
this work to serve as a benchmark as lower temperatures are reached in
ultracold atom experiments.

Ginzburg-Landau theory. The Ginzburg-Landau functional has two terms: the
Dirichlet energy of the distribution and a term penalizing the mismatch between
the fixed and actual norm of the distribution. Directional fields on surfaces
are known to have a number of critical points, which are properly identified
with the Ginzburg-Landau approach: the asymptotic behavior of Ginzburg-Landau
problem provides well-distributed critical points over the 2-manifold, whose
indices are as low as possible. The central idea in this paper is to exploit
this theoretical background for crossfield computation on arbitrary surfaces.
Such crossfields are instrumental in the generation of meshes with quadrangular
elements. The relation between the topological properties of quadrangular
meshes and crossfields are hence first recalled. It is then shown that a
crossfield on a surface can be represented by a complex function of unit norm
with a number of critical points, i.e., a nearly everywhere smooth function
taking its values in the unit circle of the complex plane. As maximal
smoothness of the crossfield is equivalent with minimal energy, the crossfield
problem is equivalent to an optimization problem based on Ginzburg-Landau
functional. A discretization scheme with Crouzeix-Raviart elements is applied
and the correctness of the resulting finite element formulation is validated on
the unit disk by comparison with an analytical solution. The method is also
applied to the 2-sphere where, surprisingly but rightly, the computed critical
points are not located at the vertices of a cube, but at those of an anticube.

Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, by an observer who is also freely and radially
falling into this black hole. Considered and resolved are several common
paradoxes and fallacies peculiar for such problems. The results of this
analytical study are written as a numerical code that allows for calculating
all related effects of this model. The numerical result have been presented in
a few synthesized videos, making a colorful, quantitative and detailed
description of the occurring astrophysical phenomena, both above and below the
horizon.

associated with Cantor's pairing function and the Rosenberg-Strong pairing
function, including their inverses, their generalizations to higher dimensions,
and a discussion of a few of the advantages of the Rosenberg-Strong pairing
function over Cantor's pairing function in practical applications. In
particular, an application to the problem of enumerating full binary trees is
discussed.

  Video via Visual Vocabulary Model and Species Inspired PSO",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in
video images using Visual Vocabulary model and Bag of Words and track our
object of interest in the subsequent video frames using species inspired PSO.
Initially, the shadow free images are obtained by background modelling followed
by foreground modeling to extract the blobs of our object of interest.
Subsequently, we train a cubic SVM with human body datasets in accordance with
our domain of interest for recognition and tracking. During training, using the
principle of Bag of Words we extract necessary features of certain domains and
objects for classification. Subsequently, matching these feature sets with
those of the extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow
free background from the foreground, we detect successfully our object of
interest from the test domain. The performance of the classification by cubic
SVM is satisfactorily represented by confusion matrix and ROC curve reflecting
the accuracy of each module. After classification, our object of interest is
tracked in the test domain using species inspired PSO. By combining the
adaptive learning tools with the efficient classification of description, we
achieve optimum accuracy in recognition of the moving objects. We evaluate our
algorithm benchmark datasets: iLIDS, VIVID, Walking2, Woman. Comparative
analysis of our algorithm against the existing state-of-the-art trackers shows
very satisfactory and competitive results.

  and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), Valencia, 2016, pp. 1-6","10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794935",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self Organizing Networks (SONs) are considered as vital deployments towards
upcoming dense cellular networks. From a mobile carrier point of view,
continuous coverage optimization is critical for better user perceptions. The
majority of SON contributions introduce novel algorithms that optimize specific
performance metrics. However, they require extensive processing delays and
advanced knowledge of network statistics that may not be available. In this
work, a progressive Autonomous Coverage Optimization (ACO) method combined with
adaptive cell dimensioning is proposed. The proposed method emphasizes the fact
that the effective cell coverage is a variant on actual user distributions. ACO
algorithm builds a generic Space-Time virtual coverage map per cell to detect
coverage holes in addition to limited or extended coverage conditions.
Progressive levels of optimization are followed to timely resolve coverage
issues with maintaining optimization stability. Proposed ACO is verified under
both simulations and practical deployment in a pilot cluster for a worldwide
mobile carrier. Key Performance Indicators show that proposed ACO method
significantly enhances system coverage and performance.
