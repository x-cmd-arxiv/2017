and fixed time in the Universe. This assumption is best embodied by general

imply the lack of evolution but rather brings to the forefront the role of
internal clocks which are some largely arbitrary internal degrees of freedom
with respect to which the evolution of timeless systems can be described. We
take this idea seriously and try to understand what it implies for quantum
mechanics when the fixed external time is replaced by an arbitrary internal
clock. We put the issue in a solid, mathematically rigorous framework. We find
that the dynamical interpretation of a quantum state of a timeless system
depends on the employed internal clock. In particular, we find that the
continuous spectra of well-known dynamical observables like the position of a
free particle on the real line may turn discrete if measured in unusual clocks.
We discuss the meaning of our result for attempts at quantization of global
gravitational degrees of freedom.

Correlation between apparent revolution directions proves partial orbit

outer projected separation less than ~50 AU, where the average \Phi is about 20
degrees. In contrast, outer orbits wider than 1000 AU are not aligned with the
inner orbits. It is established that the orbit alignment decreases with
increasing mass of the primary component. Average eccentricity of inner orbits
in well-aligned triples is smaller than in randomly aligned ones. These
findings highlight the role of dissipative interactions with gas in defining
the orbital architecture of low-mass triple systems. On the other hand, chaotic

background of $(D+1)$-dimensional dS spacetime assuming that the field is
prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The correlators are presented in the
decomposed form where the string-induced topological parts are explicitly
extracted. With this decomposition, the renormalization of the local vacuum
expectation values (VEVs) in the coincidence limit is reduced to the one for dS
spacetime in the absence of the cosmic string. The VEVs of the squared electric
and magnetic fields, and of the vacuum energy density are investigated. Near
the string they are dominated by the topological contributions and the effects
induced by the background gravitational field are small. In this region, the
leading terms in the topological contributions are obtained from the
corresponding VEVs for a string on the Minkowski bulk multiplying by the
conformal factor. At distances from the string larger than the curvature radius
of the background geometry, the pure dS parts in the VEVs dominate. In this
region, for spatial dimensions $D>3$, the influence of the gravitational field
on the topological contributions is crucial and the corresponding behavior is
essentially different from that for a cosmic string on the Minkowski bulk.
There are well-motivated inflationary models which produce cosmic strings. We
argue that, as a consequence of the quantum-to-classical transition of
super-Hubble electromagnetic fluctuations during inflation, in the
postinflationary era these strings will be surrounded by large scale stochastic
magnetic fields. These fields could be among the distinctive features of the
cosmic strings produced during the inflation and also of the corresponding

techniques from the analysis of Boolean functions. We focus on the
high-dimensional regime where the canonical example is training a neural
network with a large number of hyperparameters. The algorithm --- an iterative
application of compressed sensing techniques for orthogonal polynomials ---
requires only uniform sampling of the hyperparameters and is thus easily
parallelizable.
  Experiments for training deep neural networks on Cifar-10 show that compared
to state-of-the-art tools (e.g., Hyperband and Spearmint), our algorithm finds
significantly improved solutions, in some cases better than what is attainable
by hand-tuning. In terms of overall running time (i.e., time required to sample
various settings of hyperparameters plus additional computation time), we are
at least an order of magnitude faster than Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization.
We also outperform Random Search 8x.
  Additionally, our method comes with provable guarantees and yields the first
improvements on the sample complexity of learning decision trees in over two
decades. In particular, we obtain the first quasi-polynomial time algorithm for
learning noisy decision trees with polynomial sample complexity.

share the collected information with all other robots and possibly also with a

capabilities are not sufficient to form reliable and connected networks while
the robots move to accomplish their tasks. In this case, intermittent
communication protocols are necessary that allow the robots to temporarily
disconnect from the network in order to accomplish their tasks free of
communication constraints. We assume that the robots can only communicate with
each other when they meet at common locations in space. Our distributed control
framework jointly determines local plans that allow all robots fulfill their
assigned temporal tasks, sequences of communication events that guarantee
information exchange infinitely often, and optimal communication locations that
minimize a desired distance metric. Simulation results verify the efficacy of
the proposed controllers.

bars and both could be linked through the buckling instability. The Milky Way
is our closest example. The goal of this letter is determining if the mass
assembly of the different components leaves an imprint in their stellar
populations allowing to estimate the time of bar formation and its evolution.
To this aim we use integral field spectroscopy to derive the stellar age
distributions, SADs, along the bar and disc of NGC 6032. The analysis shows
clearly different SADs for the different bar areas. There is an underlying old
(>=12 Gyr) stellar population for the whole galaxy. The bulge shows star
formation happening at all times. The inner bar structure shows stars of ages
older than 6 Gyrs with a deficit of younger populations. The outer bar region
presents a SAD similar to that of the disc. To interpret our results, we use a
generic numerical simulation of a barred galaxy. Thus, we constrain, for the
first time, the epoch of bar formation, the buckling instability period and the
posterior growth from disc material. We establish that the bar of NGC 6032 is
old, formed around 10 Gyr ago while the buckling phase possibly happened around
8 Gyr ago. All these results point towards bars being long-lasting even in the

energy or computing time. There is a large and rapidly growing literature on
approximate computing that has focused mostly on showing the benefits of
approximation. However, we know relatively little about how to control
approximation in a disciplined way.
  This document briefly describes our published work of controlling
approximation for non-streaming programs that have a set of ""knobs"" that can be
dialed up or down to control the level of approximation of different components
in the program. The proposed system, Capri, solves this control problem as a
constrained optimization problem. Capri uses machine learning to learn cost and
error models for the program, and uses these models to determine, for a desired
level of approximation, knob settings that optimize metrics such as running
time or energy usage. Experimental results with complex benchmarks from
different problem domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
  This report outlines improvements and extensions to the existing Capri system
to address its limitations, including a complete rewrite of the software, and
discusses directions for follow up work. The document also includes
instructions and guidelines for using the new Capri infrastructure.

wave propagation. During the vigorous expansion of the abnormal granule we
detect radially outward horizontal flows, causing, together with the horizontal
flows from the surrounding granules, the magnetic elements in the bordering
intergranular lanes to be squeezed and elongated. In reaction to the squeezing,
we detect a chromospheric intensity and velocity oscillation pulse which we
identify as an upward traveling hot shock front propagating clearly through the

indicating that the BC3-based sensor has a low and moderate sensitivity to CO

significant charge is transferred from the molecules to the BC3 sheet, causing
a semiconductor-metal transition. It is found that the BC3-based sensor has
high potential for NO detection due to the significant conductance changes,
moderate adsorption energy, and short recovery time. More excitingly, the BC3
is a likely catalyst for dissociation of the NO2 gas molecule. Our findings

EG predicts the maximum velocities of these systems somewhat well for galaxies

maximum velocities for dwarf galaxies with measured velocities greater than
this value and overpredicts for those with measured velocities less than this

definitive test of EG.

observed with recurrence times as short as minutes. We present the first
one-dimensional multi-zone simulations that reproduce this phenomenon. Bursts
that ignite in a relatively hot neutron star envelope leave a substantial
fraction of the fuel unburned at shallow depths. In the wake of the burst,
convective mixing events driven by opacity bring this fuel down to the ignition
depth on the observed timescale of minutes. There, unburned hydrogen mixes with
the metal-rich ashes, igniting to produce a subsequent burst. We find burst
pairs and triplets, similar to the observed instances. Our simulations
reproduce the observed fraction of bursts with short waiting times of ~30%, and
demonstrate that short recurrence time bursts are typically less bright and of

fundamental aspects of many-body dynamics. A particular example is many-body
localization in a cold-atom setting, where incoherent photon scattering
introduces both dephasing and particle loss. Whereas dephasing has been studied
in detail and is known to destroy localization already on the level of
non-interacting particles, the effect of particle loss is less well understood.
A difficulty arises due to the `non-local' nature of the loss process,
complicating standard numerical tools using matrix product decomposition.
Utilizing symmetries of the Lindbladian dynamics, we investigate the particle
loss on both the dynamics of observables, as well as the structure of the
density matrix and the individual states. We find that particle loss in the
presence of interactions leads to dissipation and a strong suppression of the
(operator space) entanglement entropy. Our approach allows for the study of the
interplay of dephasing and loss for pure and mixed initial states to long
times, which is important for future experiments using controlled coupling of

  Society of Sciences",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies constitute a class of active galactic
nuclei characterized by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$
broad emission line < 2000 km/s and the flux ratio of [O III] to H$\beta$ < 3.
Their properties are not well understood since only a few NLSy1 galaxies were
known earlier. We have studied various properties of NLSy1 galaxies using an
enlarged sample and compared them with the conventional broad-line Seyfert 1
(BLSy1) galaxies. Both the sample of sources have z $\le$ 0.8 and their optical
spectra from SDSS-DR12 that are used to derive various physical parameters have
a median signal to noise (S/N) ratio >10 per pixel. Strong correlations between
the H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines are found both in the FWHM and flux.
The nuclear continuum luminosity is found to be strongly correlated with the
luminosity of H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and [O III] emission lines. The black hole
mass in NLSy1 galaxies is lower compared to their broad line counterparts.
Compared to BLSy1 galaxies, NLSy1 galaxies have a stronger FeII emission and a
higher Eddington ratio that place them in the extreme upper right corner of the
$R_{4570}$ - $\xi_{Edd}$ diagram. The distribution of the radio-loudness
parameter (R) in NLSy1 galaxies drops rapidly at R > 10 compared to the BLSy1
galaxies that have powerful radio jets. The soft X-ray photon index in NLSy1
galaxies is on average higher (2.9 $\pm$ 0.9) than BLSy1 galaxies (2.4 $\pm$
0.8). It is anti-correlated with the H$\beta$ width but correlated with the Fe
II strength. NLSy1 galaxies on average have a lower amplitude of optical
variability compared to their broad lines counterparts. These results suggest
Eddington ratio as the main parameter that drives optical variability in these
sources.

relationship between the number of spanning trees and the partition function of

$T(z)$ gives the spanning tree constant when evaluated at $z=1$, while giving
he lattice green function when differentiated. It is known that for the
infinite square lattice the partition function $Z(K)$ of the Ising model
evaluated at the critical temperature $K=K_c$ is related to $T(1)$. Here we
show that this idea in fact generalizes to all real temperatures. We prove that
$ ( Z(K) {\rm sech~} 2K ~\!)^2 = k \exp\big[ T(k) \big] $, where $k= 2
\tanh(2K) {\rm sech}(2K)$. The identical Mahler measure connects the two

  age-dependent compulsorily notification databases","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: National or local laws, norms or regulations (sometimes and in
some countries) require medical providers to report notifiable diseases to
public health authorities. Reporting, however, is almost always incomplete.
This is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from not recognizing the diseased
to failures in the technical or administrative steps leading to the final
official register in the disease notification system. The reported fraction
varies from 9% to 99% and is strongly associated with the disease being
reported.
  Methods: In this paper we propose a method to approximately estimate the full
prevalence (and any other variable or parameter related to transmission
intensity) of infectious diseases. The model assumes incomplete notification of
incidence and allows the estimation of the non-notified number of infections
and it is illustrated by the case of hepatitis C in Brazil. The method has the
advantage that it can be corrected iteratively by comparing its findings with
empirical results.
  Results: The application of the model for the case of hepatitis C in Brazil
resulted in a prevalence of notified cases that varied between 163,902 and
169,382 cases; a prevalence of non-notified cases that varied between 1,433,638
and 1,446,771; and a total prevalence of infections that varied between
1,597,540 and 1,616,153 cases.
  Conclusions: We conclude that that the model proposed can be useful for
estimation of the actual magnitude of endemic states of infectious diseases,
particularly for those where the number of notified cases is only the tip of
the iceberg. In addition, the method can be applied to other situations, such
as the well known underreported incidence of criminality (for example rape),
among others.

be applied successfully. In this report, we present and implement a
watershed-based image analysis and classification algorithm in a GUI, enabling
a broad set of users to easily understand the algorithm and adjust the
parameters to their specific needs. As an example, we implement this algorithm
to find and classify cells in a complex imaging assay for mitochondrial
function. In a second example, we demonstrate a workflow using manual
comparisons and receiver operator characteristics to optimize the algorithm
parameters for finding live and dead cells in a standard viability assay.
Overall, this watershed-based algorithm is more advanced than traditional
thresholding and can produce optimized, automated results. By incorporating
associated pre-processing steps in the GUI, the algorithm is also easily
adjusted, rendering it user-friendly.

observations form a first-order autoregressive (AR) process driven by
temporally independent standard Gaussian noise. Subject to possible change are
both the drift of the AR(1) process ($\mu$) as well as its correlation
coefficient ($\lambda$), both known. The change is abrupt and persistent, and
is of known magnitude, with $\vert\lambda\vert<1$ throughout. For this
scenario, we carry out a comparative performance analysis of the popular
Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart and its less well-known but worthy competitor --
the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure. Specifically, the performance is measured
through Pollak's Supremum (conditional) Average Delay to Detection (SADD)
constrained to a pre-specified level of the Average Run Length (ARL) to false
alarm. Particular attention is drawn to the sensitivity of each procedure's
SADD and ARL with respect to the value of $\lambda$ before and after the
change. The performance is studied through the solution of the respective
integral renewal equations obtained via Monte Carlo simulations. The
simulations are designed to estimate the sought performance metrics in an
unbiased and asymptotically strongly consistent manner, and to within a
prescribed proportional closeness (also asymptotically). Our extensive
numerical studies suggest that both the CUSUM chart and the SR procedure are
asymptotically second-order optimal, even though the CUSUM chart is found to be
slightly better than the SR procedure, irrespective of the model parameters.
Moreover, the existence of a worst-case post-change correlation parameter
corresponding to the poorest detectability of the change for a given ARL to
false alarm is established as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time the performance of the SR procedure is studied for autocorrelated
data.

significantly narrows the parameter space compared to our priors, showing that
although the model is flexible, the parameter space relevant to SLSNe is well
constrained by existing data. The requirement that the instantaneous engine
power is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg at the light curve peak necessitates either a large
rotational energy (P<2 ms), or more commonly that the spin-down and diffusion
timescales be well-matched. We find no evidence for separate populations of
fast- and slow-declining SLSNe, which instead form a continuum both in light
curve widths and inferred parameters. Variations in the spectra are well
explained through differences in spin-down power and photospheric radii at
maximum-light. We find no correlations between any model parameters and the
properties of SLSN host galaxies. Comparing our posteriors to stellar evolution
models, we show that SLSNe require rapidly rotating (fastest 10%) massive stars
(> 20 Msun), and that this is consistent with the observed SLSN rate. High
mass, low metallicity, and likely binary interaction all serve to maintain
rapid rotation essential for magnetar formation. By reproducing the full set of
SLSN light curves, our posteriors can be used to inform photometric searches
for SLSNe in future survey data.

particular version of Mindlin's anisotropic gradient elasticity with up to six
length scale parameters. The theory is systematically developed as a
generalization of the classical anisotropic theory in the framework of
linearized incompatible elasticity. The non-singular version of all key
equations of anisotropic dislocation theory are derived as line integrals,
including the Burgers displacement equation with isolated solid angle, the
Peach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the elastic
distortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction
energy between two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained
directly, without the use of a stress function. It is shown that all the
elastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their classical
counterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core. In
practice, the non-singular fields can be obtained from the classical ones by
replacing the classical (singular) anisotropic Green's tensor with the
non-singular anisotropic Green's tensor derived by \cite{Lazar:2015ja}. The
elastic solution is valid for arbitrary anisotropic media. In addition to the
classical anisotropic elastic constants, the non-singular Green's tensor
depends on a second order symmetric tensor of length scale parameters modeling
a weak non-locality, whose structure depends on the specific class of crystal
symmetry. The anisotropic Helmholtz operator defined by such tensor admits a
Green's function which is used as the spreading function for the Burgers vector
density. As a consequence, the Burgers vector density spreads differently in
different crystal structures.

either faster-than-ballistic, for gapless systems, or ballistic, for gapped

higher, there exist solvable large $N$ limits dominated by the melonic
diagrams. Simple examples are provided by models containing one rank-$3$ tensor
in the tri-fundamental representation of the $O(N)^3$ symmetry group. When the
quartic interaction is assumed to have a special tetrahedral index structure,
the coupling constant $g$ must be scaled as $N^{-3/2}$ in the melonic large $N$
limit. In this paper we consider the combinatorics of a large $N$ theory of one
fully symmetric and traceless rank-$3$ tensor with the tetrahedral quartic
interaction; this model has a single $O(N)$ symmetry group. We explicitly
calculate all the vacuum diagrams up to order $g^8$, as well as some diagrams
of higher order, and find that in the large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held
fixed only the melonic diagrams survive. While some non-melonic diagrams are
enhanced in the $O(N)$ symmetric theory compared to the $O(N)^3$ one, we have
not found any diagrams where this enhancement is strong enough to make them
comparable with the melonic ones. Motivated by these results, we conjecture
that the model of a real rank-$3$ symmetric traceless tensor possesses a smooth
large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed and all the contributing diagrams
are melonic. A feature of the symmetric traceless tensor models is that some
vacuum diagrams containing odd numbers of vertices are suppressed only by

of novel optoelectronic devices, since many of their properties, such as the

achieved via the organic ligand shell, through control of the size of the
nanocrystal and the distance to other objects. We here simulate ligand-coated
CdSe nanocrystals using atomistic molecular dynamics, allowing for the
resolution of novel structural details about the ligand shell. We show that the
ligands on the surface can lie flat to form a highly anisotropic 'wet hair'
layer as opposed to the 'spiky ball' appearance typically considered. We
discuss how this can give rise to a dot-to-dot packing distance of one ligand
length since the thickness of the ligand shell is reduced to approximately
one-half of the ligand length for the system sizes considered here; these
distances imply that energy and charge transfer rates between dots and nearby
objects will be enhanced due to the thinner than expected ligand shell. Our
model predicts a non-linear scaling of ligand shell thickness as the ligands
transition from 'spiky' to 'wet hair'. We verify this scaling using TEM on a
PbS nanoarray, confirming that this theory gives a qualitatively correct
picture of the ligand shell thickness of colloidal quantum dots.

to Li disorder. In the metallic and superconducting phase, Li$_x$HfNCl is a

electron-phonon coupling and results in a strong increase of the
superconducting critical temperature for $x<0.15$. On the contrary, for
$x>0.15$, $T_c$ is approximately constant, in agreement with experiments. At

Traditionally, in panel data analysis, all individuals are assumed to share the
same unknown parameters, e.g. the same coefficients of covariates when the
linear models are used, and the differences between the individuals are
accounted for by cluster effects. This kind of modelling only makes sense if
our main interest is on the global trend, this is because it would not be able
to tell us anything about the individual attributes which are sometimes very
important. In this paper, we proposed a modelling based on the single index
models embedded with homogeneity for panel data analysis, which builds the
individual attributes in the model and is parsimonious at the same time. We
develop a data driven approach to identify the structure of homogeneity, and
estimate the unknown parameters and functions based on the identified
structure. Asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established.
Intensive simulation studies conducted in this paper also show the resulting
estimators work very well when sample size is finite. Finally, the proposed
modelling is applied to a public financial dataset and a UK climate dataset,

the simple-shift bias-reduction, have been proposed to upgrade the coverage of
the confidence intervals, but these methods usually fail to adequately improve

paper, we develop a novel approach to improving the confidence intervals by
using a smaller smoothing strength than that of the spline fits. With a
carefully selected amount of reduction in smoothing strength, the confidence

potentially mimic the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (EoR),
as both of them might have fluctuating spectral structure. Although we are
sensitive to the EoR signal only in small fields of view, chromatic sidelobes

effects of leakage into the 'EoR window' of the cylindrically averaged power
spectra (PS) within wide fields of view using both observation and simulation
of the 3C196 and NCP fields, two observing fields of the LOFAR-EoR project. We
present the polarization PS of two one-night observations of the two fields and
find that the NCP field has higher fluctuations along frequency, and
consequently exhibits more power at high-$k_\parallel$ that could potentially
leak to Stokes $I$. Subsequently, we simulate LOFAR observations of Galactic
diffuse polarized emission based on a model to assess what fraction of
polarized power leaks into Stokes $I$ because of the primary beam. We find that
the rms fractional leakage over the instrumental $k$-space is $0.35\%$ in the
3C196 field and $0.27\%$ in the NCP field, and it does not change significantly
within the diameters of $15^\circ$, $9^\circ$ and $4^\circ$. Based on the
observed PS and simulated fractional leakage, we show that a similar level of
leakage into Stokes $I$ is expected in the 3C196 and NCP fields, and the
leakage can be considered to be a bias in the PS.

  Results: We developed a semi--supervised network reconstruction algorithm
that enables the synthesis of information from partially known networks with
time course gene expression data. We adapted PLS-VIP for time course data and
used reference networks to simulate expression data from which null
distributions of VIP scores are generated and used to estimate edge
probabilities for input expression data. By using simulated dynamics to
generate reference distributions, this approach incorporates previously known
regulatory relationships and links the network to the dynamics to form a
semi-supervised approach that discovers novel and anomalous connections. We
applied this approach to data from a sleep deprivation study with KEGG pathways
treated as prior networks, as well as to synthetic data from several DREAM
challenges, and find that it is able to recover many of the true edges and
identify errors in these networks, suggesting its ability to derive posterior
networks that accurately reflect gene expression dynamics.

spectral properties with decreasing metallicity, with systems below

simulations, stochastic kriging \citep{ankenman} is commonly used to generate

these questions for the peculiar, bright GRB 110731A. By using the pair-opacity

Alternatively, we derive $\Gamma_{0} \approx 580$ and $\Gamma_{0} \approx 154$
by invoking the early-afterglow phase within the homogeneous density and wind
cases, respectively. On the other hand, nondetection of a thermal component in
the spectra suggests that the prompt emission is likely powered by dissipation
of a Poynting-flux-dominated jet leading to synchrotron radiation in an
optically thin region. The nondetection of a jet break in the X-ray and optical
bands allows us to place a lower limit on the jet opening angle $\theta_{\rm
j}>5.5^{\circ}$. Within a millisecond magnetar central engine scenario, we
derive the period $P_{0}$ and polar magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}$, which
have extreme (but still allowed) values. The moderately short observed duration
(7.3\,s) and relatively large redshift ($z=2.83$) places the burst as a
""rest-frame short"" GRB, so the progenitor of the burst is subject to debate.
Its relatively large $f_{{\rm eff}, z}$ parameter (ratio of the 1\,s peak flux

relaxation behavior: the decay time constant increases as time increases,
revealing a spectral distribution of time constants. The asymptotic value of
such transients is notoriously difficult to experimentally measure due to the
increasing decay time-scale. However, if the heavy-tail transient is plotted
versus log-time, a reduced set of data around the inflection point of such a
plot is sufficient for an accurate fit. From a derivative plot in log-time, the
peak height, position, line width, and, most importantly, skewness are all that
is needed to accurately predict the asymptotic value of various heavy-tail
decay models to within less than a percent. This curve fitting strategy reduces
by orders of magnitude the amount of experimental data required, and clearly
identifies a threshold below which the amount of data is insufficient to
distinguish various models. The skew normal spectral fit and dispersive
diffusion transient fit are proposed as four-parameter fits, with the latter
including the stretched exponential as a limiting case. The line fit and
asymptotic prediction are demonstrated using experimental transient responses

opposing affinities does not cancel the interactions altogether. Instead we can
observe both attractive and repulsive interactions depending on their relative
orientations. With increasing number of domains per inclusion, the range and
magnitude of the effective interactions decrease in a similar fashion to those
of electrostatic multipoles. Finally, clusters formed by multiple-domain
inclusions can result in an effective affinity patterning due to the
anisotropic character of the Casimir interactions between the building blocks.

stochastic interacting particle systems (SIPS)) have been intensively studied
since McKean \cite{mckean1966class}. The interacting diffusions pave a way to
probabilistic representations for many important nonlinear/nonlocal PDEs, but
provide a great challenge for Monte Carlo simulations. This is due to the
nonlinear dependence of the bias on the statistical error arising through the
approximation of the law of the process. This and the fact that
particles/diffusions are not independent render classical variance reduction
techniques not directly applicable and consequently make simulations of
interacting diffusions prohibitive. In this article, we provide an alternative
iterative particle representation, inspired by the fixed point argument by
Sznitman \cite{sznitman1991topics}. This new representation has the same mean
field limit as the classical SIPS. However, unlike classical SIPS, it also
allows decomposing the statistical error and the approximation bias. We develop
a general framework to study integrability and regularity properties of the
iterated particle system. Moreover, we establish its weak convergence to the
McKean-Vlasov SDEs (MVSDEs). One of the immediate advantages of iterative
particle system is that it can be combined with the Multilevel Monte Carlo
(MLMC) approach for the simulation of MVSDEs. We proved that the MLMC approach
reduces the computational complexity of calculating expectations by an order of
magnitude. Another perspective on this work is that we analyse the error of
nested Multilevel Monte Carlo estimators, which is of independent interest.
Furthermore, we work with state dependent functionals, unlike scalar outputs
which are common in literature on MLMC. The error analysis is carried out in
uniform, and what seems to be new, weighted norms.

and at different concentrations is investigated. Density functional theory is
used to maximize the reduction of the work function. In general, the work
function drops significantly before reaching saturation. For example in the
case of Cs doping, the work function saturates at 2.05 eV with a modest 8 %
doping. The adsorption of different concentrations on metal adatoms on graphene
is also studied. Our calculations show that the adatoms prefer to relax at
hollow sites. The transfer of electron from metallic dopants to the graphene
for all the studied systems shifts the Fermi energy levels above the
Dirac-point and the doped graphenes become metallic. The value of Fermi energy
shifts depends on the type of metallic dopants and its concentrations. A detail
analysis of the electronic structure in terms of band structure and density of
states, absorption energy, and charge transfer for each adatom-graphene system
is presented.

comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study
the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority

compared to OBIA-based methods, the proposed CNN-based detection model, in

achieves higher performance with less human intervention and the knowledge it
acquires in the first image can be transferred to other images, which makes the

$D$ ($D\geq2$) which are codified in the discretized transverse momentum and
position of single photons, once they are sent through an aperture with $D$
slits. Following our previous technique we use a programmable single phase-only
spatial light modulator (SLM) to define the aperture and set the complex
transmission amplitude of each slit, allowing the independent control of the
complex coefficients that define the quantum state. Since these SLMs give us
the possibility to dynamically varying the complex coefficients of the state
during the measurement time, we can generate not only pure states but also
quantum states compatible with a mixture of pure quantum states. Therefore, by
using these apertures varying on time according to a probability distribution,
we have experimentally obtained $D$-dimensional quantum states with purities
that depend on the parameters of the distribution through a clear analytical
expression. This fact allows us to easily customize the states to be generated.
Moreover, the method offer the possibility of working without changing the
optical setup between pure and mixed states, or when the dimensionality of the
states is increased. The obtained results show a quite good performance of our
method at least up to dimension $D=11$, being the fidelity of the prepared

conduct experiments which use embeddings pre-trained with DeepWalk and LINE

generative model of natural image patches. In line with the well-established
idea that sensory processing is adapted to the statistics of the natural
environment, the GSM has also been considered a model of the early visual
system, as a reasonable ""first-order"" approximation of the internal model that
the primary visual cortex (V1) implements. According to this view, neural
activities in V1 represent the posterior distribution under the GSM given a
particular visual stimulus. Indeed, (approximate) inference under the GSM has
successfully accounted for various nonlinearities in the mean (trial-average)
responses of V1 neurons, as well as the dependence of (across-trial) response
variability with stimulus contrast found in V1 recordings. However, previous
work almost exclusively relied on numerical simulations to obtain these
results. Thus, for a deeper insight into the realm of possible behaviours the
GSM can (and cannot) exhibit and predict, here we present analytical
derivations for the limiting behaviour of the mean and (co)variance of the GSM
posterior at very low and very high contrast levels. These results should guide
future work exploring neural circuit dynamics appropriate for implementing

  differentiation using convolutional neural networks",,,,,"q-bio.TO physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The accurate assessment of White matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden is of
crucial importance for epidemiological studies to determine association between
WMHs, cognitive and clinical data. The manual delineation of WMHs is tedious,
costly and time consuming. This is further complicated by the fact that other
pathological features (i.e. stroke lesions) often also appear as hyperintense.
Several automated methods aiming to tackle the challenges of WMH segmentation
have been proposed, however cannot differentiate between WMH and strokes. Other
methods, capable of distinguishing between different pathologies in brain MRI,
are not designed with simultaneous WMH and stroke segmentation in mind. In this
work we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to
segment hyperintensities and differentiate between WMHs and stroke lesions.
Specifically, we aim to distinguish between WMH pathologies from those caused
by stroke lesions due to either cortical, large or small subcortical infarcts.
As far as we know, this is the first time such differentiation task has
explicitly been proposed. The proposed fully convolutional CNN architecture, is
comprised of an analysis path, that gradually learns low and high level
features, followed by a synthesis path, that gradually combines and up-samples
the low and high level features into a class likelihood semantic segmentation.
Quantitatively, the proposed CNN architecture is shown to outperform other well
established and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overlap with manual
expert annotations. Clinically, the extracted WMH volumes were found to
correlate better with the Fazekas visual rating score. Additionally, a
comparison of the associations found between clinical risk-factors and the WMH
volumes generated by the proposed method, were found to be in line with the
associations found with the expert-annotated volumes.

reconstruct both mean and eddying quantities, such as the heat flux, is
addressed using an idealized eddy resolving numerical model, designed to be
representative of the Southern Ocean. The model is seeded with 450 ""virtual""
Argo floats, which are then advected by the model fields for 10 years. The role
of temporal sampling, network density and length of the float experiment are
then systematically investigated by comparing the reconstructed velocity, eddy
kinetic energy and heat-flux from the virtual Argo floats with the ""true""
values from the from the model output. We find that although errors in all
three quantities decrease with increasing temporal sampling rate, number of
floats and time span, the error approaches an asymptotic limit. Thus, as these
parameters exceed this limit, only marginal reductions in the error are
observed. The parameters of the real Argo network, when scaled to match those
of the virtual Argo network, generally fall near to, or within, the asymptotic
region. Using the numerical model, a method for the calculation of cross-stream
heat-fluxes is demonstrated. This methodology is then applied to 5 years of
Argo derived velocities using the ANDRO dataset of Ollitrault \& Rannou (2013)
in order to estimate the eddy heat flux at 1000m depth across the Polar Front
in the Southern Ocean. The heat-flux is concentrated in regions downstream of
large bathymetric features, consistent with the results of previous studies.
2$\pm$0.5TW of heat transport across the Polar Front at this depth is found,
with more than 90\% of that total concentrated in less than 20\% of the total
longitudes spanned by the front. Finally, the implications of this work for

giant elliptical galaxy Cen A and the spiral galaxy M31 show a large range of
cluster-to-star number ratios ('specific frequencies'). The cluster-to-star
ratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100-1000, at all
galactocentric radii and with a slope that does not seem to depend on radius.
In dwarf galaxies, the GCs are also more metal-poor than the field stars on
average. These observations indicate a strong dependence of either the cluster
formation efficiency or the cluster destruction rate on metallicity and
environment. We aim to explain these trends by considering various effects that
may influence the observed cluster-to-star ratio as a function of metallicity,
environment and cosmological history. We show that both the cluster formation
efficiency and the maximum cluster mass increase with metallicity, so they
cannot explain the observed trend. Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and
dynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric
radii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular
clouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly
efficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.
The predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high
metallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to
orbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the
observations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on
metallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be
explained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth. As a result,
we find that the metallicity-dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio does not
reflect a GC formation efficiency, but a survival fraction. (Abridged)

on halogenated Si(111) surface, by virtue of density functional theory and

energy excitations in silicene is almost preserved in the presence of silicon
substrate passivated by various halogens. Nevertheless, the combined effects of
charge transfer into the substrate, stretching of bonds between silicon atoms,
and symmetry breaking which originates from van der Waals interaction, result
in a gap $E_{g1}$ in the spectrum of the embedded silicene. We further take the
spin-orbit interaction into account and obtain its strength and the resulting
enhancement in the gap $E_{g2}=2\lambda$. Both $E_{g1}$ and $E_{g2}$ which
contribute to the total gap, vary significantly when different halogen atoms
are used for the passivation of the Si surface and for the case of iodine, they
have very large values of $70$ and $23$ meV, respectively. To examine the
topological properties, we calculate the projected band structure of silicene
from which the tight binding parameters of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian
are obtained by fitting. Our results based on Berry curvature and
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant reveals that silicene on halogenated Si substrates has
a topological insulating state which can survive even at room temperature for
the substrate with iodine and bromine at the surface. Similar to the free
standing silicene, by applying a perpendicular electric field and at a certain
critical value which again depends on the type of halogens, the gap closes and
silicene undergoes a transition to a trivial insulating state. As a key
finding, we see that the presence of halogenated substrate except for the case
of fluorine enhances the robustness of the topological phases against the
vertical electric field and most probably other external perturbations.

the definition of arbitrary workloads, so-called Tasks, and the dependencies
between them in a lightweight and scalable structure. Further features are
multi-user support, automated dependency resolution and error handling, central
scheduling, and status visualization in the web. In addition to already
built-in features for remote jobs and file systems like Hadoop and HDFS, we
added support for WLCG infrastructure such as LSF and CREAM job submission, as
well as remote file access through the Grid File Access Library. Furthermore,
we implemented automated resubmission functionality, software sandboxing, and a
command line interface with auto-completion for a convenient working

we created a generic Python interface that provides programmatic access to all

  Data Analysis",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cortical surface fMRI (cs-fMRI) has recently grown in popularity versus
traditional volumetric fMRI, as it allows for more meaningful spatial smoothing
and is more compatible with the common assumptions of isotropy and stationarity
in Bayesian spatial models. However, as no Bayesian spatial model has been
proposed for cs-fMRI data, most analyses continue to employ the classical,
voxel-wise general linear model (GLM) (Worsley and Friston 1995). Here, we
propose a Bayesian GLM for cs-fMRI, which employs a class of sophisticated
spatial processes to flexibly model latent activation fields. We use integrated
nested Laplacian approximation (INLA), a highly accurate and efficient Bayesian
computation technique (Rue et al. 2009). To identify regions of activation, we
propose an excursions set method based on the joint posterior distribution of
the latent fields, which eliminates the need for multiple comparisons
correction. Finally, we address a gap in the existing literature by proposing a
novel Bayesian approach for multi-subject analysis. The methods are validated
and compared to the classical GLM through simulation studies and a motor task
fMRI study from the Human Connectome Project. The proposed Bayesian approach
results in smoother activation estimates, more accurate false positive control,
and increased power to detect truly active regions.

Intriguingly such phases appear in the copper- and iron-based superconductors,

open question. Nematicity may take an active part, cooperating or competing
with superconductivity, or may appear accidentally in such systems. Here we
present experimental evidence for a phase of nematic character in the heavy
fermion superconductor CeRhIn5. We observe a field-induced breaking of the
electronic tetragonal symmetry of in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
quantum phase transition at Hc~50T. This phase appears in out-of-plane fields
of H*~28T and is characterized by substantial in-plane resistivity anisotropy.
The anisotropy can be aligned by a small in-plane field component, with no
apparent connection to the underlying crystal structure. Furthermore no
anomalies are observed in the magnetic torque, suggesting the absence of
metamagnetic transitions in this field range. These observations are indicative
of an electronic nematic character of the high field state in CeRhIn5. The
appearance of nematic behavior in a phenotypical heavy fermion superconductor
highlights the interrelation of nematicity and unconventional
superconductivity, suggesting nematicity to be a commonality in such materials.

stratification. The principal objective of this paper is to use time allocation
to model and study the global efficiency of social stratification, and to
reveal whether hierarchy is an emergent property. A multi-agent model with an
evolving social network is used to verify our hypotheses. The network's
evolution is driven by the intensity of inter-agent communications, and the
communications as such depend on the preferences and time resources of the
communicating agents. The entire system is to be perceived as a metaphor of a
social network of people regularly filling out agenda for their meetings for a

agents is measured by the average utilization of the agent's preferences to

different scheduling methods, resource availabilities, and network evolution
mechanisms on communication system efficiency. The non-stratified systems show
better long-term efficiency. Moreover, in the long term hierarchy disappears in

potentially reduce the systematic uncertainty in the cosmic-ray energy
measurement significantly. Two attractive aspects are that the atmosphere is
transparent to MHz radio waves and the radio emission can be calculated from
first-principles using classical electrodynamics. This method will be discussed
for the Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Cosmic-Ray
Observatory. AERA detects radio emission from extensive air showers with
energies beyond $10^{17}~$eV in the 30 - 80 MHz frequency band and consists of
more than 150 autonomous radio stations covering an area of about 17$~$km$^2$.
It is located at the same site as the Auger low-energy detector extensions
enabling combinations with various other measurement techniques.

2016), we developed and demonstrated a generic modelling framework for the
modelling of direct precipitation fouling from multi-component fluid mixtures
that become super-saturated at the wall. The modelling concept involves the
1-dimensional transport of the fluid species through the turbulent boundary
layer close to the wall. The governing equations include the Reynolds-averaged
(RANS) advection-diffusion equations for each fluid species, and the axial
momentum and energy equations for the fluid mixture. The driving force for the
diffusive transport is the local gradient in the species' chemical potential.
Adsorption mechanisms are not modelled per se, but the time-scale of adsorption
is reflected in the choice of Dirichlet boundary conditions for the depositing
species, at the fluid-solid interface.
  In this paper, the modelling framework is implemented as a user-defined
function (UDF) for the CFD software ANSYS Fluent, to act as a wall boundary
condition for mass-transfer to the wall. The subgrid, 1-dimensional formulation
of the model reduces the computational cost associated with resolving the fine
length-scales at which the boundary-layer mass transfer is determined, and
allows for efficient modelling of industry-scale heat exchangers suffering from
fouling.
  The current paper describes the modelling framework, and demonstrates and
validates its applicability in a simplified 2D heat exchanger geometry
(experimental and detailed CFD modelling data by P\""a\""akk\""onen et al. (2012,
2016)). By tuning the diffusivity, only, good agreement with the experimental
data and the detailed CFD model was obtained, in terms of area-averaged
deposition rates.

reduction of a secondorder network system based on graph clustering. In this
approach, vertex dynamics are captured by the transfer functions from inputs to
individual states, and the dissimilarities of vertices are quantified by the
H2-norms of the transfer function discrepancies. A greedy hierarchical
clustering algorithm is proposed to place those vertices with similar dynamics
into same clusters. Then, the reduced-order model is generated by the
Petrov-Galerkin method, where the projection is formed by the characteristic
matrix of the resulting network clustering. It is shown that the simplified
system preserves an interconnection structure, i.e., it can be again
interpreted as a second-order system evolving over a reduced graph.
Furthermore, this paper generalizes the definition of network controllability
Gramian to second-order network systems. Based on it, we develop an efficient
method to compute H2-norms and derive the approximation error between the
full-order and reduced-order models. Finally, the approach is illustrated by
the example of a small-world network.

the Hawking radiation of SdS black hole is also investigated using massive

from a boundary to the bulk finds a simple description in terms of wave
functions or density matrices. While the transfer matrix formalism is a type of
Heisenberg picture for this problem, we develop here the associated
Schr\""odinger picture that keeps track of the local probabilistic information.
The transport of the probabilistic information between neighboring
hypersurfaces obeys a linear evolution equation, and therefore the
superposition principle for the possible solutions. Operators are associated to
local observables, with rules for the computation of expectation values similar
to quantum mechanics. We discuss how non-commutativity naturally arises in this
setting. Also other features characteristic of quantum mechanics, such as
complex structure, change of basis or symmetry transformations, can be found in
classical statistics once formulated in terms of wave functions or density
matrices. We construct for every quantum system an equivalent classical
statistical system, such that time in quantum mechanics corresponds to the
location of hypersurfaces in the classical probabilistic ensemble. For suitable
choices of local observables in the classical statistical system one can, in
principle, compute all expectation values and correlations of observables in
the quantum system from the local probabilistic information of the associated
classical statistical system. Realizing a static memory material as a quantum
simulator for a given quantum system is not a matter of principle, but rather
of practical simplicity.

pursed step by step to quantitatively analyze the frequency-dependent

of metals, the simulations agree well with the observed spectra (photoelectric

large amount of research because they are perfect playgrounds to investigate
highly dynamic particulate flows. Their over-all behavior is determined by
short-lasting particle collisions and the interaction between solid and gas
phase. Modern simulation techniques that combine computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) and discrete element methods (DEM) are capable of describing their
evolution and provide detailed information on what is happening on the particle
scale. However, these approaches are limited by small time steps and large
numerical costs, which inhibits the investigation of slower long-term processes
like heat transfer or chemical conversion.
  In a recent study (Lichtenegger and Pirker, 2016), we have introduced
recurrence CFD (rCFD) as a way to decouple fast from slow degrees of freedom in
systems with recurring patterns: A conventional simulation is carried out to
capture such coherent structures. Their re-appearance is characterized with
recurrence plots that allow us to extrapolate their evolution far beyond the
simulated time. On top of these predicted flow fields, any passive or weakly
coupled process can then be investigated at fractions of the original
computational costs.
  Here, we present the application of rCFD to heat transfer in a lab-scale
fluidized bed. Initially hot particles are fluidized with cool air and their
temperature evolution is recorded. In comparison to conventional CFD-DEM, we
observe speed-up factors of about two orders of magnitude at very good accuracy

paper, we develop discrete gyrator transforms (DGTs) based on the 2D LCT.
Taking the advantage of the additivity property of the 2D LCT, we propose three
kinds of DGTs, each of which is a cascade of low-complexity operators. These
DGTs have different constraints, characteristics, and properties, and are
realized by different computational algorithms. Besides, we propose a kind of
DGT based on the eigenfunctions of the gyrator transform. This DGT is an
orthonormal transform, and thus its comprehensive properties, especially the
additivity property, make it more useful in many applications. We also develop
an efficient computational algorithm to significantly reduce the complexity of
