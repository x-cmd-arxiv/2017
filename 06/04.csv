  with variable diffusivity coefficient",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomalous diffusion is a phenomenon that cannot be modeled accurately by
second-order diffusion equations, but is better described by fractional
diffusion models. The nonlocal nature of the fractional diffusion operators
makes substantially more difficult the mathematical analysis of these models
and the establishment of suitable numerical schemes. This paper proposes and
analyzes the first finite difference method for solving {\em
variable-coefficient} fractional differential equations, with two-sided
fractional derivatives, in one-dimensional space. The proposed scheme combines
first-order forward and backward Euler methods for approximating the left-sided
fractional derivative when the right-sided fractional derivative is
approximated by two consecutive applications of the first-order backward Euler
method. Our finite difference scheme reduces to the standard second-order
central difference scheme in the absence of fractional derivatives. The
existence and uniqueness of the solution for the proposed scheme are proved,
and truncation errors of order $h$ are demonstrated, where $h$ denotes the
maximum space step size. The numerical tests illustrate the global $O(h)$
accuracy of our scheme, except for nonsmooth cases which, as expected, have
deteriorated convergence rates.

Lyapunov exponent of a pair fluid particles trajectories in fully developed
incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence. According to the hypothesis of
fully developed chaos, this PDF is reasonably estimated by maximizing the
entropy associated to such distribution, resulting to be an uniform
distribution function in a proper interval of variation of the local Lyapunov
exponents. From this PDF, we determine the relationship between the average and
maximum Lyapunov exponents and the longitudinal velocity correlation function.
This link, which leads to the closure of von K\`arm\`an--Howarth and Corrsin
equations, agrees with the relation obtained in the previous work, supporting
the proposed PDF calculation, at least for the purposes of the energy cascade
effect estimation. Furthermore, through the property that the Lyapunov vectors
tend to align to the direction of the maximum growth rate of trajectories
distance, we obtain the link between maximum and average Lyapunov exponents in
line with the previous result.

Answering (QA) system. It may use a parser to interpret the question to a
structured query, execute that on a knowledge graph (KG), and return direct
entity responses. QA systems based on precise parsing tend to be brittle: minor
syntax variations may dramatically change the response. Moreover, KG coverage
is patchy. At the other extreme, a large corpus may provide broader coverage,
but in an unstructured, unreliable form. We present AQQUCN, a QA system that
gracefully combines KG and corpus evidence. AQQUCN accepts a broad spectrum of
query syntax, between well-formed questions to short `telegraphic' keyword
sequences. In the face of inherent query ambiguities, AQQUCN aggregates signals
from KGs and large corpora to directly rank KG entities, rather than commit to
one semantic interpretation of the query. AQQUCN models the ideal
interpretation as an unobservable or latent variable. Interpretations and
candidate entity responses are scored as pairs, by combining signals from
multiple convolutional networks that operate collectively on the query, KG and
corpus. On four public query workloads, amounting to over 8,000 queries with
diverse query syntax, we see 5--16% absolute improvement in mean average
precision (MAP), compared to the entity ranking performance of recent systems.
Our system is also competitive at entity set retrieval, almost doubling F1
scores for challenging short queries.

sources both show IDV properties for S5 0716+714. The timescales are in the
range from 17.3 minutes to 4.82 hours; for 3C273, the timescale is 35.6
minutes. Based on the periodic analysis methods, we find the periods P(V) =
24.24 days, P(R)=24.12 days, P(I)=24.82 days for S5 0716+714, and P = 12.99,
21.76 yr for 3C273. The two sources displayed the ""bluer-when-brighter""

transfer events between a gas bubble and its liquid surroundings towards the
current diffusion-driven growth or dissolution dynamics of that same bubble.
The history effect arises from the (non-instantaneous) development of the
dissolved gas concentration boundary layer in the liquid in response to changes
in the concentration at the bubble interface caused, for instance, by
variations of the ambient pressure in time. Essentially, the history effect
amounts to the acknowledgement that at any given time the mass flux across the
bubble is conditioned by the preceding time-history of the concentration at the
bubble boundary. Considering the canonical problem of an isolated spherical
bubble at rest, we show that the contribution of the history effect in the
current interfacial concentration gradient is fully contained within a memory
integral of the interface concentration. Retaining this integral term, we
formulate a governing differential equation for the bubble dynamics, analogous
to the well-known Epstein-Plesset solution. Our equation does not make use of
the quasi-static radius approximation. An analytical solution is presented for
the case of multiple step-like jumps in pressure. The nature and relevance of
the history effect is then assessed through illustrative examples. Finally, we
investigate the role of the history effect in rectified diffusion for a bubble
that pulsates under harmonic pressure forcing in the non-inertial, isothermal
regime.

gas bubble in a super- or undersaturated solution requires taking into account
a number of physical effects that contribute to the instantaneous mass transfer
rate. One of these effects is the so-called history effect. It refers to the
contribution of the local concentration boundary layer around the bubble that
has developed from past mass transfer events between the bubble and liquid
surroundings. In Part 1 of this work \citep{penas2016}, a theoretical treatment
of this effect was given for a spherical, isolated bubble. Here, Part 2
provides an experimental and numerical study of the history effect regarding a
spherical bubble attached to a horizontal flat plate and in the presence of
gravity. The simulation technique developed in this paper is based on a
streamfunction--vorticity formulation that may be applied to other flows where
bubbles or drops exchange mass in the presence of a gravity field. Using this
numerical tool, simulations are performed for the same conditions used in the
experiments, in which the bubble is exposed to subsequent growth and
dissolution stages, using step-wise variations in the ambient pressure. Besides
proving the relevance of the history effect, the simulations highlight the
importance that boundary-induced advection has to accurately describe bubble
growth and shrinkage, i.e. the bubble radius evolution. In addition, natural
convection has a significant influence that shows up in the velocity field even
at short times, though, given the supersaturation conditions studied here, the
bubble evolution is expected to be mainly diffusive.

new ASTE observations allowed the molecular gas component in the velocity range

have identified four molecular clumps, that were likely formed by the expansion
of the ionization front, and determined some of their physical and dynamical

gravitational collapse. We identified several candidate YSOs across the

massive star formation might have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula
via the collect and collapse mechanism. The spectroscopical distance obtained

flares with HMI intensity brightenings and study properties of detected
candidates. The code was tuned and tested and with a little effort, it could be
applied to any suitable data set. By studying a few flare examples, we found
indication that HMI intensity brightening might be an artefact of the
simplified procedure used to compute HMI observables.

human-like visuospatial skills for object manipulation tasks. Visuospatial
skills are attained by observing spatial relationships among objects through
demonstrations. The proposed Visuospatial Skill Learning (VSL) is a goal-based
approach that focuses on achieving a desired goal configuration of objects
relative to one another while maintaining the sequence of operations. VSL is
capable of learning and generalizing multi-operation skills from a single
demonstration, while requiring minimum prior knowledge about the objects and
the environment. In contrast to many existing approaches, VSL offers
simplicity, efficiency and user-friendly human-robot interaction. We also show
that VSL can be easily extended towards 3D object manipulation tasks, simply by
employing point cloud processing techniques. In addition, a robot learning
framework, VSL-SP, is proposed by integrating VSL, Imitation Learning, and a
conventional planning method. In VSL-SP, the sequence of performed actions are
learned using VSL, while the sensorimotor skills are learned using a
conventional trajectory-based learning approach. such integration easily
extends robot capabilities to novel situations, even by users without
programming ability. In VSL-SP the internal planner of VSL is integrated with
an existing action-level symbolic planner. Using the underlying constraints of
the task and extracted symbolic predicates, identified by VSL, symbolic
representation of the task is updated. Therefore the planner maintains a
generalized representation of each skill as a reusable action, which can be
used in planning and performed independently during the learning phase. The
proposed approach is validated through several real-world experiments.

is, data structures whose space consumption approaches the
information-theoretic optimal. The performance of these primitives is central
to the overall performance of succinct data structures.
  Traditionally, the select operation is the harder to implement efficiently,
and most prior implementations of select on machine words use 50--80 machine
instructions. (In contrast, rank on machine words can be implemented in only a
handful of instructions on machines that support POPCOUNT.) However, recently
Pandey et al. gave a new implementation of machine-word select that uses only
four x86 machine instructions; two of which were introduced in Intel's Haswell
CPUs.
  In this paper, we investigate the impact of this new implementation of
machine-word select on the performance of general bit-vector-select. We first
compare Pandey et al.'s machine-word select to the state-of-the-art
implementations of Zhou et al. (which is not specific to Haswell) and Gog et
al. (which uses some Haswell-specific instructions). We exhibit a speedup of 2X
to 4X.
  We then study the impact of plugging Pandey et al.'s machine-word select into
two state-of-the-art bit-vector-select implementations. Both Zhou et al.'s and
Gog et al.'s select implementations perform a single machine-word select
operation for each bit-vector select. We replaced the machine-word select with
the new implementation and compared performance. Even though there is only a
single machine- word select operation, we still obtained speedups of 20% to
68%. We found that the new select not only reduced the number of instructions
required for each bit-vector select, but also improved CPU instruction cache
performance and memory-access parallelism.

number of applications, such as setting the velocity scale for outflows as well
as measuring small-scale quasar-quasar clustering. The most reliable redshift
standard in luminous quasars is arguably the narrow [OIII]
$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission line doublet in the rest-frame optical. We
use previously published [OIII] redshifts obtained using near-infrared spectra
in a sample of 45 high-redshift (z > 2.2) quasars to evaluate redshift
measurement techniques based on rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. At redshifts
above z = 2.2 the MgII $\lambda$2798 emission line is not available in
observed-frame optical spectra, and the most prominent unblended and unabsorbed
spectral feature available is usually CIV $\lambda$1549. Peak and centroid
measurements of the CIV profile are often blueshifted relative to the
rest-frame of the quasar, which can significantly bias redshift determinations.
We show that redshift determinations for these high-redshift quasars are
significantly correlated with the emission-line properties of CIV (i.e., the
equivalent width, or EW, and the full width at half maximum, or FWHM) as well
as the luminosity, which we take from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
7. We demonstrate that empirical corrections based on multiple regression
analyses yield significant improvements in both the precision and accuracy of
the redshifts of the most distant quasars and are required to establish
consistency with redshifts determined in more local quasars.

Chebyshev functions to establish the cases for $2\leq k\leq 8$. We then move to
an analytic number theory approach to show that there is a prime number in the

that there is always a prime number between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^{2.000001}$ for

  to folds","28 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.LG q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation
  Protein fold recognition is an important problem in structural
bioinformatics. Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence
(homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a tar get protein based
on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain
the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been
developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to
methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice.
  Results
  We develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify
any protein se quence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both
fold recognition and the study of se quence-structure relationship. Different
from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method
automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any
length and map it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the
datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding a classification accuracy of 80.4%. On
the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification
accuracy is 77.0%. We compare our method with a top profile profile alignment
method - HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of
CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is
14.5%-29.1% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and
4.5%-16.7% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5, and 10
predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is
robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can
be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein
clustering, comparison and ranking.

  The Einstein-Hilbert action $S(e,\omega)$ is defined on $e$ and $\omega$. We

Its efficiency is comparable to the algorithm for the $\ell_1$ penalty in time,

relating to speciation. This random graph is defined as the stationary
distribution of a Markov chain on the space of graphs on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$.
The dynamics of this Markov chain is governed by two types of events: vertex
duplication, where at constant rate a pair of vertices is sampled uniformly and
one of these vertices loses its incident edges and is rewired to the other
vertex and its neighbors; and edge removal, where each edge disappears at
constant rate. Besides the number of vertices $n$, the model has a single
parameter $r_n$.
  Using a coalescent approach, we obtain explicit formulas for the first
moments of several graph invariants such as the number of edges or the number
of complete subgraphs of order $k$. These are then used to identify five
non-trivial regimes depending on the asymptotics of the parameter $r_n$. We
derive an explicit expression for the degree distribution, and show that under
appropriate rescaling it converges to classical distributions when the number
of vertices goes to infinity. Finally, we give asymptotic bounds for the number
of connected components, and show that in the sparse regime the number of edges
is Poissonian.

achieved experimentally or predicted theoretically, which have potential
applications in nano- and opto-electronics. Various applications for electronic
devices are closely related to their thermal transport properties. In this
work, the strain dependence of phonon transport in monolayer SiC with a perfect
planar hexagonal honeycomb structure is investigated by solving the linearized
phonon Boltzmann equation. It is found that room-temperature lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_L$) of monolayer SiC is two orders of magnitude lower
than that of graphene. The low $\kappa_L$ is due to small group velocities and
short phonon lifetimes, which can also be explained by polarized covalent bond
due to large charge transfer from Si to C atoms. In considered strain range, it
is proved that the SiC monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable. With
increased tensile strain, the $\kappa_L$ of SiC monolayer shows an unusual
nonmonotonic up-and-down behavior, which is due to the competition between the
change of phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of low frequency phonon
modes. At low strains ($<$8\%), the phonon lifetimes enhancement induces the
increased $\kappa_L$, while at high strains ($>$8\%) the reduction of group
velocities as well as the decrease of the phonon lifetimes are the major
mechanism responsible for decreased $\kappa_L$. Our works further enrich
studies on phonon transports of 2D materials with a perfect planar hexagonal

present an effective model for stanene that is reliable for electronic and

that a quadratic model with respect to the lattice momentum is the best suited

We also find that splitting the two spin-z subsectors is a good approximation,
which indicates that the lattice buckling can be neglected in calculations

computing the linear optical injection rates of carrier and spin densities in
stanene. Our calculations indicate that an incident circularly polarized
optical field only excites electrons with spin that matches its helicity.

by weak convergence of conditional laws. However, when working with stochastic
processes in the space of bounded functions and their weak convergence in the
Hoffmann-J{\o}rgensen sense, an obstacle occurs: due to possible
non-measurability, neither laws nor conditional laws are well-defined. Starting
from an equivalent formulation of weak convergence based on the bounded
Lipschitz metric, a classical circumvent is to formulate bootstrap consistency
in terms of the latter distance between what might be called a
\emph{conditional law} of the (non-measurable) bootstrap process and the law of
the limiting process. The main contribution of this note is to provide an
equivalent formulation of bootstrap consistency in the space of bounded
functions which is more intuitive and easy to work with. Essentially, the
equivalent formulation consists of (unconditional) weak convergence of the
original process jointly with two bootstrap replicates. As a by-product, we
provide two equivalent formulations of bootstrap consistency for statistics
taking values in separable metric spaces: the first in terms of (unconditional)
weak convergence of the statistic jointly with its bootstrap replicates, the
second in terms of convergence in probability of the empirical distribution
function of the bootstrap replicates. Finally, the asymptotic validity of
bootstrap-based confidence intervals and tests is briefly revisited, with
particular emphasis on the, in practice unavoidable, Monte Carlo approximation
of conditional quantiles.

a combination of Rabi- and Bloch oscillations with their strong mutual

differs from the individual picture both types of oscillations due to an

study in ultrafast science. However, in order to obtain a high-quality e beam,
electron injection and acceleration should be carefully manipulated, where a
large oscillation amplitude has to be avoided and thus the emitted x-ray yield
is limited. Here, we report a new scheme to experimentally enhance betatron
radiation significantly both in photon yield and photon energy by separating
electron injection and acceleration from manipulation of the e-beam transverse
oscillation in the wake via introducing a slanted thin plasma refraction slab.
Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that the e-beam transverse oscillation
amplitude can be increased by more than 10 folds, after being steered into the
deflected laser-driven wakefield due to refraction at the slab's boundaries.
Spectral broadening of the x-rays can be suppressed owing to the small
variation in the peak energy of the low-energy-spread e beam in a plasma
wiggler regime. We demonstrate that the high-quality e-beam generation,
refracting and wiggling can act as a whole to realize the concurrence of
monoenergetic e beam and bright x-rays in a compact LWFA.

learn an aging dictionary to reveal its aging characteristics (e.g., wrinkles),
where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from two
neighboring aging dictionaries form a particular aging pattern cross these two
age groups, and a linear combination of all these patterns expresses a
particular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into
consideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging
dictionaries, each person may have extra personalized facial characteristics,
e.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging
or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular person,
yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age
groups. To this end, we propose a novel Bi-level Dictionary Learning based

learning is formulated to learn the aging dictionaries based on face pairs from
neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages

in five infrared continuum bands between 70 and 500 $\mu$m. We present a
band-merged catalogue of spatially matched sources and their properties derived
from fits to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and heliocentric
distances, based on the photometric catalogs presented in Molinari et al.
(2016a), covering the portion of Galactic plane $-71.0^{\circ}< \ell <
67.0^{\circ}$. The band-merged catalogue contains 100922 sources with a regular
SED, 24584 of which show a 70 $\mu$m counterpart and are thus considered
proto-stellar, while the remainder are considered starless. Thanks to this huge
number of sources, we are able to carry out a preliminary analysis of early
stages of star formation, identifying the conditions that characterise
different evolutionary phases on a statistically significant basis. We
calculate surface densities to investigate the gravitational stability of
clumps and their potential to form massive stars. We also explore evolutionary
status metrics such as the dust temperature, luminosity and bolometric
temperature, finding that these are higher in proto-stellar sources compared to
pre-stellar ones. The surface density of sources follows an increasing trend as
they evolve from pre-stellar to proto-stellar, but then it is found to decrease
again in the majority of the most evolved clumps. Finally, we study the
physical parameters of sources with respect to Galactic longitude and the
association with spiral arms, finding only minor or no differences between the
average evolutionary status of sources in the fourth and first Galactic
quadrants, or between ""on-arm"" and ""inter-arm"" positions.

either in the energy harvesting (EH) mode or the data decoding (DD) mode, but
not both. Separate energy and data buffers are kept at the relay to store the
harvested energy and decoded data packets, respectively. In this paper, we
optimize a time switching policy that switches between the EH mode and DD mode
to maximize the system throughput or minimize the average transmission delay.
Both static and dynamic time switching policies are derived. In particular,
static policies are the ones where EH or DD mode is selected with a
pre-determined probability. In contrast, in a dynamic policy, the mode is
selected dynamically according to the states of data and energy buffers. We
prove that the throughput-optimal static and dynamic policies keep the relay
data buffer at the boundary of stability. More specifically, we show that the
throughput-optimal dynamic policy has a threshold-based structure. Moreover, we
prove that the delay-optimal dynamic policy also has a threshold-based
structure and keeps at most one packet at the relay. We notice that the

application performance in data centers and cloud networks. Recently, strong
interest has emerged in Join-the-Idle-Queue (JIQ) algorithms, which rely on
tokens issued by idle servers in dispatching tasks and outperform power-of-$d$
policies. Specifically, JIQ strategies involve minimal information exchange,
and yet achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit. The latter
property prevails in a multiple-dispatcher scenario when the loads are strictly
equal among dispatchers. For various reasons it is not uncommon however for
skewed load patterns to occur. We leverage product-form representations and
fluid limits to establish that the blocking and wait then no longer vanish,
even for arbitrarily low overall load. Remarkably, it is the least-loaded
dispatcher that throttles tokens and leaves idle servers stranded, thus acting
as bottleneck.
  Motivated by the above issues, we introduce two enhancements of the ordinary
JIQ scheme where tokens are either distributed non-uniformly or occasionally
exchanged among the various dispatchers. We prove that these extensions can
achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit, for any subcritical

who experiences a single behavioral bias, studying the effect of this bias on
the outcome.
  In general, however, decision-making can and will be affected by multiple
biases operating at the same time. How do multiple biases interact to produce
the overall outcome? Here we consider decisions in the presence of a pair of

tendency to value costs incurred in the present too highly -- and sunk-cost
bias -- the tendency to incorporate costs experienced in the past into one's

agents that are aware of their biases (sophisticated) and agents that are
unaware of them (naive). Interestingly, we show that the interaction between
the two biases is quite complex: in some cases, they mitigate each other's

continuous-time dynamical system whose states are finite-dimensional algebras
with (cubic) matrices of structural constants satisfying an analogue of the
Kolmogorov-Chapman equation (KCE). Since there are several kinds of
multiplications between cubic matrices one has fix a multiplication first and
then consider the KCE with respect to the fixed multiplication. The existence
of a solution for the KCE provides the existence of an FA. In this paper our
aim is to find sufficient conditions on the multiplications under which the
corresponding KCE has a solution. Mainly our conditions are given on the
algebra of cubic matrices (ACM) considered with respect to a fixed
multiplication of cubic matrices. Under some assumptions on the ACM (e.g. power
associative, unital, associative, commutative) we describe a wide class of FAs,
which contain algebras of arbitrary finite dimension. In particular, adapting
the theory of continuous-time Markov processes, we construct a class of FAs
given by the matrix exponent of cubic matrices. Moreover, we remarkably extend
the set of FAs given with respect to the Maksimov's multiplications of our

winner if votes were recounted after one of the losers had dropped out. But IIA
confuses the candidate who withdrew with the data which was generated by that
candidate. This paper reports a wide variety of simulation studies which
consistently show that data from dropout candidates can be very useful in
choosing the best of the remaining candidates. These studies use well-validated
spatial models in which the most centrist candidates are considered to be the
best candidates. Thus IIA should be abandoned. The majority judgment or MJ
voting system was created specifically to satisfy IIA. Some of these studies
also show the substantial inferiority of MJ to other voting systems.
Discussions of IIA have usually treated dropouts as strictly hypothetical, but
our conclusions about the usefulness of dropout data may apply even to real
dropouts.

applications. Examples include news recommendation where texts to be
recommended are constantly published everyday. However, most existing
recommendation techniques, such as matrix factorization based methods, mainly
rely on interaction histories to learn representations of items. While latent
factors of items can be learned effectively from user interaction data, in many
cases, such data is not available, especially for newly emerged items.
  In this work, we aim to address the problem of personalized recommendation
for completely new items with text information available. We cast the problem
as a personalized text ranking problem and propose a general framework that
combines text embedding with personalized recommendation. Users and textual
content are embedded into latent feature space. The text embedding function can
be learned end-to-end by predicting user interactions with items. To alleviate
sparsity in interaction data, and leverage large amount of text data with
little or no user interactions, we further propose a joint text embedding model
that incorporates unsupervised text embedding with a combination module.
Experimental results show that our model can significantly improve the
effectiveness of recommendation systems on real-world datasets.

  Data","15 pages, 17 figures, SCCG 2017",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum chromodynamics, most commonly referred to as QCD, is a relativistic
quantum field theory for the strong interaction between subatomic particles
called quarks and gluons. The most systematic way of calculating the strong
interactions of QCD is a computational approach known as lattice gauge theory
or lattice QCD. Space-time is discretised so that field variables are
formulated on the sites and links of a four dimensional hypercubic lattice.
This technique enables the gluon field to be represented using $3 \times 3$
complex matrices in four space-time dimensions. Importance sampling techniques
can then be exploited to calculate physics observables as functions of the
fields, averaged over a statistically-generated and suitably weighted ensemble
of field configurations. In this paper we present a framework developed to
visually assist scientists in the analysis of multidimensional properties and
emerging phenomena within QCD ensemble simulations. Core to the framework is
the use of topology-driven visualisation techniques which enable the user to
segment the data into unique objects, calculate properties of individual
objects present on the lattice, and validate features detected using
statistical measures. The framework enables holistic analysis to validate
existing hypothesis against novel visual cues with the intent of supporting and
steering scientists in the analysis and decision making process. Use of the
framework has lead to new studies into the effect that variation of
thermodynamic control parameters has on the topological structure of lattice
fields.

chemistry, often leading to conservation laws and selection rules. For example,
symmetry considerations have been used to predict selection rules for
transitions in atoms, molecules, and solids. Floquet systems also demonstrate a
variety of symmetries which are spatiotemporal (i.e. dynamical symmetries
(DSs)). However, the derivation of selection rules from DSs has so far been
limited to several ad hoc cases. A general theory for deducing the impact of
DSs in physical systems has not been formulated yet. Here we explore symmetries
exhibited in Floquet systems using group theory, and discover novel DSs and
selection rules. We derive the constraints on a general system's temporal
evolution, and selection rules that are imposed by the DSs. As an example, we
apply the theory to harmonic generation, and derive tables linking (2+1)D and
(3+1)D DSs of the driving laser and medium to allowed harmonic emission and its
polarization. We identify several new symmetries and selection rules, including
an elliptical DS that leads to production of elliptically polarized harmonics
where all the harmonics have the same ellipticity, and selection rules that
have no explanation based on currently known conservation laws. We expect the
theory to be useful for manipulating the harmonic spectrum, and for ultrafast
spectroscopy. Furthermore, the presented Floquet group theory should be useful
in various other systems, e.g., Floquet topological insulators and photonic
lattices, possibly yielding formal and general classification of symmetry and
topological properties.

  Computing Systems, December 2019","10.1145/3366635",,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a measure of the importance of a node from the
perspective of another (we call these nodes the $\textit{target}$ and the
$\textit{source}$, respectively). PPR has been used in many applications, such
as offering a Twitter user (the source) recommendations of who to follow
(targets deemed important by PPR); additionally, PPR has been used in
graph-theoretic problems such as community detection. However, computing PPR is
infeasible for large networks like Twitter, so efficient estimation algorithms
are necessary.
  In this work, we analyze the relationship between PPR estimation complexity
and clustering. First, we devise algorithms to estimate PPR for many
source/target pairs. In particular, we propose an enhanced version of the
existing single pair estimator $\texttt{Bidirectional-PPR}$ that is more useful
as a primitive for many pair estimation. We then show that the common
underlying graph can be leveraged to efficiently and jointly estimate PPR for
many pairs, rather than treating each pair separately using the primitive
algorithm. Next, we show the complexity of our joint estimation scheme relates
closely to the degree of clustering among the sources and targets at hand,
indicating that estimating PPR for many pairs is easier when clustering occurs.
Finally, we consider estimating PPR when several machines are available for
parallel computation, devising a method that leverages our clustering findings,
specifically the quantities computed $\textit{in situ}$, to assign tasks to
machines in a manner that reduces computation time. This demonstrates that the
relationship between complexity and clustering has important consequences in a
practical distributed setting.

due to focus singularities. We obtain a series of convexity results, both
positive and negative, for such singular integral affine base spaces. In
particular, near a focus singular point, they are locally convex and the
local-global convexity principle still applies. They are also globally convex
under some natural additional conditions. However, when the monodromy is
sufficiently big then the local-global convexity principle breaks down, and the
base spaces can be globally non-convex even for compact manifolds. As one of
surprising examples, we construct a 2-dimensional ""integral affine black hole"",
which is locally convex but for which a straight ray from the center can never
