hydrides in alpha-zirconium matrix are studied by a multiphase field model.
Simulations with only one hydride seed indicate that the hydride reorientation
occurs only when a tensile or compressive strain of ~0.02 is applied along
[112-0] (hoop or circumferential direction) or [0001] (radial direction aligned
with the basal pole direction), respectively. However, two-seed and multi-seed
hydride simulations show the significant influence of neighboring hydrides on
the required load for reorientation, reducing it by more than one order of
magnitude and making it comparable to the experimental results. Through
phase-field simulations, this work suggests that the hydride reorientation
happens more easily when clusters of hydrides are present, and the required
external load for reorientation is within the elastic limit of the cladding
material.

and, because the model makes use of multiple indicators of the underlying

method for incorporating information from different historic and contemporary

  applications",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum memories are key components in quantum information networks. Their
ability to store and retrieve information on demand makes repeat-until-success
strategies scalable. Warm alkali-metal vapours are interesting candidates for
the implementation of such memories, thanks to their long storage times and
experimental simplicity. Operation with the Raman protocol enables high
time-bandwidth products, which allows for multiple synchronisation trials of
probabilistically operating quantum gates via memory-based temporal
multiplexing. This makes the Raman memory a promising tool, whose broad
spectral bandwidth facilitates direct interfacing with other photonic
primitives, such as single photon sources. Here, such a light-matter interface
is implemented in a warm caesium vapour. Firstly, we study the storage of
polarisation-encoded information in the memory. High quality polarisation
preservation for bright coherent state input signals can be achieved, when
operating the Raman memory in a dual-rail configuration inside a polarisation
interferometer. Secondly, heralded single photons are stored in the memory. To
this end, the memory is operated on-demand by feed-forward of source heralding
events, which is a key technological capability. Prior to storage, single
photons are produced in a spontaneous parametric down conversion source, whose
bespoke design spectrally tailors the photons to the memory acceptance line.
The faithful retrieval of stored single photons is found to be currently
limited by noise in the memory, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3 in the
memory output. Nevertheless, a clear influence of the input's quantum nature is
observed in the retrieved light by measuring signal's photon statistics.
Finally, the memory noise processes are examined in detail. Four-wave-mixing
noise is determined as the sole important noise source for the Raman memory.

Thus, counting $2n$ down-converted photons directly yields the
$n^{\text{th}}$-order autocorrelation. The method, now with detection of near

frequencies are purely real. Since these frequencies correspond to oscillations
whose angular phase velocity matches the horizon angular velocity of the black

studied the ZDMs for near-extremal black holes. Recently, their correspondence

Aretakis instability of extremal black holes. Here we investigate the existence
of ZDMs for extremal black holes, showing that these real-axis resonances of

mobile applications as smartphones and tablets near ubiquitous adoption. Due to
this trend, the complexity of these ""apps"" has been increasing, making
development and maintenance challenging. Current bug tracking systems do not
effectively facilitate the creation of bug reports with useful information that
will directly lead to a bug's resolution. To address the need for an improved
reporting system, we introduce a novel solution, called Fusion, that helps
reporters auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps by
taking advantage of their GUI-centric nature. Fusion links information, that
reporters provide, to program artifacts extracted through static and dynamic
analysis performed beforehand. This allows our system to facilitate the
reporting process for developers and testers, while generating more
reproducible bug reports with immediately actionable information.

learning techniques. Imputation methods are algorithms conceived for restoring
missing values in the data, based on other entries in the database. The choice
of the imputation method has an influence on the performance of the machine
learning technique, e.g., it influences the accuracy of the classification
algorithm applied to the data. Therefore, selecting and applying the right
imputation method is important and usually requires a substantial amount of
human intervention. In this paper we propose the use of genetic programming
techniques to search for the right combination of imputation and classification
algorithms. We build our work on the recently introduced Python-based TPOT
library, and incorporate a heterogeneous set of imputation algorithms as part
of the machine learning pipeline search. We show that genetic programming can
automatically find increasingly better pipelines that include the most
effective combinations of imputation methods, feature pre-processing, and
classifiers for a variety of classification problems with missing data.

demonstrate the transition to involve spontaneous resolution of chiral

chirality is incommensurately modulated throughout the crystal lattice. We
refer to this state as an incommensurate chirality density wave (XDW) phase,

symmetry-forbidden at the Brillouin zone centre but symmetry-allowed for small
but finite modulation vectors $\mathbf q=[0,0,q_z]^\ast$. The importance of
long-wavelength chirality modulations in the physics of this hybrid framework

proper estimation of the background magnetic field is crucially important.
Various approaches to calculate the background magnetic fields, ranging from
local fields to globally averaged fields, are commonly used in the analysis of
turbulent data. Here we investigate how the uncertainty in the orientation of a
scale dependent background magnetic field influences the ability to resolve
anisotropy. Therefore we introduce a quantitative measure, the angle
uncertainty, which characterizes the uncertainty of the orientation of the
background magnetic field which turbulent structures are exposed to. The angle
uncertainty can be used as a condition to estimate the ability to resolve
anisotropy with certain accuracy. We apply our description to resolve spectral
anisotropy in fast solar wind data. We show that if the angle uncertainty grows
too large, the power of the turbulent fluctuations is attributed to false local
magnetic field angles, which may lead to an incorrect estimation of spectral
indices. In our results an apparent robustness of the spectral anisotropy to
false local magnetic field angles is observed, which can be explained by a
stronger increase of power for lower frequencies when the scale of the local
magnetic field is increased. The frequency dependent angle uncertainty is a
measure which can be applied to any turbulent system.

bipedal robotic locomotion as well. This chapter presents a coherent theory for
the design of feedback controllers that achieve stable walking gaits in
underactuated bipedal robots. Two fundamental tools are introduced, virtual
constraints and hybrid zero dynamics. Virtual constraints are relations on the
state variables of a mechanical model that are imposed through a time-invariant
feedback controller. One of their roles is to synchronize the robot's joints to
an internal gait phasing variable. A second role is to induce a low dimensional
system, the zero dynamics, that captures the underactuated aspects of a robot's
model, without any approximations. To enhance intuition, the relation between
physical constraints and virtual constraints is first established. From here,
the hybrid zero dynamics of an underactuated bipedal model is developed, and
its fundamental role in the design of asymptotically stable walking motions is
established. The chapter includes numerous references to robots on which the
highlighted techniques have been implemented.

goods to customers over multiple periods. The customers choose their time of
purchase to maximize their payoff that depends on their valuation of the
product, the purchase price, and the utility they derive from past purchases of
others, termed the network effect. We first show that the optimal price
sequence is non-decreasing. Therefore, by postponing purchase to future rounds,
customers trade-off a higher utility from the network effects with a higher
price. We then show that a customer's equilibrium strategy can be characterized
by a threshold rule in which at each round a customer purchases the product if
and only if her valuation exceeds a certain threshold. This implies that
customers face an inference problem regarding the valuations of others, i.e.,
observing that a customer has not yet purchased the product, signals that her
valuation is below a threshold. We consider a block model of network
interactions, where there are blocks of buyers subject to the same network
effect. A natural benchmark, this model allows us to provide an explicit
characterization of the optimal price sequence asymptotically as the number of
agents goes to infinity, which notably is linearly increasing in time with a
slope that depends on the network effect through a scalar given by the sum of
entries of the inverse of the network weight matrix. Our characterization shows
that increasing the ""imbalance"" in the network defined as the difference
between the in and out degree of the nodes increases the revenue of the
monopolist. We further study the effects of price discrimination and show that
in earlier periods monopolist offers lower prices to blocks with higher
Bonacich centrality to encourage them to purchase, which in turn further
incentivizes other customers to buy in subsequent periods.

First, I analyze the full scale Illustris simulation, and find that Galactic
indirect detection signals are expected to be largely symmetric, while
extragalactic signals are not, due to recent mergers and the presence of
substructure. Second, through the study of the high resolution Milky Way
simulation Eris, I find that metal-poor halo stars can be used as tracers for

routers. Although it is known that some network equipment emanates optical
signals correlated with the information being processed by the device
('side-channel'), intentionally controlling the status LEDs to carry any type
of data ('covert-channel') has never studied before. A malicious code is
executed on the LAN switch or router, allowing full control of the status LEDs.
Sensitive data can be encoded and modulated over the blinking of the LEDs. The
generated signals can then be recorded by various types of remote cameras and
optical sensors. We provide the technical background on the internal
architecture of switches and routers (at both the hardware and software level)
which enables this type of attack. We also present amplitude and frequency
based modulation and encoding schemas, along with a simple transmission
protocol. We implement a prototype of an exfiltration malware and discuss its
design and implementation. We evaluate this method with a few routers and
different types of LEDs. In addition, we tested various receivers including
remote cameras, security cameras, smartphone cameras, and optical sensors, and
also discuss different detection and prevention countermeasures. Our experiment
shows that sensitive data can be covertly leaked via the status LEDs of
switches and routers at a bit rates of 10 bit/sec to more than 1Kbit/sec per

time-consuming manual annotation of ICAC hampers much demanded further research
into the relationship between ICAC and neurological diseases. Automation of
ICAC segmentation is therefore highly desirable, but difficult due to the
proximity of the lesions to bony structures with a similar attenuation
coefficient. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic segmentation of
ICAC; the first to our knowledge. Our method is based on a 3D fully
convolutional neural network that we extend with two regularization techniques.
Firstly, we use deep supervision (hidden layers supervision) to encourage
discriminative features in the hidden layers. Secondly, we augment the network
with skip connections, as in the recently developed ResNet, and dropout layers,
inserted in a way that skip connections circumvent them. We investigate the
effect of skip connections and dropout. In addition, we propose a simple
problem-specific modification of the network objective function that restricts
the focus to the most important image regions and simplifies the optimization.
We train and validate our model using 882 CT scans and test on 1,000. Our
regularization techniques and objective improve the average Dice score by 7.1%,
yielding an average Dice of 76.2% and 97.7% correlation between predicted ICAC
volumes and manual annotations.

achievable rate regions of networks using finite field alphabets to the more
general cases of arbitrary ring and module alphabets. For non-commutative
rings, two-sided linearity is allowed. Specifically, we prove the following for
directed acyclic networks:
  (i) The linear rate region and the linear capacity of any network over a
finite field depend only on the characteristic of the field. Furthermore, any
two fields with different characteristics yield different linear capacities for
at least one network.
  (ii) Whenever the characteristic of a given finite field divides the size of
a given finite ring, each network's linear rate region over the ring is
contained in its linear rate region over the field. Thus, any network's linear
capacity over a field is at least its linear capacity over any other ring of
the same size. An analogous result also holds for linear network codes over
module alphabets.
  (iii) Whenever the characteristic of a given finite field does not divide the
size of a given finite ring, there is some network whose linear capacity over
the ring is strictly greater than its linear capacity over the field. Thus, for
any finite field, there always exist rings over which some networks have higher
linear capacities than over the field.

potential binary systems in fields containing the Perseus Molecular Cloud,
Pleiades, NGC 2264, and the Orion A star forming region. 18 of these systems
have been previously identified as binaries in the literature. Candidate
double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) are identified by analyzing the
cross-correlation functions (CCFs) computed during the reduction of each APOGEE
spectrum. We identify sources whose CCFs are well fit as the sum of two
Lorentzians as likely binaries, and provide an initial characterization of the
system based on the radial velocities indicated by that dual fit. For systems
observed over several epochs, we present mass ratios and systemic velocities;
for two systems with observations on eight or more epochs, and which meet our
criteria for robust orbital coverage, we derive initial orbital parameters. The
distribution of mass ratios for multi-epoch sources in our sample peaks at q=1,
but with a significant tail toward lower q values. Tables reporting radial
velocities, systemic velocities, and mass ratios are provided online. We
discuss future improvements to the radial velocity extraction method we employ,
as well as limitations imposed by the number of epochs currently available in
the APOGEE database. The Appendix contains brief notes from the literature on

short and long times in case the structured reservoirs of frequency modes
exhibit a spectral gap in the density of modes over low frequencies. The
presence of the low-frequency gap with upper cut-off frequency $\omega_g$
produces over the time scale $1/\omega_g$ an infinite sequence of time
intervals over which information backflow appears. Such time intervals are
generally irregular but, under certain conditions, exhibit the following
bounds: the $n$th backflow has certainly started at the instant $\pi
\left(1+2(n-1)\right)/\omega_g$, and certainly ended at the instant $2\pi
n/\omega_g$, for every $n=1,2,\ldots$. The intervals become regular over long
times, tend to the asymptotic length $\pi/\omega_g$ as supremum value, and are
described analytically in terms of the structure of the spectral density near
the cut-off frequency. Consequently, engineering structured reservoirs of
frequency modes with low-frequency spectral gaps produces in local dephasing
channels regular and controllable sequences of information backflow and
recoherence over long times, along with non-Markovian evolution.

enlarge the gap, and simultaneously shift the critical minimum. For a Bose gas

using mapped coded images with explicit texture information provide
complementary information to the standard RGB deep models. Additionally, two
deep architectures, namely early and late fusion, are investigated to combine

for the production of Hawking-like radiation. We demonstrate that when this
radiation is taken into account it prevents horizon crossing/formation in a
large class of models. We conjecture that horizon avoidance is a general
feature of collapse. The non-existence of event horizons dispels the paradox,
but opens up important questions about thermodynamic properties of the
resulting objects and correlations between different degrees of freedom.

the area product formula for both cases is \emph{not} mass-independent because
they depends on the ADM mass parameter while in \emph{Einstein gravity} this
formula is mass-independent~(universal). We also explicitly verify the

moving sectors are the same via universal thermodynamic relations. We also
discuss the most important result of the \emph{Kerr-MOG/CFT correspondence}. We
derive the central charges for Kerr-MOG BH which is $c_{L}=12J$ and it is
similar to Kerr BH. We also derive the dimensionless temperature of a extreme

future outcomes, and assess the statistical significance of explanatory
variables. When used for the purpose of statistical inference, logistic models
produce p-values for the regression coefficients by using an approximation to
the distribution of the likelihood-ratio test. Indeed, Wilks' theorem asserts
that whenever we have a fixed number $p$ of variables, twice the log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) $2\Lambda$ is distributed as a $\chi^2_k$ variable in the limit of
large sample sizes $n$; here, $k$ is the number of variables being tested. In
this paper, we prove that when $p$ is not negligible compared to $n$, Wilks'
theorem does not hold and that the chi-square approximation is grossly
incorrect; in fact, this approximation produces p-values that are far too small
(under the null hypothesis). Assume that $n$ and $p$ grow large in such a way
that $p/n\rightarrow\kappa$ for some constant $\kappa < 1/2$. We prove that for
a class of logistic models, the LLR converges to a rescaled chi-square, namely,
$2\Lambda~\stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{\rightarrow}~\alpha(\kappa)\chi_k^2$, where the
scaling factor $\alpha(\kappa)$ is greater than one as soon as the
dimensionality ratio $\kappa$ is positive. Hence, the LLR is larger than
classically assumed. For instance, when $\kappa=0.3$,
$\alpha(\kappa)\approx1.5$. In general, we show how to compute the scaling
factor by solving a nonlinear system of two equations with two unknowns. Our
mathematical arguments are involved and use techniques from approximate message
passing theory, non-asymptotic random matrix theory and convex geometry. We
also complement our mathematical study by showing that the new limiting
distribution is accurate for finite sample sizes. Finally, all the results from
this paper extend to some other regression models such as the probit regression
model.

abundance spreads in r-process elements (e.g., Eu). We here propose a new
scenario which explains the origin of these GCs (e.g., M5 and M15). In this
scenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive
molecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by
numerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be
accumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density
intra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject
r-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed
with the ICM. New stars formed from the ICM can have r-process abundances quite
different from those of earlier generations of stars within the GC. This
scenario can explain both (i) why r-process elements can be trapped within GCs
and (ii) why GCs with internal abundance spreads in r-process elements do not
show [Fe/H] spreads. Our model shows that (i) a large fraction of Eu-rich stars
can be seen in Na-enhanced stellar populations of GCs, as observed in M15, and
(ii) why most of the Galactic GCs do not exhibit such internal abundance
spreads. Our model demonstrates that the observed internal spreads of
$r$-process elements in GCs provide strong evidence for prolonged star
formation (~10^8 yr).

Weyl semimetals. We show that the chiral anomaly (positive magnetoconductivity
quadratic in magnetic field) that appears when separate Fermi surface pockets
surround distinct Weyl points survives only when intervalley scattering is very
weak compared to intravalley scattering.

the overall dependence of the fraction of active nuclei on galaxy type and

from positive time lags to negative time lags in the spectral lag data of GRB
160625B. They have fit these observed lags to a sum of two components: an
assumed functional form for intrinsic time lag due to astrophysical mechanisms
and an energy-dependent speed of light due to quadratic and linear Loren tz
invariance violation (LIV) models. Here, we examine the statistical
significance of the evidence for a transition to nega tive time lags. Such a
transition, even if present in GRB 160625B, cannot be due to an energy
dependent speed of light as th is would contradict previous limits by some 3-4
orders of magnitude, and must therefore be of intrinsic astrophysical origin .
We use three different model comparison techniques: a frequentist test and two
information based criteria (AIC and BIC). From the frequentist model comparison
test, we find that the evidence for transition in the spectral lag data is
favored at $3.05\sigma$ and $3.74\sigma$ for the linear and quadratic models
respectively. We find that $\Delta$AIC and $\Delta$BIC have values $\gtrsim$ 10
for the spectral lag transition that was motivated as being due to quadratic
Lorentz invariance vio lating model pointing to ""decisive evidence"". We note
however that none of the three models (including the model of intr insic
astrophysical emission) provide a good fit to the data.

smoothing out a program. Our compiler framework models intermediate values in
the program as random variables, by using mean and variance statistics. Our
approach breaks the input program into parts and relates the statistics of the
different parts, under the smoothing process. We give several approximations
that can be used for the different parts of the program. These include the
approximation of Dorn et al., a novel adaptive Gaussian approximation, Monte
Carlo sampling, and compactly supported kernels. Our adaptive Gaussian
approximation is accurate up to the second order in the standard deviation of
the smoothing kernel, and mathematically smooth. We show how to construct a
compiler that applies chosen approximations to given parts of the input
program. Because each expression can have multiple approximation choices, we
use a genetic search to automatically select the best approximations. We apply
this framework to the problem of automatically bandlimiting procedural shader
programs. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex shaders, including
shaders with parallax mapping, animation, and spatially varying statistics. The
resulting smoothed shader programs outperform previous approaches both
numerically, and aesthetically, due to the smoothing properties of our

diverse as geology and dentistry. For a subset of experiments at ultra-fast,
x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), SDDs can make substantial contributions.
Often the unknown spectrum is interesting, carrying science data, or the
background measurement is useful to identify unexpected signals. Many
measurements involve only several discrete photon energies known a priori,
allowing single event decomposition of pile-up and spectroscopic photon
counting. We designed a pulse function and demonstrated that the signal
amplitude and rise time are obtained for each pulse by fitting, thus removing
the need for pulse shaping. By avoiding pulse shaping, rise times of tens of
nanoseconds resulted in reduced pulse pile-up and allowed decomposition of
remaining pulse pile-up at photon separation times down to hundreds of
nanoseconds while yielding time-of-arrival information with precision of 10
nanoseconds. Waveform fitting yields simultaneously high energy resolution and
high counting rates (2 orders of magnitude higher than current digital pulse
processors). We showed that pile-up spectrum fitting is relatively simple and
preferable to pile-up spectrum deconvolution. We developed a photon pile-up
statistical model for constant intensity sources, extended it to variable
intensity sources (typical for FELs) and used it to fit a complex pile-up
spectrum. We subsequently developed a Bayesian pile-up decomposition method
that allows decomposing pile-up of single events with up to 6 photons from 6
monochromatic lines with 99% accuracy. The usefulness of SDDs will continue
into the x-ray FEL era of science. Their successors, the ePixS hybrid pixel
detectors, already offer hundreds of pixels, each with similar performance to
an SDD, in a compact, robust and affordable package

in a hierarchy is an important area of research. Top-down approaches that

for large scale hierarchical classification. However, accuracy of top-down
approaches is poor due to error propagation i.e., prediction errors made at
higher levels in the hierarchy cannot be corrected at lower levels. One of the
main reason behind errors at the higher levels is the presence of inconsistent
nodes that are introduced due to the arbitrary process of creating these
hierarchies by domain experts. In this paper, we propose two different
data-driven approaches (local and global) for hierarchical structure
modification that identifies and flattens inconsistent nodes present within the
hierarchy. Our extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed approaches on
several image and text datasets with varying distribution of features, classes
and training instances per class shows improved classification performance over
competing hierarchical modification approaches. Specifically, we see an
improvement upto 7% in Macro-F1 score with our approach over best TD baseline.

sensing applications, but their excessive resource needs on constrained
embedded devices remain an important impediment. A recently explored solution
space lies in compressing (approximating or simplifying) deep neural networks
in some manner before use on the device. We propose a new compression solution,
called DeepIoT, that makes two key contributions in that space. First, unlike
current solutions geared for compressing specific types of neural networks,
DeepIoT presents a unified approach that compresses all commonly used deep
learning structures for sensing applications, including fully-connected,
convolutional, and recurrent neural networks, as well as their combinations.
Second, unlike solutions that either sparsify weight matrices or assume linear
structure within weight matrices, DeepIoT compresses neural network structures
into smaller dense matrices by finding the minimum number of non-redundant
hidden elements, such as filters and dimensions required by each layer, while
keeping the performance of sensing applications the same. Importantly, it does
so using an approach that obtains a global view of parameter redundancies,
which is shown to produce superior compression. We conduct experiments with
five different sensing-related tasks on Intel Edison devices. DeepIoT
outperforms all compared baseline algorithms with respect to execution time and
energy consumption by a significant margin. It reduces the size of deep neural
networks by 90% to 98.9%. It is thus able to shorten execution time by 71.4% to
94.5%, and decrease energy consumption by 72.2% to 95.7%. These improvements
are achieved without loss of accuracy. The results underscore the potential of
DeepIoT for advancing the exploitation of deep neural networks on
resource-constrained embedded devices.

planetesimals, and their presence around stars also suggests that planets exist
in these systems. In this paper, we present submillimetre images of the thermal
emission from debris discs that formed the SCUBA-2 Observations of Nearby Stars
(SONS) survey, one of seven legacy surveys undertaken on the James Clerk
Maxwell telescope between 2012 and 2015. The overall results of the survey are
presented in the form of 850 microns (and 450 microns, where possible) images
and fluxes for the observed fields. Excess thermal emission, over that expected
from the stellar photosphere, is detected around 49 stars out of the 100
observed fields. The discs are characterised in terms of their flux density,
size (radial distribution of the dust) and derived dust properties from their
spectral energy distributions. The results show discs over a range of sizes,
typically 1-10 times the diameter of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt in our Solar
System. The mass of a disc, for particles up to a few millimetres in size, is
uniquely obtainable with submillimetre observations and this quantity is
presented as a function of the host stars' age, showing a tentative decline in
mass with age. Having doubled the number of imaged discs at submillimetre
wavelengths from ground-based, single dish telescope observations, one of the
key legacy products from the SONS survey is to provide a comprehensive target
list to observe at high angular resolution using submillimetre/millimetre
interferometers (e.g., ALMA, SMA).

requires a careful selection of the targets. Under the assumption of a

calculate a temperature-dependent habitability index, $h_{050}$, designed to
maximize the potential presence of biosignature-producing activity (Silva et
al.\ 2016). The surface temperature has been computed for a broad range of
climate factors using a climate model designed for terrestrial-type exoplanets
(Vladilo et al.\ 2015). After fixing the planetary data according to the
experimental results (Jenkins et al.\ 2015), we changed the surface gravity,
CO$_2$ abundance, surface pressure, orbital eccentricity, rotation period, axis
obliquity and ocean fraction within the range of validity of our model. For
most choices of parameters we find habitable solutions with $h_{050}>0.2$ only
for CO$_2$ partial pressure $p_\mathrm{CO_2} \lesssim 0.04$\,bar. At this
limiting value of CO$_2$ abundance the planet is still habitable if the total
pressure is $p \lesssim 2$\,bar. In all cases the habitability drops for
eccentricity $e \gtrsim 0.3$. Changes of rotation period and obliquity affect
the habitability through their impact on the equator-pole temperature
difference rather than on the mean global temperature. We calculated the

yield habitability-weighted lifetimes $\gtrsim 2$\,Gyr, sufficiently long to
develop atmospheric biosignatures still detectable at the present time.

framework for video captioning. However, most existing decoders apply the
attention mechanism to every generated word including both visual words (e.g.,
""gun"" and ""shooting"") and non-visual words (e.g. ""the"", ""a""). However, these
non-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without
considering visual signals or attention. Imposing attention mechanism on

proposed framework utilizes the temporal attention for selecting specific

for deciding whether to depend on the visual information or the language
context information. Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously
consider both low-level visual information and high-level language context
information to support the video caption generation. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed framework, we test our method on two prevalent

outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both two datasets.

The ensemble is dense enough for the usual condition for homogenization, viz.

scattered powers, we define two criteria to define the homogenization regime.
We find that when the excitation field is tuned in a broad frequency range
around the resonance, none of the criteria for homogenization is fulfilled,
meaning that the condition $\rho\lambda^3\gg 1$ is not sufficient to
characterize the homogenized regime around the atomic resonance. We interpret
these results as a consequence of the light-induced dipole-dipole interactions
between the atoms, which implies a description of scattering in terms of
collective modes rather than as a sequence of individual scattering events.
Finally, we show that, although homogenization can never be reached for a dense
ensemble of randomly positioned laser-cooled atoms around resonance, it becomes
possible if one introduces spatial correlations in the positions of the atoms
or non-radiative losses, such as would be the case for organic molecules or
quantum dots coupled to a phonon bath.

minimizing the distance between the corresponding images and texts in the

key observation is that modeling the pairwise image-image relationship improves
the discrimination ability of the embedding model. In this paper, we propose
the structured discriminative and difference constraints to learn
visual-semantic embeddings. First, we exploit the discriminative constraints to
capture the intra- and inter-class relationships of image embeddings. The
discriminative constraints encourage separability for image instances of
different classes. Second, we align the difference vector between a pair of
image embeddings with that of the corresponding word embeddings. The difference
constraints help regularize image embeddings to preserve the semantic
relationships among word embeddings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed structured embeddings for single-label
classification, multi-label classification, and zero-shot recognition.

established, prior to shoulder formation, and the stochastic model is shown to
be capable of simultaneously matching the time averaged profile measurement as
well as the PDF shape and autocorrelation function from the ion-saturation
current time series at the outer wall. Aspects of the stochastic model are then
varied with the aim of producing a profile shoulder with statistical
measurements consistent with experiment. This is achieved through a strong
localised reduction in the density sink acting on the filaments within the
model. The required reduction of the density sink occurs over a highly
localised region with the timescale of the density sink increased by a factor
of 25. This alone is found to be insufficient to model the expansion and
flattening of the shoulder region as the density increases, which requires
additional changes within the stochastic model. An example is found which
includes both a reduction in the density sink and filament acceleration and
provides a consistent match to the experimental data as the shoulder expands,
though the uniqueness of this solution can not be guaranteed. Within the
context of the stochastic model, this implies that the localised reduction in
the density sink can trigger shoulder formation, but additional physics is

will cover 2pi steradians over the southern sky, and obtain optical spectra for
about two million galaxies out to z<0.4. Taipan will use the newly-refurbished
1.2m UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN
instrument, which includes an innovative 'Starbugs' positioning system capable
of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres (and up
to 300 with a proposed upgrade) over the 6-deg diameter focal plane, and a
purpose-built spectrograph operating from 370 to 870nm with resolving power
R>2000. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure the distance
scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H_0) to
1% precision, and the structure growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make
the most extensive map yet constructed of the mass distribution and motions in
the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved Fundamental
Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics;
and (iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique
laboratory for studying galaxy evolution as a function of mass and environment.
The final survey, which will be completed within 5 years, will consist of a
complete magnitude-limited sample (i<17) of about 1.2x10^6 galaxies,
supplemented by an extension to higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes
(i<18.1) of a luminous red galaxy sample of about 0.8x10^6 galaxies.
Observations and data processing will be carried out remotely and in a
fully-automated way, using a purpose-built automated 'virtual observer'
software and an automated data reduction pipeline. The Taipan survey is
deliberately designed to maximise its legacy value, by complementing and
enhancing current and planned surveys of the southern sky at wavelengths from
the optical to the radio.

However, research on creative exploration is limited by a lack of
high-resolution automated paradigms. To address this, we present such an
automated paradigm, the creative foraging game, in which people search for
novel and valuable solutions in a large and well-defined space made of all
possible shapes made of ten connected squares. Players discovered shape
categories such as digits, letters, and airplanes. They exploited each
category, then dropped it to explore once again, and so on. Aligned with a
prediction of optimal foraging theory (OFT) prediction, during exploration
phases, people moved along meandering paths that are about three times longer
than the minimal paths between shapes, when exploiting a category of related
shapes, they moved along the minimal paths. The moment of discovery of a new
category was usually done at a nonprototypical and ambiguous shape, which can
serve as an experimental proxy for creative leaps. People showed individual
differences in their search patterns, along a continuum between two strategies:
a mercurial quick-to-discover/quick-to-drop strategy and a thorough
slow-to-discover/slow-to-drop strategy. Contrary to optimal foraging theory,
players leave exploitation to explore again far before categories are depleted.
This paradigm opens the way for automated high-resolution study of creative
exploration.

the objective is to produce provably correct random samples from a particular
quantum mechanical distribution. The computational framework was proposed by
Aaronson and Arkhipov in 2011 as an attainable demonstration of `quantum
supremacy', that is a practical quantum computing experiment able to produce
output at a speed beyond the reach of classical (that is non-quantum) computer
hardware. Since its introduction Boson Sampling has been the subject of intense
international research in the world of quantum computing. On the face of it,
the problem is challenging for classical computation. Aaronson and Arkhipov
show that exact Boson Sampling is not efficiently solvable by a classical
computer unless $P^{\#P} = BPP^{NP}$ and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to
the third level.
  The fastest known exact classical algorithm for the standard Boson Sampling
problem takes $O({m + n -1 \choose n} n 2^n )$ time to produce samples for a
system with input size $n$ and $m$ output modes, making it infeasible for
anything but the smallest values of $n$ and $m$. We give an algorithm that is
much faster, running in $O(n 2^n + \operatorname{poly}(m,n))$ time and $O(m)$
additional space. The algorithm is simple to implement and has low constant
factor overheads. As a consequence our classical algorithm is able to solve the
exact Boson Sampling problem for system sizes far beyond current photonic
quantum computing experimentation, thereby significantly reducing the

for synthesis of quasi-spherical, ultra-small, stable, and monodispersed copper
oxide QDs (r<2 nm) based on digestive ripening (DR). It may be noted this is
only the second transition metal oxide system in which DR is reported so far.
DR involves the refluxing of polydispersed colloidal nanoparticles in the
presence of surface active agents (e.g. triethanolamine (TEA)) that leads to
fairly monodispersed nanoparticles. It has been noticed that capping with TEA
results in reduction in the average particle diameter from 6 +/- 4 nm to 2.4
+/- 0.5 nm and an increase of zeta potential ({\xi}) from +12 +/- 2 mV to +31
+/- 2 mV. These copper oxide QDs are monodispersed (size ~ 2.4 +/- 0.5 nm), and
stable (>1 year). In addition, these quantum dots show an anomalous increase in
band gap (5.3 eV), inexplicable using Brus' equation. XPS indicates that Cu
exists in mixed valence state in this material. Based on our observations, we
suggest that off-stoichiometry in copper oxide, which is seemingly substantial
at these length scales, is responsible for the observed anomaly in band gap.

overview of the four MACS SNAPshot surveys conducted from Cycle 14 to Cycle 20
as part of a long-term effort aimed at identifying exceptional cluster targets
for in-depth follow up by the extragalactic community. We also release
redshifts and X-ray luminosities of all clusters observed as part of this
initiative. To illustrate the power of SNAPshot observations of MACS clusters,
we explore several aspects of galaxy evolution illuminated by the images
obtained for these programmes. We confirm the high lensing efficiency of X-ray
selected clusters at $z>0.3$. Examining the evolution of the slope of the
cluster red sequence, we observe at best a slight decrease with redshift,
indicating minimal age contribution since $z\sim 1$. Congruent to previous
studies' findings, we note that the two BCGs which are significantly bluer
($\geq 5\sigma$) than their clusters' red sequences reside in relaxed clusters
and exhibit pronounced internal structure. Thanks to our targets' high X-ray
luminosity, the subset of our sample observed with Chandra adds valuable
leverage to the X-ray luminosity--optical richness relation, which, albeit with
substantial scatter, is now clearly established from groups to extremely
massive clusters of galaxies. We conclude that SNAPshot observations of MACS
clusters stand to continue to play a vital pathfinder role for astrophysical
investigations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

  1.1",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study boundedness questions for (simply-connected) smooth
Calabi-Yau threefolds. The diffeomorphism class of such a threefold is known to
be determined up to finitely many possibilities by the integral middle
cohomology and two integral forms on the integral second cohomology, namely the
cubic cup-product form and the linear form given by cup-product with the second
Chern class. The motivating question for this paper is whether knowledge of
these cubic and linear forms determines the threefold up to finitely many
families, that is the moduli of such threefolds is bounded. If this is true,
then in particular the middle integral cohomology would be bounded by knowledge
of these two forms on the second cohomology. Crucial to this question is the
study of rigid rational surfaces on the threefold, which are the irreducible
surfaces for which no multiple moves and which do not disappear under a general
deformation of the complex structure of the threefold. If for instance there
are no such surfaces, then the answer to the motivating question is yes
(Theorem 0.1). In particular, for given cubic and linear forms on the second
cohomology, there must exist such surfaces for large enough third Betti number
(Corollary 0.2). The paper starts by proving general results on these rigid
rational surfaces and boundedness of the family of threefolds. The basic
principle is that if the cohomology classes of these surfaces are also known,
then boundedness should hold (Theorem 4.5). The second half of the paper
restricts to the case of Picard number 2, where it is shown that knowledge of
the cubic and linear forms does indeed bound the family of Calabi-Yau
threefolds (Theorem 0.3). As far as the author is aware, this is the first
non-trivial case where a general boundedness result for Calabi-Yau threefolds
has been proved (without the assumption of a special structure).

different conditions, identifying three main regimes: First, when both the
superconducting wires of the Josephson junction lie in the topologically

applied DC voltage. Second, when one superconducting wire lies in the trivial
region and the other one lies in the non-trivial region, the Josephson current
is $2\pi$ periodic but unstable with the evolving of time. Third, when both

seems to avoid the superconducting or insulating fate of standard
two-dimensional electron systems. Some experiments also find a marked tendency
to a negative electronic compressibility. We suggest that this indicates an
inclination for electronic phase separation resulting in a nanoscopic inhomo-
geneity. Although the mild modulation of the inhomogeneous landscape is
compatible with a high electron mobility in the metallic state, this
intrinsically inhomogeneous character is highlighted by the peculiar behaviour
of the metal-to-superconductor transition. Modelling the system with super-
conducting puddles embedded in a metallic matrix, we fit the peculiar
resistance vs. temperature curves of systems like TiSe2, MoS2, and ZrNCl. In
this framework also the low-temperature debated metallic state finds a natural
explanation in terms of the pristine metallic background embedding
non-percolating superconducting clusters. An intrinsically inhomogeneous
character naturally raises the question of the formation mechanism(s). We
propose a mechanism based on the interplay be- tween electrons and the charges

stars as Keplerian motion. Both stars have masses close to Solar (1.11 and
1.14), very low metallicities ([Fe/H]=-0.50 and -0.71), and, both have Jupiter
planetary mass companions (m sin i=7 and 6.4 Mj), in close to terrestrial
orbits (1.4 and 1.3~au), with moderate eccentricities (e=0.34 and 0.2).
However, we cannot totally exclude that the signal in the case of HD~103485 is
due to rotational modulation of active regions. Based on the current data, we
conclude that BD+03 2562 has a bona fide planetary companion while for HD
103485 we cannot totally exclude that the best explanation for the RV signal
modulations is not the existence of a planet but stellar activity. If, the
interpretation remains that both stars have planetary companions they represent
systems orbiting very evolved stars with very low metallicities, a challenge to

performance of program synthesis from input-output examples. Albeit its
significant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art
approaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move
a significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of
challenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output
examples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their
parse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than
previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is
almost 0%.
  We tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by
three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep
learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a
non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space.
Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific
non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve
generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our
non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn
how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the
model effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold
boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search
algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our
novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test
accuracy on test inputs that are 500x longer than the training samples.

the distribution of fluctuations of the diffusion exponent characterizing them
takes the Gaussian form, which is, quite remarkably, the same form for two
different types of the virus. This suggests high robustness of such

nanoparticle suspension upon a heterogeneous surface. The model consists of a
generalised lattice-gas in which the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian
can be varied to model different properties of the materials involved. We show
how to choose correctly the interactions, to minimise the effects of the
underlying grid so that hemispherical droplets form. We also include the
effects of surface roughness to examine the effects of contact-line pinning on
the dynamics. When there is a `lid' above the system, which prevents
evaporation, equilibrium drops form on the surface, which we use to determine
the contact angle and how it varies as the parameters of the model are changed.
This enables us to relate the interaction parameters to the materials used in
applications. The model has also been applied to drying on heterogeneous
surfaces, in particular to the case where the suspension is deposited on a
surface consisting of a pair of hydrophilic conducting metal surfaces that are
either side of a band of hydrophobic insulating polymer. This situation occurs
when using inkjet printing to manufacture electrical connections between the
metallic parts of the surface. The process is not always without problems,
since the liquid can dewet from the hydrophobic part of the surface, breaking
the bridge before the drying process is complete. The MC model reproduces the
observed dewetting, allowing the parameters to be varied so that the conditions
for the best connection can be established. We show that if the hydrophobic
portion of the surface is located at a step below the height of the
neighbouring metal, the chance of dewetting of the liquid during the drying
process is significantly reduced.

uncertainty in a calculation of the solar neutrino flux is due to the effects
of the magnetic fields on the absorption rate of charged cosmic rays. We use

independent and identically distributed normal outcomes, in which interim
analyses of the sum of the outcomes are performed. Based on a prescribed
stopping rule, one decides after each interim analysis whether the trial is
stopped or continued. Consequently, the actual length of the study is a random
variable. It is reported in the literature that the interim analyses may cause
bias if one uses the ordinary sample mean to estimate the location parameter.
For a generic stopping rule, which contains many classical stopping rules as a
special case, explicit formulas for the expected length of the trial, the bias,
and the mean squared error (MSE) are provided. It is deduced that, for a fixed
number of interim analyses, the bias and the MSE converge to zero if the first
interim analysis is performed not too early. In addition, optimal rates for
this convergence are provided. Furthermore, under a regularity condition,
asymptotic normality in total variation distance for the sample mean is
established. A conclusion for naive confidence intervals based on the sample
mean is derived. It is also shown how the developed theory naturally fits in
the broader framework of likelihood theory in a group sequential trial setting.
A simulation study underpins the theoretical findings.

described in such a universe, and we find that the detection of a redshifted

Thus, measuring the redshift of the photon is equivalent to a weak measurement
of the underlying cosmology. We also consider a potential optomechanical
analogy system that would enable experimental exploration of these concepts.
The analogy focuses on the effects of photon redshift measurement as a quantum
back-action on metric variables, where the position of a movable mirror plays
the role of the scale factor. By working in the rotating frame, an effective

gamma-ray burst (GRB) event. In this work we revisit the dissipative
photospheric scenario, in which the GRB prompt emission is produced around the
photospheric radius. Meanwhile, possible dissipation mechanisms (e.g., internal
shocks or magnetic reconnection) could accelerate cosmic-rays (CRs) to
ultra-high energies and then produce neutrinos via hadronuclear and
photohadronic processes, which are referred to as prompt neutrinos. In this
paper, we obtain the prompt neutrino spectrum of a single GRB within a
self-consistent analytical framework, in which the jet-cocoon structure and
possible collimation effects are included. We investigate a possible neutrino
signal from the cocoon, which has been ignored in the previous studies. We show
that if a GRB event happens at a distance of the order of Mpc, there is a great
chance to observe the neutrino emission from the cocoon by IceCube, which is
even more promising than jet neutrinos since the opening angle of the cocoon is
much larger. We also figure out the diffuse neutrino flux of GRB cocoons and
find that it could be comparable with that of the jets. Our results are
consistent with the latest result reported by the IceCube collaboration that no
significant correlation between neutrino events and observed GRBs is seen in
the new data (Aartsen et al. 2017).

some cases, integrals of this type can be mapped to complete elliptic integrals
at rational argument. This class of functions appears to be the next one
arising in the calculation of more complicated Feynman integrals following the
harmonic polylogarithms, generalized polylogarithms, cyclotomic harmonic
polylogarithms, square-root valued iterated integrals, and combinations
thereof, which appear in simpler cases. The inhomogeneous solution of the
corresponding differential equations can be given in terms of iterative
integrals, where the new innermost letter itself is not an iterative integral.
A new class of iterative integrals is introduced containing letters in which
(multiple) definite integrals appear as factors. For the elliptic case, we also
derive the solution in terms of integrals over modular functions and also
modular forms, using $q$-product and series representations implied by Jacobi's
$\vartheta_i$ functions and Dedekind's $\eta$-function. The corresponding
representations can be traced back to polynomials out of Lambert--Eisenstein
series, having representations also as elliptic polylogarithms, a $q$-factorial
$1/\eta^k(\tau)$, logarithms and polylogarithms of $q$ and their $q$-integrals.
Due to the specific form of the physical variable $x(q)$ for different
processes, different representations do usually appear. Numerical results are
also presented.

saturation point by a comparison with experimental elliptic flow ratios
measured by the FOPI-LAND and ASYEOS collaborations in $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au
collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon impact energy. A previous calculation has proven
that neutron-to-proton and neutron-to-charged particles elliptic flow ratios
probe on average different densities allowing in principle the extraction of
both the slope $L$ and curvature $K_{sym}$ parameters of the symmetry energy.
Consequently a Gogny interaction inspired potential has been modified to allow
independent changes of $L$ and $K_{sym}$. Comparing theoretical predictions
with experimental data for neutron-to-proton and neutron-to-charged particles
elliptic flow ratios the following constraints have been extracted:
$L$=85$\pm$22(exp)$\pm$20(th)$\pm$12(sys) MeV and
$K_{sym}$=96$\pm$315(exp)$\pm$170(th)$\pm$166(sys) MeV. Residual model
dependence is accounted for in the magnitude of the quoted theoretical error.
Systematical uncertainties are generated by the inability of the transport
model to reproduce experimental light-cluster-to-proton multiplicity ratios. A
value for $L$, free of systematical theoretical uncertainties, can be extracted
from the neutron-to-proton elliptic flow ratio alone:
$L$=84$\pm$30(exp)$\pm$19(th) MeV. It has also been demonstrated that elliptic
flow ratios reach a maximum sensitivity on the $K_{sym}$ parameter in heavy-ion

experimental component of uncertainty to about 150 MeV for this parameter.

by combining the subconnected phase shifter network with a fully-connected

major obstacle towards this goal which may be overcome by Dynamic Nuclear Spin
Polarization (DNP) methods. The latter often rely on the transfer of the
thermally polarized electron spins to nearby nuclear spins, which is limited by
the Boltzmann distribution of the former. Here we demonstrate the polarization
and read out of a nuclear spin bath consisting of $^{13}$C nuclear spins in
diamond by using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Our method utilizes
microwave dressed states to transfer the NV's high ($>$~92~\%) non-equilibrium

carbon nuclear spins, where the NV is repeatedly repolarized optically, thus
providing an effectively infinite polarization reservoir. A saturation of the
polarization in the nuclear ""frozen core"" is achieved, which is confirmed by
the decay of the polarization transfer signal and shows an excellent agreement
with theoretical simulations. Hereby we introduce the Polarization Read Out by

effect both for single and double quantum transitions a nuclear spin
polarization can be achieved even when the static magnetic field is not aligned

substantial simplification is achieved by introduction of null vectors. Two
variable polynomials corresponding to different R-symmetry representations are
constructed. The Ward identities for superconformal symmetry are obtained as
simple differential equations. The general solution is presented in terms of a
constant, a single variable function and a two variable function. An
interpretation in terms of the operator product expansion is given for the case
of fields of equal dimension and for the so called (next-to)extremal cases. The
result is shown to accommodate long multiplets, semishort and short multiplets
with protected dimension. Generically also non-unitary multiplets can appear.
It is shown how to remove them to obtain a unitary theory. Implications of
crossing symmetry for the four point functions studied are derived and
discussed. It is shown that crossing symmetry fixes the single variable
function in the general solution to be of free field form using singularity
arguments. For a restricted set of next-to-extremal correlation functions with
S3 symmetry amongst the first three fields it is shown that the amplitude is
fixed up to normalization to free field form. We compute the conformal partial

value of the anomalous dimensions for long multiplets given spin and twist in

Recent papers stated that the echo state networks maximize their computational
performance on the transition between order and chaos, the so-called edge of
chaos. This work confirms this statement in a comprehensive set of experiments.
Furthermore, the echo state networks are compared to networks evolved via
neuroevolution. The evolved networks outperform the echo state networks,
however, the evolution consumes significant computational resources. It is
demonstrated that echo state networks with local connections combine the best
of both worlds, the simplicity of random echo state networks and the
performance of evolved networks. Finally, it is shown that evolution tends to
stay close to the ordered side of the edge of chaos.

independent intrinsic geometric structures, due to the peptide planes and the
side chains. Here we adapt and develop modern 3D virtual reality techniques to
scrutinize the atomic geometry along a protein backbone, in the vicinity of a
peptide plane. For this we compare backbone geometry-based (extrinsic) and
structure-based (intrinsic) coordinate systems, and as an example we inspect
the trans and cis peptide planes. We reveal systematics in the way how a cis
peptide plane deforms the neighbouring atomic geometry, and we develop a
virtual reality based visual methodology that can identify the presence of a
cis peptide plane from the arrangement of atoms in its vicinity. Our approach
can easily detect exceptionally placed atoms in crystallographic structures.
Thus it can be employed as a powerful visual refinement tool which is
applicable also in the case when resolution of the protein structure is limited
and whenever refinement is needed. As concrete examples we identify a number of
crystallographic protein structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) that display
exceptional atomic positions around their cis peptide planes.

this event is a third ribbon (R3) arising in the decay phase, propagating along
a dimming channel (seen in EUV passbands) towards a neighboring sunspot. The
propagation of R3 occurs in the presence of hard X-ray footpoint emission, and

configuration and the thermal structure of the flaring region. Our results are
in favor of a slipping-type reconnection followed by the thermodynamic
evolution of coronal loops. In comparison with those previously reported
slipping reconnection events, this one proceeds across a particularly long
distance ($\sim$60 Mm) over a long period of time ($\sim$50 min), and shows two

phenomenon which, so far, we only managed to understand in a few highly
specialized cases: the family of functions $f_N:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq
0}$ $$ f_N(x) = \sum_{k \leq N}{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_k}}
\frac{|\phi_k(x)|}{\|\phi_k\|_{L^{\infty}(M)}}}$$ seems strangely suited for
the detection of anomalous points on the manifold. It may be heuristically
interpreted as the sum over distances to the nearest nodal line and potentially
hints at a new phenomenon in spectral geometry. We give rigorous statements on
the unit square $[0,1]^2$ (where minima localize in $\mathbb{Q}^2$) and on
Paley graphs (where $f_N$ recovers the geometry of quadratic residues of the
underlying finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$). Numerical examples show that the
phenomenon seems to arise on fairly generic manifolds.

  We phrase the conjecture in terms of the notions (which we define here) of
synchronization and separation for association schemes. These definitions are
based on those for permutation groups which grow out of the theory of
synchronization in finite automata. In this theory, two classes of permutation
groups (called \emph{synchronizing} and \emph{separating}) lying between
primitive and $2$-homogeneous are defined. A big open question is how the
permutation group induced by $S_n$ on $k$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ fits in
this hierarchy; our conjecture would give a solution to this problem for $n$
large in terms of $k$. We prove the conjecture in the case $k=4$: our result
asserts that $S_n$ acting on $4$-sets is separating for $n\ge10$ (it fails to
be synchronizing for $n=9$).

suggesting that formic acid is mostly formed at the surface of interstellar
grains and then evaporated. The detection of multiple transitions for each
species allows us to constrain their abundances through LTE and non-LTE
methods. All the considered COMs show similar abundances between $\sim 1$ and
$\sim 10$ % relative to methanol depending on the assumed excitation
temperature. The non-detection of glycolaldehyde, an isomer of methyl formate,
with a [glycolaldehyde]/[methyl formate] abundance ratio lower than 6 %,
favours gas phase formation pathways triggered by methanol evaporation.
According to their excitation temperatures derived in massive hot cores, formic
acid, ketene, and acetaldehyde have been designated as ""lukewarm"" COMs whereas
methyl formate and di-methyl ether were defined as ""warm"" species. Comparison
with previous observations of other types of sources confirms that ""lukewarm""

common in these objects, are a crucial source of feedback energy driving mass
outflows into the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium. This paper reports
the first direct measurement of powerful mass outflows traced by the forbidden
high ionization gas in the low luminosity AGN NGC1386 at scales of a few
parsecs from the central engine. The high angular resolution of the data allows
us to directly measure the location, morphology and kinematic of the outflow.
This the form of two symmetrical expanding hot gas shells moving in opposite
directions along the line of sight. The co-spatiality of the gas shells with
radio emission seen at the same parsec scales and with X-rays indicates that
this is a shock-driven outflow induced by an incipient core-jet. With a minimum
number of assumptions, we derive a mass outflow rate of 11 solar masses/yr,
comparable to those of powerful AGN. The result has strong implications in the
global accounting of feedback mass and energy driven by a low-luminosity AGN

termed the ""bus-branch"" model, with network electrical behavior summarized in
the Ybus admittance matrix. From a circuit perspective, this admittance
representation restricts network elements to be voltage controlled and
limitations of the Ybus have long been recognized. A fixed Ybus is unable to
represent an ideal circuit breaker, and more subtle limitations appear in
transformer modeling. In power systems parlance, more detailed approaches to
overcome these limitations are termed ""node-breaker"" representations, but these
are often cumbersome, and are not widely utilized in OPF. This paper develops a
general network representation adapted to the needs of OPF, based on the Sparse
Tableau Formulation (STF) with following advantages for OPF: (i) conceptual
clarity in formulating constraints, allowing a comprehensive set of network
electrical variables; (ii) improved fidelity in capturing physical behavior and
engineering limits; (iii) added flexibility in optimization solution, in that
elimination of intermediate variables is left to the optimization algorithm.
The STF is then applied to OPF numerical case studies which demonstrate that
the STF shows little or no penalty in computational speed compared to classic
OPF representations, and sometimes provides considerable advantage in
computational speed.

(Multi-Input Multi-Output) communication systems by using spherical mode
expansion. Given spatial channel properties of a MIMO channel, such as the
angular profile at both sides, the optimal MIMO antennas should provide the
largest channel capacity with a constraint of the limited implementation space
(volume). In designing a conventional MIMO antenna, first the antenna structure
(current distribution) is determined, second antenna directivity is calculated
based on the current distribution, and thirdly MIMO channel capacity is
calculated by using given angular profiles and obtained antenna directivity.
This process is repeated by adjusting the antenna structure until the
performance satisfies a predefined threshold. To the contrary, this paper
solves the optimization problem analytically and finally gives near optimal
antenna structure (current distribution) without any greedy search. In the
proposed process, first the optimal directivity of MIMO antennas is derived by
applying spherical mode expansion to the angular profiles, and second a
far-near field conversion is applied on the derived optimal directivity to
achieve near optimal current distributions on a limited surface. The
effectiveness of the proposed design methodology is validated via numerical
calculation of MIMO channel capacity as in the conventional design method while
giving near optimal current distribution with constraint of an antenna
structure derived from proposed methodology.

system with a low mass stellar companion. The interaction of the pulsar wind
with the companion star wind and/or the interstellar plasma is expected to
create plausible conditions for acceleration of electrons to TeV energies and
subsequent production of very high energy {\gamma} rays in the inverse Compton
process. We performed extensive observations with the MAGIC telescopes of
B1957+20. We interpret results in the framework of a few different models,
namely emission from the vicinity of the millisecond pulsar, the interaction of
the pulsar and stellar companion wind region, or bow shock nebula. No
significant steady very high energy {\gamma}-ray emission was found. We derived
a 95% confidence level upper limit of 3.0 x 10 -12 cm -2 s -1 on the average
{\gamma}-ray emission from the binary system above 200 GeV. The upper limits
obtained with MAGIC constrain, for the first time, different models of the
high-energy emission in B1957+20. In particular, in the inner mixed wind nebula
model with mono-energetic injection of electrons, the acceleration efficiency
of electrons is constrained to be below ~(2-10)% of the pulsar spin down power.
For the pulsar emission, the obtained upper limits for each emission peak are
well above the exponential cut-off fits to the Fermi-LAT data, extrapolated to
energies above 50 GeV. The MAGIC upper limits can rule out a simple power-law
tail extension through the sub-TeV energy range for the main peak seen at radio
frequencies.

compute these coefficients from optimally short molecular dynamics simulations,
based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and the cepstral analysis of
time series. Information from the full sample power spectrum of the relevant
current for a single and relatively short trajectory is leveraged to evaluate
and optimally reduce the noise affecting its zero-frequency value, whose
expectation is proportional to the corresponding conductivity. Our method is
unbiased and consistent, in that both the resulting bias and statistical error
can be made arbitrarily small in the long-time limit. A simple data-analysis
protocol is proposed and validated with the calculation of thermal
conductivities in the paradigmatic cases of elemental and molecular fluids
(liquid Ar and H$_2$O) and of crystalline and glassy solids (MgO and

inspired model for stochastic spiking neural networks. We focus on tradeoffs
between computation time and network complexity, along with the role of
randomness in efficient neural computation.
  It is widely accepted that neural computation is inherently stochastic. In
recent work, we explored how this stochasticity could be leveraged to solve the
`winner-take-all' leader election task. Here, we focus on using randomness in
neural algorithms for similarity testing and compression. In the most basic
setting, given two $n$-length patterns of firing neurons, we wish to
distinguish if the patterns are equal or $\epsilon$-far from equal.
  Randomization allows us to solve this task with a very compact network, using
$O \left (\frac{\sqrt{n}\log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ auxiliary neurons, which is
sublinear in the input size. At the heart of our solution is the design of a
$t$-round neural random access memory, or indexing network, which we call a
neuro-RAM. This module can be implemented with $O(n/t)$ auxiliary neurons and
is useful in many applications beyond similarity testing.
  Using a VC dimension-based argument, we show that the tradeoff between
runtime and network size in our neuro-RAM is nearly optimal. Our result has
several implications -- since our neuro-RAM can be implemented with
deterministic threshold gates, it shows that, in contrast to similarity
testing, randomness does not provide significant computational advantages for
this problem. It also establishes a separation between feedforward networks
whose gates spike with sigmoidal probability functions, and well-studied
deterministic sigmoidal networks, whose gates output real number sigmoidal
values, and which can implement a neuro-RAM much more efficiently.

formed from pairs of stars born together are more likely to have spins
preferentially aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. We consider

description with metric brackets for describing systems with both Hamiltonian

represented in this framework. In this paper we present an application of the
metriplectic formalism of interest for the theory of control: a suitable torque
is applied to a free rigid body, which is expressed through a metriplectic

to drive the body to align its angular velocity to rotation about a stable

On theoretical grounds, this example shows how the non-Hamiltonian part of a
metriplectic system may include convergence to a limit cycle, the first example
of a non-zero dimensional attractor in this formalism. The method suggests a
way to extend metriplectic dynamics to systems with general attractors, e.g.
chaotic ones, with the hope of representing bio-physical, geophysical and

frequently encounters the situations that a printed circuit or track needs to
be corrected or the unwanted parts of the device should be removed as desired.
However, few appropriate strategies are currently available to tackle such
important issues at this stage. Here we have identified several low cost ways
toward this goal by comparatively investigating three typical strategies
spanning from mechanical, chemical, to electrochemical principles, for removing
the gallium-based liquid metal circuits or thin films. Regarding the mechanical
approach, we constructed an eraser for removing the liquid metal thin films. It
was shown that ethanol (CH3CH2OH) could serve as a good candidacy material for
the mechanical eraser. In the chemical category, we adopted alkalis and acids
to remove the finely printed liquid metal circuits and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
solution was particularly revealed to be rather efficient in making a chemical
eraser. In the electrochemical strategy, we applied a 15 V voltage to a liquid
metal thin film (covered with water) and successfully removed the target metal
part. These methods were comparatively evaluated with each of the merits and
shortcomings preliminarily clarified in the end. The present work is expected
to be important for the increasing applications of the liquid metal enabled

structure of their niche has profound repercussions by both selecting their

cues and stimuli. Adaptive, collective behaviour underpinned by specialized
optimization strategies is ubiquitously found in the natural world. This
exceptional success originates from the processes of fitness and selection.
Here we prove that a universal physical mechanism of a nonequilibrium
transition underlies the collective organization of information-processing
organisms. As cognitive agents build and update an internal, cognitive
representation of the causal structure of their environment, complex patterns
emerge in the system, where the onset of pattern formation relates to the
spatial overlap of cognitive maps. Studying the exchange of information among
the agents reveals a continuous, order-disorder transition. As a result of the
spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry, a Goldstone mode emerges, which
points at a collective mechanism of information transfer among cognitive
organisms. Taken together, the characteristics of this phase transition
consolidate different results in cognitive and biological sciences in a
universal manner. These finding are generally applicable to the design of

our approach is again the closedness theorem that the projections $K^{n} \times

of resolution of singularities in much the same way as over locally compact
ground fields. As before, the proof of that theorem uses i.a. the local
behavior of definable functions of one variable and fiber shrinking, being a
relaxed version of curve selection. But now, to achieve the former result, we
first examine functions given by algebraic power series. All our previous
results will be established here in the general settings: several versions of
curve selection (via resolution of singularities) and of the \L{}ojasiewicz
inequality (via two instances of quantifier elimination indicated below),
extending continuous hereditarily rational functions as well as the theory of
regulous functions, sets and sheaves, including Nullstellensatz and Cartan's
theorems A and B. Two basic tools applied in this paper are quantifier
elimination for Henselian valued fields due to Pas and relative quantifier
elimination for ordered abelian groups (in a many-sorted language with
imaginary auxiliary sorts) due to Cluckers--Halupczok. Other, new applications
of the closedness theorem are piecewise continuity of definable functions,
H\""{o}lder continuity of definable functions on closed bounded subsets of
$K^{n}$, the existence of definable retractions onto closed definable subsets
of $K^{n}$, and a definable, non-Archimedean version of the Tietze--Urysohn

interact and influence each other. The coupling functions that connect them
contain detailed information about the functional mechanisms underlying the
interactions and prescribe the physical rule specifying how an interaction
occurs. Here, we aim to present a coherent and comprehensive review
encompassing the rapid progress made recently in the analysis, understanding
and applications of coupling functions. The basic concepts and characteristics
of coupling functions are presented through demonstrative examples of different
domains, revealing the mechanisms and emphasizing their multivariate nature.
The theory of coupling functions is discussed through gradually increasing
complexity from strong and weak interactions to globally-coupled systems and
networks. A variety of methods that have been developed for the detection and
reconstruction of coupling functions from measured data is described. These
methods are based on different statistical techniques for dynamical inference.
Stemming from physics, such methods are being applied in diverse areas of
science and technology, including chemistry, biology, physiology, neuroscience,
social sciences, mechanics and secure communications. This breadth of
application illustrates the universality of coupling functions for studying the
interaction mechanisms of coupled dynamical systems.

(PBR) have given an argument by which they claimed that the epistemic view on
the wavefunction should be ruled out. This study highlights an incorrect
conclusion in PBR's arguments, which was made due to inadequacies in the
definitions of OMF. To be precise, OMF models the ontology of the preparation
procedure, but it does not model the ontology of the measurement device. Such
an asymmetric treatment becomes problematic, in scenarios in which measurement
devices have a quantum nature. Modifying the OMF's definition such that the
ontology of the measurement device becomes included, we will see how PBR's
result disappears.

limited by a single-exciton motion along the antenna. Starting from the
many-body Schr\""odinger equation, we derived Lindblad-type Master equations
describing the cyclic exciton-electron dynamics of the light harvesting
complex, originated from charge reduction of a donor. These equations,
resembling the Master equations for the electric current in mesoscopic systems,
go beyond the single-exciton description by accounting for the multi-exciton
states accumulated in the antenna, as well as the charge-separation,
fluorescence and initial photo-absorption. Although these effects take place on
very different time-scales, we demonstrate that their inclusion is necessary
for a consistent description of the exciton dynamics. We applied our results to
evaluate the energy (exciton) current and for the fluorescent current depending
on the light-intensity.

ultrahigh sensitivity. Instead of using the direct absorption of terahertz
through a bare sample in the regular transmission scheme, a cavity mode
resonating at the characteristic frequency of the sample is used and due to the
high dependence of the cavity mode transmission on the material loss, an
amplified transmission decaying is observed when the sample is loaded into the
cavity. Furthermore, this scheme retains the feature of substance
identification. A one-dimensional photonic crystal cavity is used as the
example for the detection of {\alpha}-lactose and an efficient detection of 7nm
{\alpha}-lactose can be achieved, which corresponds to 1/80000 of the free
space wavelength at the characteristic frequency of 0.529THz, exhibiting
sensitivity 500 times higher than the regular method.

suspension over the conventional passive system focusing on ride quality
behavior and road holding. Therefore, a dynamic modeling of passive and
twin-accumulator suspension for a quarter model is constructed. MATLAB Simulink
environment is used to develop the suspension models. The simulation is applied
with two different road disturbances, namely, step input and random input to
disturb the suspension system. The optimum solution is obtained numerically by
utilizing a multi-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm and employing a
cost function that seeks to minimize the RMS value of the body acceleration,
the suspension displacement as well as the dynamic tire load. Moreover, in this
work, an active suspension system with PI controller is presented in order to
improve the suspension performance criteria. The simulation results of passive,
optimized twin accumulator suspension and active suspension consist of body
displacement, wheel deflection, vehicle body acceleration, suspension travel
and dynamic tire load are compared and analyzed. Results show that the
twin-accumulator suspension system gives worthwhile improvements in ride
behavior compared with the passive suspension. Finally, it can be observed that
the performance of body displacement and wheel displacement can be improved by
using the proposed PI controller.

certain point is proportional to a distance to this point. The proportionality
coefficient is the Hubble constant measured with 5% accuracy. It is used in

  In the present work we have determined a limit value of the global Hubble

imaging technique with both high resolution and wide field-of-view. In current
FP experimental setup, the dark-field images with high-angle illuminations are
easily submerged by stray light and background noise due to the low
signal-to-noise ratio, thus significantly degrading the reconstruction quality
and also imposing a major restriction on the synthetic numerical aperture (NA)
of the FP approach. To this end, an overall and systematic data preprocessing
scheme for noise removal from FP's raw dataset is provided, which involves
sampling analysis as well as underexposed/overexposed treatments, then followed
by the elimination of unknown stray light and suppression of inevitable
background noise, especially Gaussian noise and CCD dark current in our
experiments. The reported non-parametric scheme facilitates great enhancements
of the FP's performance, which has been demonstrated experimentally that the
benefits of noise removal by these methods far outweigh its defects of
concomitant signal loss. In addition, it could be flexibly cooperated with the
existing state-of-the-art algorithms, producing a stronger robustness of the FP
approach in various applications.
