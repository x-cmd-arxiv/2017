turns the Fierz ambiguity, inherent to approaches based on a bosonic decoupling
of local fermionic interactions, into a convergence criterion. It is based on
the approximation of the three-leg vertex by a coarse-grained vertex computed
by solving a self-consistently determined multi-site effective impurity model.
The computed self-energies are, by construction, continuous functions of
momentum. We show that, in three interaction and doping regimes of parameters
of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, self-energies obtained with clusters of
size four only are very close to numerically exact benchmark results. We show
that the Fierz parameter, which parametrizes the freedom in the
Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling, can be used as a quality control parameter. By
contrast, the $GW$+extended dynamical mean field theory approximation with four
cluster sites is shown to yield good results only in the weak-coupling regime
and for a particular decoupling. Finally, we show that the vertex has spatially
nonlocal components only at low Matsubara frequencies.

task in many economical and biological studies. Mendelian randomization, in
particular, uses genetic variants as instruments to estimate causal effects in
epidemiological studies. However, conventional instrumental variable methods
rely on some untestable assumptions, which may be violated in real problems. In
this paper, we adopt a Bayesian framework and build hierarchical models to
incorporate invalid effects of instruments. We introduce an empirical Bayes
estimator for which some of the instruments are invalid by utilizing a Gaussian
mixture prior. Theoretical performance and algorithm implementations are
provided and illustrated. The reliable performance of the proposed method is
demonstrated in various simulation settings and on real datasets concerning the
causal effects of HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol on type 2 diabetes.

as the Plateau borders and vertices inflate with liquid. So-called
""border-blocking"" models can explain some features of wet-foam coarsening based
on the presumption that the inflated borders totally block the gas flux,
however, this approximation dramatically fails in the wet/unjamming limit where
the bubbles become close-packed spheres and coarsening proceeds even though
there are no films. Here, we account for the ever-present border-crossing flux
by a new length scale defined by the average gradient of gas concentration
inside the borders. We compute that it is proportional to the geometric average
of film and border thicknesses, and we verify this scaling by numerical
solution of the diffusion equation. We similarly consider transport across
inflated vertices and surface Plateau borders in quasi-2d foams. And we show
how the $dA/dt=K_0(n-6)$ von~Neumann law is modified by the appearance of terms

in inkjet printing, coating, deposition of materials, medical diagnostics,

evaporation of pure liquids, liquids with dispersed particles, or even liquid
mixtures has intensively been studied over the last two decades, the
evaporation of ternary mixtures of liquids with different volatilities and
mutual solubilities has not yet been explored. Here we show that the
evaporation of such ternary mixtures can trigger a phase transition and the
nucleation of microdroplets of one of the components of the mixture. As model
system we pick a sessile Ouzo droplet (as known from daily life - a transparent
mixture of water, ethanol, and anise oil) and reveal and theoretically explain
its four life phases: In phase I, the spherical cap-shaped droplet remains
transparent, while the more volatile ethanol is evaporating, preferentially at
the rim of the drop due to the singularity there. This leads to a local ethanol
concentration reduction and correspondingly to oil droplet nucleation there.
This is the beginning of phase II, in which oil microdroplets quickly nucleate
in the whole drop, leading to its milky color which typifies the so-called
'Ouzo-effect'. Once all ethanol has evaporated, the drop, which now has a
characteristic non-spherical-cap shape, has become clear again, with a water
drop sitting on an oil-ring (phase III), finalizing the phase inversion.
Finally, in phase IV, also all water has evaporated, leaving behind a tiny
spherical cap-shaped oil drop.

instance determines a unique path through the optimal tree of predictors; the
final prediction aggregates the predictions of the predictors along this path.
We derive loss bounds for the final predictor in terms of the Rademacher
complexity of the base learners. We report the results of a number of
experiments on a variety of datasets, showing that our approach provides
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art machine learning

including changes in patterns of food demand, circulation and land use, the
next century will witness a major increase in the extent of paved roads built
worldwide. To model the effects of this increase, it is crucial to understand
whether possible self-organized patterns are inherent in the global road
network structure. Here, we use the largest updated database comprising all
major roads on Earth, together with global urban and cropland inventories, to
suggest that road length distributions within croplands are indistinguishable
from urban ones, once rescaled to account for the difference in mean road
length. Such similarity extends to road length distributions within urban or
agricultural domains of given area. We find two distinct regimes for the
scaling of the mean road length with the associated area, holding in general at
small and at large values of the latter. In suitably large urban and cropland
domains, we find that mean and total road lengths increase linearly with their
domain area, differently from earlier suggestions. Scaling regimes suggest that
simple and universal mechanisms regulate urban and cropland road expansion at
the global scale. As such, our findings bear implications for global road
infrastructure growth based on land-use change and for planning policies
sustaining urban expansions.

Even though Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are most often used in training
and deploying CNNs, their power efficiency is less than 10 GOp/s/W for
single-frame runtime inference. We propose a flexible and efficient CNN
accelerator architecture called NullHop that implements SOA CNNs useful for
low-power and low-latency application scenarios. NullHop exploits the sparsity
of neuron activations in CNNs to accelerate the computation and reduce memory
requirements. The flexible architecture allows high utilization of available
computing resources across kernel sizes ranging from 1x1 to 7x7. NullHop can
process up to 128 input and 128 output feature maps per layer in a single pass.
We implemented the proposed architecture on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA platform and
present results showing how our implementation reduces external memory
transfers and compute time in five different CNNs ranging from small ones up to
the widely known large VGG16 and VGG19 CNNs. Post-synthesis simulations using
Mentor Modelsim in a 28nm process with a clock frequency of 500 MHz show that
the VGG19 network achieves over 450 GOp/s. By exploiting sparsity, NullHop
achieves an efficiency of 368%, maintains over 98% utilization of the MAC
units, and achieves a power efficiency of over 3TOp/s/W in a core area of
6.3mm$^2$. As further proof of NullHop's usability, we interfaced its FPGA
implementation with a neuromorphic event camera for real time interactive
demonstrations.

This paper is superceded by arXiv:1803.00174v2",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Milne-like spacetimes are a class of FLRW models which admit $C^0$ spacetime
extensions through the big bang. The boundary of a Milne-like spacetime can be
identified with a null cone in the extension. We find that the comoving
observers all emanate from a single point in the extension. This suggests that
something physical may have happened there. Next we ask what role these
spacetimes have in modern cosmology. We find that Milne-like spacetimes are
inconsistent with classical cosmology theory in which a radiation-dominated era
follows immediately after the big bang. However, Milne-like spacetimes are
consistent with inflationary theory. In fact the very nature of Milne-like
spacetimes solves the horizon problem. We note that this has already been
observed for the Milne universe in [2] and [25]. Next we show, assuming a
finite initial condition on the energy density, that Milne-like spacetimes
naturally exhibit a slow-roll inflationary era. This makes Milne-like
spacetimes good models for inflationary theory. We also show that Milne-like
spacetimes still admit $C^0$ extensions under well-behaved perturbations.

the i.i.d. assumption, starting from first principles. While the traditional
approach to statistical learning theory typically relies on standard
assumptions from probability theory (e.g., i.i.d. or stationary ergodic), in
this work we are interested in developing a theory of learning based only on
the most fundamental and necessary assumptions implicit in the requirements of
the learning problem itself. We specifically study universally consistent
function learning, where the objective is to obtain low long-run average loss
for any target function, when the data follow a given stochastic process. We
are then interested in the question of whether there exist learning rules
guaranteed to be universally consistent given only the assumption that
universally consistent learning is possible for the given data process. The
reasoning that motivates this criterion emanates from a kind of optimist's
decision theory, and so we refer to such learning rules as being optimistically
universal. We study this question in three natural learning settings:
inductive, self-adaptive, and online. Remarkably, as our strongest positive
result, we find that optimistically universal learning rules do indeed exist in
the self-adaptive learning setting. Establishing this fact requires us to
develop new approaches to the design of learning algorithms. Along the way, we
also identify concise characterizations of the family of processes under which
universally consistent learning is possible in the inductive and self-adaptive
settings. We additionally pose a number of enticing open problems, particularly
for the online learning setting.

of this paper is to examine the relationships between the satellites and rings
of the gas giants, using an analytical technique called cladistics. Cladistics
is traditionally used to examine relationships between living organisms, the
`tree of life'. In this work, we perform the first cladistical study of objects

compositional characteristics of satellites to classify the objects in the
Jovian and Saturnian systems. We find that the major relationships between the
satellites in the two systems, such as families, as presented in previous
studies, are broadly preserved. In addition, based on our analysis of the
Jovian system, we identify a new retrograde irregular family, the Iocaste
family, and suggest that the Phoebe family of the Saturnian system can be
further divided into two subfamilies. We also propose that the Saturnian
irregular families be renamed, to be consistent with the convention used in
Jovian families. Using cladistics, we are also able to assign the new
unclassified irregular satellites into families. Taken together, the results of
this study demonstrate the potential use of the cladistical technique in the

in many scientific disciplines. Because a RKHS can be very flexible, it is
common to impose a regularization term in the optimization to prevent
overfitting. Standard RKHS learning employs the squared norm penalty of the
learning function. Despite its success, many challenges remain. In particular,
one cannot directly use the squared norm penalty for variable selection or data
extraction. Therefore, when there exists noise predictors, or the underlying
function has a sparse representation in the dual space, the performance of
standard RKHS learning can be suboptimal. In the literature,work has been
proposed on how to perform variable selection in RKHS learning, and a data
sparsity constraint was considered for data extraction. However, how to learn
in a RKHS with both variable selection and data extraction simultaneously
remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a unified RKHS learning method,
namely, DOuble Sparsity Kernel (DOSK) learning, to overcome this challenge. An
efficient algorithm is provided to solve the corresponding optimization
problem. We prove that under certain conditions, our new method can
asymptotically achieve variable selection consistency. Simulated and real data

results in a new solution to a long-standing problem in Bayesian inference: the
definition of an objective or uninformative prior. A key characteristic of this

attached by flip-chip-bonding. Transient signals characteristics are important
in, e.g., matching ASIC and sensor design, modeling and optimizing detector
parameters and describing timing and charge sharing properties. Currently
analytical forms of transient signals are available for only a few limited
cases (e.g., drift or diffusion) or for the steady state (which is not relevant
for high energy radiation detection). Tools are available for (relatively slow)
numerical evaluation of the transient charge transport. We present here the
first analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing
drift-diffusion-recombination charge transport in planar p-n junction sensors
in a variety of conditions: (1) undepleted, (2) fully depleted, (3) taking into
account the gradual velocity saturation, and (4) overdepleted. We deduce the
Green's functions which can be applied to any detection problem through simple
convolution with the initial conditions. We compare the analytical solutions
with Monte Carlo simulations and industry standard simulations (Synopsys
Sentaurus), demonstrating good agreement. Using the analytical equations
enables fast modeling of the influence of various detector parameters on
tracking, imaging and timing performance, describing performance and enabling
optimizations for different applications. Finally, we illustrate this model
with applications in 3D+T (x,y,z,time) photon tracking and 4D+T
(x,y,theta,phi,time) relativistic charged particle tracking.

engineering, robotics, and graphics are often restricted to narrow domains and
require direct measurements of the underlying states. We introduce the Visual
Interaction Network, a general-purpose model for learning the dynamics of a
physical system from raw visual observations. Our model consists of a
perceptual front-end based on convolutional neural networks and a dynamics
predictor based on interaction networks. Through joint training, the perceptual
front-end learns to parse a dynamic visual scene into a set of factored latent
object representations. The dynamics predictor learns to roll these states
forward in time by computing their interactions and dynamics, producing a
predicted physical trajectory of arbitrary length. We found that from just six
input video frames the Visual Interaction Network can generate accurate future
trajectories of hundreds of time steps on a wide range of physical systems. Our
model can also be applied to scenes with invisible objects, inferring their
future states from their effects on the visible objects, and can implicitly
infer the unknown mass of objects. Our results demonstrate that the perceptual

latent representations that support accurate dynamical predictions. This work

and annihilation in noble gases is simulated using accurate scattering and
annihilation cross sections calculated \emph{ab initio} with many-body theory.
It is shown that a strikingly small fraction of positrons survive to
thermalisation: $\sim$0.1 in He, $\sim$0 in Ne (due to cooling effectively
stalling in the relatively deep momentum-transfer cross-section minimum),
$\sim$0.15 in Ar, $\sim$0.05 in Kr and $\sim$0.01 in Xe. For Xe, the
time-varying annihilation rate $\bar{Z}_{\rm eff}(\tau)$ is shown to be highly
sensitive to the depletion of the distribution due to annihilation,
conclusively explaining the long-standing discrepancy between gas-cell and
trap-based measurements in Xe. The \emph{ab initio} calculations enable the
first simultaneous probing of the energy dependence of the the scattering cross
section and annihilation rate. Overall, the use of the accurate atomic data
gives $\bar{Z}_{\rm eff}(\tau)$ in close agreement with experiment for all

from $N$ replicated databases. We consider the case when $B$ databases are
outdated (unsynchronized), or even worse, adversarial (Byzantine), and
therefore, can return incorrect answers. In the PIR problem with Byzantine
databases (BPIR), a user wishes to retrieve a specific message from a set of
$M$ messages with zero-error, irrespective of the actions performed by the
Byzantine databases. We consider the $T$-privacy constraint in this paper,
where any $T$ databases can collude, and exchange the queries submitted by the
user. We derive the information-theoretic capacity of this problem, which is
the maximum number of \emph{correct symbols} that can be retrieved privately
(under the $T$-privacy constraint) for every symbol of the downloaded data. We
determine the exact BPIR capacity to be
$C=\frac{N-2B}{N}\cdot\frac{1-\frac{T}{N-2B}}{1-(\frac{T}{N-2B})^M}$, if $2B+T
< N$. This capacity expression shows that the effect of Byzantine databases on
the retrieval rate is equivalent to removing $2B$ databases from the system,
with a penalty factor of $\frac{N-2B}{N}$, which signifies that even though the
number of databases needed for PIR is effectively $N-2B$, the user still needs
to access the entire $N$ databases. The result shows that for the
unsynchronized PIR problem, if the user does not have any knowledge about the
fraction of the messages that are mis-synchronized, the single-round capacity
is the same as the BPIR capacity. Our achievable scheme extends the optimal
achievable scheme for the robust PIR (RPIR) problem to correct the
\emph{errors} introduced by the Byzantine databases as opposed to
\emph{erasures} in the RPIR problem. Our converse proof uses the idea of the
cut-set bound in the network coding problem against adversarial nodes.

discuss a simple toy model which can be solved analytically, and show the
condition for the non-existence of a bound state is the same as that for the
existence of a regular solution for the differential equation in our method.
From these results, we conjecture that our criteria is also a necessary
condition.

MAXIMUS is faster than other solvers by up to an order of magnitude, but again

performance for all inputs, we introduce a new data-dependent optimizer,
OPTIMUS, that selects online with minimal overhead the best MIPS solver for a

of vectorlike technicolor, often called hypercolor (HC), with eight flavors
that form a one-family content of HC fermions. Dynamics of the composite vector
bosons, referred to as HC rho in this paper, are formulated together with HC
pions by the hidden local symmetry (HLS), in a way analogous to QCD vector
mesons. Then coupling properties to the standard model (SM) fermions, which
respect the HLS gauge symmetry, are described in a way that couplings of the HC
rhos to the left-handed SM quarks and leptons are given by a well-defined setup
as taking the flavor mixing structures into account. Under the present
scenario, we discuss significant bounds on the model from electroweak precision
tests, flavor physics, and collider physics. We also try to address B anomalies
in processes such as B -> K(*) mu+ mu- and B -> D(*) tau nu, recently reported
by LHCb, Belle, (ATLAS, and CMS in part.) Then we find that the present model
can account for the anomaly in B -> K(*) mu+ mu- consistently with the other
constraints while it predicts no significant deviations in B -> D(*) tau nu
from the SM, which can be examined in the future Belle II experiment. The
former is archived with the form C9 = -C10 of the Wilson coefficients for
effective operators of b -> s mu+ mu-, which has been favored by the recent
experimental data. We also investigate current and future experimental limits
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and see that possible collider signals come
from dijet and ditau, or dimuon resonant searches for the present scenario with
TeV mass range. To conclude, the present b -> s mu+ mu- anomaly is likely to
imply discovery of new vector bosons in the ditau or dimuon channel in the
context of the HC rho model. Our model can be considered as a UV completion of
conventional U(1)' model.

for BDs it is <10%. We investigate a case in which BDs in Taurus formed
dominantly through peripheral fragmentation. The decline of the binary
frequency in the transition region between star-like and peripheral formation
is modelled. A dynamical population synthesis model is employed in which
stellar binary formation is universal. Peripheral objects form separately in
circumstellar disks with a distinctive initial mass function (IMF), own orbital
parameter distributions for binaries and a low binary fraction. A small amount
of dynamical processing of the stellar component is accounted for as
appropriate for the low-density Taurus-Auriga embedded clusters. The binary
fraction declines strongly between the mass-limits for star-like and peripheral
formation. The location of characteristic features and the steepness depend on
these mass-limits. Such a trend might be unique to low density regions hosting
dynamically unprocessed binary populations. The existence of a strong decline
in the binary fraction -- primary mass diagram will become verifiable in future
surveys on BD and VLMS binarity in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. It is
a test of the (non-)continuity of star formation along the mass-scale, the
separateness of the stellar and BD populations and the dominant formation
channel for BDs and BD binaries in regions of low stellar density hosting

gaseous collapse route in pre-galactic dark matter halos, producing objects on

prevented from cooling below $10^4$ K that requires a metal-free and relatively
H$_2$-free medium. The initial collapse cools through atomic hydrogen
transitions, but the gas becomes optically thick to the cooling radiation at
high densities. We explore the effects ofLyman-$\alpha$ trapping in such a
collapsing system with a suite of Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations
in uniform density and isotropic cases that are based from a cosmological
simulation. Our method includes both non-coherent scattering and two-photon
line cooling. We find that Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation is marginally trapped in
the parsec-scale gravitationally unstable central cloud, allowing the
temperature to increase to 50,000 K at a number density of $3 \times 10^4$
cm$^{-3}$ and increasing the Jeans mass by a factor of five. The effective
equation of state changes from isothermal at low densities to have an adiabatic
index of 4/3 around the temperature maximum and then slowly retreats back to
isothermal at higher densities. Our results suggest that Lyman-$\alpha$
trapping delays the initial collapse by raising the Jeans mass. Afterward the
high density core cools back to $10^4$ K that is surrounded by a warm envelope
whose inward pressure may alter the fragmentation scales at high densities.

peaking, the four galaxy's radial tracks feature a downturn in both ellipticity

transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions, which are
fundamental constituents of the TMD factorization theorem. We provide a general
review of the theory of TMD distributions, and present a new scheme of scale
fixation. This scheme, called the $\zeta$-prescription, allows to minimize the
impact of perturbative logarithms in the large range of scales and does not
generate undesired power corrections. Within $\zeta$-prescription we
consistently include the perturbatively calculable parts up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), and perform the global fit of the
Drell-Yan and Z-boson production, which include the data of E288, Tevatron and
LHC experiments. The nonperturbative part of the TMDs are explored checking a
large variety of models. We support the obtained results by a study of
theoretical uncertainties, perturbative convergence, and dedicated study of the
range of applicability of the TMD factorization theorem. The considered
nonperturbative models present significant differences in the fitting behavior,
which allow us to clearly disfavor most of them. The numerical evaluations are
provided by the ""arTeMiDe"" code, which is introduced in this work and that can
be used for current/future TMD phenomenology.

data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)
survey. We assume that the thick disc has a constant scale-height and has
completed its formation at an early epoch, after which time radial mixing of
its stars has taken place. Under these assumptions, we find that the initial
radial metallicity gradient of the thick disc progenitor should not be
negative, but either flat or even positive, to explain the current negative
vertical metallicity gradient of the thick disc. Our study suggests that the
thick disc was built-up in an inside-out and upside-down fashion, and older,
smaller and thicker populations are more metal poor. In this case, star forming
discs at different epochs of the thick disc formation are allowed to have
different radial metallicity gradients, including a negative one, which helps
to explain a variety of slopes observed in high redshift disc galaxies. This
scenario helps to explain the positive slope of the metallicity-rotation
velocity relation observed for the Galactic thick disc. On the other hand,
radial mixing flattens the slope of an existing gradient.

Metallicities were measured in three different radial ranges, spanning cluster
cores through their outskirts. We explore trends in these measurements as a
function of cluster redshift, temperature, and surface brightness ""peakiness""
(a proxy for gas cooling efficiency in cluster centers). The data at large
radii (0.5--1 $r_{500}$) are consistent with a constant metallicity, while at
intermediate radii (0.1-0.5 $r_{500}$) we see a late-time increase in
enrichment, consistent with the expected production and mixing of metals in
cluster cores. In cluster centers, there are strong trends of metallicity with
temperature and peakiness, reflecting enhanced metal production in the
lowest-entropy gas. Within the cool-core/sharply peaked cluster population,
there is a large intrinsic scatter in central metallicity and no overall
evolution, indicating significant astrophysical variations in the efficiency of
enrichment. The central metallicity in clusters with flat surface brightness
profiles is lower, with a smaller intrinsic scatter, but increases towards
lower redshifts. Our results are consistent with other recent measurements of
ICM metallicity as a function of redshift. They reinforce the picture implied
by observations of uniform metal distributions in the outskirts of nearby
clusters, in which most of the enrichment of the ICM takes place before cluster
formation, with significant later enrichment taking place only in cluster
centers, as the stellar populations of the central galaxies evolve.

away from Sgr A. The system is expected to have a short orbital period, even
within the ultra-compact regime, given its persistent nature at low X-ray
luminosities and the long duration thermonuclear burst that it has displayed.
We have analysed a Suzaku (18 ks) observation and an XMM-Newton (39 ks)
observation taken 7 years apart. We infer (0.5-10 keV) X-ray luminosities in
the range 3-6 x10^35erg s-1, in agreement with previous findings. The spectra
are well described by a relatively cool (kTbb = 0.5 keV) black body component
plus a Comptonized emission component with {\Gamma} ~1.5-1.7. These values are
consistent with the source being in a faint hard state, as confirmed by the ~
20 per cent fractional root mean square amplitude of the fast variability (0.1
- 7 Hz) inferred from the XMM-Newton data. The electron temperature of the
corona is >7 keV for the Suzaku observation, but it is measured to be as low as
~2 keV in the XMM-Newton data at higher flux. The latter is significantly lower
than expected for systems in the hard state. We searched for X-ray pulsations
and imposed an upper limit to their semi-amplitude of 2 per cent (0.001 - 7
Hz). Finally, we investigated the origin of the low frequency variability
emission present in the XMM-Newton data and ruled out an absorption dip origin.
This constraint the orbital inclination of the system to 65 degr unless the
orbital period is longer than 11 hr (i.e. the length of the XMM-Newton

two models where the high-energy cutoff arises from intrinsic opacity to pair
production within the source ($\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$): (i) a Band spectrum with
$\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$ from the internal-shocks motivated model of Granot et al.
(2008), and (ii) the photospheric model of Gill & Thompson (2014). Alternative
explanations for the cutoff, such as an intrinsic cutoff in the emitting
electron energy distribution, appear to be less natural. Both models provide a
good fit to the data with very reasonable physical parameters, providing a
direct estimate of bulk Lorentz factors in the range $\Gamma\sim 100-400$, on
the lower end of what is generally observed in Fermi GRBs. Surprisingly, their
lower cutoff energies $E_c$ compared to other Fermi-LAT GRBs arise not
predominantly from the lower Lorentz factors, but also at a comparable level
from differences in variability time, luminosity, and high-energy photon index.
Finally, particularly low $E_c$ values may prevent detection by Fermi-LAT, thus
introducing a bias in the Fermi-LAT GRB sample against GRBs with low Lorentz
factors or variability times.

spectro-temporal variability from accreting black holes in both small systems,
i.e. state transitions in galactic black hole binaries (GBHBs), and large
systems, i.e. low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). In the canonical
truncated disk model of moderately low accretion rate systems, gas in the inner
region of the accretion disk occupies a hot, radiatively inefficient phase,
which leads to a geometrically thick disk, while the gas in the outer region
occupies a cooler, radiatively efficient phase that resides in the standard
geometrically thin disk. Observationally, there is strong empirical evidence to
support this phenomenological model, but a detailed understanding of the
dynamics of truncated disks is lacking. We present a well-resolved viscous,
hydrodynamic simulation that uses an ad hoc cooling prescription to drive a
thermal instability and, hence, produce the first sustained truncated accretion
disk. With this simulation, we perform a study of the dynamics, angular
momentum transport, and energetics of a truncated disk. We find that time
variability introduced by the quasi-periodic transition of gas from efficient
cooling to inefficient cooling impacts the evolution of the simulated disk. A
consequence of the thermal instability is that an outflow is launched from the
hot/cold gas interface which drives large, sub-Keplerian convective cells in
the disk atmosphere. The convective cells introduce a viscous $\theta-\phi$
stress that is less than the generic $r-\phi$ viscous stress component, but

is informative of the value of the SUSY breaking scale, and, if produced during
reheating, their number density is a function of the reheating temperature
($T_{\text{rh}}$). As a result, constraining their parameter space provides in
turn significant constraints on particles physics and cosmology. We have
previously shown that for gravitinos decaying into photons or charged particles
during the ($\mu$ and $y$) distortion eras, upcoming CMB spectral distortions
bounds are highly effective in constraining the $T_{\text{rh}}-m_{G}$ space.
For heavier gravitinos (with lifetimes shorter than a few $\times10^6$ sec),
distortions are quickly thermalized and energy injections cause a temperature
rise for the CMB bath. If the decay occurs after neutrino decoupling, its
overall effect is a suppression of the effective number of relativistic degrees
of freedom ($N_{\text{eff}}$). In this paper, we utilize the observational
bounds on $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain gravitino decays, and hence provide new
constaints on gravitinos and reheating. For gravitino masses less than $\approx

made, in particular, on the rotating nature of the magnetic field lines and on
the application of the magnetohydrodynamic frozen-field theorem to the disk
plasma. As an alternative, a unipolar induction model is proposed, where the
magnetic field is stationary in space and the stellar unipolar electric field
$\vec E_{*}$ on the surface is uploaded to the magnetosphere. Through the
Poynting vector, the star and the magnetosphere form a coupled system where the
total angular momentum, consisting the mechanical one of the star, the
electromagnetic one of the magnetosphere, and the mechanical one of the plasma
in the magnetosphere, is conserved. The stellar interaction with the accretion
disk is through the projection of the unipolar electric field $\vec E_{*}$ onto
the disk via the equipotential field lines, generating a disk current and
consequently toroidal fields with opposite signs on both sides of the disk,
with return current loops via the stellar surface. As a result, magnetic flux
is added to the magnetospheric field in the northern and southern hemispheres
with the disk current sheet as the boundary condition. This makes the star-disk
system an astrophysical site where intense magnetic fields are generated
through the rotational energy of the star. Angular momentum extraction from
this star-disk system happens as the magnetic flux in the magnetosphere
increases to the point that exceeds the current carrying capacity of the disk,
leading to a mega scale magnetic eruption sending Poynting fluxes to space
either isotropically or beamed.

very task. The first method uses autoencoders to construct a unique
representation of each emotion, while the second method is an 8-layer
convolutional neural network (CNN). These methods were trained on the
posed-emotion dataset (JAFFE), and to test their robustness, both the models
were also tested on 100 random images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
dataset, which consists of images that are candid than posed. The results show
that with more fine-tuning and depth, our CNN model can outperform the
state-of-the-art methods for emotion recognition. We also propose some exciting
ideas for expanding the concept of representational autoencoders to improve
their performance.

Planetary mass is crucial in assessing the feasibility of numerous

between classes, which may vary during operations w.r.t. the design data.
Two-class classification systems designed using skewed data tend to recognize
the majority class better than the minority class of interest. Several
data-level techniques have been proposed to alleviate this issue by up-sampling
minority samples or under-sampling majority samples. However, some informative
samples may be neglected by random under-sampling and adding synthetic positive
samples through up-sampling adds to training complexity. In this paper, a new
ensemble learning algorithm called Progressive Boosting (PBoost) is proposed
that progressively inserts uncorrelated groups of samples into a Boosting
procedure to avoid loss of information while generating a diverse pool of
classifiers. Base classifiers in this ensemble are generated from one iteration
to the next, using subsets from a validation set that grows gradually in size
and imbalance. Consequently, PBoost is more robust to unknown and variable
levels of skew in operational data, and has lower computation complexity than
Boosting ensembles in literature. In PBoost, a new loss factor is proposed to
avoid bias of performance towards the negative class. Using this loss factor,
the weight update of samples and classifier contribution in final predictions
are set based on the ability to recognize both classes. Using the proposed loss
factor instead of standard accuracy can avoid biasing performance in any
Boosting ensemble. The proposed approach was validated and compared using
synthetic data, videos from the FIA dataset that emulates face
re-identification applications, and KEEL collection of datasets. Results show
that PBoost can outperform state of the art techniques in terms of both
accuracy and complexity over different levels of imbalance and overlap between

to be surrounded by low-density, hot, geometrically thick accretion disks. This
includes the two black holes being imaged at sub-horizon resolution by the
Event Horizon Telescope. In these disks, the mean free path for Coulomb
interactions between charged particles is large, and the accreting matter is a
nearly collisionless plasma. Despite this, numerical simulations have so far
modeled these accretion flows using ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Here, we
present the first global, general relativistic, 3D simulations of accretion
flows onto a Kerr black hole including the non-ideal effects most likely to
affect the dynamics of the disk: the anisotropy between the pressure parallel
and perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the heat flux along magnetic field
lines. We show that for both standard and magnetically arrested disks, the
pressure anisotropy is comparable to the magnetic pressure, while the heat flux
remains dynamically unimportant. Despite this large pressure anisotropy,
however, the time-averaged structure of the accretion flow is strikingly
similar to that found in simulations treating the plasma as an ideal fluid. We
argue that these similarities are largely due to the interchangeability of the
viscous and magnetic shear stresses as long as the magnetic pressure is small
compared to the gas pressure, and to the sub-dominant role of pressure/viscous
effects in magnetically arrested disks. We conclude by highlighting outstanding
questions in modeling the dynamics of low collisionality accretion flows.

the CERN Large Hadron Collider requires a radiation-hard ADC. The design of a
radiation-hard dual-channel 12-bit 40 MS/s pipeline ADC for this use is
presented. The design consists of two pipeline A/D channels each with four
Multiplying Digital-to-Analog Converters followed by 8-bit
Successive-Approximation-Register analog-to-digital converters. The custom
design, fabricated in a commercial 130 nm CMOS process, shows a performance of
67.9 dB SNDR at 10 MHz for a single channel at 40 MS/s, with a latency of 87.5
ns (to first bit read out), while its total power consumption is 50 mW/channel.
The chip uses two power supply voltages: 1.2 and 2.5 V. The sensitivity to
single event effects during irradiation is measured and determined to meet the
system requirements.

has numerous potential applications because of its ubiquity in nature.
Superamphiphobic surfaces, which are both superhydrophobic and superoleophobic,
can give a low wettability not only for water drops but also for oil drops. In
this paper, we experimentally, numerically and theoretically investigate the
evaporation process of millimetric sessile ouzo drops (a transparent mixture of
water, ethanol, and trans-anethole) with low wettability on a superamphiphobic
surface. The evaporation-triggered ouzo effect, i.e. the spontaneous
emulsification of oil microdroplets below a specific ethanol concentration,
preferentially occurs at the apex of the drop due to the evaporation flux
distribution and volatility difference between water and ethanol. This
observation is also reproduced by numerical simulations. The volume decrease of
the ouzo drop is characterized by two distinct slopes. The initial steep slope
is dominantly caused by the evaporation of ethanol, followed by the slower
evaporation of water. At later stages, thanks to Marangoni forces the oil wraps
around the drop and an oil shell forms. We propose an approximate diffusion
model for the drying characteristics, which predicts the evaporation of the
drops in agreement with experiment and numerical simulation results. This work
provides an advanced understanding of the evaporation process of ouzo
(multi-component) drops.

to similar accuracy systematic uncertainty in the calibrated broadband
magnitudes due to uncertainty in the spectrum of the source. Here we present a
""Forward Global Calibration Method (FGCM)"" for photometric calibration of the
DES, and we present results of its application to the first three years of the

the observatory with data from the broad-band survey imaging itself and models
of the instrument and atmosphere to estimate the spatial- and time-dependence
of the passbands of individual DES survey exposures. ""Standard"" passbands are
chosen that are typical of the passbands encountered during the survey. The
passband of any individual observation is combined with an estimate of the
source spectral shape to yield a magnitude $m_b^{\mathrm{std}}$ in the standard
system. This ""chromatic correction"" to the standard system is necessary to
achieve sub-percent calibrations. The FGCM achieves reproducible and stable
photometric calibration of standard magnitudes $m_b^{\mathrm{std}}$ of stellar
sources over the multi-year Y3A1 data sample with residual random calibration
errors of $\sigma=5-6\,\mathrm{mmag}$ per exposure. The accuracy of the
calibration is uniform across the $5000\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ DES footprint to
within $\sigma=7\,\mathrm{mmag}$. The systematic uncertainties of magnitudes in

implications for high-throughput chemical and biological analysis,
lubrications, lab-on-chip devices, and near-field imaging techniques. Oil
nanodroplets can be produced on a solid-liquid interface in a simple step of
solvent exchange in which a good solvent of oil is displaced by a poor solvent.
In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the formation of
nanodroplets by the solvent exchange process under well-controlled flow
conditions. We find that the contact angle of the nanodroplets is independent
of the flow condition. However, there are significant effects from the flow
rate and the flow geometry on the droplet size. We develop a theoretical
framework to account for these effects. The main idea is that the droplet
nuclei are exposed to an oil oversaturation pulse during the exchange process.
The analysis gives that the volume of the nanodroplets increases with the
Peclet number $Pe$ of the flow as $\propto Pe^{3/4}$, which is in good
agreement with our experimental results. In addition, at fixed flow rate and
thus fixed Peclet number, larger and less homogeneously distributed droplets
formed at less narrow channels, due to convection effects originating from the
density difference between the two solutions of the solvent exchange. The
understanding from this work provides valuable guidelines for producing surface
nanodroplets with desired sizes by controlling the flow conditions.

predicted precisely by the (mean-field) product-state Ansatz, in which all
particles are in the same quantum state. Yet, in situations where
particle-particle correlations become important, the product Ansatz fails. To
include correlations nonperturbatively, we consider a new set of states: the
particle-correlated state of $N=l\times n$ bosons is derived by symmetrizing
the $n$-fold product of an $l$-particle quantum state. The particle-correlated
states can be simulated efficiently for large $N$, because their parameter
spaces, which depend on $l$, do not grow with $n$. Here we formulate and
develop in great detail the pure-state case for $l=2$, where the many-body
state is constructed from a two-particle pure state. These paired wave
functions, which we call pair-correlated states (PCS), were introduced by A. J.
Leggett [Rev. Mod. Phys. ${\bf 73}$, 307 (2001)] as a
particle-number-conserving version of the Bogoliubov approximation. We present
an iterative algorithm that solves for the reduced (marginal) density matrices
(RDMs), i.e., the correlation functions, associated with PCS in time $O(N)$.
The RDMs can also be derived from the normalization factor of PCS, which is
derived analytically in the large-$N$ limit. To test the efficacy of PCS, we
analyze the ground state of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model by minimizing the
energy of the PCS~state, both in its exact form and in its large-$N$
approximate form, and comparing with the exact ground state. For $N=1\,000$,
the relative errors of the ground-state energy for both cases are within
$10^{-5}$ over the entire parameter region from a single condensate to a Mott
insulator. We present numerical results that suggest that PCS might be useful
for describing the dynamics in the strongly interacting regime.

symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock for the description of strong correlations.
Unfortunately, these symmetry-projected mean-field methods do not adequately
account for dynamic correlation. Presumably, this shortcoming could be
addressed if one could combine symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock with a many-body
method such as coupled cluster theory, but this is by no means straightforward
because the two techniques are formulated in very different ways. However, we
have recently shown that the singlet $S^2$-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock
wave function can in fact be written in a coupled cluster-like wave function:
that is, the spin-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function can be
written as a polynomial of a double-excitation operator acting on some
closed-shell reference determinant. Here, we extend this result and show that
the spin-projected generalized Hartree-Fock wave function (which has both $S^2$
and $S_z$ projection) is likewise a polynomial of low-order excitation
operators acting on a closed-shell determinant, and provide a closed-form
expression for the resulting polynomial coefficients. We include a few
preliminary applications of the combination of this spin-projected Hartree-Fock
and coupled cluster theory to the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and comment on
generalizations of the methodology. Results here are not for production level,
but a similarity transformed theory that combines the two offers the promise of
being accurate for both weak and strong correlation, and particularly may offer
significant improvements in the intermediate correlation regime where neither
projected Hartree-Fock nor coupled cluster is particularly accurate.

is to avoid power-losses in frequency in the estimates of the iteration. This
goal is achieved using localization techniques of \cite{IOnonpd} to modify the
convex integration scheme.
  We also prove results on general solutions at the critical regularity that
may not conserve energy. These include a theorem on intermittency stating
roughly that energy dissipating solutions cannot have absolute structure

However, we deal with the scaling factor (as the number of models increases) of
the original combinatorial problem by relaxing the solution. This relaxation
brings two advantages: first, by operating in the continuous domain we can
parallelize the calculations. Second, it allows for the use of different
metrics which results in a more general formulation.
  We demonstrate the versatility of our technique on two different problems of
estimating structure from images: plane extraction from RGB-D data and
homography estimation from pairs of images. In both cases, we report accurate
results on publicly available datasets, in most of the cases outperforming the
state-of-the-art.

  to a Generative Visual Dialog Model","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel training framework for neural sequence models,
particularly for grounded dialog generation. The standard training paradigm for
these models is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), or minimizing the
cross-entropy of the human responses. Across a variety of domains, a recurring
problem with MLE trained generative neural dialog models (G) is that they tend
to produce 'safe' and generic responses (""I don't know"", ""I can't tell""). In
contrast, discriminative dialog models (D) that are trained to rank a list of
candidate human responses outperform their generative counterparts; in terms of
automatic metrics, diversity, and informativeness of the responses. However, D
is not useful in practice since it cannot be deployed to have real
conversations with users.
  Our work aims to achieve the best of both worlds -- the practical usefulness
of G and the strong performance of D -- via knowledge transfer from D to G. Our
primary contribution is an end-to-end trainable generative visual dialog model,
where G receives gradients from D as a perceptual (not adversarial) loss of the
sequence sampled from G. We leverage the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax (GS)
approximation to the discrete distribution -- specifically, an RNN augmented
with a sequence of GS samplers, coupled with the straight-through gradient
estimator to enable end-to-end differentiability. We also introduce a stronger
encoder for visual dialog, and employ a self-attention mechanism for answer
encoding along with a metric learning loss to aid D in better capturing
semantic similarities in answer responses. Overall, our proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art on the VisDial dataset by a significant margin
(2.67% on recall@10). The source code can be downloaded from

careful material engineering, we achieve over 80% conversion of implanted

approximately 90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and near-transform

controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the
plant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate
that even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point
equilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region
of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a
nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard
stochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives
conditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium.
Furthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions
provide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary.

the data within. Finally, the overlap between consecutive windows hinders a

explicitly modeling the spectral dynamics through integrating the multitaper

multitaper analysis are estimated using instances of the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and are used to construct spectrograms and

one side of a null congruence $N$ through $p$ generated by $k^a$. The
conjecture has been established for super-renormalizeable field theories at
points $p$ that lie on a bifurcate Killing horizon with null tangent $k^a$ and
for large-N holographic theories on flat space. While the Koeller-Leichenauer
holographic argument clearly yields an inequality for general $(p,k^a)$, more
conditions are generally required for this inequality to be a useful QNEC. For
$d\le 3$, for arbitrary backgroud metric satisfying the null convergence
condition $R_{ab} k^a k^b \ge 0$, we show that the QNEC is naturally finite and
independent of renormalization scheme when the expansion $\theta$ and shear
$\sigma_{ab}$ of $N$ at point $p$ satisfy $\theta |_p= \dot{\theta}|_p =0$,
$\sigma_{ab}|_p=0$. This is consistent with the original QNEC conjecture. But
for $d=4,5$ more conditions are required. In particular, we also require the
vanishing of additional derivatives and a dominant energy condition. In the
above cases the holographic argument does indeed yield a finite QNEC, though
for $d\ge6$ we argue these properties to fail even for weakly isolated horizons
(where all derivatives of $\theta, \sigma_{ab}$ vanish) that also satisfy a
dominant energy condition. On the positive side, a corrollary to our work is
that, when coupled to Einstein-Hilbert gravity, $d \le 3$ holographic theories
at large $N$ satisfy the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics at
leading order in Newton's constant $G$. This is the first GSL proof which does
not require the quantum fields to be perturbations to a Killing horizon.

are currently developing strong support for some extremist entity such as ISIS

The importance of online connectivity in developing intent has been confirmed
by recent case-studies of already convicted terrorists. Here we identify
dynamical patterns in the online trajectories that individuals take toward
developing a high level of extremist support -- specifically, for ISIS. Strong
memory effects emerge among individuals whose transition is fastest, and hence
may become 'out of the blue' threats in the real world. A generalization of
diagrammatic expansion theory helps quantify these characteristics, including
the impact of changes in geographical location, and can facilitate prediction
of future risks. By quantifying the trajectories that individuals follow on
their journey toward expressing high levels of pro-ISIS support -- irrespective
of whether they then carry out a real-world attack or not -- our findings can
help move safety debates beyond reliance on static watch-list identifiers such
as ethnic background or immigration status, and/or post-fact interviews with
already-convicted individuals. Given the broad commonality of social media
platforms, our results likely apply quite generally: for example, even on
Telegram where (like Twitter) there is no built-in group feature as in our

present a molecular dynamics (MD) investigation to determine the fracture
strength and toughness of nanocrystalline silicene (nc silicene) sheet of
varied grain size and pre existing crack length at room temperature. Our
results suggest that the transition from an inverse pseudo Hall Petch to a
pseudo Hall Petch behavior in nc silicene occurs at a critical grain size of

However, nc silicene with pre existing cracks exhibits anomalous crack
propagation and fracture toughness behaviour. We have observed two distinct
types of failure mechanisms (crack sensitive and insensitive failure) and
devised the mechanophysical conditions under which they occur. Fracture
toughness calculated from both Griffiths theory and MD simulations indicate
that the former overpredicts the fracture toughness of nc silicene. The most
striking outcome, however, is that despite the presence of a pre existing
crack, the crack sensitivity of nc silicene is found to be dependent on the
grain size and their orientations. This study is the first direct comparison of
atomistic simulations to the continuum theories to predict the anomalous

from the work that the product is intended to do, systemic properties like

ways to build the right product embedded with the desired systemic properties.

the properties of the $\ell_1$ non-convex problem associated with DPCP, we
develop a geometric analysis of a closely related continuous optimization

state that as long as the hyperplanes are sufficiently separated, the dominant

2015 the MeV-to-GeV photon index has hardened and changes in the range of
$\Gamma=(1.73-1.79)$ for most of the time. The hardest photon index of
$\Gamma=1.54\pm0.16$ has been observed on MJD 57131.46 with $11.8\sigma$ which

external inverse Compton processes; the model parameters are estimated using
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The emission in the flaring states can be

the density of the produced fermions is low, they can still have detectable

proportional to the density of the produced particles and the fermion and boson

  Barrier Coverage in the Plane",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a line barrier and a set of mobile sensors distributed in the plane,
the Minimizing Maximum Sensor Movement problem (MMSM) for
\textcolor{black}{line barrier coverage} is to compute relocation positions for
the sensors in the plane such that the barrier is entirely covered by the
monitoring area of the sensors while the maximum relocation movement (distance)
is minimized. Its weaker version, decision MMSM is to determine whether the
barrier can be covered by the sensors within a given relocation distance bound
$D\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
  This paper presents three approximation algorithms for decision MMSM. The
first is a simple greedy approach, which runs in time $O(n\log n)$ and achieves
a maximum movement $D^{*}+2r_{max}$, where $n$ is the number of the sensors,
$D^{*}$ is the maximum movement of an optimal solution and $r_{max}$ is the
maximum radii of the sensors. The second and the third algorithms improve the
maximum movement to $D^{*}+r_{max}$ , running in time $O(n^{7}L)$ and
$O(R^{2}\sqrt{\frac{M}{\log R}})$ by applying linear programming (LP) rounding
and maximal matching tchniques respecitvely, where $R=\sum2r_{i}$, which is
$O(n)$ in practical scenarios of uniform sensing radius for all sensors, and
$M\leq n\max r_{i}$. Applying the above algorithms for $O(\log(d_{max}))$ time
in binary search immediately yields solutions to MMSM with the same performance
guarantee. In addition, we also give a factor-2 approximation algorithm which
can be used to improve the performance of the first three algorithms when
$r_{max}>D^{*}$. As shown in \cite{dobrev2015complexity}, the 2-D MMSM problem
admits no FPTAS as it is strongly NP-complete, so our algorithms arguably
achieve the best possible ratio.

designing the attack sequence using our proposed approach, the attacker can
cause a large deviation of the bus voltages from the desired setpoint. Further,
the results verify the optimality of the derived attack sequence and show that,
to cause maximum impact, the attacker must carefully craft his attack to strike
a balance between the attack magnitude and stealthiness, due to the

sensors, that is represented as features, serves as input for an iterative
expectation-maximization method to estimate a lane model. The generic and
modular concept of the approach allows to freely choose the mathematical
functions for the geometrical description of lanes. In addition to the current
measurement data, the previously estimated result as well as additional
constraints to reflect parallelism and continuity of traffic lanes, are
considered in the optimization process. As evaluation of the lane estimation
method, its performance is showcased using cubic splines for the geometric
representation of lanes in simulated scenarios and measurements recorded using
a development vehicle. In a comparison to ground truth data, robustness and
precision of the lanes estimated up to a distance of 120 m are demonstrated. As
a part of the environmental modeling, the presented method can be utilized for
longitudinal and lateral control of autonomous vehicles.

sample is constructed from SDSS-DR7Q and BOSS-DR12Q, each with at least 2
spectroscopic epochs in SDSS-I/II/III surveys. Additionally, we adopt the
following signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) selection criteria: a) for MgII and the
3000 {\AA} continuum, S/N $\geq$ 10; b) for narrow lines, S/N $\geq$ 5. All our
quasar spectra are recalibrated based on the assumption of constant narrow
emission-line fluxes. In an analysis of spectrum-to-spectrum variations, we
find a fairly close correlation (Spearman $\rho = 0.593$) between the
variations in broad MgII and in the continuum. This is consistent with the idea
that MgII is varying in response to the continuum emission variations. Adopting
the modified weighted least squares regression method, we statistically
constrain the slopes (i.e., the responsivity $\alpha$ of the broad MgII)
between the variations in both components for the sources in different
luminosity bins after eliminating intrinsic biases introduced by the rescaling
process itself. It is shown that the responsivity is quite small (average
$\bar{\alpha} \approx$ 0.464) and anti-correlates with the quasar luminosity.
Our results indicate that high signal-to-noise flux measurements are required
to robustly detect the intrinsic variability and the time lag of MgII line.

  Carried Out by Industrial Engineers?",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Testing is an important activity in engineering of industrial software. For
such software, testing is usually performed manually by handcrafting test
suites based on specific design techniques and domain-specific experience. To
support developers in testing, different approaches for producing good test
suites have been proposed. In the last couple of years combinatorial testing
has been explored with the goal of automatically combining the input values of
the software based on a certain strategy. Pairwise testing is a combinatorial
technique used to generate test suites by varying the values of each pair of
input parameters to a system until all possible combinations of those
parameters are created. There is some evidence suggesting that these kinds of
techniques are efficient and relatively good at detecting software faults.
Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence on the comparison of these
combinatorial testing techniques with, what is perceived as, rigorous manually
handcrafted testing. In this study we compare pairwise test suites with test
suites created manually by engineers for 45 industrial programs. The test
suites were evaluated in terms of fault detection, code coverage and number of
tests. The results of this study show that pairwise testing, while useful for
achieving high code coverage and fault detection for the majority of the
programs, is almost as effective in terms of fault detection as manual testing.
The results also suggest that pairwise testing is just as good as manual
testing at fault detection for 64% of the programs.

spin-orbit torque when passing current pulses through the Pt/Co system with an
inserted IrMn antiferromagnetic layer. Manipulating the current-pulse-induced

unidirectional anisotropy is achieved and the thermal agitation of the magnetic

innovative method to generate and to control the exchange bias by electrical
means, which enables us to realize the new switching mechanism of highly stable

must always have definite values. The idea was introduced by Leggett and Garg
(1985), who wished to show a conflict with the predictions of quantum theory.
However, their analysis required not just the assumption of macroscopic realism
per se, but also that the observable properties could be measured
non-invasively. In recent years there has been increasing interest in
experimental tests of the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality, but it has
remained a matter of controversy whether this second assumption is a reasonable
requirement for a macroscopic realist view of quantum theory. In a recent
critical assessment Maroney and Timpson (2017) identified three different
categories of macroscopic realism, and argued that only the simplest category
could be ruled out by Leggett-Garg inequality violations. Allen, Maroney, and
Gogioso (2016) then showed that the second of these approaches was also
incompatible with quantum theory in Hilbert spaces of dimension 4 or higher.
However, we show that the distinction introduced by Maroney and Timpson between
the second and third approaches is not noise tolerant, so unfortunately Allen's
result, as given, is not directly empirically testable. In this paper we
replace Maroney and Timpson's three categories with a parameterization of
macroscopic realist models, which can be related to experimental observations
in a noise tolerant way, and recover the original definitions in the noise-free
limit. We show how this parameterization can be used to experimentally rule out
classes of macroscopic realism in Hilbert spaces of dimension 3 or higher,
including the category tested by the Leggett-Garg inequality, without any use
of the non-invasive measurability assumption.

architecture to support the massive data traffic in the next generation
cellular networks. In a C-RAN, a massive number of low-cost remote antenna
ports (RAPs) are connected to a single baseband unit (BBU) pool via high-speed
low-latency fronthaul links, which enables efficient resource allocation and
interference management. As the RAPs are geographically distributed, the group
sparse beamforming schemes attracts extensive studies, where a subset of RAPs
is assigned to be active and a high spectral efficiency can be achieved.
However, most studies assumes that each user is equipped with a single antenna.
How to design the group sparse precoder for the multiple antenna users remains
little understood, as it requires the joint optimization of the mutual coupling
transmit and receive beamformers. This paper formulates an optimal joint RAP
selection and precoding design problem in a C-RAN with multiple antennas at
each user. Specifically, we assume a fixed transmit power constraint for each
RAP, and investigate the optimal tradeoff between the sum rate and the number
of active RAPs. Motivated by the compressive sensing theory, this paper
formulates the group sparse precoding problem by inducing the $\ell_0$-norm as
a penalty and then uses the reweighted $\ell_1$ heuristic to find a solution.
By adopting the idea of block diagonalization precoding, the problem can be
formulated as a convex optimization, and an efficient algorithm is proposed
based on its Lagrangian dual. Simulation results verify that our proposed
algorithm can achieve almost the same sum rate as that obtained from exhaustive
search.

lung wall, inhomogeneous background noises and large variations in sizes and
shape. In this paper, we employ Halton low-discrepancy sequences to calculate
the volume of the lung lesions. The proposed method directly compute the volume
without the procedure of three-dimension (3D) model reconstruction and surface
triangulation, which significantly improves the efficiency and reduces the
complexity. The main steps of the proposed method are: (1) generate a certain
number of random points in each slice using Halton low-discrepancy sequences
and calculate the lesion area of each slice through the proportion; (2) obtain
the volume by integrating the areas in the sagittal direction. In order to
evaluate our proposed method, the experiments were conducted on the sufficient
data sets with different size of lung lesions. With the uniform distribution of
random points, our proposed method achieves more accurate results compared with
other methods, which demonstrates the robustness and accuracy for the volume
calculation of CT lung lesions. In addition, our proposed method is easy to
follow and can be extensively applied to other applications, e.g., volume

polycrystal is constructed by imposing F^L to be a piecewise constant rotation

(SLT)~\cite{Mermin1966Absence,Mermin1968Crystalline,Kosterlitz1972Long}
concerns fundamental concepts of long-range correlations vital to magnetism,
superconductivity, superfluidity, and topological matters. A long sought-after
example is the melting of a Wigner Crystal (WC)~\cite{Wigner1934Interaction} of
electrons. Detection efforts have targeted distinctive collective modes such as
pinning by disorder, resonant-frequency absorption of Goldstone modes, and
melting transition. However, only one-step second-order melting of
softly-pinned modes was reported. Without the evidence of genuine pinning as
exhibited in the charge density waves (CDWs)~\cite{PinningCDW}, these modes are
likely intermediate phases which are only part of a complete SLT. To verify if
there is a WC-intermediate phase transition will not only provide a solid proof
of a WC, but will also unveil the nature of the SLT in relation to the
two-stage Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)

Through transport studies of ultra-dilute high-purity 2D systems, this work
presents evidence for not only a WC, but also for a two-stage WC-liquid SLT

is a painstakingly tedious process especially when the objective functions are
expensive-to-evaluate computer codes with parametric uncertainties. The
effectiveness of the state-of-the-art techniques is greatly diminished because
they require a large number of objective evaluations, which makes them
impractical for problems of the above kind. Bayesian global optimization (BGO),
has managed to deal with these challenges in solving single-objective
optimization problems and has recently been extended to multi-objective
optimization (MOO). BGO models the objectives via probabilistic surrogates and
uses the epistemic uncertainty to define an information acquisition function
(IAF) that quantifies the merit of evaluating the objective at new designs.
This iterative data acquisition process continues until a stopping criterion is
met. The most commonly used IAF for MOO is the expected improvement over the
dominated hypervolume (EIHV) which in its original form is unable to deal with
parametric uncertainties or measurement noise. In this work, we provide a
systematic reformulation of EIHV to deal with stochastic MOO problems. The
primary contribution of this paper lies in being able to filter out the noise
and reformulate the EIHV without having to observe or estimate the stochastic
parameters. An addendum of the probabilistic nature of our methodology is that
it enables us to characterize our confidence about the predicted Pareto front.
We verify and validate the proposed methodology by applying it to synthetic
test problems with known solutions. We demonstrate our approach on an
industrial problem of die pass design for a steel wire drawing process.

growing impact on electric power systems as it dramatically modifies the way
electricity is produced. To ensure a safe and smooth transition towards a
pan-European electricity production dominated by renewable sources, it is of
paramount importance to anticipate how production dispatches will evolve, to
understand how increased fluctuations in power generations can be absorbed at
the pan-European level and to evaluate where the resulting changes in power
flows will require significant grid upgrades. To address these issues, we
construct an aggregated model of the pan-European transmission network which we
couple to an optimized, few-parameter dispatch algorithm to obtain time- and
geographically-resolved production profiles. We demonstrate the validity of our
dispatch algorithm by reproducing historical production time series for all
power productions in fifteen different European countries. Having calibrated
our model in this way, we investigate future production profiles at later
stages of the energy transition - determined by planned future production
capacities - and the resulting interregional power flows. We find that large
power fluctuations from increasing penetrations of renewable sources can be
absorbed at the pan-European level via significantly increased electricity
exchanges between different countries. We identify where these increased
exchanges will require additional power transfer capacities. We finally
introduce a physically-based economic indicator which allows to predict future
financial conditions in the electricity market. We anticipate new economic
opportunities for dam hydroelectricity and pumped-storage plants.

the process is positive, (ii) the time $t_{\rm last}$ the process last visits
the origin, and (iii) the time $t_{\rm max}$ when it achieves its maximum (or
minimum). All three observables have the same cumulative probability

non-Markovian Gaussian process indexed by the Hurst exponent $H$. It
generalizes standard Brownian motion (i.e. $H=\tfrac{1}{2}$). We obtain the
three probabilities using a perturbative expansion in $\epsilon =

that the corrections to mean-field theory or the random phase approximation for

recognized as a powerful pathway to self-assembly of micro and nano-scale
machines with programmable mechanical properties. The typical approach to
designing the mechanical response of an ideal origami machine is to include
mechanisms where mechanical constraints transform applied forces into a desired
motion along a narrow set of degrees of freedom. In fact, to date, most design
approaches focus on building up complex mechanisms from simple ones in ways
that preserve each individual mechanism's degree of freedom (DOF), with
examples ranging from simple robotic arms to homogenous arrays of identical
vertices, such as the well-known Miura-ori. However, such approaches typically
require tight fabrication tolerances, and often suffer from parasitic
compliance. In this work, we demonstrate a technique in which
high-degree-of-freedom mechanisms associated with single vertices are
heterogeneously combined so that the coupled phase spaces of neighboring
vertices are pared down to a controlled range of motions. This approach has the
advantage that it produces mechanisms that retain the DOF at each vertex, are
robust against fabrication tolerances and parasitic compliance, but
nevertheless effectively constrain the range of motion of the entire machine.
We demonstrate the utility of this approach by mapping out the configuration
space for the modified Miura-ori vertex of degree 6, and show that when strung
together, their combined configuration spaces create mechanisms that isolate
deformations, constrain the configuration topology of neighboring vertices, or
lead to sequential bistable folding throughout the entire origami sheet.

external Zeeman fields. We show that these nodal phases are robust against weak
disorders, thus are possible to be realized in experiments with real materials.
The smoking-gun evidences to verify these phases based on scanning tunneling
spectroscopy are also briefly discussed.

largest scale sizes are stable on timescales of minutes while the small scale
sizes are more variable. When comparing two smaller time intervals of different
types of auroral displays, we find a variation in their characteristics. The
characteristics averaged over the event are in remarkable agreement with the
spatiotemporal characteristics of the nightside field-aligned currents during

decomposition of immersions, a program classically pushed by B.-Y. Chen since

scaling together with the most popular extrinsic fourth-order curvature flow,
the Willmore and surface diffusion flows. Unlike them however the famous Chen
conjecture indicates that there should be no stationary nonminimal data, and so
in particular the flow should drive all closed submanifolds to singularities.

finite time in all dimensions and for any codimension; (2) singularities are
characterised by concentration of curvature in $L^n$ for intrinsic dimension $n
\in \{2,4\}$ and any codimension (a Lifespan Theorem); and (3) for $n = 2$ and

relation for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, its repulsive counterpart, the WCA
system and a network forming liquid, the NTW model. We find that for all the
systems both the relations are valid at high temperature regime with an
universal exponent close to 0.8. Similar to that observed for the simple
liquids, the LJ and the WCA systems show a breakdown of the scaling laws at the
low temperature regime. However for the NTW model, which is a simple liquid,
these scaling laws are valid even at lower temperature regime similar to that
found for ionic melts. Thus we find that the NTW model has mixed
characteristics of simple liquids and ionic melts. Our study further reveals a
quantitative relationship between the Rosenfeld and the Arrhenius relations.
For strong liquids, the validity of the Rosenfeld relation in the low
temperature regime is connected to it following the Arrhenius behaviour in that
regime. Finally we explore the role of pair entropy and residual multiparticle
entropy in the dynamics as a function of fragility of the systems.

disturbances causing transition in a fully developed spiral annular flow. The
problem is approached through reformulation of the linearised equations of
motion governing small-amplitude disturbances in a parameter space that differs
from that conventionally employed for this purpose. The alternative parameter
space comprises a suitably defined Reynolds number that is formed with a
resultant characteristic velocity which is a vector sum of the axial and
azimuthal characteristic velocities, a swirl parameter that is the ratio of the
azimuthal to the axial characteristic velocity, and the ratio of the annular
gap to the mean diameter of the cylinders. In the limits of the swirl parameter
assuming very small or very large values, the newly derived generalised
Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations for disturbance propagation in the revised
parameter space reduce to the corresponding equations that are known and well
established for the limiting cases of disturbance propagation as the swirl
parameter goes to zero or infinity respectively. Furthermore, they also lead
naturally to the criterion that determines from the equations themselves the
analytical expression for the location of the critical layer in spiral annular
flow, the scaling behaviour of the thickness of the critical layer with the
Reynolds number and the swirl parameter, and the equation governing the
dynamics of the flow in the critical layer. They thus explicitly reveal the
effect of swirl on the critical layer.

adaptation induced a higher flow state, however music had no effect. There was

often based on the space of generalized functions of bounded deformation
$GSBD^p(\Omega)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$, their treatment is however hindered by the
very low regularity of those functions and by the lack of appropriate density
results. We construct here an approximation of $GSBD^p$ functions, for
$p\in(1,\infty)$, with functions which are Lipschitz continuous away from a
jump set which is a finite union of closed subsets of $C^1$ hypersurfaces. The
strains of the approximating functions converge strongly in $L^p$ to the strain
of the target, and the area of their jump sets converge to the area of the
target. The key idea is to use piecewise affine functions on a suitable grid,
which is obtained via the Freudhental partition of a cubic grid.

another user with a better channel condition. The message intended for the

particular successive decoding and interference cancellation. This paper aims
to design linear precoders/beamformers for signal superposition at the base
stations of NOMA multi-input multi-output multi-cellular systems to maximize
the overall sum throughput subject to the users' QoS requirements, which are
imposed independently on the users' channel condition. This design problem is

maximal zero or a minimal one. It is known that if $f$ depends on all its
variables, then the set of its extremal points completely specifies $f$ within
the universe of threshold functions. However, in some cases, $f$ can be
specified by a smaller set. The minimum number of points in such a set is the
specification number of $f$. It was shown in [S.-T. Hu. Threshold Logic, 1965]
that the specification number of a threshold function of $n$ variables is at
least $n+1$. In [M. Anthony, G. Brightwell, and J. Shawe-Taylor. On specifying
Boolean functions by labelled examples. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 1995] it
was proved that this bound is attained for nested functions and conjectured
that for all other threshold functions the specification number is strictly
greater than $n+1$. In the present paper, we resolve this conjecture negatively
by exhibiting threshold Boolean functions of $n$ variables, which are
non-nested and for which the specification number is $n+1$. On the other hand,
we show that the set of extremal points satisfies the statement of the
conjecture, i.e., a positive threshold Boolean function depending on all its
$n$ variables has $n+1$ extremal points if and only if it is nested. To prove
this, we reveal an underlying structure of the set of extremal points.

cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral
pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to
vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep
neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit
towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either
two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results
show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree
of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network
trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture
that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional
organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to

research. If the graviton has a small mass, the gravitational force at large
distances decreases more rapidly, which could contribute to explain the
accelerated expansion of the universe. The massive spin-2 particles are
commonly described by the known Fierz-Pauli action which is formulated in terms
of a symmetric tensor $h_{\mu\nu}=h_{\nu\mu}$. However, the Fierz-Pauli theory
is not the only possible description of massive spin-2 particles via a rank-2
tensor. There are other two families of models $\mathcal{L}(a_1)$ and
$\mathcal{L}_{nFP}(c)$, where $a_1$ and $c$ are real arbitrary parameters,
which describe massive particles of spin-2 in the flat space via a nonsymmetric
tensor $e_{\mu\nu}\neq e_{\nu\mu}$. In the present work we derive Lagrangian
constraints stemming from $\mathcal{L}(a_1)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{nFP}(c)$ in
curved backgrounds with nonminimal couplings which are analytic functions of
$m^2$. We show that the constraints lead to a correct counting of degrees of
freedom if nonminimal terms are included with fine tuned coefficients and the
background space is of the Einstein type, very much like the Fierz-Pauli case.
We also examine the existence of local symmetries.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can improve the throughput of users with

with better channel conditions can decode the information of users in poorer

allocating separate fractional time slots for serving the users with similar

unit while the privacy of each user is preserved. The fractional times and

based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all visits

standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is
randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors
that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in
applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of
interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an
alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a
design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated,
perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from
lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken
under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for
design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based
uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the
usual infinite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions
under which they coincide.

independent on the number of involved individuals. The transmission duration
presents a truncated power-law behavior at the daily timescale with weekly

network may participate in the `super-connecting cliques' in the aggregated

the probability distribution of TIs' inter-event duration also displays a

while the pairwise individuals with burst interactions are prone to randomly
select their interactive locations, and those individuals with periodic
interactions have preferred interactive locations.

several unusual characteristics. Its late-time spectrum shows a strong, broad
H$\alpha $ emission line and the bolometric LC exhibits two peaks and a

well match the observations of iPTF15esb. Based on this result, we infer that
the progenitor has undergone at least three violent mass-loss processes before
the SN explosion. Furthermore, we find that the masses of the CSM wind and
shells from the outermost shell (the first eruption) to the innermost wind (the
final eruption) decrease sequentially but their densities increase. The
variation trend of the inferred densities of the shells and wind is consistent
with the stellar structure before an SN explosion. Further investigations for
similar SLSNe would provide a probe for the mass-loss history of their

simulate the evolution of moderately dense, three-dimensional, quasiclassical
vortex tangles and the Andreev reflection of thermal quasiparticle excitations
by these tangles. This numerical simulation enables us to generate the
two-dimensional map of local Andreev reflections for excitations incident on
one of the faces of a cubic computational domain, and to calculate the total
coefficient of Andreev reflection as a function of the vortex line density. Our
numerical simulation is then compared with the experimental measurements
probing quantum turbulence generated by a vibrating grid. We also address the
question of whether the quasiclassical and ultraquantum regimes of quantum
turbulence can be distinguished by their respective total Andreev
reflectivities. We discuss the screening mechanisms which may strongly affect
the total Andreev reflectivity of dense vortex tangles. Finally, we present
combined numerical-experimental results for fluctuations of the Andreev

absorption, which is highly variable in time and significantly complicates both

monitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the

light curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic
Monitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch
aperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple
Observatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to
trace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations
with the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red
telescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data
analysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken
with CAMAL. For seven nights of data, we have independent PWV measurements
extracted from high-resolution stellar spectra taken with the Tillinghast
Reflector Echelle Spectrometer (TRES) also located on Mount Hopkins. We use the
TRES spectra to calibrate the CAMAL absolute PWV scale. Comparisons between
CAMAL and TRES PWV estimates show excellent agreement, matching to within 1 mm
over a 10 mm range in PWV. Analysis of CAMAL's photometric precision propagates
to PWV measurements precise to better than 0.5 mm in dry (PWV < 4 mm)

loop top due to radiative thermal instability. The first large-scale
condensation on the loop top suffers Rayleigh-Taylor instability and becomes
fragmented into smaller blobs. The blobs fall vertically dragging magnetic
loops until they reach low beta regions and start to fall along the loops from
loop top to loop footpoints. A statistic study of the coronal rain blobs finds
that small blobs with masses of less than 10^10 g dominate the population. When
blobs fall to lower regions along the magnetic loops, they are stretched and
develop a non-uniform velocity pattern with an anti-parallel shearing pattern
seen to develop along the central axis of the blobs. Synthetic images of

to generate segmentation label maps, and propose a novel adversarial critic
network with a multi-scale $L_1$ loss function to force the critic and
segmentor to learn both global and local features that capture long- and
short-range spatial relationships between pixels. In our SegAN framework, the
segmentor and critic networks are trained in an alternating fashion in a
min-max game: The critic takes as input a pair of images, (original_image $*$
predicted_label_map, original_image $*$ ground_truth_label_map), and then is
trained by maximizing a multi-scale loss function; The segmentor is trained
with only gradients passed along by the critic, with the aim to minimize the
multi-scale loss function. We show that such a SegAN framework is more
effective and stable for the segmentation task, and it leads to better
performance than the state-of-the-art U-net segmentation method. We tested our
SegAN method using datasets from the MICCAI BRATS brain tumor segmentation
challenge. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the

a complex internal symmetry, representing highly non-trivial ways of rotational
symmetry breaking, and are subject to current experimental pursuits in
colloidal and molecular systems. The classification of these phases has been
known for a long time, however, their transitions to the disordered isotropic
liquid phase remain largely unexplored, except for a few symmetries. In this
work, we utilize a recently introduced non-Abelian gauge theory to explore the
nature of the underlying nematic-isotropic transition for all three-dimensional
polyhedral nematics. The gauge theory can readily be applied to nematic phases
with an arbitrary point-group symmetry, including those where traditional
Landau methods and the associated lattice models may become too involved to
implement owing to a prohibitive order-parameter tensor of high rank or (the
absence of) mirror symmetries. By means of exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations,
we find that the nematic-isotropic transition is generically first-order for
all polyhedral symmetries. Moreover, we show that this universal result is
fully consistent with our expectation from a renormalization group approach, as
well as with other lattice models for symmetries already studied in the
literature. We argue that extreme fine tuning is required to promote those
transitions to second order ones. We also comment on the nature of phase
transitions breaking the $O(3)$ symmetry in general cases.

by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was
measured on January 4, 2017 at 10:11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second
observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm
rate less than 1 in 70,000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are
$31.2^{+8.4}_{-6.0}\,M_\odot$ and $19.4^{+5.3}_{-5.9}\,M_\odot$ (at the 90%
credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement
of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the
spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, $\chi_\mathrm{eff} =
-0.12^{+0.21}_{-0.30}.$ This result implies that spin configurations with both
component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are
disfavored. The source luminosity distance is $880^{+450}_{-390}~\mathrm{Mpc}$
corresponding to a redshift of $z = 0.18^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. We constrain the
magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and
perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed
in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to $m_g \le 7.7
\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{eV}/c^2$. In all cases, we find that GW170104 is
consistent with general relativity.

face a trade-off between potential bankruptcy and extraction of profits. In
contrast to previous works, general cash flow drifts, including
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck and CIR processes, are considered. We provide rigorous
proofs of continuity of the value function, whence dynamic programming, as well
as comparison between the sub- and supersolutions of the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, and we provide an efficient and convergent
numerical scheme for finding the solution. The value function is given by a
nonlinear PDE with a gradient constraint from below in one dimension. We find
that the optimal strategy is both a barrier and a band strategy and that it
includes voluntary liquidation in parts of the state space. Finally, we present
and numerically study extensions of the model, including equity issuance and
credit lines.

the error term for the Andrews smallest parts function $\mathrm{spt}(n)$. We
use this formula to prove recent conjectures of Chen concerning inequalities
which involve the partition function $p(n)$ and $\mathrm{spt}(n)$. Further, we
strengthen one of the conjectures, and prove that for every $\epsilon>0$ there
is an effectively computable constant $N(\epsilon) > 0$ such that for all
$n\geq N(\epsilon)$, we have \begin{equation*}
\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\pi}\sqrt{n}\,p(n)<\mathrm{spt}(n)<\left(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\pi}+\epsilon\right)
\sqrt{n}\,p(n). \end{equation*} Due to the conditional convergence of the
Rademacher-type formula for $\mathrm{spt}(n)$, we must employ methods which are
completely different from those used by Lehmer to give effective error bounds
for $p(n)$. Instead, our approach relies on the fact that $p(n)$ and
$\mathrm{spt}(n)$ can be expressed as traces of singular moduli.

($GW\Gamma$) for a set of small molecules.
  The computational scheme allows for the consistent inclusion of the vertex
both at the polarizability level and in the self-energy.
  A diagrammatic analysis shows that the self-energy formed with this
four-point vertex does not lead to double counting of diagrams, that can be
classified as direct ""bubbles"" and exchange diagrams.
  By removing the exchange diagrams from the self-energy, a simpler
approximation is obtained, called $GW^{\rm{tc-tc}}$.

performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously. Conventional MTL
works under the offline or batch setting, and suffers from expensive training

techniques have been applied to solve MTL problems. However, most existing
algorithms of online MTL constrain task relatedness into a presumed structure
via a single weight matrix, which is a strict restriction that does not always
hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a robust online MTL framework that
overcomes this restriction by decomposing the weight matrix into two
components: the first one captures the low-rank common structure among tasks
via a nuclear norm and the second one identifies the personalized patterns of
outlier tasks via a group lasso. Theoretical analysis shows the proposed
algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to the best linear model
in hindsight. Even though the above framework achieves good performance, the
nuclear norm that simply adds all nonzero singular values together may not be a
good low-rank approximation. To improve the results, we use a log-determinant
function as a non-convex rank approximation. The gradient scheme is applied to
optimize log-determinant function and can obtain a closed-form solution for
this refined problem. Experimental results on a number of real-world
applications verify the efficacy of our method.

that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected

Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms

development and drug discovery. Biochemical experiments or \textit{in vitro}
methods are very expensive, laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, \textit{in
silico} approaches including docking simulation and machine learning have been
proposed to solve this problem. In particular, machine learning approaches have
attracted increasing attentions recently. However, in addition to the known
drug-target interactions, most of the machine learning methods require extra
characteristic information such as chemical structures, genome sequences,
binding types and so on. Whenever such information is not available, they may
perform poor. Very recently, the similarity-based link prediction methods were
extended to bipartite networks, which can be applied to solve the DTI
prediction problem by using topological information only. In this work, we
propose a method based on low-rank matrix projection to solve the DTI
prediction problem. On one hand, when there is no extra characteristic
information of drugs or targets, the proposed method utilizes only the known
interactions. On the other hand, the proposed method can also utilize the extra
characteristic information when it is available and the performances will be
remarkably improved. Moreover, the proposed method can predict the interactions
associated with new drugs or targets of which we know nothing about their
associated interactions, but only some characteristic information. We compare
the proposed method with ten baseline methods, e.g., six similarity-based
methods that utilize only the known interactions and four methods that utilize
the extra characteristic information. The datasets and codes implementing the

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.06338",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI) is needed for
most detection schemes developed for molecular communication (MC) systems.
Since the MC channel changes over time, e.g., due to variations in the velocity
of flow, the temperature, or the distance between transmitter and receiver, CSI
acquisition has to be conducted repeatedly to keep track of CSI variations.
Frequent CSI acquisition may entail a large overhead whereas infrequent CSI
acquisition may result in a low CSI estimation accuracy. To overcome these
challenges, we design codes which enable maximum likelihood sequence detection
at the receiver without instantaneous or statistical CSI. In particular,
assuming concentration shift keying modulation, we show that a class of codes,
referred to as strongly constant-weight (SCW) codes, enables optimal CSI-free
sequence detection at the expense of a decrease in data rate. For the proposed
SCW codes, we analyze the code rate, the error rate, and the average number of
released molecules. In addition, we study the properties of binary SCW codes
and balanced SCW codes in further detail. Simulation results verify our
analytical derivations and reveal that SCW codes with CSI-free detection
outperform uncoded transmission with optimal coherent and non-coherent
detection.

here extended to a class of pseudo-monotone operators in Banach spaces. On this

an operator is here reformulated as a minimization principle, extending a
method that was pioneered by Brezis, Ekeland and Nayroles for gradient flows.
This formulation is used to prove that the problem is stable w.r.t.\ arbitrary
perturbations not only of data but also of operators. This is achieved by using
the notion of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence w.r.t.\ a nonlinear topology of
weak type.
  These results are applied to the Cauchy problem for quasilinear parabolic
PDEs. This provides the structural compactness and stability of the model of
several physical phenomena: nonlinear diffusion, incompressible viscous flow,
phase transitions, and so on.

weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in

making use of objectness priors to generate foreground/background masks.
Unfortunately these priors either require pixel-level annotations/bounding

how foreground/background masks can be obtained from the activations of

state energy and the dependence of the chemical potential on the electron

thermodynamic potentials are derived by means of the Bogoliubov-Valatin
formalism. The thermodynamic potentials can be obtained by computing the free
energy of a gas of quasi-particles, whose energy spectrum is conditional on the
gap function. However, the nontrivial dependence of the gap on the temperature
jeopardises the validity of the standard thermodynamic relations. In this
article it is shown how the thermodynamic consistency (i.e. the validity of the
Maxwell relations) is recovered, and the correction terms to the
quasi-particles potentials are computed. It is shown that the
Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation avoids the problem of the thermodynamic
consistency of the quasi-particle approach; in facts, the correct
identification of the variables, which are associated with the quasi-particles,
leads to a precise calculation of the quasi-particles vacuum energy and of the
dependence of the chemical potential on the electron density. The stationarity
condition for the grand potential coincides with the gap equation, which
guarantees the thermodynamic consistency. The expressions of various
thermodynamic potentials, as functions of the (T,V,N) variables, are produced

process that is mediated by kinetochores, protein-complexes that assemble at
the centromere of each sister chromatid. Each kinetochore has to establish a
tight bipolar attachment to the spindle apparatus before sister-chromatid
separation is initiated. The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) links the
biophysical attachment status of the kinetochores to mitotic progression, and
ensures that even a single misaligned kinetochore keeps the checkpoint active.
The mechanism by which this is achieved is still elusive. Current computational
models of the human SAC disregard important biochemical properties by omitting
any kind of feedback loop, proper kinetochore signals, and other spatial
properties such as the stability of the system and diffusion effects. To allow
for more realistic in silico study of the dynamics of the SAC model, a minimal
mathematical framework for SAC activation and silencing is introduced. A
nonlinear ordinary differential equation model successfully reproduces
bifurcation signaling switches with attachment of all 92 kinetochores and
activation of APC/C by kinetochore-driven feedback. A partial differential
equation model and mathematical linear stability analyses indicate the
influence of diffusion and system stability. The conclusion is that
quantitative models of the human SAC should account for the positive feedback
on APC/C activation driven by the kinetochores which is essential for SAC
silencing. Experimental diffusion coefficients for MCC sub-complexes are found
to be insufficient for rapid APC/C inhibition. The presented analysis allows
for systems-level understanding of mitotic control and the minimal new model

improving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the
interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little
information is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for
applying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in
filling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in
healthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based
healthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software
patterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by
blockchain-based healthcare apps.

photonic band-gap fibres and hollow capillaries. The freezing of attenuated
out-of-equilibrium capillary waves during the drawing process is shown to
result in a reduced surface roughness. The roughness attenuation with respect
to the expected thermodynamical limit is determined to vary with the drawing
stress following a power law. A striking anisotropic character of the height
correlation is observed: glass surfaces thus retain a structural record of the
direction of the flow to which the liquid was submitted.

biofilms, based on a continuum approach and mass conservation principles is
presented. Diffusion of contaminants within the biofilm is described using a
diffusion-reaction equation. Binding sites formation and occupation are modeled
by two systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations are mutually
connected through the two growth rate terms. The model is completed with a
system of hyperbolic equations governing the microbial species growth within
the biofilm; a system of parabolic equations for substrates diffusion and
reaction and a nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing the free
boundary evolution. Two real special cases are modelled. The first one
describes the dynamics of a free sorbent component diffusing and reacting in a
multispecies biofilm. In the second illustrative case, the fate of two
different contaminants has been modelled.

  Behavior?","27 pages, 16 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent theoretical results together with established theory have identified
the displacement thickness and the velocity at the boundary layer edge as
similarity scaling parameter candidates for the wall-bounded turbulent boundary
layer. In the work described herein, we examine these scaling parameters along
with the Prandtl Plus scaling's and the Zagarola and Smits scaling's to search
for similarity in the outer region of experimental turbulent boundary layer
velocity profile datasets. A new integral area method combined with the
traditional chi-by-eye method is used to search for similar velocity profiles.
The results indicate that strict whole profile similarity is not evident in any
of the datasets we searched. However, ten datasets are found that display
""similar-like"" behavior using the ratio of the inner to outer thickness ratio
as a search criterion. In alignment with theory, the preferred similarity
scaling parameters for the similar-like behavior case are the displacement
thickness and the velocity at the boundary layer edge. It was found that there
are a few datasets for which the Prandtl Plus scaling and the Zagarola and
Smits scaling also work.

criterion for quasi-polynomial of second order. Time intervals between
deliveries of raw materials which make it possible to preserve stable

their range does not reach the steady state, although such state exists. To
prove this, a cascade of tank reactors coupled with mass recycle loop was
tested numerically. The above-mentioned phenomenon is characterized by the
location of the steady point out of the limit cycle in the phase portrait. This
incident may be beneficial to the process, as low steady state does not have to
exclude an independent increase of the conversion degree, despite being the
only state and not generating oscillations.

goods or services using users' past activities, such as item ratings or
purchase histories. If collections of such personal activities were made
publicly available, they could be used to personalize a diverse range of
services, including targeted advertisement or recommendations. However, there
would be an accompanying risk of privacy violations. The pioneering work of
Narayanan et al.\ demonstrated that even if the identifiers are eliminated, the
public release of user ratings can allow for the identification of users by
those who have only a small amount of data on the users' past ratings.
  In this paper, we assume the following setting. A collector collects user
ratings, then anonymizes and distributes them. A recommender constructs a
recommender system based on the anonymized ratings provided by the collector.
Based on this setting, we exhaustively list the models of recommender systems
that use anonymized ratings. For each model, we then present an item-based
collaborative filtering algorithm for making recommendations based on
anonymized ratings. Our experimental results show that an item-based
collaborative filtering based on anonymized ratings can perform better than
collaborative filterings based on 5--10 non-anonymized ratings. This surprising
result indicates that, in some settings, privacy protection does not
necessarily reduce the usefulness of recommendations. From the experimental
analysis of this counterintuitive result, we observed that the sparsity of the
ratings can be reduced by anonymization and the variance of the prediction can
be reduced if $k$, the anonymization parameter, is appropriately tuned. In this
way, the predictive performance of recommendations based on anonymized ratings
can be improved in some settings.
