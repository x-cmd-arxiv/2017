Antiproton Decelerator. Experiments aiming to test the fundamental CPT symmetry
and antigravity effects require the efficient detection of antihydrogen
annihilation events, which is performed using highly granular tracking
detectors installed around an antimatter trap. Improving the efficiency of the
antihydrogen annihilation detection plays a central role in the final
sensitivity of the experiments. We propose deep learning as a novel technique
to analyze antihydrogen annihilation data, and compare its performance with a
traditional track and vertex reconstruction method. We report that the deep

simultaneously improving performance by over 5% in terms of Area Under Curve

been measured in a heated rapid compression machine (RCM). At compressed
pressures of 15 and 30 bar, over the temperature range 800-950 K, and for
equivalence ratio of $\phi$ = 0.5 in air, no evidence of an NTC region of
overall ignition delay is found. By comparing the data from this study taken at
$\phi$ = 0.5 to previous data collected at $\phi$ = 1.0 (Weber et al. 2013), it
was found that the $\phi$ = 0.5 mixture was less reactive (as measured by the
inverse of the ignition delay) than the $\phi$ = 1.0 mixture for the same
compressed pressure. Furthermore, a recent chemical kinetic model of
iso-butanol combustion was updated using the automated software Reaction
Mechanism Generator (RMG) to include low- temperature chain branching pathways.
Comparison of the ignition delays with the updated model showed reasonable
agreement for most of the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, further work
is needed to fully understand the low temperature pathways that control
iso-butanol autoignition in the RCM.

such behavior is at least partially a coordinate effect. We are able to tune

large spikes appear in the Kretschmann scalar on the symmetry axis but away

The hybridization of Fe with the nearest neighbour $X$ ion is found to cause
redistribution of the on-site Fe charge and a net increase of its magnetic
moment proportional to the valence of $X$. Thus, late transition metals are
ideal Fe neighbours for producing high-moment Fe-based Heusler magnets. At the
same time a thermodynamic stability analysis is found to restrict $Z$ to main
group elements. Machine learning regressors, trained to predict magnetic moment
and volume of Heusler alloys, are used to determine the magnetization for all
materials belonging to the proposed prototype. We find that Co$_2$Fe$Z$ alloys,
and in particular Co$_2$FeSi, maximize the magnetization, which reaches values
up to 1.2T. This is in good agreement with both ab initio and experimental

First, in races with two candidates, the only well known alternatives to MR can
sometimes name as winner a candidate who is preferred over their opponent by
only one voter, with all others preferring the opponent. That is unacceptable.
Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic

result of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical
J-factors of dSphs are usually affected by significant errors. In this paper,
we study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective targets of interest. In the
framework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies
provides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and,
consequently, of their astrophysical J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for

of dSph galaxies. However, differently from dSphs an extra astrophysical
gamma-ray background component is expected in dIrrs, that is due to their
star-formation activity. In this paper, we show via a theoretical approach that
for galaxies in our sample the extra astrophysical background component is
negligible. Therefore, we conclude that dIrr galaxies can be potentially
considered as additional point-like targets for DM searches with gamma-rays. As
a first application of this study, we show the sensitivity limits of the

particle mass and annihilation cross-section. We conclude that the results of
the individual study of several dIrr galaxies are not yet competitive with
respect to the analysis of one of the most promising dSph galaxies, ie SEGUE1.
However, taking into account SEGUE1's symmetry-related uncertainties in the

conditions for geometric convergence are similar to those guaranteeing
posterior propriety. We also provide conditions for posterior propriety when
the design matrices take commonly observed forms. In general, the Haar
parameter expansion for DA (PX- DA) algorithm is an improvement of the DA
algorithm and it has been shown that it is theoretically at least as good as
the DA algorithm. Here we construct a Haar PX-DA algorithm, which has
essentially the same computational cost as the two-block Gibbs sampler.

extremely small by tuning the spin-orbit coupling strength. Although the

tilting the magnetization slightly away from the in-plane orientation. For the

hypothesis describing a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational motions of

where dL/dt represents the rate of change of barycentric orbital angular
momentum, omega sub alpha is the angular velocity of rotation, r is a position
vector identifying a particular location in a coordinate system rotating with
the Sun, and c is a coupling efficiency coefficient. This form of coupling has
no dependence on tides. The coupling expression defines a non-axisymmetric
global-scale acceleration field that varies both in space and with time.
Meridional components of acceleration typically dominate in equatorial and
middle latitudes, while zonal accelerations become increasingly significant at
higher latitudes. A comparison of the waveform of the putative dynamical
forcing function with the time series for measured solar meridional flow speeds
from Sunspot Cycle 23 yields correlations significant at the 99.9% level. We
introduce the possibility of a destructive interaction between the predicted
large-scale flows (due to orbit-spin coupling) and the dynamo mechanism(s) of
the 22-year magnetic activity cycle; observations in recent cycles of higher
meridional flow speeds during episodes of reduced solar sunspot activity may be
explained as a consequence of differences between the phasing of the magnetic
cycle and the phase of the forcing function. Algorithms are provided for
calculating meridional and zonal orbit-spin coupling accelerations within the

improve the BI-RADS classification performance. Additionally, the best
performing morphological feature subset was indicated. We obtained a better

features were the extent, overlap ratio, NRL entropy, circularity,
elliptic-normalized circumference and the normalized residual value. The area

populate the statistical distance scale diagrams with this sample and discuss
its significance in light of existing data and current calibrations.
  We glean from DR1 parallaxes 8 CSPNe with S/N$>$1. We show that this set of
potential calibrators doubles the number of extant trigonometric parallaxes
(from HST and ground-based), and increases by two orders of magnitude the
domain of physical parameters probed previously. We then use the combined
sample of suitable trigonometric parallaxes to fit the

calibration, although preliminary, appears solid on statistical grounds, and
suggestive of new PNe physics.
  With the tenfold improvement in PNe number statistics and astrometric

low-dimensional node vector representation for each node in the network. The
learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node
classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of
the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and
static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over
time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of
real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and
their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new
content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing
characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to
capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental
importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are
the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the
inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and
incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their
individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be
performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network
embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline
method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory
to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We
perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to
corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

thermal fluctuations and complex DNA conformations such as folds and loops make
it challenging to order genomic material for in vitro analysis. In this work,
we discover that rotation-induced macromolecular spooling of DNA around a
rotating microwire can monotonically order genomic bases, overcoming this
challenge. We use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize
long DNA strands deforming and elongating in shear flow near a rotating
microwire, in agreement with numerical simulations. While untethered DNA is
observed to elongate substantially, in agreement with our theory and numerical
simulations, strong extension of DNA becomes possible by introducing tethering.
For the case of tethered polymers, we show that increasing the rotation rate
can deterministically spool a substantial portion of the chain into a fully
stretched, single-file conformation. When applied to DNA, the fraction of
genetic information sequentially ordered on the microwire surface will increase
with the contour length, despite the increased entropy. This ability to handle
long strands of DNA is in contrast to modern DNA sample preparation
technologies for sequencing and mapping, which are typically restricted to
comparatively short strands resulting in challenges in reconstructing the
genome. Thus, in addition to discovering new rotation-induced macromolecular
dynamics, this work inspires new approaches to handling genomic-length DNA

Imaging (HARDI), a tensor field or a spherical function field (e.g., an
orientation distribution function field), can be estimated from measured
diffusion weighted images. In this paper, inspired by the microscopic
theoretical treatment of phases in liquid crystals, we introduce a novel
mathematical framework, called Director Field Analysis (DFA), to study local
geometric structural information of white matter based on the reconstructed
tensor field or spherical function field: 1) We propose a set of mathematical
tools to process general director data, which consists of dyadic tensors that
have orientations but no direction. 2) We propose Orientational Order (OO) and
Orientational Dispersion (OD) indices to describe the degree of alignment and
dispersion of a spherical function in a single voxel or in a region,
respectively; 3) We also show how to construct a local orthogonal coordinate
frame in each voxel exhibiting anisotropic diffusion; 4) Finally, we define
three indices to describe three types of orientational distortion (splay, bend,
and twist) in a local spatial neighborhood, and a total distortion index to
describe distortions of all three types. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to quantitatively describe orientational distortion (splay, bend, and
twist) in general spherical function fields from DTI or HARDI data. The
proposed DFA and its related mathematical tools can be used to process not only
diffusion MRI data but also general director field data, and the proposed

in statistical inference, signal processing, and machine learning. Common
examples of PLQ penalties include least squares, Huber, Vapnik, 1-norm, and
their asymmetric generalizations. Properties of these estimators depend on the
choice of penalty and its shape parameters, such as degree of asymmetry for the
quantile loss, and transition point between linear and quadratic pieces for the
Huber function. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework that can help
the modeler to automatically tune shape parameters once the shape of the
penalty has been chosen. The choice of the parameter is informed by the basic
notion that each QS penalty should correspond to a true statistical density.
The normalization constant inherent in this requirement helps to inform the
optimization over shape parameters, giving a joint optimization problem over
these as well as primary parameters of interest. A second contribution is to
consider optimization methods for these joint problems. We show that basic
first-order methods can be immediately brought to bear, and design specialized
extensions of interior point (IP) methods for PLQ problems that can quickly and
efficiently solve the joint problem. Synthetic problems and larger-scale
practical examples illustrate the potential of the approach.

generically display a finite-size correction proportional to the inverse

one-dimensional classical Ising model in the canonical ensemble, which for
classical models corresponds to the so-called fixed-magnetization ensemble. Our
method is useful for simulating finite systems which are not coupled to a

arranged in a regular pattern has been carried out at bulk Reynolds number and
roughness Reynolds number (based on sphere diameter) of approximately 6900 and
120, respectively, for which the flow regime is fully-rough. The open-channel
height was approximately 5.5 times the diameter of the spheres. Extending the
results obtained by Chan-Braun et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 684, 2011, 441) for
an open-channel flow in the transitionally-rough regime, the present purpose is
to show how the flow structure changes as the fully-rough regime is attained
and, for the first time, to enable a direct comparison with experimental
observations. The results indicate that, in the vicinity of the roughness
elements, the average flow field is affected both by Reynolds number effects
and by the geometrical features of the roughness, while at larger
wall-distances this is not the case, and roughness concepts can be applied. The
flow-roughness interaction occurs mostly in the region above the virtual origin
of the velocity profile, and the effect of form-induced velocity fluctuations
is maximum at the level of sphere crests. The spanwise length scale of
turbulent velocity fluctuations in the vicinity of the sphere crests shows the
same dependence on the distance from the wall as that observed over a smooth
wall, and both vary with Reynolds number in a similar fashion. Moreover, the
hydrodynamic force and torque experienced by the roughness elements are
investigated. Finally, the possibility either to adopt an analogy between the
hydrodynamic forces associated with the interaction of turbulent structures
with a flat smooth wall or with the surface of the spheres is also discussed,
distinguishing the skin-friction from the form-drag contributions both in the
transitionally-rough and in the fully-rough regimes.

isolation of the EIGs does not affect considerably their star-formation
compared to field galaxies. EIGs are typically `blue cloud' galaxies that fit
the `main sequence of star forming galaxies' and may show asymmetric star
formation and strong compact star-forming regions.
  We discovered surprising environmental dependencies of the HI content,
M$_{HI}$, and of the morphological type of EIGs; The most isolated galaxies (of
subsample EIG-1) have lower M$_{HI}$ on average (with $2.5\,\sigma$ confidence)
and a higher tendency to be early-types (with 0.94 confidence) compared to the
less isolated galaxies of subsample EIG-2. To the best of our knowledge this is
the first study that finds an effect in which an isolated sample shows a higher
fraction of early-types compared to a less isolated sample.
  Both early-type and late-type EIGs follow the same colour-to-M$_{*}$,
SFR-to-M$_{*}$ (`main sequence') and M$_{HI}$-to-$M_{*}$ relations. This
indicates that the mechanisms and factors governing star formation, colour and
the M$_{HI}$-to-M$_{*}$ relation are similar in early-type and late-type EIGs,

general galaxy population at $3<z<4.6$. We use the Michigan/Magellan Fiber
System (M2FS) spectrograph to study a stellar mass (M$_*$) selected sample of
625 galaxies homogeneously distributed in the range
$7.6<\log{\mbox{M$_*$/M$_{\odot}$}}<10.6$. Our sample is selected from the
3D-HST/CANDELS survey, which provides the complementary data to estimate
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths ($W_{Ly\alpha}$) and escape fractions ($f_{esc}$)
for our galaxies. We find both quantities to anti-correlate with M$_*$,
star-formation rate (SFR), UV luminosity, and UV slope ($\beta$). We then model
the $W_{Ly\alpha}$ distribution as a function of M$_{UV}$ and $\beta$ using a
Bayesian approach. Based on our model and matching the properties of typical
Lyman break galaxy (LBG) selections, we conclude that the $W_{Ly\alpha}$
distribution in such samples is heavily dependent on the limiting M$_{UV}$ of
the survey. Regarding narrowband surveys, we find their $W_{Ly\alpha}$
selections to bias samples toward low M$_*$, while their line-flux limitations
preferentially leave out low-SFR galaxies. We can also use our model to predict
the fraction of Ly$\alpha$-emitting LBGs at $4\leqslant z\leqslant 7$. We show
that reported drops in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction at $z\geqslant6$, usually
attributed to the rapidly increasing neutral gas fraction of the universe, can
also be explained by survey M$_{UV}$ incompleteness. This result does not
dismiss reionization occurring at $z\sim7$, but highlights that current data is
not inconsistent with this process taking place at $z>7$.

is more luminous and decays more slowly than other Ca-rich transients. Optical
and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy reveal signatures consistent with
the supernova explosion of a < 10 solar mass star that was stripped of its
H-rich envelope via binary interaction. Distinct chemical abundances and ejecta
kinematics suggest that the core collapse occurred through electron capture
processes. Deep limits on possible radio emission made with the Jansky Very

out mutual inclinations below 1.3 degrees as we do not observe transits of

clump formation. We extend our analysis to multi-component systems that consist
of gas and stars in an external potential. We then perform numerical
simulations of isolated disc galaxies with isothermal gas, and compare the
results with the prediction of our analytic model. Our model describes
accurately the evolution of the spiral arms in our simulations, even when
spiral arms dynamically interact with one another. We show that most of the
giant clumps formed in the simulated disc galaxies satisfy the instability
condition. The clump masses predicted by our model are in agreement with the
simulation results, but the growth time-scale of unstable perturbations is
overestimated by a factor of a few. We also apply our instability analysis to
derive scaling relations of clump properties. The expected scaling relation
between the clump size, velocity dispersion, and circular velocity is slightly
different from that given by the Toomre instability analysis, but neither is

second one, traced by young stellar populations YSP ($<$140 Myr), which is
concentrated in the central regions ($<$1.4 kpc). Our results are in agreement
with the epochs of the first peri-center passage ($\sim$200 Myr ago) and
coalescence ($<$100 Myr ago) predicted by dynamical models, and with high

concentrated within $<$2.8 kpc, where LINER-like ionization and high velocity
dispersion ($\sim$220 km/s) are found, consistent with the previously reported
outflow. As revealed by the highest resolution OSIRIS and HST data, a
collection of HII regions is also present in the plane of the galaxy, which
explains the mixture of ionization mechanisms in this system. It is unlikely
that the outflow in NGC 2623 will escape from the galaxy, given the low SFR

rate is 3 times lower than the current SFR, and the escape velocity in the

the continuum variability of deeply embedded protostars in eight nearby

one of the most promising Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios.
Recent studies have suggested that the rapid transfer of a very small amount of
helium from one WD to another is sufficient to ignite a helium shell detonation
that subsequently triggers a carbon core detonation, yielding a
""dynamically-driven double degenerate double detonation"" SN Ia. Because the
helium shell that surrounds the core explosion is so minimal, this scenario
approaches the limiting case of a bare C/O WD detonation. Motivated by
discrepancies in previous literature and by a recent need for detailed
nucleosynthetic data, we revisit simulations of naked C/O WD detonations in
this paper. We disagree to some extent with the nucleosynthetic results of
previous work on sub-Chandrasekhar-mass bare C/O WD detonations; e.g., we find
that a median-brightness SN Ia is produced by the detonation of a 1.0 Msol WD
instead of a more massive and rarer 1.1 Msol WD. The neutron-rich
nucleosynthesis in our simulations agrees broadly with some observational
constraints, although tensions remain with others. There are also discrepancies
related to the velocities of the outer ejecta and light curve shapes, but
overall our synthetic light curves and spectra are roughly consistent with
observations. We are hopeful that future multi-dimensional simulations will
resolve these issues and further bolster the dynamically-driven double
degenerate double detonation scenario's potential to explain most SNe Ia.

longest timescales, a charged disturbance (fracton) will acquire a screening
cloud of other fractons, resulting in only short-range correlations in the
system. At intermediate timescales, on the other hand, a fracton can only be
partially screened by a cloud of mobile excitations, leaving weak power-law
correlations in the system. Such residual power-law correlations may be a

asymmetries in the number counts in a variety of thin- and thick-disk
subsamples in regions of some 200 square degrees within 2 kpc in vertical

features as previously observed on other scales and at other distances from the
Sun. We additionally explore the scale height of the disk and the implied
offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane at different locations, noting that
the scale height of the disk can differ significantly when measured using stars
only above or only below the plane. Moreover, we compare the shape of the
number density distribution in the north for different latitude ranges with a
fixed range in longitude and find the shape to be sensitive to the selected
latitude window. We explain why this may be indicative of a change in stellar
populations in the latitude regions compared, possibly allowing access to the
systematic metallicity difference between thin- and thick-disk populations

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw2492",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The faster light-curve evolution of low-luminosity Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) suggests that they could result from the explosion of white dwarf (WD)
progenitors below the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$). Here we present 1D
non-LTE time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of pure central
detonations of carbon-oxygen WDs with a mass ($M_\rm{tot}$) between 0.88
M$_{\odot}$ and 1.15 M$_{\odot}$, and a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ yield between 0.08
M$_{\odot}$ and 0.84 M$_{\odot}$. Their lower ejecta density compared to
$M_{\rm Ch}$ models results in a more rapid increase of the luminosity at early
times and an enhanced $\gamma$-ray escape fraction past maximum light.
Consequently, their bolometric light curves display shorter rise times and
larger post-maximum decline rates. Moreover, the higher
$M(^{56}\rm{Ni})/M_\rm{tot}$ ratio at a given $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass enhances the
temperature and ionization level in the spectrum-formation region for the less
luminous models, giving rise to bluer colours at maximum light and a faster
post-maximum evolution of the $B-V$ colour. For sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ models fainter
than $M_B\approx -18.5$ mag at peak, the greater bolometric decline and faster
colour evolution lead to a larger $B$-band post-maximum decline rate, $\Delta
M_{15}(B)$. In particular, all of our previously-published $M_{\rm Ch}$ models
(standard and pulsational delayed detonations) are confined to $\Delta
M_{15}(B) < 1.4$ mag, while the sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ models with
$M_\rm{tot}\lesssim 1$ M$_{\odot}$ extend beyond this limit to $\Delta
M_{15}(B)\approx 1.65$ mag for a peak $M_B\approx -17$ mag, in better agreement
with the observed width-luminosity relation (WLR). Regardless of the precise
ignition mechanism, these simulations suggest that fast-declining SNe Ia at the
faint end of the WLR could result from the explosion of WDs whose mass is
significantly below the Chandrasekhar limit.

survey (HIPASS), ESO 435-IG 020 and ESO 435- G 016, a BCD pair were found in a
common, extended gas envelope of atomic hydrogen, providing an ideal case to
test the hypothesis that the starburst in BCDs can be indeed triggered by a
fly-by interaction. Using high-resolution data from the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA), we investigated HI properties and the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the BCD pair to study their interaction and star
formation histories. The high-resolution HI data of both BCDs reveal a number
of peculiarities, which are suggestive of tidal perturbation. Meanwhile, 40% of
the HIPASS flux is not accounted for in the ATCA observations with no HI gas
bridge found between the two BCDs. Intriguingly, in the residual of the HIPASS
and the ATCA data, 10% of the missing flux appears to be located between the
two BCDs. While the SED-based age of the most dominant young stellar population
is old enough to have originated from the interaction with any neighbors
(including the other of the two BCDs), the most recent star formation activity
traced by strong H$\alpha$ emission in ESO 435-IG 020 and the shear motion of
gas in ESO 435- G 016, suggest a more recent or current tidal interaction.
Based on these and the residual emission between the HIPASS and the ATCA data,
we propose an interaction between the two BCDs as the origin of their recently
enhanced star formation activity. The shear motion on the gas disk, potentially
with re-accretion of the stripped gas, could be responsible for the active star
formation in this BCD pair.

it declines with density as a power-law P~rho**(-2), which is exponentially

combination with the spherical infall model that works well for small

precision cosmology. We find that at 5-10% level the PDF explicitly depends on
redshift (at fixed sigma) and on cosmological density parameter Omega_m. We

network (FullLVNet), which is constituted by a deep convolution neural network
(CNN) for expressive feature embedding of cardiac structure; two followed
parallel recurrent neural network (RNN) modules for temporal dynamic modeling;
and four linear models for the final estimation. During the final estimation,
both intra- and inter-task relatedness are modeled to enforce improvement of
generalization: 1) respecting intra-task relatedness, group lasso is applied to
each of the regression tasks for sparse and common feature selection and
consistent prediction; 2) respecting inter-task relatedness, three phase-guided
constraints are proposed to penalize violation of the temporal behavior of the
obtained LV indices. Experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects show that
FullLVNet achieves high accurate prediction with our intra- and inter-task
relatedness, leading to MAE of 190mm$^2$, 1.41mm, 2.68mm for average areas,
RWT, dimensions and error rate of 10.4\% for the phase classification. This

Some recent reports that indicate a deviation from $\rm{L_x}$-T scaling in
groups compared to clusters have motivated us to study their physical
properties in depth. In this article, we report the extensive study on physical
properties of groups in comparison to the clusters through cosmological
hydrodynamic plus N-body simulations using ENZO 2.2 code. As additional
physics, radiative cooling, heating due to supernova and star motions, star
formation and stellar feedback has been implemented. We have produced a mock
sample of 362 objects with mass ranging from $5\times10^{12}\; \rm{M_{\odot}}$
to 2.5$\times 10^{15}\; \rm{M_{\odot}}$. Strikingly, we have found that objects
with mass below $\sim$ $8\times 10^{13}\;\rm{M_{\odot}}$ do not follow any of
the cluster self-similar laws in hydrostatics, not even in thermal and
non-thermal energies. Two distinct scaling laws are observed to be followed
with breaks at $\sim$ $8\times 10^{13}\;\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for mass, $\sim$1 keV
for temperature and $\sim$1 Mpc for radius. This places groups as a distinct
entity in the hierarchical structures, well demarcated from clusters. This
study reveals that groups are mostly far away from virialization, suggesting
the need for formulating new models for deciphering their physical parameters.
They are also shown to have high turbulence and more non-thermal energy stored,
indicating better visibility in the non-thermal regime.

of general many- body lattice spin systems due to local quantum quenches. We
obtain Lieb-Robinson-like bounds that are independent of the subsystem volume.
The main assumptions are that the Hamiltonian satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound
and that the volume of spheres on the lattice grows at most exponentially with
their radius. More specifically, the bound exponentially increases with time
but exponentially decreases with the distance between the subsystem and the
region where the quench takes place. The fact that the bound is independent of
the subsystem volume leads to stronger constraints (than previously known) on
the propagation of information throughout many-body systems. In particular, it
shows that bipartite entanglement satisfies an effective ""light cone"",
regardless of system size. Further implications to t density-matrix
renormalization-group simulations of quantum spin chains and limitations to the
propagation of information are discussed.

The states to be estimated are represented by spatially distributed,

locations of the states, we cluster the states in moderately sized groups and
propose a new hierarchical Dynamic Programming (DP) framework to compute
optimal sensing policies for each cluster that mitigates the computational cost
of planning optimal policies in the combined belief space. Then, we develop a
decentralized assignment algorithm that dynamically allocates clusters to
robots based on the pre-computed optimal policies at each cluster. The
integrated distributed state estimation framework is optimal at the cluster
level but also scales very well to large numbers of states and robot sensors.
We demonstrate efficiency of the proposed method in both simulations and
real-world experiments using stereoscopic vision sensors.

massive particles, decaying with significant displacement from the interaction
point. The best sensitivity is achieved to models where the production and
decay occur due to different coupling constants, and the lifetime of exotic
particles determines the probability of decay within a detector. The lifetimes
of such particles can be independently limited from standard cosmology, in
particular the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we analyze the
constraints on the simplest scalar model coupled through the Higgs portal,
where the production occurs via $h\to SS$, and the decay is induced by the
small mixing angle of the Higgs field $h$ and scalar $S$. We find that
throughout the most part of the parameter space, $2 m_\mu < m_S < m_h/2$, the
lifetimes of exotic particle has to be less than 0.1 seconds, while below
$2m_\mu$ it could grow to about a second. The strong constraints on lifetimes
are induced by the nucleonic and mesonic decays of scalars that tend to raise
the $n/p$ ratio. Strong constraints on lifetimes of the minimal singlet
extensions of the Higgs potential is a welcome news for the MATHUSLA proposal
that seeks to detect displaced decays of exotic particles produced in the LHC
collisions. We also point out how more complicated exotic sectors could evade
the BBN lifetime constraints.

two-photon absorption. In this case, dissipative solitons are perturbed by
physical processes such as third-order dispersion, intrapulse Raman scattering,
self-steepening, and free-carrier generation. To solve the variational problem,
we adopt the Pereira--Stenflo soliton as an ansatz since this soliton is the
exact solution of the unperturbed GLE. With this ansatz, we derive a set of six
coupled differential equations exhibiting the dynamics of various pulse
parameters. This set of equations provides considerable physical insight in the
complex behavior of perturbed dissipative solitons. Its predictions are found
to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the GLE. More
specifically, the spectral and temporal shifts of the chirped soliton induced

Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $A_{n}$ with geometric parameter. For $k=1$

system, where multiple power beacons (PBs) supply power to a transmitter in
order to establish a reliable communication link with multiple legitimate users
in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The transmitter has to harvest radio
frequency (RF) energy from multiple PBs due to the shortage of embedded power
supply before establishing its secure communication. We consider two different
scenarios. In the first, the PBs and the transmitter belong to the same
operator, where we formulate the resource allocation problem as the
minimization of the total transmit power subject to the target secure rate
constraint. The solution of this problem yields both the optimal power and
energy transfer time allocation. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we
propose a two-level approach, where the inner level problem can be recast as a
convex optimization framework via conic convex reformulation, while the outer
level problem can be handled by using one-dimensional (1D) search. The second
scenario considers the case where the transmitter and the PBs belong to
different service suppliers. Hence, we formulate the resource allocation
problem where we consider incentives for the PBs to assist the transmitter.
This leads to the formulation of a Stackelberg game for the secure
wireless-powered multiantenna multicasting system. The transmitter has to pay
for the energy services from these multiple PBs in order to facilitate secure
communications. In this game, the transmitter and the PB are modelled as leader
and follower, respectively, in which both of them try to maximize their own
utility function. The closed-form Stackelberg equilibrium of the formulated
game is then derived. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our
proposed schemes.

new upper bounds on the smallest size $t_{2}(N,q)$ of a complete cap in

that this approach is far more resilient to the noise of the quantum annealers

within the CP-conserving 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I, for the detection
prospects of the charged $H^\pm$ state at Run II of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), assuming $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV as energy and ${\cal O}(100~{\rm fb}^{-1})$
as luminosity. When sufficiently light, this $h$ state can open up the bosonic
decay channel $H^\pm \to W^{\pm(*)}h$, which may have a branching ratio
significantly exceeding those of the $H^\pm \to \tau\nu$ and $H^\pm \to cs$
channels. We perform a broad scan of the 2HDM Type-I parameter space, assuming
the heavier of the two CP-even Higgs bosons, $H$, to be the observed SM-like
state with a mass near 125 GeV. Through these scans we highlight regions in
which $m_{H^\pm} < m_t +m_b$ that are still consistent with the most recent
limits from experimental searches. We find in these regions that, when the
$H^\pm \to W^{\pm(*)}h$ decay mode is the dominant one, the $h$ can be highly
fermiophobic, with a considerably large decay rate in the $\gamma\gamma$
channel. This can result in the total cross section of the $\sigma(pp\to H^\pm
h \to W^{\pm(*)} + 4\gamma)$ process reaching up to ${\cal O}(100~{\rm fb})$.
We therefore investigate the possibility of observing this spectacular signal
at the LHC Run II.

under image quantization noise. Assuming that a pair of images of a set of
targets is available, the camera moves through a sequence of Next-Best-Views
(NBVs), i.e., a sequence of views that minimize the trace of the targets'
cumulative state covariance, constructed using a realistic model of the stereo
rig that captures image quantization noise and a Kalman Filter (KF) that fuses
the observation history with new information. The proposed algorithm decomposes
control into two stages: first the NBV is computed in the camera relative
coordinates, and then the camera moves to realize this view in the fixed global
coordinate frame. This decomposition allows the camera to drive to a new pose
that effectively realizes the NBV in camera coordinates while satisfying
Field-of-View constraints in global coordinates, a task that is particularly
challenging using complex sensing models. We provide simulations and real
experiments that illustrate the ability of the proposed mobile camera system to
accurately localize sets of targets. We also propose a novel data-driven
technique to characterize unmodeled uncertainty, such as calibration errors, at
the pixel level and show that this method ensures stability of the KF.

often low densities make physical collisions likely outcomes. We use numerical
simulations to study the dynamical instabilities and planet-planet interactions
in a synthetically generated sample of closely-packed, high-multiplicity
systems. We focus specifically on systems resembling Kepler-11, a Kepler multi
with six planets, and run a suite of dynamical integrations, sampling the
initial orbital parameters around the nominal values reported in Lissauer et
al. (2011a), finding that most of the realizations are unstable, resulting in
orbit crossings and, eventually, collisions and mergers. We study in detail the
dependence of stability on the orbital parameters of the planets and
planet-pair characteristics to identify possible precursors to instability,
compare the systems that emerge from dynamical instabilities to the observed
Kepler sample (after applying observational corrections), and propose possible
observable signatures of these instabilities. We examine the characteristics of
each planet-planet collision, categorizing collisions by the degree of contact
and collision energy, and find that grazing collisions are more common than
direct impacts. Since the structure of many planets found in Kepler multis is
such that the mass is dominated by a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by
a low-density gaseous envelope, the sticky-sphere approximation may not be
valid, and we present hydrodynamic calculations of planet-planet collisions
clearly deviating from this approximation. Finally, we rerun a subset of our
dynamical calculations using instead a modified prescription to handle
collisions, finding, in general, higher multiplicity remnant systems.

in the literature, the community lacks a widely adopted standard format for
this data. This impedes both sharing and wide use by the community. Here we
introduce a new chemical kinetics experimental data format, ChemKED, and the
related Python-based package for validating and working with ChemKED-formatted

need for a new solution. ChemKED currently supports the representation of
autoignition delay time measurements from shock tubes and rapid compression
machines. ChemKED-formatted files contain all of the information needed to
simulate experimental data points, including the uncertainty of the data.
ChemKED is based on the YAML data serialization language, and is intended as a
human- and machine-readable standard for easy creation and automated use.

where the Aleksandrov--Clark family of unitary perturbations is parametrized by
the scalars on the unit circle $\mathbb{T}\subset\mathbb{C}$.
  For a purely contractive $\Gamma$ the resulting perturbed operator $T_\Gamma$
is a contraction (a completely non-unitary contraction under the natural

  In this paper we investigate the Clark operator, i.e. a unitary operator that

singular integral operator yield representations of the adjoint Clark operator

little chance to achieve ignition at an acceptable energy level due to its

lower gas-fill density (=0.3 mg/cm3 4He) is proposed to ignite a high-foot
pusher capsule with a shorter pulse (~9ns). The peanut hohlraum requires about
2.5 MJ laser energy to achieve 306 eV peak drive temperature while the low-z
plasma electron density on the inner cone path is maintained very low which
results in little simulated Raman backscattering and the high-z bubble still
stays away from the inner cone path without the laser absorption in it, which
favor the drive symmetry control. Crossed-beam energy transfer is also
neglectable because the crossing position is far away from the LEH. The peanut
hohlraum can provide a good drive environment for capsule to achieve ignition,
so it is undoubted that it will add to the diversity of ICF approaches.

compelling efficiency to the community, whereas the accuracy of such models is

sketching as a novel technique of pursuing binary-weight CNNs, targeting at
more faithful inference and better trade-off for practical applications. Our
basic idea is to exploit binary structure directly in pre-trained filter banks
and produce binary-weight models via tensor expansion. The whole process can be
treated as a coarse-to-fine model approximation, akin to the pencil drawing
steps of outlining and shading. To further speedup the generated models, namely
the sketches, we also propose an associative implementation of binary tensor
convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that a proper sketch of AlexNet
(or ResNet) outperforms the existing binary-weight models by large margins on
the ImageNet large scale classification task, while the committed memory for
network parameters only exceeds a little.

obtain the signal attenuation expression. However, the general analytical PFG
signal attenuation expression based on the fractional derivative has not been
previously reported. Additionally, the reported modified-Bloch equations for
PFG anomalous diffusion in the literature yielded different results due to
their different forms. Here, a new integral type modified-Bloch equation based
on the fractional derivative for PFG anomalous diffusion is proposed, which is
significantly different from the conventional differential type modified-Bloch
equation. The merit of the integral type modified-Bloch equation is that the
original properties of the contributions from linear or nonlinear processes
remain unchanged at the instant of the combination. From the modified-Bloch
equation, the general solutions are derived, which includes the finite gradient
pulse width (FGPW) effect. The numerical evaluation of these PFG signal
attenuation expressions can be obtained either by the Adomian decomposition, or
a direct integration method that is fast and practicable. The theoretical
results agree with the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulations performed
in this paper. Additionally, the relaxation effect in PFG anomalous diffusion

We also give an explicit formula for the Chern-Mather class of $\tau_{m,n,k}$
as a class in projective space. The irreducibility of the intersection
cohomology characteristic cycle follows from the explicit computation of the
local Euler obstruction, a study of the `Tjurina transforms' of determinantal
varieties, and the Kashiwara-Dubson's microlocal index theorem.
  Our explicit formulas are based on calculations of degrees of certain Chern

graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis. During the reduction
process, issues were encountered with pressure-dependent reactions formulated
using the logarithmic pressure interpolation approach; these issues are
discussed and recommendations made to avoid ambiguity in its future

simulations of autoignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and perfectly
stirred reactor temperature response curves and extinction residence times,
over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. The
detailed and skeletal mechanisms agreed well, demonstrating the adequacy of the
resulting reduced chemistry for all the butanol isomers in predicting global
combustion phenomena. In addition, the skeletal mechanisms closely predicted
the time-histories of fuel mass fractions in homogeneous compression-ignition
engine simulations. The performance of each butanol isomer was additionally
compared with that of a gasoline surrogate with an antiknock index of 87 in a
homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulation. The gasoline surrogate was
consumed faster than any of the butanol isomers, with tert-butanol exhibiting
the slowest fuel consumption rate. While n-butanol and isobutanol displayed the

have found that rocky planets only have radii up to 1.5-2$R_{\oplus}$. Two
general hypotheses exist for the cause of the dichotomy between rocky and
gas-enveloped planets (or possible water worlds): either low mass planets do
not necessarily form thick atmospheres of a few wt. %, or the thick atmospheres
on these planets easily escape driven by x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
emissions from young parent stars. Here we show that a cutoff between rocky and
gas-enveloped planets due to hydrodynamic escape is most likely to occur at a
mean radius of 1.76$\pm$0.38 (2$\sigma$) $R_{\oplus}$ around Sun-like stars. We
examine the limit in rocky planet radii predicted by hydrodynamic escape across
a wide range of possible model inputs using 10,000 parameter combinations drawn
randomly from plausible parameter ranges. We find a cutoff between rocky and
gas-enveloped planets that agrees with the observed cutoff. The large
cross-section available for XUV absorption in the extremely distended primitive
atmospheres of low mass planets results in complete loss of atmospheres during
the ~100 Myr phase of stellar XUV saturation. In contrast, more massive planets
have less distended atmospheres and less escape, and so retain thick
atmospheres through XUV saturation and then indefinitely as the XUV and escape
fluxes drop over time. The agreement between our model and exoplanet data leads
us to conclude that hydrodynamic escape plausibly explains the observed upper

High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scans of patients with chronic

with diverse disease severity are acquired at two different centers. Textural
features from co-occurrence matrices and Gaussian filter banks are used to
characterize the lung parenchyma in the scans. Two robust versions of multiple
instance learning (MIL) classifiers, miSVM and MILES, are investigated. The
classifiers are trained with the weak labels extracted from the forced
expiratory volume in one minute (FEV$_1$) and diffusing capacity of the lungs
for carbon monoxide (DLCO). At test time, the classifiers output a patient
label indicating overall COPD diagnosis and local labels indicating the
presence of emphysema. The classifier performance is compared with manual
annotations by two radiologists, a classical density based method, and
pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The miSVM classifier performed better than
MILES on both patient and emphysema classification. The classifier has a
stronger correlation with PFT than the density based method, the percentage of
emphysema in the intersection of annotations from both radiologists, and the
percentage of emphysema annotated by one of the radiologists. The correlation
between the classifier and the PFT is only outperformed by the second
radiologist. The method is therefore promising for facilitating assessment of
emphysema and reducing inter-observer variability.

distribution of surfactants due to the bulk flow results in the generation of a
Marangoni stress which affects both the deformation as well as the bulk
rheology of the suspension. The present analysis is done for the limiting case
when the surfactant transport is dominated by the surface diffusion relative to
surface convection. As an example, we have used two commonly encountered bulk
flows, namely, uniaxial extensional flow and simple shear flow. With the
assumption of negligible inertial forces present in either of the phases, we
are able to show that both the surfactant concentration on the droplet surface
as well as the ratio of viscosity of the droplet phase with respect to the
suspending fluid has a significant effect on the droplet deformation as well as
the bulk rheology. It is seen that increase in the non-uniformity in surfactant
distribution on the droplet surface results in a higher droplet deformation and
a higher effective viscosity for either of linear flows considered. For the
case of simple shear flow, surfactant distribution is found to have no effect
on the inclination angle, however, a higher viscosity ratio predicts the
droplet to be more aligned towards the direction of flow.

simulating the double-Weyl semimetal with a pair of double-Weyl points by
engineering the atomic hopping in a three-dimensional optical lattice. We show
that the double-Weyl points with topological charges of \$pm2$ behave as sink
and source of Berry flux in momentum space connecting by two Fermi arcs and
they are stabilized by the \$C_{4h}$ point-group symmetry. By applying a
realizable \$C_4$ breaking term, we find that each double-Weyl point splits
into two single-Weyl points and obtain rich phase diagrams in the parameter
space spanned by the strengths of an effective Zeeman term and the \$C_4$
breaking term, which contains a topological and a normal insulating phases and
two topological Weyl semimetal phases with eight and four single-Weyl points,
apart from the double-Weyl semimetal phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate with
numerical simulations that (i) the mimicked double- and single-Weyl points can
be detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions after a Bloch
oscillation; (ii) the Chern number of different quantum phases in the phase
diagram can be extracted from the center shift of the hybrid Wannier functions,
which can be directly measured with the time-of-flight imaging; (iii) the band
topology of the \$C_4$ symmetric Bloch Hamiltonian can be detected simply from
measuring the spin polarization at the high symmetry momentum points with a
condensate in the optical lattice. The proposed system would provide a
promising platform for elaborating the intrinsic exotic physics of double-Weyl

in spherically symmetric space-time, and (ii) colliding scalar pulses in
plane-symmetric space-time. We used a dual-null formulation for evolving the
field equations, which enables us to locate the trapping horizons directly, and
also enables us to follow close to the large-curvature region due to its causal
integrating scheme. We observed that the fate of a perturbed wormhole is either
a black hole or an expanding throat depending on the total energy of the
structure, and its threshold depends on the coupling constant of the GB terms
($\alpha_{\rm GB}$). We also observed that a collision of large scalar pulses
will produce a large-curvature region, of which the magnitude also depends on
$\alpha_{\rm GB}$. For both models, the normal corrections ($\alpha_{\rm
GB}>0$) work for avoiding the appearance of singularity, although it is
inevitable. We also found that in the critical situation for forming a black

semiconducting spin devices such as spin diodes and bipolar spin transistors.
The recent emergence of 2D semiconductors could help overcome this basic
challenge. In this letter we report the first important step towards making 2D
semiconductor spin devices. We have fabricated a spin valve based on ultra-thin
(5 nm) semiconducting black phosphorus (bP), and established fundamental spin
properties of this spin channel material which supports all electrical spin
injection, transport, precession and detection up to room temperature (RT).
Inserting a few layers of boron nitride between the ferromagnetic electrodes
and bP alleviates the notorious conductivity mismatch problem and allows
efficient electrical spin injection into an n-type bP. In the non-local spin
valve geometry we measure Hanle spin precession and observe spin relaxation
times as high as 4 ns, with spin relaxation lengths exceeding 6 um. Our
experimental results are in a very good agreement with first-principles
calculations and demonstrate that Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism is
dominant. We also demonstrate that spin transport in ultra-thin bP depends
strongly on the charge carrier concentration, and can be manipulated by the
electric field effect.

theoretical developments of the diffusive shock acceleration theory in SNRs,
protons are expected to accelerate in SNRs at least up to the knee energy. If
SNRs are true generator of cosmic rays, they should accelerate not only protons
but also heavier nuclei with right proportion and the maximum energy of heavier
nuclei should be atomic mass (Z) times that of protons. In this work we
investigate the implications of acceleration of heavier nuclei in SNRs on
energetic gamma rays those are produced in hadronic interaction of cosmic rays
with ambient matter. Our findings suggest that the energy conversion efficiency
has to be nearly double for the mixed cosmic ray composition instead of pure
protons to explain the observation and secondly the gamma ray flux above few
tens of TeV would be significantly higher if cosmic rays particles can attain
energies Z times of the knee energy in lieu of 200 TeV, as suggested earlier
for non-amplified magnetic fields. The two stated maximum energy paradigm will

given network. The closeness centrality measure assigns a centrality value to
each node based on its accessibility to the whole network. In real life
applications, we are mainly interested in ranking nodes based on their
centrality values. The classical method to compute the rank of a node first
computes the closeness centrality of all nodes and then compares them to get
its rank. Its time complexity is $O(n \cdot m + n)$, where $n$ represents total
number of nodes, and $m$ represents total number of edges in the network. In
the present work, we propose a heuristic method to fast estimate the closeness
rank of a node in $O(\alpha \cdot m)$ time complexity, where $\alpha = 3$. We
also propose an extended improved method using uniform sampling technique. This
method better estimates the rank and it has the time complexity $O(\alpha \cdot
m)$, where $\alpha \approx 10-100$. This is an excellent improvement over the
classical centrality ranking method. The efficiency of the proposed methods is
verified on real world scale-free social networks using absolute and weighted

preferred, with $a^* \geq 0.7$, but a slowly-rotating black hole is not

Confronting the reported costs of a conventional machining and welding pathway
with an estimator of the costs incurred through an AM route utilising Direct
Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), we weave together four aspects: optimised
capacity utilisation, ancillary process steps, the effect of build failure, and
design adaptation. Recognising that AM users can fill unused machine capacity
with other, potentially unrelated, geometries, we posit a characteristic of
'fungible' build capacity. This aspect is integrated in the cost estimation
framework through computational build volume packing, drawing on a basket of
sample geometries. We show that the unit cost in mixed builds at full capacity
is lower than in builds limited to a single type of geometry; in our study this
results in a mean unit cost overstatement of 157%. The estimated manufacturing
costs savings from AM adoption range from 36% to 46%. Additionally, we indicate
that operating cost savings resulting from design adaptation are likely to far
outweigh the manufacturing cost advantage.

separated asteroid families. Exploiting these unique characteristics, and using
a modified version of the hierarchical clustering method we are able to remove
the majority of asteroid family members from the region. The remaining,
background asteroids should be of primordial origin, as the strong 5/2 and 7/3
mean-motion resonances with Jupiter inhibit transfer of asteroids to and from
the neighboring regions. The size-frequency distribution of asteroids in the
size range $17<D(\rm{km})<70$ has a slope $q\simeq-1$. Using Monte-Carlo
methods, we are able to simulate, and compensate for the collisional and
dynamical evolution of the asteroid population, and get an upper bound for its

workspace to gather different types of data. The robots have different roles
due to different capabilities: some gather data from the workspace (source
robots) and others receive data from source robots and upload them to a data
center (relay robots). The data-gathering tasks are specified locally to each
source robot as high-level Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, that capture
the different types of data that need to be gathered at different regions of
interest. All robots have a limited buffer to store the data. Thus the data
gathered by source robots should be transferred to relay robots before their
buffers overflow, respecting at the same time limited communication range for
all robots. The main contribution of this work is a distributed motion
coordination and intermittent communication scheme that guarantees the
satisfaction of all local tasks, while obeying the above constraints. The robot
motion and inter-robot communication are closely coupled and coordinated during
run time by scheduling intermittent meeting events to facilitate the local plan
execution. We present both numerical simulations and experimental studies to
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches that
predominantly require all-time network connectivity.

ranking problem for a large number of items. It is important to obtain
effective ranking results and at the same time obtain the results efficiently
in a timely manner for providing good user experience and saving computational
costs. Valuable prior research has been conducted for learning to efficiently
rank like the cascade ranking (learning) model, which uses a sequence of
ranking functions to progressively filter some items and rank the remaining
items. However, most existing research of learning to efficiently rank in
search is studied in a relatively small computing environments with simulated
user queries.
  This paper presents novel research and thorough study of designing and
deploying a Cascade model in a Large-scale Operational E-commerce Search
application (CLOES), which deals with hundreds of millions of user queries per
day with hundreds of servers. The challenge of the real-world application
provides new insights for research: 1). Real-world search applications often
involve multiple factors of preferences or constraints with respect to user
experience and computational costs such as search accuracy, search latency,
size of search results and total CPU cost, while most existing search solutions
only address one or two factors; 2). Effectiveness of e-commerce search
involves multiple types of user behaviors such as click and purchase, while
most existing cascade ranking in search only models the click behavior. Based
on these observations, a novel cascade ranking model is designed and deployed
in an operational e-commerce search application. An extensive set of
experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed work to address multiple
factors of effectiveness, efficiency and user experience in the real-world
application.

thermohaline circulation in a spherical shell in a parameter regime which only
allows transitions to multiple equilibria. We find that the first transition is
either continuous (Type-I) or drastic (Type-II) depending on the sign of the
transition number. The transition number depends on the system parameters and
$l_c$, which is the common degree of spherical harmonics of the first critical
eigenmodes, and it can be written as a sum of terms describing the nonlinear
interactions of various modes with the critical modes. We obtain the exact
formulas of this transition number for $l_c=1$ and $l_c=2$ cases. Numerically,
we find that the main contribution to the transition number is due to nonlinear
interactions with modes having zero wave number and the contribution from the
nonlinear interactions with higher frequency modes is negligible. In our
numerical experiments we encountered both types of transition for $Le<1$ but
only continuous transition for $Le>1$. In the continuous transition scenario,
we rigorously prove that an attractor in the phase space bifurcates which is
homeomorphic to the 2$l_c$ dimensional sphere and consists entirely of

the expansion rate predicted by various cosmological models. But the recent
application of 2-point diagnostics, such as Om(z_i,z_j) and Omh^2(z_i,z_j), has
produced considerable tension between LCDM's predictions and several
observations, with other models faring even worse. Part of this problem is
attributable to the continued mixing of truly model-independent measurements
using the cosmic-chronomter approach, and model-dependent data extracted from
BAOs. In this paper, we advance the use of 2-point diagnostics beyond their
current status, and introduce new variations, which we call Delta h(z_i,z_j),
that are more useful for model comparisons. But we restrict our analysis
exclusively to cosmic-chronometer data, which are truly model independent. Even
for these measurements, however, we confirm the conclusions drawn by earlier
workers that the data have strongly non-Gaussian uncertainties, requiring the
use of both ""median"" and ""mean"" statistical approaches. Our results reveal that
previous analyses using 2-point diagnostics greatly underestimated the errors,
thereby misinterpreting the level of tension between theoretical predictions
and H(z) data. Instead, we demonstrate that as of today, only Einstein-de
Sitter is ruled out by the 2-point diagnostics at a level of significance
exceeding ~ 3 sigma. The R_h=ct universe is slightly favoured over the
remaining models, including LCDM and Chevalier-Polarski-Linder, though all of

preserves unobstructed-ness of the Lagrangian Floer theory. Thus, this paper
generalizes earlier results by Wehrheim-Woodward and Mau's-Wehrheim-Woodward so
that it works in complete generality in the compact case. The main idea of the
proofs are based on Lekili-Lipiyansky's Y diagram and a lemma from homological

sentences in natural languages, is a crucial task for artificial intelligence
applications that need to extract meaning from natural language text or speech.
Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently
proven useful.
  In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of
parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented
evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a
state-of-the-art rule-based sentiment analysis system that determines the
polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the
system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models
with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however,
require less computational resources.
  The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results
in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant
influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively
high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests
that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over
accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate
models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy.

useful for Bayesian inference when it is computationally expensive to calculate
the true posterior, but a computationally cheap approximation is available; the
delayed-acceptance kernel targets the same posterior as its associated ""parent""
Metropolis-Hastings kernel. Although the asymptotic variance of the ergodic
average of any functional of the chain cannot be less than that obtained using
its parent, the average computational time per iteration can be much smaller
and so for a given computational budget the delayed-acceptance kernel can be
more efficient.
  When the asymptotic variance of the ergodic averages of all $L^2$ functionals
of the chain is finite, the kernel is said to be variance bounding. It has
recently been noted that a delayed-acceptance kernel need not be variance
bounding even when its parent is. We provide sufficient conditions for
inheritance: for non-local algorithms, such as the independence sampler, the
discrepancy between the log density of the approximation and that of the truth
should be bounded; for local algorithms, two alternative sets of conditions are
provided.
  As a by-product of our initial, general result we also supply sufficient
conditions on any pair of proposals such that, for any shared target
distribution, if a Metropolis-Hastings kernel using one of the proposals is
variance bounding then so is the Metropolis-Hastings kernel using the other

sparse linear models remains a challenge, mainly because of the complicated
limiting distributions of the widely used estimators, such as the lasso.
Several methods have been developed for constructing such intervals. Bootstrap
lasso+ols is notable for its technical simplicity, good interpretability, and
performance that is comparable with that of other more complicated methods.
However, bootstrap lasso+ols depends on the beta-min assumption, a theoretic
criterion that is often violated in practice. Thus, we introduce a new method,
called bootstrap lasso+partial ridge, to relax this assumption. Lasso+partial
ridge is a two-stage estimator. First, the lasso is used to select features.
Then, the partial ridge is used to refit the coefficients. Simulation results
show that bootstrap lasso+partial ridge outperforms bootstrap lasso+ols when
there exist small, but nonzero coefficients, a common situation that violates
the beta-min assumption. For such coefficients, the confidence intervals
constructed using bootstrap lasso+partial ridge have, on average, $50\%$ larger
coverage probabilities than those of bootstrap lasso+ols. Bootstrap
lasso+partial ridge also has, on average, $35\%$ shorter confidence interval
lengths than those of the de-sparsified lasso methods, regardless of whether
the linear models are misspecified. Additionally, we provide theoretical
guarantees for bootstrap lasso+partial ridge under appropriate conditions, and
implement it in the R package ""HDCI.""

essential part of this picture, but cannot describe the complete picture. Since
reading scholarly publications is an essential part of the research life cycle,
it is only natural to introduce measures for this activity in attempts to
quantify the efficiency, productivity and impact of an entity. Citations and
reads are significantly different signals, so taken together, they provide a
more complete picture of research activity. Most scholarly publications are now
accessed online, making the study of reads and their patterns possible.
Click-stream logs allow us to follow information access by the entire research
community, real-time. Publication and citation datasets just reflect activity
by authors. In addition, download statistics will help us identify publications
with significant impact, but which do not attract many citations. Click-stream
signals are arguably more complex than, say, citation signals. For one, they
are a superposition of different classes of readers. Systematic downloads by
crawlers also contaminate the signal, as does browsing behavior. We discuss the
complexities associated with clickstream data and how, with proper filtering,
statistically significant relations and conclusions can be inferred from
download statistics. We describe how download statistics can be used to
describe research activity at different levels of aggregation, ranging from
organizations to countries. These statistics show a correlation with
socio-economic indicators. A comparison will be made with traditional

dimensions on the unit disk. By a linearization around constant coefficients
and using a trigonometric basis, we calculate the linearized
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in terms of moments of the conduction coefficient
of the problem. By expanding this coefficient into angular trigonometric
functions and Legendre-M\""untz polynomials in radial coordinates, we can find a
lower-triangular representation of the parameter to data mapping. As a
consequence, we find an explicit solution formula for the corresponding inverse
problem. Furthermore, we also consider the problem with boundary data given
only on parts of the boundary while setting homogeneous Dirichlet values on the
rest. We show that the conduction coefficient is uniquely determined from
incomplete data of the linearized Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator with an

unstable wave equation, where the boundary input, given by the Neumann trace at
one end of the domain, is the sum of the control input and the total
disturbance. The latter is composed of a nonlinear uncertain feedback term and
an external bounded disturbance. Using the two boundary displacements as output
signals, we design a disturbance estimator that does not use high gain. It is
shown that the disturbance estimator can estimate the total disturbance in the
sense that the estimation error signal is in $L^2[0,\infty)$. Using the
estimated total disturbance, we design an observer whose state is exponentially
convergent to the state of original system. Finally, we design an
observer-based output feedback stabilizing controller. The total disturbance is
approximately canceled in the feedback loop by its estimate. The closed-loop
system is shown to be exponentially stable while guaranteeing that all the
internal signals are uniformly bounded.

in the observed relationship between specific angular momentum $j_\star$ and
the stellar mass $M_\star$ in early-type (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs).
Specifically, we exploit the observed star-formation efficiency and chemical
abundance to infer the fraction $f_{\rm inf}$ of baryons that infall toward the
central regions of galaxies where star formation can occur. We find $f_{\rm
inf}\approx 1$ for LTGs and $\approx 0.4$ for ETGs with an uncertainty of about
$0.25$ dex, consistent with a biased collapse. By comparing with the locally
observed $j_\star$ vs. $M_\star$ relations for LTGs and ETGs we estimate the
fraction $f_j$ of the initial specific angular momentum associated to the
infalling gas that is retained in the stellar component: for LTGs we find
$f_j\approx 1.11^{+0.75}_{-0.44}$, in line with the classic disc formation
picture; for ETGs we infer $f_j\approx 0.64^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$, that can be
traced back to a $z<1$ evolution via dry mergers. We also show that the
observed scatter in the $j_{\star}$ vs. $M_{\star}$ relation for both galaxy
types is mainly contributed by the intrinsic dispersion in the spin parameters
of the host dark matter halo. The biased collapse plus mergers scenario implies
that the specific angular momentum in the stellar components of ETG progenitors
at $z\sim 2$ is already close to the local values, in pleasing agreement with
observations. All in all, we argue such a behavior to be imprinted by nature
and not nurtured substantially by the environment.

capable of producing relativistic jets and could explain the diversity in
observations of collapsar explosions (e.g., gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
low-luminosity GRBs, and Type Ibc SNe). We use an unbinned maximum likelihood

background-only hypothesis using one year of data, and are able to place upper
limits on the total amount of isotropic equivalent energy that choked jet
core-collapse SNe deposit in cosmic rays ${\mathcal E}_{\rm cr}$ and the
fraction of core-collapse SNe which have a jet pointed towards Earth $f_{\rm

graph when an input observation is given. The input and the output could be two
different physical quantities. In particular, the input may not be a graph
signal at all or it could be agnostic to an underlying graph. We use a training
dataset to learn the proposed regression model by formulating it as a convex
optimization problem, where we use a graph-Laplacian based regularization to
enforce that the predicted target is a graph signal. Once the model is learnt,
it can be directly used on a large number of test data points one-by-one
independently to predict the corresponding targets. Our approach employs
kernels between the various input observations, and as a result the kernels are
not restricted to be functions of the graph adjacency/Laplacian matrix. We show
that the proposed kernel regression exhibits a smoothing effect, while
simultaneously achieving noise-reduction and graph-smoothness. We then extend
our method to the case when the underlying graph may not be known apriori, by
simultaneously learning an underlying graph and the regression coefficients.
Using extensive experiments, we show that our method provides a good prediction
performance in adverse conditions, particularly when the training data is
limited in size and is noisy. In graph signal reconstruction experiments, our
method is shown to provide a good performance even for a highly

irreversibility and its consequences in quantum processes. Here, we discuss how
entropy production provides a quantification of the irreversibility in open
quantum systems through the quantum fluctuation theorem. We start by
introducing a two-time quantum measurement scheme, in which the dynamical
evolution between the measurements is described by a completely positive,
trace-preserving (CPTP) quantum map (forward process). By inverting the
measurement scheme and applying the time-reversed version of the quantum map,
we can study how this backward process differs from the forward one. When the
CPTP map is unital, we show that the stochastic quantum entropy production is a
function only of the probabilities to get the initial measurement outcomes in
correspondence of the forward and backward processes. For bipartite open
quantum systems we also prove that the mean value of the stochastic quantum
entropy production is sub-additive with respect to the bipartition (except for
product states). Hence, we find a method to detect correlations between the
subsystems. Our main result is the proposal of an efficient protocol to
determine and reconstruct the characteristic functions of the stochastic
entropy production for each subsystem. This procedure enables to reconstruct
even others thermodynamical quantities, such as the work distribution of the
composite system and the corresponding internal energy. Efficiency and possible
extensions of the protocol are also discussed. Finally, we show how our
findings might be experimentally tested by exploiting the state-of-the-art
trapped-ion platforms.

National Synchrotron Light Source II storage ring lattice has helped to
mitigate the chaotic motion within its dynamic aperture. For a given dynamical

causing radio interferences. In this paper, we propose a novel Autonomic
Dissemination Method (ADM) which delivers messages in accordance with given

offline optimization process and an adaptation to the network characteristics.
The first step uses a genetic algorithm to find solutions that fit the network

each vehicle to dynamically adapt its broadcasting strategy not only with
respect to the network density, but also in accordance to the priority level of
the message to send. The experimental results show that ADM effectively uses
the radio resources even when there are globally many messages to send
simultaneously. Moreover, ADM allows to increase the message delivery ratio and
to reduce the latency and radio interferences.

distributed augmented Lagrangian algorithm to solve for the optimal flows
associated with each beam in the network. For each augmented Lagrangian
iteration, we propose a scaled gradient projection method to minimize the local
Lagrangian function that incorporates the local topology of each node in the
network. Simulation results show fast convergence of the algorithm in
comparison to simple distributed primal dual methods and highlight performance
gains over standard minimum distance-based routing.

of the continuity bound of the von Neumann entropy, i.e., the Audenaert-Fannes

These include the R\'enyi entropy and the min- and max- entropies. This allows
us to obtain local continuity bounds for these quantities as well. In obtaining
this bound, we first derive a more general result which may be of independent

maximizes a concave and G\^ateaux-differentiable function in an
$\varepsilon$-ball around a given state $\sigma$. Examples of such a function

However, PCA is an unsupervised method, therefore its subspace was not
consistent with the parameter. We thus tested a supervised method based on
Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR), which provides a subspace consistent with the
parameter. It also shares analogies with factorial discriminant analysis: the
method slices the database along the parameter variation, and builds the
subspace which maximizes the inter-slice variance, while standardizing the
total projected variance of the data. Nevertheless the performances of SIR were
not satisfying in standard usage, because of the non-monotonicity of the
unknown function linking the data to the parameter and because of the noise
propagation. We show that better performances can be achieved by selecting the
most relevant directions for parameter inference. Preliminary tests are
performed on synthetic pseudo-line profiles plus noise. Using one direction, we
show that compared to PCA, the error associated with SIR is 50$\%$ smaller on a
non-linear parameter, and 70$\%$ smaler on a linear parameter. Moreover, using
a selected direction, the error is 80$\%$ smaller for a non-linear parameter,

fundamental question in soft matter physics. It is well-known that the

conventional wisdom given by classic Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the decay length
increases with ion concentration for concentrated electrolytes and can be an
order of magnitude larger than the ion diameter in ionic liquids. We derive a
simple scaling theory that explains this anomalous dependence of the decay
length on ion concentration. Our theory successfully collapses the decay
lengths of a wide class of salts onto a single curve. A novel prediction of our
theory is that the decay length increases linearly with the Bjerrum length,
which we experimentally verify by surface force measurements. Moreover, we
quantitatively relate the measured decay length to classic measurements of the

This balance can lead to a host of novel optical phenomena, such as
unidirectional invisibility, loss-induced lasing, single-mode lasing from
multimode resonators, and non-reciprocal effects in conjunction with
nonlinearities. Because PT-symmetry has been thought of as fragile,
experimental realizations to date have been usually restricted to on-chip
micro-devices. Here, we demonstrate that certain features of PT-symmetry are
sufficiently robust to survive the statistical fluctuations associated with a
macroscopic optical cavity. We construct optical-fiber-based coupled-cavities
in excess of a kilometer in length (the free spectral range is less than 0.8
fm) with balanced gain and loss in two sub-cavities and examine the lasing
dynamics. In such a macroscopic system, fluctuations can lead to a
cavity-detuning exceeding the free spectral range. Nevertheless, by varying the
gain-loss contrast, we observe that both the lasing threshold and the growth of
the laser power follow the predicted behavior of a stable PT-symmetric
structure. Furthermore, a statistical symmetry-breaking point is observed upon
varying the cavity loss. These findings indicate that PT-symmetry is a more
robust optical phenomenon than previously expected, and points to potential
applications in optical fiber networks and fiber lasers.

keep these oscillators in sync with the daily day-night rhythm in the presence
of noise, circadian clocks must be coupled to the dark-light cycle. In this
manuscript, we study the entrainment of phase oscillators as a function of the
intrinsic noise in the system. Using stochastic simulations, we compute the
optimal coupling strength, intrinsic frequency and shape of the phase-response
curve, that maximize the mutual information between the phase of the clock and
time. We show that the optimal coupling strength and intrinsic frequency
increase with the noise, but that the shape of the phase-response curve varies
non-monotonically with the noise: in the low-noise regime, it features a
deadzone that increases in width as the noise increases, while in the
high-noise regime, the width decreases with the noise. These results arise from
a trade-off between maximizing stability -noise suppression - and maximizing
linearity of the input-output, i.e. time- phase, relation. We also show that

very low-dimensional field theory with geometric degrees of freedom. The
geometric approximation procedure consists of three steps. The first step is to
construct weighted graphs (we call information graphs) with vertices
representing subsystems (e.g. qubits or random variables) and edges
representing mutual information (or the flow of information) between
subsystems. The second step is to deform the adjacency matrices of the
information graphs to that of a (locally) low-dimensional lattice using the
graph flow equations introduced in the paper. (Note that the graph flow
produces very sparse adjacency matrices and thus might also be used, for
example, in machine learning or network science where the task of graph
sparsification is of a central importance.) The third step is to define an
emergent metric and to derive an effective description of the metric and
possibly other degrees of freedom. To illustrate the procedure we analyze
(numerically and analytically) two information graph flows with geometric
attractors (towards locally one- and two-dimensional lattices) and metric
perturbations obeying a geometric flow equation. Our analysis also suggests a
possible approach to (a non-perturbative) quantum gravity in which the geometry
(a secondary object) emerges directly from a quantum state (a primary object)
due to the flow of the information graphs.

blister test devices designed for measurement of energy release rate for
brittle thin films and to propose easy-to-implement solutions accordingly. To
this end, we provide a step-by-step guide for fabricating a blister test device
comprised of thin polystyrene films adhered to glass substrates. Thin films are
first transferred from donor substrates to an air-water interface, which is
then used as a platform to locate them on a receiver substrate. We embed a
microchannel at the back of the device to evacuate the air trapped in the
opening, through which the pressure is applied. We quantify the height and the
radius of the blister to estimate the adhesion energy using the available
expressions correlating the normal force and the moment with the shape of the
blister. The present blister test provided adhesion energy per unit area of $G
= 18 \pm 2$ $ \mbox{mJ}/{\mbox m}^2$ for polystyrene on glass, which is in good
agreement with the measurement of $G = 14 \pm 2$ $ \mbox{mJ}/{\mbox m}^2$ found

space-time supersymmetry was argued to emerge in the low-energy region by
tuning Dirac or Weyl semimetal to approach a superconducting quantum critical
point, at which the Dirac or Weyl fermion and the bosonic order parameter are
both massless. Here, we study under what circumstances can space-time
supersymmetry be realized at a quantum critical point. We demonstrate that the
Yukawa-type coupling between the massless fermion and massless boson can
dynamically generate an infinite number of non-supersymmetric terms in the
effective field theory of the boson. Owing to these terms, no space-time
supersymmetry emerges at the superconducting quantum critical points. The
results provide important constraint on the exploration of emergent space-time
supersymmetry in condensed matter systems.

spun up by tidal interaction with a close companion, either another star, a
brown dwarf, or a planet. We focus here on the case of red giants that are spun
up by tidal interaction with a planet. When the distance between the planet and
the star decreases, the spin period of the star decreases, the orbital period
of the planet decreases, and the reflex motion of the star increases. We study
the change rate of these three quantities when the circular orbit of a planet
of 15 M$_{J}$ that initially orbits a 2 M$_\odot$ star at 1 au shrinks under
the action of tidal forces during the red giant phase. We use stellar evolution
models coupled with computations of the orbital evolution of the planet, which
allows us to follow the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the
orbit in a consistent way. We obtain that the reflex motion of the red giant
star increases by more than 1 m s$^{-1}$ per year in the last $\sim$40 years
before the planet engulfment. During this phase, the reflex motion of the star
is between 660 and 710 m s$^{-1}$. The spin period of the star increases by
more than about 10 minutes per year in the last 3000 y before engulfment.
During this period, the spin period of the star is shorter than 0.7 year.
During this same period, the variation in orbital period, which is shorter than
0.18 year, is on the same order of magnitude. Changes in reflex-motion and spin
velocities are very small and thus most likely out of reach of being observed.
The most promising way of detecting this effect is through observations of
transiting planets, that is, through{\it } changes of the beginning or end of
the transit. A space mission like PLATO might be of great interest for
detecting planets that are on the verge of being engulfed by red giants.

energy equation of state parameter of the models is derived following the
mathematical treatment of PADE expansion. Unlike CPL parameterisation, the PADE
approximation provides different forms of the equation of state parameter which
avoid the divergence in the far future. Initially, we perform a likelihood
analysis in order to put constraints on the model parameters using solely
background expansion data and we find that all parameterisations are consistent
with each other. Then, combining the expansion and the growth rate data we test
the viability of PADE parameterisations and compare them with CPL and
$\Lambda$CDM models respectively. Specifically, we find that the growth rate of
the current PADE parameterisations is lower than $\Lambda$CDM model at low
redshifts, while the differences among the models are negligible at high
redshifts. In this context, we provide for the first time growth index of
linear matter perturbations in PADE cosmologies. Considering that dark energy
is homogeneous we recover the well known asymptotic value of the growth index,
namely $\gamma_{\infty}=\frac{3(w_{\infty}-1)}{6w_{\infty}-5}$, while in the
case of clustered dark energy we obtain $\gamma_{\infty}\simeq

existing problems to utilize vital data for real-time actions. Recently, IoT
technologies have been progressed but in the healthcare area, real-time actions
based on analyzed vital data are not considered sufficiently yet. The causes
are proper use of analyzing methods of stream / micro batch processing and
network cost. To resolve existing problems, we propose our vital data analysis
platform. Our platform collects vital data of Electrocardiograph and
acceleration using an example of wearable vital sensor and analyzes them to
extract posture, fatigue and relaxation in smart phones or cloud. Our platform
can show analyzed dangerous posture or fatigue level change. We implemented the
platform and we are now preparing a field test.

of distributions, they are not available in closed form. Furthermore, they
often are improper priors. Hence, they have never been used to draw inference
on the mixture parameters. The implementation and the properties of Jeffreys
priors in several mixture settings are studied. It is shown that the associated
posterior distributions most often are improper. Nevertheless, the Jeffreys
prior for the mixture weights conditionally on the parameters of the mixture
components will be shown to have the property of conservativeness with respect
to the number of components, in case of overfitted mixture and it can be
therefore used as a default priors in this context.

The cost rate, transition rate and post-jump distributions are under control.
The state space is Borel, and the transition and cost rates are locally
integrable along the drift. Under natural conditions, we establish the
optimality equation, justify the value iteration algorithm, and show the
existence of a deterministic stationary optimal policy. Applied to special

constructing exact solutions with quasiperiodic structure in modified gravity
theories, MGTs, and general relativity, GR. Such solutions are described by
generic off-diagonal metrics, nonlinear and linear connections and (effective)
matter sources with coefficients depending on all spacetime coordinates via
corresponding classes of generation and integration functions and (effective)
matter sources. There are studied effective free energy functionals and
nonlinear evolution equations for generating off-diagonal quasiperiodic
deformations of black hole and/or homogeneous cosmological metrics. The
physical data for such functionals are stated by different values of constants
and prescribed symmetries for defining quasiperiodic structures at cosmological
scales, or astrophysical objects in nontrivial gravitational backgrounds some
similar forms as in condensed matter physics. It is shown how quasiperiodic
structures determined by general nonlinear, or additive, functionals for
generating functions and (effective) sources may transform black hole like
configurations into cosmological metrics and inversely. We speculate on
possible implications of quasiperiodic solutions in dark energy and dark matter
physics. Finally, it is concluded that geometric methods for constructing exact

range of speech and audio processing applications including speech recognition,
audio event detection and computational paralinguistics, owing to their ability
to reduce factors of variations, for learning from speech. However, studies
have suggested to favor a certain type of convolutional operations when
building a deep convolutional neural network for speech applications although
there has been promising results using different types of convolutional
operations. In this work, we study four types of convolutional operations on
different input features for speech emotion recognition under noisy and clean
conditions in order to derive a comprehensive understanding. Since affective
behavioral information has been shown to reflect temporally varying of mental
state and convolutional operation are applied locally in time, all deep neural
networks share a deep recurrent sub-network architecture for further temporal
modeling. We present detailed quantitative module-wise performance analysis to
gain insights into information flows within the proposed architectures. In
particular, we demonstrate the interplay of affective information and the other
irrelevant information during the progression from one module to another.
Finally we show that all of our deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art

indicated that there is an inward decreasing of mass accretion rate with
decreasing radius. Consequently, we have a flatter density profile ($\rho
\propto r^{-p}$ with $p\propto 1.5-s$ in the case of $\dot{M}\propto r^{s}$, $0
\leq s<1$) compared to the case of a constant accretion rate (($\rho \propto
r^{-\frac{3}{2}}$). In order to describe this behavior two models have been
proposed: inflow-outflow solution and convection-dominated accretion flows. We
have studied the properties of a hot accretion flow in the presence of
convection, large scale magnetic field and outflow. We consider an axisymmetric
viscous flow in the steady state. We used the self-similar solutions to solve
the 1.5 dimensional inflow-outflow equations. We have assumed that the
convection as a free parameter in our model for simplicity. We have considered
two components of magnetic field (toroidal and vertical) in this paper. We have
shown that the strong convection makes the inflow accretes and rotates slower
while it becomes hotter and thicker. We have found that the thickness of the
disc deviates from non-convective solutions obviously. We have represented that
two components of magnetic field have the opposite effects on the thickness of
the disc and similar effects on the radial and angular velocities of the flow.

jets in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries is arguably the most
contentious claim in black hole astrophysics. Because jets are thought to
originate in the context of electromagnetism, and the modeling of Maxwell
fields in curved spacetime around black holes is challenging, various
approximations are made in numerical simulations that fall under the guise of
'ideal magnetohydrodynamics'. But the simplifications of this framework may
struggle to capture relevant details of real astrophysical environments near
black holes. In this work, we highlight tension between analytic and numerical
results, specifically between the analytically derived conserved Noether
currents for rotating black hole spacetimes and the results of general
relativistic numerical simulations (GRMHD). While we cannot definitively
attribute the issue to any specific approximation used in the numerical
schemes, there seem to be natural candidates, which we explore. GRMHD
notwithstanding, if electromagnetic fields around rotating black holes are
brought to the hole by accretion, we show from first principles that prograde
accreting disks likely experience weaker large-scale black hole-threading
fields, implying weaker jets than in retrograde configurations.

mechanics, as made of a (generally large) number of identical units and
exhibiting a (generally large) number of different configurations
(microstates), among which only equivalence classes (macrostates) are
accessible to observations. Further attention is devoted to evolving
statistical systems, and a simple case including only a possible event, E, and
related opposite event, $\neg$E, is examined in detail. In particular, the
expected evolution is determined and compared to the random evolution inferred
from a sequence of random numbers, for different sample populations. The
special case of radioactive decay is considered and results are expressed in
terms of the fractional time, $t/\Delta t$, where the time step, $\Delta t$, is
related to the decay probability, $p=p(\Delta t)$. An application is made to
data collections from selected academic courses, focusing on the extent to
which expected evolutions and model random evolutions fit to empirical random
evolutions inferred from data collections. Results could be biased by the
assumed number of students who abandoned their course, defined as suitable
impostors (SI). Extreme cases related to a lower and an upper limit of the SI
number are considered for a time step, $\Delta t=(1/12)$y, where fitting
expected evolutions relate to $0.003\le p\le0.200$. In conclusion, evolving
statistical systems made of academic courses are similar to poorly populated
samples of radioactive nuclides exhibiting equal probabilities, $p$, and time
steps, $\Delta t$, where inferred mean lifetimes, $\tau$, and half-life times,
