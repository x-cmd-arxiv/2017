quadrilateral meshes that uses direction fields and a frontal point insertion
strategy. Two types of direction fields are considered: asterisk fields and
cross fields. With asterisk fields we generate high quality triangulations,
while with cross fields we generate right-angled triangulations that are
optimal for transformation to quadrilateral meshes. The input of our algorithm
is an initial triangular mesh and a direction field calculated on it. The goal
is to compute the vertices of the final mesh by an advancing front strategy
along the direction field. We present an algorithm that enables to efficiently
generate the points using solely information from the base mesh. A
multi-threaded implementation of our algorithm is presented, allowing us to
achieve significant speedup of the point generation. Regarding the
quadrangulation process, we develop a quality criterion for right-angled
triangles with respect to the local cross field and an optimization process
based on it. Thus we are able to further improve the quality of the output
quadrilaterals. The algorithm is demonstrated on the sphere and examples of
high quality triangular and quadrilateral meshes of coastal domains are
presented.

  Making 2017",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In several realistic situations, an interactive learning agent can practice
and refine its strategy before going on to be evaluated. For instance, consider
a student preparing for a series of tests. She would typically take a few
practice tests to know which areas she needs to improve upon. Based of the
scores she obtains in these practice tests, she would formulate a strategy for
maximizing her scores in the actual tests. We treat this scenario in the
context of an agent exploring a fixed-horizon episodic Markov Decision Process
(MDP), where the agent can practice on the MDP for some number of episodes (not
necessarily known in advance) before starting to incur regret for its actions.
  During practice, the agent's goal must be to maximize the probability of
following an optimal policy. This is akin to the problem of Pure Exploration
(PE). We extend the PE problem of Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) to MDPs and propose
a Bayesian algorithm called Posterior Sampling for Pure Exploration (PSPE),
which is similar to its bandit counterpart. We show that the Bayesian simple
regret converges at an optimal exponential rate when using PSPE.
  When the agent starts being evaluated, its goal would be to minimize the
cumulative regret incurred. This is akin to the problem of Reinforcement
Learning (RL). The agent uses the Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning
algorithm (PSRL) initialized with the posteriors of the practice phase. We
hypothesize that this PSPE + PSRL combination is an optimal strategy for
minimizing regret in RL problems with an initial practice phase. We show
empirical results which prove that having a lower simple regret at the end of
the practice phase results in having lower cumulative regret during evaluation.

the QCD phase diagram. On the temperature and baryon chemical potential plane,
the ratio of the baryon number susceptibilities (up to fourth order) forms a
ridge along the phase boundary, and develops a sword shape mountain standing
upright around the CEP in a narrow and oblate region. This feature is model
independent and universal if the CEP exists. The measurement of the baryon
number susceptibilities from heavy-ion collision experiment is along the
freeze-out line. If the freeze-out line crosses the foot of the CEP mountain,
then one can observe the peaked baryon number susceptibilities along the
freeze-out line, and the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions has the
tallest magnitude. The data from the first phase of beam energy scan program at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions indicates that a peak of the kurtosis of

Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) with suitable forward detectors. The measured
proton recoil momentum (~< 100 MeV in the deuteron rest frame) specifies the
deuteron configuration during the high-energy process and permits a controlled
theoretical treatment of nuclear effects. Nuclear and nucleonic structure are
separated using methods of light-front quantum mechanics. The impulse
approximation (IA) to the tagged DIS cross section contains the free neutron
pole, which can be reached by on-shell extrapolation in the recoil momentum.
Final-state interactions (FSI) distort the recoil momentum distribution away
from the pole. In the intermediate-x region 0.1 < x < 0.5 FSI arise
predominantly from interactions of the spectator proton with slow hadrons
produced in the DIS process on the neutron (rest frame momenta ~< 1 GeV, target
fragmentation region). We construct a schematic model describing this effect,
using final-state hadron distributions measured in nucleon DIS experiments and
low-energy hadron scattering amplitudes. We investigate the magnitude of FSI,
their dependence on the recoil momentum (angular dependence, forward/backward
regions), their analytic properties, and their effect on the on-shell
extrapolation. We comment on the prospects for neutron structure extraction in
tagged DIS with EIC. We discuss possible extensions of the FSI model to other

contains strict \epsilon-optimal states) for studying SGoals, and we develop
kernels, like sort and permutation, on such structure. Finally, we present some

constraints on dark matter by looking for elastic scattering events between
dark matter particles and nuclei in underground detectors. However these
constraints weaken significantly in the sub-GeV mass region, simply because
light dark matter does not have enough energy to trigger detectors regardless
of the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Even if future experiments
lower their energy thresholds, they will still be blind to parameter space
where dark matter particles interact with nuclei strongly enough that they lose
enough energy and become unable to cause a signal above the experimental
threshold by the time they reach the underground detector. Therefore in case
dark matter is in the sub-GeV region and strongly interacting, possible
underground scatterings of dark matter with terrestrial nuclei must be taken
into account because they affect significantly the recoil spectra and event
rates, regardless of whether the experiment probes DM via DM-nucleus or
DM-electron interaction. To quantify this effect we present the publicly

Monte Carlo simulator of DM trajectories through the Earth taking underground
scatterings into account. Our simulation allows the precise calculation of the
density and velocity distribution of dark matter at any detector of given depth
and location on Earth. The simulation can also provide the accurate recoil
spectrum in underground detectors as well as the phase and amplitude of the
diurnal modulation caused by this shadowing effect of the Earth, ultimately
relating the modulations expected in different detectors, which is important to
decisively conclude if a diurnal modulation is due to dark matter or an

are clustered into four jets and paired such that the mass difference between
the two dijet systems is minimized. The excess occurs in the region
$M_1+M_2\sim 110\mbox{ GeV}$; about half of the excess is concentrated in the
region $M_1\sim 80\mbox{ GeV}$, $M_2\sim 25\mbox{ GeV}$, with a local
significance between $4.7\sigma$ and $5.5\sigma$, depending on assumptions
about hadronization uncertainties. The other half of the events are in a broad
excess near $M_1\sim M_2\sim 55\mbox{ GeV}$; these display a local significance
of $4.1-4.5\sigma$. We investigate the effects of changing the SM QCD Monte
Carlo sample, the jet-clustering algorithm, and the jet rescaling method. We
find that the excess is remarkably robust under these changes, and we find no
source of systematic uncertainty that can explain the excess. No analogue of

benchmark results on an abstract anaphora subset of the ARRAU corpus. This

syntactically plausible candidates and -- if disregarding syntax --
discriminates candidates using deeper features.

uses a deep bidirectional recurrent neural network (DBRNN) to learn the
correlation between sensory inputs and impending driver behavior achieving
accurate and high horizon action prediction. The proposed system performs
better than other existing systems on driver action prediction tasks and can
accurately predict key driver actions including acceleration, braking, lane

2018, a lightweight tracker based on an innovative Cylindrical Gas Electron
Multiplier (CGEM) detector is now under development. The analogue readout of
the CGEM enables the use of a charge centroid algorithm to improve the spatial
resolution to better than 130 um while loosening the pitch strip to 650 um,
which allows to reduce the total number of channels to about 10 000. The
channels are readout by 160 dedicated integrated 64-channel front-end ASICs,
providing a time and charge measurement and featuring a fully-digital output.
The energy measurement is extracted either from the time-over-threshold (ToT)
or the 10-bit digitisation of the peak amplitude of the signal. The time of the
event is generated by quad-buffered low-power TDCs, allowing for rates in
excess of 60 kHz per channel. The TDCs are based on analogue interpolation
techniques and produce a time stamp (or two, if working in ToT mode) of the
event with a time resolution better than 50 ps. The front-end noise, based on a
CSA and CR-RC2 shapers, dominate the channel intrinsic time jitter, which is
less than 5 ns r.m.s.. The time information of the hit can be used to
reconstruct the track path, operating the detector as a small TPC and hence
improving the position resolution when the distribution of the cloud, due to
large incident angle or magnetic field, is very broad. Event data is collected
by an off-detector motherboard, where each GEM-ROC readout card handles 4 ASIC
carrier PCBs (512 channels). Configuration upload and data readout between the
off-detector electronics and the VME-based data collector cards are managed by
bi-directional fibre optical links.

abundances in the full sample of massive Galactic AGB stars, previously studied
with hydrostatic models, by using more realistic extended model atmospheres. We
use a modified version of the spectral synthesis code Turbospectrum and
consider the presence of a circumstellar envelope and radial wind. The Rb and
Zr abundances are determined from the 7800 A Rb I resonant line and the 6474 A
ZrO bandhead, respectively, and we explore the sensitivity of the derived
abundances to variations of the stellar (Teff) and wind (M_loss, beta and vexp)
parameters in the extended models. The Rb and Zr abundances derived from the
best spectral fits are compared with the most recent AGB nucleosynthesis
theoretical models. The new Rb abundances are much lower (even 1-2 dex) than
those derived with the hydrostatic models, while the Zr abundances are similar.
The Rb I line profile and Rb abundance are very sensitive to the M_loss rate
but much less sensitive to variations of the wind velocity-law and the
vexp(OH). We confirm the earlier preliminary results based on a smaller sample
of massive O-rich AGB stars, that the use of extended atmosphere models can
solve the discrepancy between the AGB nucleosynthesis theoretical models and
the observations of Galactic massive AGB stars. The Rb abundances, however, are
still strongly dependent of the M_loss, which is unknown in these AGB stars.
Accurate M_loss rates in these massive Galactic AGB stars are needed in order
to break the models degeneracy and get reliable Rb abundances in these stars.

addressed in the early stages of the controller design, otherwise they could
lead to failure in the controller performance and consequently increase the
time and cost required for completing the controller verification and
validation (V&V) with more iterative loops. In this paper, a new control
approach is developed based on a nonlinear discrete sliding mode controller
(DSMC) formulation to mitigate the ADC imprecisions and model uncertainties. To
this end, a DSMC design is developed against implementation imprecisions by
incorporating the knowledge of ADC uncertainties on control inputs via an
online uncertainty prediction and propagation mechanism. Next, a generic online
adaptive law will be derived to compensate for the impact of an unknown
parameter in the controller equations that is assumed to represent the model
uncertainty. The final proposed controller is an integrated adaptive DSMC with
robustness to implementation and model uncertainties that includes (i) an
online ADC uncertainty mechanism, and (ii) an online adaptation law. The
proposed adaptive control approach is evaluated on a nonlinear automotive
engine control problem in real-time using a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) setup
with an actual electronic control unit (ECU). The results reveal that the
proposed adaptive control technique removes the uncertainty in the model fast,
and significantly improves the robustness of the controllers to ADC
imprecisions. This provides up to 60% improvement in the performance of the
controller under implementation and model uncertainties compared to a baseline
DSMC, in which there are no incorporated ADC imprecisions.

suggesting that surface Li enhancement in this group may be a transient episode

those Li-rich giants belonging to the latter group appear more anomalous in the
sense that they tend to show larger rotational velocities, and that their
elemental abundances (e.g., those of C and O derived from high-excitation

some spurious effect reflecting the difficulty of abundance derivation in stars
of higher rotation and activity. Our analysis confirmed considerable Be
deficiency as well as absence of 6Li as the general characteristics of Li-rich

system. Therefore, it might be possible to make conscious machines to overcome
human capabilities, which will have limitations as well as humans. In other
words, trying to overcome human capabilities with computers implies the
paradoxical conclusion that a computer will never overcome human capabilities
at all, or if the computer does, it should not be considered as a computer

sufficiently low amounts of statistical predictability as quantified by the

defined as the maximal size of a subset of $[k]^n$ that contains no
combinatorial line. We show that for $k \ge 3$ the density Hales-Jewett number
$c_{n,k}$ is equal to the maximal size of a cylinder intersection in the
problem $Part_{n,k}$ of testing whether $k$ subsets of $[n]$ form a partition.
It follows that the communication complexity, in the Number On the Forehead
(NOF) model, of $Part_{n,k}$, is equal to the minimal size of a partition of
$[k]^n$ into subsets that do not contain a combinatorial line. Thus, the bound
in \cite{chattopadhyay2007languages} on $Part_{n,k}$ using the Hales-Jewett
theorem is in fact tight, and the density Hales-Jewett number can be thought of
as a quantity in communication complexity. This gives a new angle to this well
studied quantity.
  As a simple application we prove a lower bound on $c_{n,k}$, similar to the
lower bound in \cite{polymath2010moser} which is roughly $c_{n,k}/k^n \ge
\exp(-O(\log n)^{1/\lceil \log_2 k\rceil})$. This lower bound follows from a
protocol for $Part_{n,k}$. It is interesting to better understand the
communication complexity of $Part_{n,k}$ as this will also lead to the better
understanding of the Hales-Jewett number. The main purpose of this note is to
motivate this study.

  In M4 we have identified two main populations of stars with different Na/O
content, lying on distinct AGBs in the mF438W vs. C_F275W,F336W,F438W and the V

of stars with different chemical abundances occupy different locations on the
so-called ""chromosome map"" photometric diagram. The spectroscopic+photometric
comparison of stellar populations along the AGB and the red giants of this GC
suggests that the AGB hosts stellar populations with a range in helium
abundances spanning from primordial up to high contents of Y~0.32. On the other
hand, from our dataset, there is no evidence for stars with extreme helium
abundance (Y~0.38) on the AGB, suggesting that the most He-rich stars of

the convergence speed might be too slow for large scale problems with a large

separable in some sense. In this paper, we analyze different types of
separability of some real-world engineering equations and establish a

the structure of the GS system, a multilevel block building (MBB) algorithm is
proposed, in which the target model is decomposed into a number of blocks,
further into minimal blocks and factors. Compare to the conventional GP, MBB
can make large reductions to the search space. This makes MBB capable of
modeling a complex system. The minimal blocks and factors are optimized and

difficulties due to the sizes of the matrices that need to be solved. Various
approximation schemes have been invoked, for example by truncating the spaces,
imposing seniority limits, or appealing to various symmetry schemes such as
pseudo-SU(3). This paper proposes a new symmetry scheme also based on SU(3).
This proxy-SU(3) can be applied to well-deformed nuclei, is simple to use, and
can yield analytic predictions. Purpose: To present the new scheme and its
microscopic motivation, and to test it using a Nilsson model calculation with
the original shell model orbits and with the new proxy set. Method: We invoke
an approximate, analytic, treatment of the Nilsson model, that allows the above
vetting and yet is also transparent in understanding the approximations
involved in the new proxy-SU(3). Results: It is found that the new scheme
yields a Nilsson diagram for well-deformed nuclei that is very close to the
original Nilsson diagram. The specific levels of approximation in the new
scheme are also shown, for each major shell. Conclusions: The new proxy-SU(3)
scheme is a good approximation to the full set of orbits in a major shell.
Being able to replace a complex shell model calculation with a symmetry-based
description now opens up the possibility to predict many properties of nuclei
analytically and often in a parameter-free way. The new scheme works best for
heavier nuclei, precisely where full microscopic calculations are most
challenged. Some cases in which the new scheme can be used, often analytically,
to make specific predictions, are shown in a subsequent paper.

non-experimental studies. Most propensity score methods assume that covariates
are measured without error. However, covariates are often measured with error,
which leads to biased causal effect estimates if the true underlying covariates
are the actual confounders. Although some studies have investigated the impact
of a single mismeasured covariate on estimating a causal effect and proposed
methods for handling the measurement error, almost no work exists investigating
the case where multiple covariates are mismeasured. In this paper, we examine
the consequences of multiple error-prone covariates when estimating causal
effects using propensity score-based estimators via extensive simulation
studies and real data analyses. We find that causal effect estimates are less
biased when the propensity score model includes mismeasured covariates whose
true underlying values are strongly correlated with each other. However, when
the measurement \emph{errors} are correlated with each other, additional bias
is introduced. In addition, it is beneficial to include correctly measured
auxiliary variables that are correlated with confounders whose true underlying
values are mismeasured in the propensity score model.

the wide sdB sample has been increased, finding an unexpected correlation

solution and spectral analysis of four new systems, BD-7.5977, EC11031-1348,
TYC2084-448-1 and TYC3871-835-1, and update the orbital solution of PG1104+243.
Using the whole sample of wide sdBs, we aim at finding possible correlations
between orbital and spectral properties, with as goal improving theoretical
models of Roche-lobe overflow. High-resolution spectra were obtained to
determine the radial velocities of both the sdB and MS components. Surface
gravities and temperatures of both component were derived from photometric
spectral-energy distributions. Spectral parameters of the cool companion were
verified using the GSSP code. Furthermore the amount of accreted mass was
estimated. Orbital parameters matching the earlier observed period-eccentricity
relation were found for three systems, while TYC 2084-448-1 is found to have a
lower eccentricity than expected from the period-eccentricity trend indicated
by the other systems. Based on new observations, the orbit of PG 1104+243 has a
small but significant eccentricity of 0.04 $\pm$ 0.02, matching other systems
with similar periods. Furthermore, a correlation between accreted mass and
orbital period was found, as well as a possible relation between the initial
mass-ratio and the final period-eccentricity. The wide sdB-binary sample shows
interesting possible correlations between orbital and spectral properties.
However, a larger sample is necessary to statistically validate them.

the lack of tangential motion and inaccurate distances of the halo stars, the
velocity moments in the Galactic halo have largely remained ""known unknowns"".
Fortunately, our off-centric position within the Galaxy allows us to estimate
these moments in the galacto-centric frame using the observed radial velocities
of the stars alone. We use these velocities coupled with the Hierarchical
Bayesian scheme, which allows easy marginalisation over the missing data (the
proper-motion, and uncertainty-free distance and line-of-sight velocity), to
measure the velocity dispersions, orbital anisotropy ($\beta$) and streaming
motion ($v_{\rm rot}$) of the halo main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and K-giant
(KG) stars in the inner stellar halo (r $\lesssim 15$ kpc). We study the
metallicity bias in kinematics of the halo stars and observe that the
comparatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$>-1.4$) and the metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq -
1.4$) MSTO samples show a clear systematic difference in $v_{\rm rot} \sim
20-40$ km s$^{-1}$, depending on how restrictive the spatial cuts to cull the
disk contamination are. The bias is also detected in KG samples but with less
certainty. Both MSTO and KG populations suggest that the inner stellar halo of
the Galaxy is radially biased i.e. $\sigma_r>\sigma_\theta$ or $\sigma_\phi$
and $\beta \simeq 0.5$. The apparent metallicity contrariety in the rotation
velocity among the halo sub-populations supports the co-existence of multiple
populations in the galactic halo that may have formed through distinct

cloud-free models of giant exoplanetary atmospheres over a range of equilibrium
temperatures, metallicities, C/O ratios and spanning non-irradiated and

community with theoretical emergent spectra and pressure-temperature profiles
over this range, along with those for several known hot Jupiters. The code can
generate self-consistent spectra at high resolution and has the potential to be
integrated into general circulation and non-equilibrium chemistry models as it
is optimised for efficiency and convergence. GENESIS paves the way for
high-fidelity remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres at high resolution

ISM is at a given radius in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) the X-ray data can be
used to measure the total enclosed mass of the galaxy. Differences from
optically-derived mass distributions therefore yield information about
departures from HE in the hot halos. The X-ray mass profiles in different
angular sectors of NGC 4649 are generally smooth with no significant azimuthal
asymmetries within \(12\) kpc. Extrapolation of these profiles beyond this
scale yields results consistent with the optical estimate. However, in the
central region (\(r < 3\) kpc) the X-ray data underpredict the enclosed mass,
when compared with the optical mass profiles. Consistent with previous results
we estimate a non-thermal pressure component accounting for \(30\%\) of the gas
pressure, likely linked to nuclear activity. In NGC 5846 the X-ray mass
profiles show significant azimuthal asymmetries, especially in the NE
direction. Comparison with optical mass profiles in this direction suggests
significant departures from HE, consistent with bulk gas compression and
decompression due to sloshing on \(\sim 15\) kpc scales; this effect disappears
in the NW direction where the emission is smooth and extended. In this sector
we find consistent X-ray and optical mass profiles, suggesting that the hot

galaxies across the MS, which also correlate with stellar age. At all
redshifts, galaxies that are quenching or quenched, and thus old, have high
$\Sigma_1$ (the projected density within the central 1 kpc), while younger,
star-forming galaxies span a much broader range of $\Sigma_1$, which includes
the high values observed for quenched galaxies, but also extends to much lower
values. As galaxies age and quench, the stellar age and the dispersion of
$\Sigma_1$ for fixed values of $M_{*}$ shows two different regimes, one, at the
low--mass end, where quenching might be driven by causes external to the
galaxies; the other, at the high--mass end, where quenching is driven by
internal causes, very likely the mass given the low scatter of $\Sigma_1$ (mass
quenching). We suggest that the monotonic increase of central density as
galaxies grow is one manifestation of a more general phenomenon of structural
transformation that galaxies undergo as they evolve.

accretion disc in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The ionisation parameter of
the inner disc at a radius $r$ from the black hole, $\xi(r)$, can be used to
infer information about the location of the corona. Here, a new formula is
derived that predicts $\xi(r,h)$ for a disc irradiated by a X-ray source at a
height $h$ above the black hole symmetry axis (i.e., a lamppost geometry). The
equation is independent of the black hole mass and the X-ray spectrum, and
accounts for the effects of gravitational light-bending on the ionisation state
and a variable coronal dissipation factor. We predict a strong ionisation
gradient across the surface of the inner disc that depends on the black hole
spin and lamppost height. For a fixed $h$, the ionisation parameter is also
expected to increase as $\lambda^3$, where $\lambda$ is the observed bolometric
Eddington ratio of the AGN. Comparing this formula to the observed
$\xi$-$\lambda$ relationship for Mrk 335 yields $h \propto \lambda^{0.5-0.6}$,
supporting the view of a dynamic X-ray corona in AGNs.

can only form in the most massive dark matter halos embedded within large scale
structures marked by galaxy over-densities that may extend up to 10 physical
Mpc. This scenario, however, has not been confirmed observationally, as the
search for galaxy over-densities around high-z quasars has returned conflicting
results. The field around the z=6.28 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524 (J1030) is unique
for multi-band coverage and represents an excellent data legacy for studying
the environment around a primordial SMBH. In this paper we present wide-area
(25x25 arcmin), Y- and J-band imaging of the J1030 field obtained with the near
infrared camera WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We built
source catalogues in the Y- and J-band, and matched those with our photometric
catalogue in the r, z, i bands presented in Morselli et al. (2014). We used
these new infrared data together with H and K and Spitzer/IRAC data to refine
our selection of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), extending our selection criteria
to galaxies in the range 25.2<zAB<25.7. We selected 21 robust high-z candidates
in the J1030 field with photometric redshift around 6 and colors i-z>=1.3. We
found a significant asymmetry in the distribution of the high-z galaxies in
J1030, supporting the existence of a coherent large-scale structure around the
quasar. We compared our results with those of Bowler et al. (2015), who adopted
similar LBGs selection criteria, and estimated an over-density of galaxies in
the field of delta = 2.4, which is significant at >4 sigma. The over-density
value and its significance are higher than those found in Morselli et al.

conceal the form of the resulting functions. We determine these infinite sums

the Lax operators corresponding to the Q-operators into a representation
involving only finite sums allows us to take the supertrace and to obtain the
explicit form of the Q-operators in terms of finite matrices for a given magnon

Q-operators from those of the lowest level. We exemplify this approach for

allows for exact analytical solutions of the dynamics. Our quench protocol
starts with a finite mass gap at early times and crosses a critical point or a
critical region, and we study the behaviour of one point functions of the
quenched operator at the critical point or in the critical region as a function
of the quench rate. For quench rates slow compared to the initial mass gap, we
find the expected Kibble-Zurek scaling. In contrast, for rates fast compared to
the mass gap, but slow compared to the inverse lattice spacing, we find scaling
behaviour similar to smooth fast continuum quenches. For quench rates of the
same order of the lattice scale, the one point function saturates as a function
of the rate, approaching the results of an abrupt quench. The presence of an
extended critical surface in the Kitaev model leads to a variety of scaling
exponents depending on the starting point and on the time where the operator is

extent of the slow (Kibble-Zurek) and fast quench regimes, and the onset of the

to the intrinsic complexity of the systems involved. Graph theory provides an
approach for making sense of such complexity, where allosteric proteins can be
represented as networks of amino acids. In this work, we establish the
eigenvector centrality metric in terms of the mutual information, as a mean of
elucidating the allosteric mechanism that regulates the enzymatic activity of
proteins. Moreover, we propose a strategy to characterize the range of the
physical interactions that underlie the allosteric process. In particular, the
well known enzyme, imidazol glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), is utilized to
test the proposed methodology. The eigenvector centrality measurement
successfully describes the allosteric pathways of IGPS, and allows to pinpoint
key amino acids in terms of their relevance in the momentum transfer process.
The resulting insight can be utilized for refining the control of IGPS
activity, widening the scope for its engineering. Furthermore, we propose a new
centrality metric quantifying the relevance of the surroundings of each
residue. In addition, the proposed technique is validated against experimental

methodologies proposed in the present work constitute a powerful and cost

formation activity. Radio jets have been argued to be an ideal mechanism for
direct interaction between the AGN and the host galaxy. A drawback of previous
surveys of AGN is that they are fundamentally limited by the degeneracy between
redshift and luminosity in flux-density limited samples. To overcome this
limitation, we present far-infrared Herschel observations of 74 radio-loud
quasars (RLQs), 72 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and 27 radio galaxies (RGs),
selected at 0.9<z<1.1 which span over two decades in optical luminosity. By
decoupling luminosity from evolutionary effects, we investigate how the star
formation rate (SFR) depends on AGN luminosity, radio-loudness and orientation.
We find that: 1) the SFR shows a weak correlation with the bolometric
luminosity for all AGN sub-samples, 2) the RLQs show a SFR excess of about a
factor of 1.4 compared to the RQQs, matched in terms of black hole mass and
bolometric luminosity, suggesting that either positive radio-jet feedback or
radio AGN triggering are linked to star-formation triggering and 3) RGs have
lower SFRs by a factor of 2.5 than the RLQ sub-sample with the same BH mass and
bolometric luminosity. We suggest that there is some jet power threshold at
which radio-jet feedback switches from enhancing star formation (by compressing
gas) to suppressing it (by ejecting gas). This threshold depends on both galaxy
mass and jet power.

report flux growth in a horizontal configuration with a temperature gradient
along the horizontal axis: a liquid transport growth analogous to the vapor
transport technique. In a typical liquid transport growth, the charge is kept
at the hot end of the refractory container and the flux melt dissolves the
charge and transfers it to the cold end. Once the concentration of charge is
above the solubility limit at the cold end, the thermodynamically stable phase
nucleates and grows. Compared to the vertical flux growth, the liquid transport
growth can provide a large quantity of crystals in a single growth since the
charge/flux ratio is not limited by the solubility limit at the growth
temperature. This technique is complementary to the vertical flux growth and
can be considered when a large amount of crystals are needed but the yield from
the conventional vertical flux growth is limited. We applied this technique to

advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its
path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies
conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies, and
makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the
remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond.
  This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its
inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect
the credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in
the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling
flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across
those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly
connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the network's core and provide
high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base
of around 112,000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10
highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be
withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway
tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale
exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not
always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers
according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were
used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to
mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the
health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity,

The approach is illustrated on a delayed logistic equation set not far away
from its Hopf bifurcation point in the parameter space. In this case, we show
that low-dimensional controls for a standard quadratic cost functional can be
efficiently computed from Galerkin-Koornwinder approximations to reduce at a
nearly optimal cost the oscillation amplitude displayed by the DDE's solution.
Optimal controls computed from the Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) and the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) associated with the corresponding ODE

finally argued that the value function computed from the corresponding reduced

demonstrate its accuracy in modeling the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole

The model describes the clustering of galaxies in the context of a halo model
and the clustering of the underlying halos in redshift space using a
combination of Eulerian perturbation theory and $N$-body simulations. The
modeling of redshift-space distortions is done using the so-called distribution
function approach. The final model has 13 free parameters, and each parameter
is physically motivated rather than a nuisance parameter, which allows the use
of well-motivated priors. We account for the Finger-of-God effect from centrals
and both isolated and non-isolated satellites rather than using a single
velocity dispersion to describe the combined effect. We test and validate the
accuracy of the model on several sets of high-fidelity $N$-body simulations, as
well as realistic mock catalogs designed to simulate the BOSS DR12 CMASS data
set. The suite of simulations covers a range of cosmologies and galaxy bias
models, providing a rigorous test of the level of theoretical systematics
present in the model. The level of bias in the recovered values of $f \sigma_8$
is found to be small. When including scales to $k = 0.4 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
we find 15-30\% gains in the statistical precision of $f \sigma_8$ relative to
$k = 0.2 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and a roughly 10-15\% improvement for the
perpendicular Alcock-Paczynski parameter $\alpha_\perp$. Using the BOSS DR12
CMASS mocks as a benchmark for comparison, we estimate an uncertainty on $f
\sigma_8$ that is $\sim$10-20\% larger than other similar Fourier-space RSD

that these models likely have a too-limited parametrization.

beyond their occurrence in nature, and a deeper understanding of their dynamics
might be also helpful in order to shed further light on the dynamics of pure
two-dimenional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) flows and vice versa. The purpose
of the present paper is to make a step in this direction through a combination
of numerical and analytical work. The analytical part is mainly concerned with
the behavior of 2D3C flows in isolation and the connection between the geometry
of the nonlinear interactions and the resulting energy transfer directions.
Special emphasis is given to the role of helicity. We show that a generic 2D3C
flow can be described by two stream functions corresponding to the two helical
sectors of the velocity field. The projection onto one helical sector
(homochiral flow) leads to a full 3D constraint and to the inviscid
conservation of the total (three dimensional) enstrophy and hence to an inverse
cascade of the kinetic energy of the third component also. The coupling between
several 2D3C flows is studied through a set of suitably designed direct
numerical simulations (DNS), where we also explore the transition between 2D
and fully 3D turbulence. In particular, we find that the coupling of three 2D3C
flows on mutually orthogonal planes subject to small-scale forcing leads to
stationary 3D out-of-equilibrium dynamics at the energy containing scales. The
transition between 2D and 3D turbulence is then explored through adding a
percentage of fully 3D Fourier modes in the volume.

in microbiome studies, where the bacterial composition is estimated based on
the sequencing read counts. Due to limited sequencing depth and DNA dropouts,
many rare bacterial taxa might not be captured in the final sequencing reads,
which results in many zero counts. Naive composition estimation using count
normalization leads to many zero proportions, which tend to result in
inaccurate estimates of bacterial abundance and diversity. This paper takes a
multi-sample approach to the estimation of bacterial abundances in order to
borrow information across samples and across species. Empirical results from
real data sets suggest that the composition matrix over multiple samples is
approximately low rank, which motivates a regularized maximum likelihood
estimation with a nuclear norm penalty. An efficient optimization algorithm
using the generalized accelerated proximal gradient and Euclidean projection
onto simplex space is developed. The theoretical upper bounds and the minimax
lower bounds of the estimation errors, measured by the Kullback-Leibler

demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the naive estimators. The
method is applied to an analysis of a human gut microbiome dataset.

cannot be inferred reliably without accounting for the temporal variations of
its polarized light. This has been broadly overlooked in the modelling and
interpretation of the polarization due to technical problems (e.g., lack of
temporal resolution or of time-dependent MHD solar models) and/or because many
polarization measurements can apparently be explained without dynamics. Here,
we show that the temporal evolution is critic for explaining the spectral-line
scattering polarization because of its sensitivity to rapidly-varying physical
quantities and the possibility of signal cancellations and attenuation during
extended time integration. For studying the combined effect of time-varying
magnetic fields and kinematics, we solved the 1.5D NLTE problem of the second
kind in time-dependent 3D R-MHD solar models and we synthesized the Hanle and
Zeeman polarization in forward scattering for the chromospheric {\lambda}4227
line. We find that the quiet-sun polarization amplitudes depend on the
periodicity and spectral coherence of the signal enhacements produced by
kinematics, but that substantially larger linear polarization signals should
exist all over the solar disk for short integration times. The spectral
morphology of the polarization is discussed as a combination of Hanle, Zeeman,
dynamic effects and partial redistribution. We give physical references for
observations by degrading and characterizing our slit time-series in different
spatio-temporal resolutions. The implications of our results for the
interpretation of the second solar spectrum and for the investigation of the
solar atmospheric heatings are discussed.

combinatoric problems. We show here that enumerative combinatorics
(EC)\citep{book:Stanley-2011} is a natural setting for spin composition, and
easily leads to very general analytic formulae -- many of which hitherto not
present in the literature. Based on it, we propose three general methods for
computing spin multiplicities; namely, 1) the multi-restricted composition, 2)
the generalized binomial and 3) the generating function methods. Symmetric and
anti-symmetric compositions of $SU(2)$ spins are also discussed, using
generating functions. Of particular importance is the observation that while
the common Clebsch-Gordan decomposition (CGD) -- which considers the spins as
distinguishable -- is related to integer compositions, the symmetric and
anti-symmetric compositions (where one considers the spins as
indistinguishable) are obtained considering integer partitions. The integers in
question here are none other but the occupation numbers of the
Holstein-Primakoff bosons.
  \par The pervasiveness of $q-$analogues in our approach is a testament to the
fundamental role they play in spin compositions. In the appendix, some new
results in the power series representation of Gaussian polynomials (or
$q-$binomial coefficients) -- relevant to symmetric and antisymmetric
compositions -- are presented.

e.g., scientific datasets, social network information, videos, etc. In such

neither known in general how delays scale with the size of a request nor how
delays compare under different policies for coding, data dissemination, and
delivery.
  Motivated by these questions, we develop and explore a set of evolution
equations as a unified model which captures the above features. These equations
allow for both efficient simulation and mathematical analysis of several
delivery policies under general statistical assumptions. In particular, we
quantify in what sense a workload aware delivery policy performs better than a
workload agnostic policy. Under a dynamic or stochastic setting, the sample
path comparison of these policies does not hold in general. The comparison is
shown to hold under the weaker increasing convex stochastic ordering, still
stronger than the comparison of averages.
  This result further allows us to obtain insightful computable performance
bounds. For example, we show that in a system where files are divided into
chunks of equal size, replicated or erasure-coded, and disseminated across
servers at random, the job delays increase sub-logarithmically in the request
size for small and medium-sized files but linearly for large files.

problem of considerable theoretical and practical interest. Within the context
of Bayesian Networks, a practical and surprisingly successful solution to this
learning problem is achieved by adopting score-functions optimisation schema,
augmented with multiple restarts to avoid local optima. Yet, the conditions
under which such strategies work well are poorly understood, and there are also
some intrinsic limitations to learning the directionality of the interaction
among the variables. Following an early intuition of Friedman and Koller, we
propose to decouple the learning problem into two steps: first, we identify a
partial ordering among input variables which constrains the structural learning
problem, and then propose an effective bootstrap-based algorithm to simulate
augmented data sets, and select the most important dependencies among the
variables. By using several synthetic data sets, we show that our algorithm
yields better recovery performance than the state of the art, increasing the
chances of identifying a globally-optimal solution to the learning problem, and
solving also well-known identifiability issues that affect the standard

After these, more computationally demanding approaches like taint analysis can
focus on the identified sets that show collusion potential. This ""filtering""

also demonstrate that our tool scales by running it on a set of more than

is based on a power-of-two weight representation and, as a result, performs

computational cost of convolutional layers by precomputing convolution terms.
Such an optimization can be applied to any CNN architecture with a relatively
small codebook of weights and allows to decrease the number of product
operations by at least two orders of magnitude. The proposed architecture
targets custom inference accelerators and can be realized on FPGAs or ASICs.
Extensive evaluation on ImageNet shows that the state-of-the-art CNNs can be
converted without retraining into ShiftCNN with less than 1% drop in accuracy

reversal mechanism in surface oxidized nanowires as in their ferromagnetic

reversal mechanism activated in the central part of the wire with
characteristics of coherent rotation, which acts in synergy to wall propagation
leading to enhancement of the wall mobility. This effect is more pronounced in

system has a short orbital period of $\sim$1.11 days and consists of components
with M$_1$ = $0.447^{-0.047}_{+0.052}\,M_\odot$ and M$_2$ =
$0.399^{-0.042}_{+0.046}\,M_\odot$ in nearly circular orbits. The radii of the
two stars are R$_1$ = $0.540^{-0.032}_{+0.034}\,R_\odot$ and R$_2$ =
$0.453\pm0.017\,R_\odot$. Full system and orbital properties were determined
(to $\sim$10% error) by conducting an EBOP global modeling of the high
precision photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained by the KELT
Follow-up Network. Each star is larger by 17-28% and cooler by 4-10% than
predicted by standard (non-magnetic) stellar models. Strong H$\alpha$ emission
indicates chromospheric activity in both stars. The observed radii and
temperature discrepancies for both components are more consistent with those
predicted by empirical relations that account for convective suppression due to
magnetic activity.

spot structures with the characteristic length $\le 0.5$ nm. The conductance
spectra dI/dV(V) show the coexistence of smaller gaps $\Delta_S$ and large gaps
(pseudogaps) $\Delta_L$. The pseudogap-related features in the superconducting

the superconducting critical temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

$T$ above $T_c$. The $T$ dependences of the spatial distributions for both
relevant gaps ($\Delta$ map), as well as for each gap separately ($\Delta_S$
and $\Delta_L$) were obtained. From the histogram of $\Delta$ map, the averaged
gap values were found to be $\bar \Delta_S = \sim 24$ meV and $\bar \Delta_L =

distribution while the larger gap $\Delta_L$ is quite inhomogeneous, indicating
that rather homogeneous superconductivity coexists with the patchy distributed
pseudogap. The spatial variation length $\xi_{\Delta_L}$ of $\Delta_L$
correlates with the scale of the topography spot structures, being
approximately 0.4 nm. This value is considerably smaller than the coherence
length of this class of superconductors, suggesting that $\Delta_L$ is strongly

nonparametric regression model, when the errors are independent of the
covariates but may only have a $p$-th moment ($p\geq 1$). In such a
heavy-tailed regression setting, we show that if the model satisfies a standard
`entropy condition' with exponent $\alpha \in (0,2)$, then the $L_2$ loss of
the LSE converges at a rate \begin{align*}
\mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}}\big(n^{-\frac{1}{2+\alpha}} \vee
n^{-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2p}}\big). \end{align*} Such a rate cannot be improved
under the entropy condition alone.
  This rate quantifies both some positive and negative aspects of the LSE in a
heavy-tailed regression setting. On the positive side, as long as the errors
have $p\geq 1+2/\alpha$ moments, the $L_2$ loss of the LSE converges at the
same rate as if the errors are Gaussian. On the negative side, if
$p<1+2/\alpha$, there are (many) hard models at any entropy level $\alpha$ for
which the $L_2$ loss of the LSE converges at a strictly slower rate than other
robust estimators.
  The validity of the above rate relies crucially on the independence of the
covariates and the errors. In fact, the $L_2$ loss of the LSE can converge
arbitrarily slowly when the independence fails.
  The key technical ingredient is a new multiplier inequality that gives sharp
bounds for the `multiplier empirical process' associated with the LSE. We
further give an application to the sparse linear regression model with
heavy-tailed covariates and errors to demonstrate the scope of this new
inequality.

a family of distributions on the observed data, some of which assign very low
probabilities to the outliers. The set of distributions under consideration are
close to the empirical distribution in the sense of the Wasserstein metric. We
show that this DRO formulation can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem

one-photon absorption at $\hbar\omega$ with stimulated electronic Raman
scattering (virtual absorption at $2\hbar\omega$ followed by emission at

energy-dependence similar to that of 2D graphene, the zigzag nanoribbons
exhibit a richer structure at low photon energies, arising from divergences of

Gaussians, and discuss their applications to the estimation of mutual

very useful in optimization problems involving maximization/minimization of

May to 2016 December, and categorize their source regions into four classes (B,
C, M, and X) according to the maximum GOES magnitude of flares they generated.
We then retrieve SHARP related parameters for each selected region at the
beginning of its flare date to build a database. Finally, we train a
machine-learning algorithm, called random forest (RF), to predict the
occurrence of a certain class of flares in a given active region within 24
hours, evaluate the classifier performance using the 10-fold cross validation
scheme, and characterize the results using standard performance metrics.
Compared to previous works, our experiments indicate that using the HMI
parameters and RF is a valid method for flare forecasting with fairly
reasonable prediction performance. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that RF is used to make multi-class predictions of solar flares. We also find
that the total unsigned quantities of vertical current, current helicity, and
flux near polarity inversion line are among the most important parameters for
classifying flaring regions into different classes.

theoretically, the coupling mode that can surely stabilize the

exchange using lesser number of coordinates (commonly via a single coordinate).
In the present work, we propose that if the node dynamics are given by a pair

conventional way of single oscillator (say, {\it single oscillatory system}
SOS), then the information exchange via a single coordinate could be sufficient

with and without feedback (feedback means quorum sensing conditions). The TOS
effect has been found numerically both in the chaotic (R{\""o}ssler, Chua and

also increases as a side effect of TOS, the extent of $\beta$ enhancement
depends on the choice of oscillator model like larger for R{\""o}ssler,
intermediate for Chua and smaller for Lorenz.

GEMs in strong magnetic field have been run by means of the muon beam available

different gains, gas mixtures, with and without magnetic field. The obtained
efficiency is 97-98% on single coordinate view, in many operational

two different algorithms for the position determination: the charge centroid
and the micro time projection chamber (mu-TPC) methods. The two modes are
complementary and are able to cope with the asymmetry of the electron avalanche
when running in magnetic field, and with non-orthogonal incident tracks. With
the charge centroid, a resolution lower than 100 micron has been reached
without magnetic field and lower than 200 micron with a magnetic field up to 1
T. The mu-TPC mode showed to be able to improve those results. In the first

stability under different voltage configurations and particle intensities. The

are generated from the delicate balance between long-range order and its
quantum fluctuation. So far, the nature of quantum phase transitions has been
investigated by changing a limited number of external parameters such as
pressure and magnetic field. We propose a new approach for investigating
quantum criticality by changing the strength of quantum fluctuation that is
controlled by the dimensional crossover in metallic quantum well (QW)
structures of strongly correlated oxides. With reducing layer thickness to the
critical thickness of metal-insulator transition, crossover from a Fermi liquid
to a non-Fermi liquid has clearly been observed in the metallic QW of SrVO$_3$
by \textit{in situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Non-Fermi liquid
behavior with the critical exponent ${\alpha} = 1$ is found to emerge in the
two-dimensional limit of the metallic QW states, indicating that a quantum
critical point exists in the neighborhood of the thickness-dependent Mott
transition. These results suggest that artificial QW structures provide a
unique platform for investigating novel quantum phenomena in strongly
correlated oxides in a controllable fashion.

implement the network tracking as a min-cost flow problem, and propose a novel
optimization scheme to iteratively track the vessel structure by inherently
handling bifurcations and paths. The method was tested using both synthetic and

achieved maximum accuracies of more than 98\%. We further use the synthetic
data-set to analyse the sensibility of our method to parameter setting, showing

visual results. Still for real images, we present numerical and visual results

generally find that the response of the nonlocal observables is smoother than
that of the local ones. We discuss mechanisms which generate such smoothing, as
well as ""beats"" which appear in the time-dependence of the nonlocal operators

the smoothing is ineffective, we are able to perform ""entanglement

presupernova star carries information about the stellar radius and explosion
energy. Here the CASTRO code, which treats radiation transport using multigroup
flux-limited diffusion, is used to simulate the light curves and spectra of
shock breakout in very low-energy supernovae (VLE SNe), explosions in giant
stars with final kinetic energy much less than 10$^{51}$ erg. VLE SNe light
curves, computed here with the KEPLER code, are distinctively faint, red, and
long-lived, making them challenging to find with transient surveys. The
accompanying shock breakouts are brighter, though briefer, and potentially
easier to detect. Previous analytic work provides general guidance, but
numerical simulations are challenging due to the range of conditions and lack
of equilibration between color and effective temperatures. We consider previous
analytic work and extend discussions of color temperature and opacity to the
lower energy range explored by these events. Since this is the first
application of the CASTRO code to shock breakout, test simulations of normal
energy shock breakout of SN1987A are carried out and compared with the
literature. A set of breakout light curves and spectra are then calculated for
VLE SNe with final kinetic energies in the range $10^{47} - 10^{50}$ ergs for
red supergiants with main sequence masses 15 Msun and 25 Msun. The importance
of uncertainties in stellar atmosphere model, opacity, and ambient medium is
discussed, as are observational prospects with current and forthcoming

confirm that the molecule's J=1-0 transition exhibits maser action in this CSE,
as first suggested more than thirty years ago. The maser emission's radial
velocity peaking at a local standard of rest velocity of -39.862$\pm$0.065 km/s
indicates that it arises from an almost fully accelerated shell. Monitoring
observations show time variability of the SiS (1-0) maser. The two lowest-$J$
SiS quasi-thermal emission lines trace a much more extended emitting region
than previous high-J SiS observations. Their distributions show that the SiS
quasi-thermal emission consists of two components: one is very compact
(radius<1.5"", corresponding to <3$\times 10^{15}$ cm), and the other extends
out to a radius >11"". An incomplete shell-like structure is found in the
north-east, which is indicative of existing SiS shells. Clumpy structures are
also revealed in this CSE. The gain of the SiS (1-0) maser (optical depths of
about -5 at the blue-shifted side and, assuming inversion throughout the entire
line's velocity range, about -2 at the red-shifted side) suggests that it is
unsaturated. The SiS (1-0) maser can be explained in terms of ro-vibrational
excitation caused by infrared pumping, and we propose that infrared continuum
emission is the main pumping source.

However, due to explaining away and unobserved common inputs (Stevenson et al.,

physics contribution to $0\nu \beta \beta$ in such a scenario, particularly the
heavy-light neutrino mixing diagrams, can individually saturate the existing
experimental bounds, but their contributions to total $0\nu \beta \beta$
half-life cancels each other due to unitarity of the total $6\times 6$ mass
matrix. The effective contribution to half-life therefore, arises from the

find that the parameter space saturating the $0\nu \beta \beta$ bounds remain
allowed from the latest experimental bounds on charged lepton flavour violating
decays like $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$. We finally include the bounds from

$I(q_{Y|X})-R_n^* = \Theta(n^{-1/\mu})$.
  It is well known that the scaling exponent $\mu$ for any binary-input
memoryless channel (BMC) with $I(q_{Y|X})\in(0,1)$ is bounded above by $4.714$,
which was shown by an explicit construction of polar codes. Our main result
shows that $4.714$ remains to be a valid upper bound on the scaling exponent
for the AWGN channel. Our proof technique involves the following two ideas: (i)
The capacity of the AWGN channel can be achieved within a gap of
$O(n^{-1/\mu}\sqrt{\log n})$ by using an input alphabet consisting of $n$
constellations and restricting the input distribution to be uniform; (ii) The
capacity of a multiple access channel (MAC) with an input alphabet consisting
of $n$ constellations can be achieved within a gap of $O(n^{-1/\mu}\log n)$ by
using a superposition of $\log n$ binary-input polar codes. In addition, we
investigate the performance of polar codes in the moderate deviations regime
where both the gap to capacity and the error probability vanish as $n$ grows.
An explicit construction of polar codes is proposed to obey a certain tradeoff
between the gap to capacity and the decay rate of the error probability for the
AWGN channel.

mass above $M_{\rm a}$, in units of the group $r_{\rm vir}$. If $M_{\rm a}$ is
small (large), the outer DP of groups falls rapidly (slowly). We find that
there is an optimal $M_{\rm a}$ for which the stacked DP resembles the NFW

long-range NFW surface DPs (out to $\simeq 10\,r_{\rm vir}$) in the SDSS
observations using a galaxy assignment scheme that combines the non-linear
virialized regions of groups with their linear outer parts. The optimal $M_{\rm
a}$ scales as the minimum mass of the groups that are stacked to the power
$0.25-0.3$. Our results suggest that the NFW model does not solely originate
from violent relaxation. Moreover, populating haloes with galaxies using HOD

the development of new data-analysis methods. Photometric redshift estimation
is one field of application where such new methods improved the results,
substantially. Up to now, the vast majority of applied redshift estimation
methods have utilized photometric features. We aim to develop a method to
derive probabilistic photometric redshift directly from multi-band imaging
data, rendering pre-classification of objects and feature extraction obsolete.
A modified version of a deep convolutional network was combined with a mixture
density network. The estimates are expressed as Gaussian mixture models
representing the probability density functions (PDFs) in the redshift space. In
addition to the traditional scores, the continuous ranked probability score
(CRPS) and the probability integral transform (PIT) were applied as performance
criteria. We have adopted a feature based random forest and a plain mixture
density network to compare performances on experiments with data from SDSS
(DR9). We show that the proposed method is able to predict redshift PDFs
independently from the type of source, for example galaxies, quasars or stars.
Thereby the prediction performance is better than both presented reference
methods and is comparable to results from the literature. The presented method
is extremely general and allows us to solve of any kind of probabilistic
regression problems based on imaging data, for example estimating metallicity
or star formation rate of galaxies. This kind of methodology is tremendously
important for the next generation of surveys.

such that |R|=|F|, the Arbitrary Pattern Formation (APF) problem asks for a
distributed algorithm that moves robots so as to reach a configuration similar
to F. Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of
translations, rotations, reflections, uniform scalings. Initially, each robot
occupies a distinct position. When active, a robot operates in standard LCM
cycles. Robots are asynchronous, oblivious, anonymous, silent and execute the
same distributed algorithm. So far, the problem has been mainly addressed by
assuming chirality, that is robots share a common left-right orientation. We
are interested in removing such a restriction. While working on the subject, we
faced several issues that required close attention. We deeply investigated how
such difficulties were overcome in the literature, revealing that crucial
arguments for the correctness proof of the existing algorithms have been
neglected. The systematic lack of rigorous arguments with respect to necessary
conditions required for providing correctness proofs deeply affects the
validity as well as the relevance of strategies proposed in the literature.
Here we design a new deterministic distributed algorithm that fully
characterizes APF showing its equivalence with the well-known Leader Election
problem in the asynchronous model without chirality. Our approach is
characterized by the use of logical predicates in order to formally describe
our algorithm as well as its correctness. In addition to the relevance of our
achievements, our techniques might help in revising previous results. In fact,
it comes out that well-established results like [Fujinaga et al, SIAM J. Comp.

explores the Madala hypothesis, which is the introduction of a heavy scalar

several anomalous features observe in the LHC Run 1 data. This work extends the

Galactic and extragalactic measurements. This research is aimed at establishing
the confidence with which such parameters can be determined. This is relevant
for the data published in the context of the BeSSeL survey collaboration, but
also for future observations, in particular from the Southern Hemisphere. In
addition, some astrophysical properties of the masers can be constrained,
notably the luminosity function. We have simulated the population of
maser-bearing young stars associated with Galactic spiral structure, generating
several samples and comparing them with the observed samples used in the BeSSeL
survey. Consequently, we checked the determination of Galactic parameters for
observational biases introduced by the sample selection. Galactic parameters
obtained by the BeSSeL survey do not seem to be biased by the sample selection
used. In fact, the published error estimates appear to be conservative for most
of the parameters. We show that future BeSSeL data and future observations with
Southern arrays will improve the Galactic parameters estimates and smoothly
reduce their mutual correlation. Moreover, by modeling future parallax data
with larger distance and, thus, greater relative uncertainties for a larger
numbers of sources, we found that parallax-distance biasing is an important
issue. Hence, using fractional parallax uncertainty in the weighting of the
motion data is imperative. Finally, the luminosity function for 6.7 GHz
methanol masers was determined, allowing us to estimate the number of Galactic

types of semantic context, scene names of images and label map statistics of
image patches, are exploited to create label hierarchies between the original
classes and newly created subclasses as the learning supervisions. Such
subclasses show lower intra-class variation, and help CNN detect more
meaningful visual patterns and learn more effective deep features. Novel
training strategies and network structure that take advantages of such label
hierarchies are introduced. Our proposed method is evaluated extensively on
four popular datasets, Stanford Background (8 classes), SIFTFlow (33 classes),

Because of this, gaze
typing tends to be a slow and frustrating process. In this paper, we propose
SliceType, a soft keyboard that is optimized for gaze input. Our main design
objective is to use the screen area more efficiently by allocating a larger
area to the target keys. We achieve this by determining the keys that will not
be used for the next input, and allocating their space to the adjacent keys
with a merging animation. Larger keys are faster to navigate towards, and easy
to dwell on in the presence of eye tracking jitter. As a result, the user types
faster and more comfortably. In addition, we employ a word completion scheme
that complements gaze typing mechanics. A character and a related prediction is
displayed at each key. Dwelling at a key enters the character, and
double-dwelling enters the prediction. While dwelling on a key to enter a
character, the user reads the related prediction effortlessly. The improvements
provided by these features are quantified using the Fitts' law. The performance
of the proposed keyboard is compared with two other soft keyboards designed for
gaze typing, Dasher and GazeTalk. 37 novice users gaze-typed a piece of text
using all three keyboards. The results of the experiment show that the proposed
keyboard allows faster typing, and is more preferred by the users.

potentials---was recently introduced to generate various nonlinear localized
modes. Several attempts failed to stabilize two-dimensional (2D) solitons
against their intrinsic critical collapse in Kerr media. Here, we provide a
possibility for supporting 2D matter-wave solitons and vortices in an extended
setting---the cubic and quintic model---by introducing another nonlinear
lattice whose period is controllable and can be different from its cubic
counterpart, to its quintic nonlinearity, therefore making a fully `nonlinear
quasi-crystal'.
  A variational approximation based on Gaussian ansatz is developed for the
fundamental solitons and in particular, their stability exactly follows the
inverted \textit{Vakhitov-Kolokolov} stability criterion, whereas the vortex
solitons are only studied by means of numerical methods. Stability regions for
two types of localized mode---the fundamental and vortex solitons---are
provided. A noteworthy feature of the localized solutions is that the vortex
solitons are stable only when the period of the quintic nonlinear lattice is
the same as the cubic one or when the quintic nonlinearity is constant, while
the stable fundamental solitons can be created under looser conditions. Our
physical setting (cubic-quintic model) is in the framework of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) or nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation, the
predicted localized modes thus may be implemented in Bose-Einstein condensates

  Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making)",,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in simulation to construct policies useful
in real life is challenging. This is often attributed to the sequential
decision making aspect: inaccuracies in simulation accumulate over multiple
steps, hence the simulated trajectories diverge from what would happen in
reality.
  In our work we show the need to consider another important aspect: the
mismatch in simulating control. We bring attention to the need for modeling
control as well as dynamics, since oversimplifying assumptions about applying
actions of RL policies could make the policies fail on real-world systems.
  We design a simulator for solving a pivoting task (of interest in Robotics)
and demonstrate that even a simple simulator designed with RL in mind
outperforms high-fidelity simulators when it comes to learning a policy that is
to be deployed on a real robotic system. We show that a phenomenon that is hard
to model - friction - could be exploited successfully, even when RL is
performed using a simulator with a simple dynamics and noise model. Hence, we
demonstrate that as long as the main sources of uncertainty are identified, it
could be possible to learn policies applicable to real systems even using a
simple simulator.
  RL-compatible simulators could open the possibilities for applying a wide
range of RL algorithms in various fields. This is important, since currently
data sparsity in fields like healthcare and education frequently forces
researchers and engineers to only consider sample-efficient RL approaches.
Successful simulator-aided RL could increase flexibility of experimenting with
RL algorithms and help applying RL policies to real-world settings in fields
where data is scarce. We believe that lessons learned in Robotics could help
other fields design RL-compatible simulators, so we summarize our experience
and conclude with suggestions.

Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. In this case, the question becomes:
what BSM theories are consistent with the unexpected resonance? One possibility
would be a spin-2 object called the colorphilic graviton--a spin-2
color-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon
stress-energy tensors. We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in
the dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of
parameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by
LHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for
integrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$. We then delineate which of
those regions remain accessible to future collider searches, once one accounts
for applicability of the narrow-width approximation, detector mass resolution,
and self-consistency according to tree-level partial-wave unitarity. We
discover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes on collider
searches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC
dijet channel. A means of investigation would be to apply the color
discriminant variable (CDV), a dimensionless combination of quantities
(cross-section, decay width, and invariant mass) that can be quickly measured
after the discovery of a dijet resonance. Previous publications have
demonstrated the CDV's utility when applied to theories containing Z',
colorons, excited quarks, and diquarks. We extend this analysis to the
colorphilic graviton by applying the CDV to the appropriate region of parameter
space. We conclude that resolvable, discoverable dijet resonances consistent
with colorphilic gravitons span a narrower range of masses than those
consistent with leptophobic Z' models, and can be distinguished from those
originating from coloron, excited quark, and diquark models.

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural
networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and,
therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce
self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract
representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization,
neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit
variance. The activation function of SNNs are ""scaled exponential linear units""
(SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point
theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that
are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and
unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This
convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many
layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly
robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an
upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients
are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning
repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with
standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and
support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN
methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21

Program. We find 47 and 40 UDGs in Abell S1063 and Abell 2744, respectively.
Color-magnitude diagrams of the UDGs show that they are mostly located at the
faint end of the red sequence. From the comparison with simple stellar
population models, we estimate their stellar mass to range from $10^8$ to $10^9
M_\odot$. Radial number density profiles of the UDGs show a turnover or a
flattening in the central region at $r<100$ kpc. We estimate the total masses
of the UDGs using the galaxy scaling relations. A majority of the UDGs have
total masses, $M_{200} = 10^{10}$ to $10^{11}~M_\odot$, and only a few of them
have total masses, $M_{200} = 10^{11}$ to $10^{12}~M_\odot$. The total number
of UDGs within the virial radius is estimated to be N(UDG)$=770\pm114$ for
Abell S1063, and N(UDG)$=814\pm122$ for Abell 2744. Combining these results

UDGs and the masses of their host systems for $M_{200}>10^{13} M_\odot$ with a
power law, N(UDG) $= M_{200}^{1.05\pm0.09}$. These results suggest that a

are then presented by formulating the resulting equations of motion.
Furthermore, an input- output formalism is established, which provides a direct
connection to the dynamics of output states accessible with detectors. The
application-oriented cases of coherent and pulsed laser pumping are discussed
as inputs. Finally the single-photon dynamics in an optical cavity with
significant radiative loss - whose importance has to be contextualized in view
of the prospects of light-matter interaction applications - are reviewed
according to the proposed model. The formulation is kept as general as possible

framework, we infer retrospectively the parameters of the epidemic model for
each seasonal outbreak from 2012 to 2015, including: the effective reproduction
number; the initial susceptibility; the probability of admission to intensive
care given infection; and the effect of school closure on transmission. The
model is also implemented in real time to assess whether early forecasting of
the number of admission to intensive care is possible. Our model of admissions
data allows reconstruction of the underlying transmission dynamics revealing:
increased transmission during the season 2013/14 and a noticeable effect of
Christmas school holiday on disease spread during season 2012/13 and 2014/15.
When information on the initial immunity of the population is available,
forecasts of the number of admissions to intensive care can be substantially
improved. Readily available severe case data can be effectively used to
estimate epidemiological characteristics and to predict the evolution of an
epidemic, crucially allowing real-time monitoring of the transmission and

with a local absolute instability when a fixed boundary condition upstream is

creating a local periodic excitation near the boundary, which initiates waves
traveling both up and downstream. To confirm this, we performed analytical
analysis and numerical simulations of a modified Martiel-Goldbeter
reaction-diffusion model with the addition of an advection term. We provide a
quantitative description of the wave packet appearing in the convectively

high advection speed, it is suppressed. This type of instability can be
expected for reaction-diffusion systems that present both a convective
instability and an excitable regime. In particular, it can be relevant to
understand the signaling mechanism of the social amoeba Dictyostelium

particular investigation into resolving this issue; a conditional probability
interpretation that was first proposed by Page and Wooters. Those authors
addressed the apparent timelessness by subdividing a faux Universe into two
entangled parts, ""the clock"" and ""the remainder of the Universe"", and then
synchronizing the effective dynamics of the two subsystems by way of
conditional probabilities. The current treatment focuses on the possibility of
using a (somewhat) realistic clock system; namely, a coherent-state description
of a damped harmonic oscillator. This clock proves to be consistent with the
conditional probability interpretation; in particular, a standard evolution
operator is identified with the position of the clock playing the role of time
for the rest of the Universe. Restrictions on the damping factor are determined
and, perhaps contrary to expectations, the optimal choice of clock is not
necessarily one of minimal damping.

height (about 350 km) and the brightness of the host star make HD3167c an ideal

over 10^4 events with energies above 10 EeV, whose arrival directions appear to
be nearly isotropically distributed. On the other hand, the distribution of
matter in the nearby Universe -- and, therefore, presumably also that of UHECR
sources -- is not homogeneous. This is expected to leave an imprint on the
angular distribution of UHECR arrival directions, though deflections by cosmic
magnetic fields can confound the picture. In this work, we investigate
quantitatively this apparent inconsistency. To this end we study observables
sensitive to UHECR source inhomogeneities but robust to uncertainties on
magnetic fields and the UHECR mass composition. We show, in a rather
model-independent way, that if the source distribution tracks the overall
matter distribution, the arrival directions at energies above 30 EeV should
exhibit a sizeable dipole and quadrupole anisotropy, detectable by UHECR
observatories in the very near future. Were it not the case, one would have to
seriously reconsider the present understanding of cosmic magnetic fields and/or
the UHECR composition. Also, we show that the lack of a strong quadrupole
moment above 10 EeV in the current data already disfavours a pure proton
composition, and that in the very near future measurements of the dipole and
quadrupole moment above 60 EeV will be able to provide evidence about the UHECR

i.e. the time-dependent mechanisms by which the density field is irreversibly
mixed. This investigation is achieved using 'recurrent flow analysis'. We
identify (unstable) periodic orbits, which are embedded in the turbulent

volume-averaged kinetic energy dissipation rate and $\chi$ is the
volume-averaged density variance dissipation rate) varies non-monotonically
with the time-averaged buoyancy Reynolds numbers $\overline{Re}_B=
\overline{\mathcal{D}}/(\nu N_B^2)$, and is bounded above by $1/6$,
consistently with the classical model of Osborn (1980). There are qualitatively
different physical properties between the unstable orbits that have lower
irreversible mixing efficiency at low $\overline{Re}_B \sim O(1)$ and those
with nearly optimal $\mathscr{E} \lesssim 1/6$ at intermediate $\overline{Re}_B
\sim 10$. The weaker orbits, inevitably embedded in more strongly stratified
flow, are characterised by straining or 'scouring' motions, while the more
efficient orbits have clear overturning dynamics in more weakly stratified, and
apparently shear-unstable flow.

As complete subnetworks, the existence of cliques is ubiquitous in various
social, computer, and engineering networks. By clique gossiping, nodes interact
with each other along a sequence of cliques. Clique-gossip protocols are
defined as arbitrary linear node interactions where node states are vectors
evolving as linear dynamical systems. Such protocols become clique-gossip
averaging algorithms when node states are scalars under averaging rules. We
generalize the classical notion of line graph to capture the essential node
interaction structure induced by both the underlying network and the specific
clique sequence. We prove a fundamental eigenvalue invariance principle for
periodic clique-gossip protocols, which implies that any permutation of the
clique sequence leads to the same spectrum for the overall state transition
when the generalized line graph contains no cycle. We also prove that for a
network with $n$ nodes, cliques with smaller sizes determined by factors of $n$
can always be constructed leading to finite-time convergent clique-gossip
averaging algorithms, provided $n$ is not a prime number. Particularly, such
finite-time convergence can be achieved with cliques of equal size $m$ if and
only if $n$ is divisible by $m$ and they have exactly the same prime factors. A
proven fastest finite-time convergent clique-gossip algorithm is constructed
for clique-gossiping using size-$m$ cliques. Additionally, the acceleration
effects of clique-gossiping are illustrated via numerical examples.

a general search algorithm we name surprise search as a new method of
evolutionary divergent search. Surprise search is grounded in the divergent
search paradigm and is fabricated within the principles of evolutionary search.
The algorithm mimics the self-surprise cognitive process and equips
evolutionary search with the ability to seek for solutions that deviate from
the algorithm's expected behaviour. The predictive model of expected solutions
is based on historical trails of where the search has been and local
information about the search space. Surprise search is tested extensively in a
robot maze navigation task: experiments are held in four authored deceptive
mazes and in 60 generated mazes and compared against objective-based
evolutionary search and novelty search. The key findings of this study reveal
that surprise search is advantageous compared to the other two search
processes. In particular, it outperforms objective search and it is as
efficient as novelty search in all tasks examined. Most importantly, surprise
search is faster, on average, and more robust in solving the navigation problem
compared to any other algorithm examined. Finally, our analysis reveals that
surprise search explores the behavioural space more extensively and yields
higher population diversity compared to novelty search. What distinguishes
surprise search from other forms of divergent search, such as the search for
novelty, is its ability to diverge not from earlier and seen solutions but
rather from predicted and unseen points in the domain considered.

absorbing state where only the prey survives, while the other half attains a
stable coexistence state wherein both species remain active. At the domain
boundary, we observe a marked enhancement of the predator population density.
The predator correlation length displays a minimum at the boundary, before
reaching its asymptotic constant value deep in the active region. The frequency
of the population oscillations appears only very weakly affected by the
existence of two distinct domains, in contrast to their attenuation rate, which
assumes its largest value there. We also observe that boundary effects become
less prominent as the system is successively divided into subdomains in a
checkerboard pattern, with two different reaction rates assigned to neighboring
patches. When the domain size becomes reduced to the scale of the correlation
length, the mean population densities attain values that are very similar to

frequently found in nature and industry. Some examples are the air flows over
hills and desert dunes, but also water flows over aquatic dunes inside closed
conduits. The perturbation of a two-dimensional boundary layer by a hill
introduces new scales in the problem, changing the way in which velocities and
stresses are distributed along the flow. When in the presence of sediment
transport, the stress distribution along the hill is strongly related to bed
instabilities. This paper presents an experimental study on the perturbation of
a fully-developed turbulent boundary layer by a two-dimensional hill. Water
flows were imposed over a hill fixed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and
the flow field was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry. From the flow
measurements, mean and fluctuation fields were computed. The general behaviors
of velocities and stresses are compared to published asymptotic analyses and
the surface shear stress is analyzed in terms of instabilities of a granular
bed.

free of cost, user-friendly, versatile, robust, fast and provide reliable
statistics for different organisms (invertebrates, vertebrates and mammals) are
significantly limited.
  2. We present an automated open-source executable software (ToxTrac) for
image-based tracking that can simultaneously handle several organisms monitored
in a laboratory environment. We compare the performance of ToxTrac with current
accessible programs on the web.
  3. The main advantages of ToxTrac are: i) no specific knowledge of the
geometry of the tracked bodies is needed; ii) processing speed, ToxTrac can
operate at a rate >25 frames per second in HD videos using modern desktop
computers; iii) simultaneous tracking of multiple organisms in multiple arenas;
iv) integrated distortion correction and camera calibration; v) robust against
false positives; vi) preservation of individual identification if crossing
occurs; vii) useful statistics and heat maps in real scale are exported in:
image, text and excel formats.
  4. ToxTrac can be used for high speed tracking of insects, fish, rodents or
other species, and provides useful locomotor information. We suggest using
ToxTrac for future studies of animal behavior independent of research area.

of sum of squares (SOS) optimization. The reliance of this technique on
large-scale semidefinite programs however, has limited the scale of problems to
which it can be applied. In this paper, we introduce DSOS and SDSOS
optimization as linear programming and second-order cone programming-based
alternatives to sum of squares optimization that allow one to trade off
computation time with solution quality. These are optimization problems over
certain subsets of sum of squares polynomials (or equivalently subsets of
positive semidefinite matrices), which can be of interest in general
applications of semidefinite programming where scalability is a limitation. We
show that some basic theorems from SOS optimization which rely on results from
real algebraic geometry are still valid for DSOS and SDSOS optimization.
Furthermore, we show with numerical experiments from diverse application
areas---polynomial optimization, statistics and machine learning, derivative
pricing, and control theory---that with reasonable tradeoffs in accuracy, we
can handle problems at scales that are currently significantly beyond the reach
of traditional sum of squares approaches. Finally, we provide a review of
recent techniques that bridge the gap between our DSOS/SDSOS approach and the
SOS approach at the expense of additional running time. The Supplementary

become robust in all ensembles when interactions become strong. As evidence,
the steep cliff in the distribution of the number of excited atoms is

e.g., frequently in life sciences whenever it is easier or cheaper to

to answer questions about the occurrence of certain time, group and
interactions effects or about particular profiles.
  The test procedures are based on standardized quadratic forms involving
suitably symmetrized U-statistics-type estimators which are robust against an
increasing number of dimensions $d$ and/or groups $a$. We then discuss its
limit distributions in a general asymptotic framework and additionally propose
improved small sample approximations. Finally its small sample performance is

a homogeneous bubble swarm rising at high-Reynolds-numbers within a homogeneous
and isotropic turbulent flow. Both the gas volume fraction {\alpha} and the
velocity fluctuations of the carrier flow before bubble injection are varied,
respectively, in the ranges 0% < alpha < 0.93% and 2.3 cm/s < urms < 5.5 cm/s.
The so-called bubblance parameter is used to compare the ratio of the kinetic
energy generated by the bubbles to the one produced by the incident turbulence,
and is varied from 0 to 1.3. Conditional measurements of the velocity field
downstream of the bubbles in the vertical direction allow us to disentangle
three regions that have specific statistical properties, namely the primary
wake, the secondary wake and the far field. While the fluctuations in the
primary wake are similar to the one of a single bubble rising in a liquid at
rest, the statistics of the velocity fluctuations in the far field follow
Gaussian distribution, similar to the one produced by the homogenous and
isotropic turbulence at the largest scales. In the secondary wake region, the
conditional probability density function (pdf) of the velocity fluctuations is
asymmetric and shows an exponential tail for the positive fluctuations and a
Gaussian one for the negative fluctuations. The overall agitation thus results
from the combination of these three contributions and depends mainly on the
bubblance parameter.

happens precisely for those edge length distributions that produce explosive
branching processes with infinite mean power law offspring distributions. For

characterise the asymptotic behaviour of the time it takes to reach the first

sensor networks, signal processing, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence. Methods for distributed convex optimization are widely
investigated, while those for non-convex objectives are not well understood.
One of the first non-convex distributed optimization frameworks over an
arbitrary interaction graph was proposed by Di Lorenzo and Scutari [IEEE Trans.
on Signal and Information Processing over Network, 2 (2016), pp. 120-136],
which iteratively applies a combination of local optimization with convex
approximations and local averaging. We generalize the existing results in two
ways. In the case when the decision variables are separable such that there is
partial dependency in the objectives, we reduce the communication complexity of
the algorithm so that nodes only keep and communicate local variables instead
of the whole vector of variables. In addition, we relax the assumption that the
objectives' gradients are bounded and Lipschitz by means of successive proximal
approximations. Having developed the methodology, we then discuss many ways to
apply our algorithmic framework to resource allocation problems in
multi-cellular networks, where the two generalizations are found useful and
practical. Simulation results show the superiority of our resource allocation
algorithms over naive single cell methods, and furthermore, our approximation
framework lead to algorithms that are numerically more stable.

relaxation characteristic of classical glasses is the presence of kinetic

invariant quantum many-body systems. We illustrate this general idea by
considering two simple models: (i) a one-dimensional quantum analogue to
classical constrained lattice gases where excitation hopping is constrained by
the state of neighboring sites, mimicking excluded-volume interactions of dense
fluids; and (ii) fully packed quantum dimers on the square lattice. Both models
have a Rokhsar--Kivelson (RK) point at which kinetic and potential energy
constants are equal. To one side of the RK point, where kinetic energy
dominates, thermalization is fast. To the other, where potential energy
dominates, thermalization is slow, memory of initial conditions persists for
long times, and separation of timescales leads to pronounced metastability
before eventual thermalization. Furthermore, in analogy with what occurs in the
relaxation of classical glasses, the slow-thermalization regime displays
dynamical heterogeneity as manifested by spatially segregated growth of
entanglement.

of nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), zinc (Zn) and cobalt (Co) has been studied by
means of Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Replacing only a few of the S=1/2
Cu ions with Ni, Pd, Zn or Co has a major impact on the magnetic properties of
the spin chain system. In the case of Ni, Pd and Zn an unusual line broadening
in the low temperature NMR spectra reveals the existence of an impurity-induced
local alternating magnetization (LAM), while exponentially decaying
spin-lattice relaxation rates $T_1^{-1}$ towards low temperatures indicate the
opening of spin gaps. A distribution of gap magnitudes is proven by a stretched
spin-lattice relaxation and a variation of $T_1^{-1}$ within the broad
resonance lines. These observations depend strongly on the impurity
concentration and therefore can be understood using the model of finite
segments of the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, i.e. pure chain
segmentation due to S = 0 impurities. This is surprising for Ni as it was
previously assumed to be a magnetic impurity with S = 1 which is screened by
the neighboring copper spins. In order to confirm the S = 0 state of the Ni, we
performed x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and compared the measurements to
simulated XAS spectra based on multiplet ligand-field theory. Furthermore, Zn
doping leads to much smaller effects on both the NMR spectra and the
spin-lattice relaxation rates, indicating that Zn avoids occupying Cu sites.
For magnetic Co impurities, $T_1^{-1}$ does not obey the gap like decrease, and
the low-temperature spectra get very broad. This could be related to the
increase of the Neel temperature which was observed by recent muSR and
susceptibility measurements, and is most likely an effect of the impurity spin
$S\neq0$.

challenging procedure and most determinations are based on model-dependent
assumptions. We attempt a direct determination of the radial and vertical
temperature structure of the Flying Saucer disk, thanks to its favorable
inclination of 90 degrees. We present a method based on the tomographic study
of an edge-on disk. Using ALMA, we observe at 0.5$""$ resolution the Flying
Saucer in CO J=2-1 and CS J=5-4. This edge-on disk appears in silhouette
against the CO J=2-1 emission from background molecular clouds in $\rho$ Oph.
The combination of velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk
and intensity variations in the CO background as a function of velocity provide
a direct measure of the gas temperature as a function of radius and height
above the disk mid-plane. The overall thermal structure is consistent with
model predictions, with a cold ($< 15-12 $~K), CO-depleted mid-plane, and a
warmer disk atmosphere. However, we find evidence for CO gas along the
mid-plane beyond a radius of about 200\,au, coincident with a change of grain
properties. Such a behavior is expected in case of efficient rise of UV
penetration re-heating the disk and thus allowing CO thermal desorption or
favoring direct CO photo-desorption. CO is also detected up to 3-4 scale
heights while CS is confined around 1 scale height above the mid-plane. The
limits of the method due to finite spatial and spectral resolutions are also
discussed. This method appears to be very promising to determine the gas
structure of planet-forming disks, provided that the molecular data have an
angular resolution which is high enough, of the order of $0.3 - 0.1""$ at the
distance of the nearest star forming regions.

distinct sequences with the thick disc stars showing higher [{\alpha}/Fe]
ratios. We adopt two different approaches to model the evolution of thick and
thin discs. In particular, we adopt: i) a two-infall approach where the thick
disc forms fast and before the thin disc and by means of a fast gas accretion
episode, whereas the thin disc forms by means of a second accretion episode on
a longer timescale; ii) a parallel approach, where the two discs form in
parallel but at different rates. By comparing our model results with the
observed [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the
two Galactic components, we conclude that the parallel approach can account for
a group of {\alpha}-enhanced metal rich stars present in the data, whereas the
two-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they are the result of
stellar migration. In both approaches, the thick disc has formed on a timescale
of accretion of 0.1 Gyr, whereas the thin disc formed on a timescale of 7 Gyr
in the solar region. In the two-infall approach a gap in star formation between
the thick and thin disc formation of several hundreds of Myr should be present,
at variance with the parallel approach where no gap is present.

quite general, although originally motivated by the quest of exact lattice
supersymmetry. Two long standing problems have a solution in this context: 1)
Each degree of freedom on the lattice corresponds to $2^d$ degrees of freedom
in the continuum, but all these doublers have (in the case of fermions) the
same chirality and can be either identified, thus removing the degeneracy, or,
in some theories with extended supersymmetry, identified with different members
of the same supermultiplet. 2) The derivative operator, defined on the lattice
as a suitable periodic function of the lattice momentum, is an addittive and
conserved quantity, thus assuring that the Leibnitz rule is satisfied. This
implies that the product of two fields on the lattice is replaced by a
non-local ""star product"" which is however in general non-associative.
Associativity of the ""star product"" poses strong restrictions on the form of
the lattice derivative operator (which becomes the inverse gudermannian
function of the lattice momentum) and has the consequence that the degrees of
freedom of the lattice theory and of the continuum theory are in one-to-one
correspondence, so that the two theories are eventually equivalent.
Regularization of the ultraviolet divergences on the lattice is not associated
to the lattice spacing, which does not act as a regulator, but may be obtained
by a one parameter deformation of the lattice derivative, thus preserving the
lattice structure even in the limit of infinite momentum cutoff. However this
regularization breaks gauge invariance and a gauge invariant regularization
within the lattice formulation is still lacking.

(GPDs). In this way, the distribution of partons in the transverse plane can be
obtained. As an example, coherent deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) off
$^3$He nuclei, important to access the neutron GPDs, will be discussed. In
Impulse Approximation (IA), the sum of two GPDs of $^3$He, $H$ and $E$, at low
momentum transfer, turns out to be dominated by the neutron contribution.
Besides, a technique, able to take into account the nuclear effects included in
the Impulse Approximation analysis, has been developed. The spin dependent GPD
$\tilde H$ of $^3$He is also found to be largely dominated, at low momentum
transfer, by the neutron contribution. Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
processes access the momentum space 3D structure parameterized through
transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. A distorted spin-dependent
spectral function has been recently introduced for $^3$He, in a
non-relativistic framework, to take care of the final state interaction between

scattering off transversely polarized $^3$He. The calculation of the Sivers and

reddening minimizes uncertainties due to extinction corrections. We use the

at face value, the derived mass loss rates are larger than those predicted by
Vink et al. (2001), and the magnitude of the disagreement increases with
decreasing luminosity. However, the IR excesses need not imply large mass loss
rates. Instead, we argue that they probably indicate that the outer atmospheres
of O stars contain complex structures and that their winds are launched with
much smaller velocity gradients than normally assumed. If this is the case, it
could affect the theoretical and observational interpretations of the ""weak

these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models
in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using
sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully
generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for
GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on
a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and
vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate
time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in
performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification
from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical
dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and
analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate
realistic synthetic medical time series data.

suggests that the mixing of the two regions, in the case of hotter environment,
greatly increases the temperature of the tube at the site of the strongest

fluid stochastic Petri nets (LFSPNs) while preserving their discrete and
continuous properties. We define a linear-time relation of fluid trace
equivalence and its branching-time counterpart, fluid bisimulation equivalence.
Both fluid relations take into account the essential features of the LFSPNs
behaviour: functional activity, stochastic timing and fluid flow. We consider
the LFSPNs whose continuous markings have no influence to the discrete ones and
whose discrete part is continuous time stochastic Petri nets. The underlying
stochastic model for the discrete part of the LFSPNs is continuous time Markov
chains (CTMCs). The performance analysis of the continuous part of LFSPNs is
accomplished via the associated stochastic fluid models (SFMs). We show that
fluid trace equivalence preserves average potential fluid change volume for the
transition sequences of every certain length. We prove that fluid bisimulation
equivalence preserves the aggregated probability functions: stationary
probability mass for the underlying CTMC, as well as stationary fluid buffer
empty probability, fluid density and distribution for the associated SFM.
Hence, the equivalence guarantees identity of a number of discrete and
continuous performance measures. Fluid bisimulation equivalence is then used to
simplify the qualitative and quantitative analysis of LFSPNs via quotienting
the discrete reachability graph and underlying CTMC. To describe the quotient
associated SFM, the quotients of the probability functions are defined. We
characterize logically fluid trace and bisimulation equivalences with two novel
fluid modal logics $HML_{flt}$ and $HML_{flb}$, based on the Hennessy-Milner
Logic HML. The application example of a document preparation system
demonstrates the behavioural analysis via quotienting by fluid bisimulation

having inner and outer rings or related features. In this paper, the
morphologies of 54 barred and oval ringed galaxies have been examined with the
goal of determining what the dark gaps are telling us about the structure and
evolution of barred galaxies. The analysis is based mainly on galaxies selected
from the Galaxy Zoo 2 database and the Catalogue of Southern Ringed Galaxies.
The dark gaps between inner and outer rings are of interest because of their
likely association with the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points that would be present
in the gravitational potential of a bar or oval. Since the points are
theoretically expected to lie very close to the corotation resonance (CR) of
the bar pattern, the gaps provide the possibility of locating corotation in
some galaxies simply by measuring the radius rgp of the gap region and setting
rCR=rgp. With the additional assumption of generally flat rotation curves, the
locations of other resonances can be predicted and compared with observed
morphological features. It is shown that this ""gap method"" provides remarkably
consistent interpretations of the morphology of early-to-intermediate type
barred galaxies. The paper also brings attention to cases where the dark gaps
lie inside an inner ring, rather than between inner and outer rings. These may
have a different origin compared to the inner/outer ring gaps.

of freedom are scalars transforming under some representation of $SO(5)$ and
subject to some unspecified strong interactions. The holographic description
presented here is inspired by previous studies performed in the context of QCD
and it allows for the consideration of spin one and spin zero resonances. The
resulting spectrum leads in a natural way to a variety of resonances. Namely,
those transforming under the unbroken $SO(4)$ subgroup exhibit an exact
degeneracy between the two Regge trajectories of vector and scalar channels,
while the resonances with quantum numbers in the $SO(5)/ SO(4)$ coset lie on a
trajectory of (heavier) spin one states and a non-degenerated one of scalar
resonances where the four lowest lying ones are massless. These correspond to
the four Goldstone bosons in 4D associated to the global symmetry breaking
pattern. Restrictions derived from the experimental constraints (Higgs
couplings, $S$ parameter, etc.) are then implemented and we conclude that the
model is able to accommodate vector and scalar resonances with masses in the
range 1 TeV to 2 TeV without encountering phenomenological difficulties.
Extension to generic models characterized by the breaking pattern $SO(N)\to

beta ($\beta_i$) regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For $\beta_i=0.5$, good
agreement between the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion
to the electron gyroradius, thus providing firm evidence for a kinetic Alfv\'en
cascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower spectral
slopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For
$\beta_i=0.1$, a detailed analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight
disagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at kinetic scales, even though
kinetic Alfv\'en fluctuations likely still play a significant role. The
discrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK

Bernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes, but with a more notable deviation
from GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and strengths of
reduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the fully-kinetic model
on a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic

algorithm for distributed optimisation termed the primal-dual method of
multipliers (PDMM). In contrast to its initial derivation, in this work
monotone operator theory is used to connect PDMM with other first-order methods
such as Douglas-Rachford splitting and the alternating direction method of
multipliers thus providing insight to the operation of the scheme. In
particular, we show how PDMM combines a lifted dual form in conjunction with
Peaceman-Rachford splitting to remove the need for collaboration between nodes
per iteration. We demonstrate sufficient conditions for strong primal
convergence for a general class of functions while under the assumption of
strong convexity and functional smoothness, we also introduce a primal
geometric convergence bound. Finally we introduce a distributed method of
parameter selection in the geometric convergent case, requiring only finite
transmissions to implement regardless of network topology.

scenarii, such as a true intermediate phase which persists in the thermodynamic
limit versus a glassy regime established on finite but very large time and

in statistical physics. Previously, a class of 2D cellular models has been
shown to undergo a rigidity transition controlled by a mechanical parameter
that specifies cell shapes. Here, we generalize this model to 3D and find a
rigidity transition that is similarly controlled by the preferred surface area:
the model is solid-like below a dimensionless surface area of
$s_0^\ast\approx5.413$, and fluid-like above this value. We demonstrate that,
unlike jamming in soft spheres, residual stresses are necessary to create
rigidity. These stresses occur precisely when cells are unable to obtain their
desired geometry, and we conjecture that there is a well-defined minimal
surface area possible for disordered cellular structures. We show that the
behavior of this minimal surface induces a linear scaling of the shear modulus
with the control parameter at the transition point, which is different from the
scaling observed in particulate matter. The existence of such a minimal surface
may be relevant for biological tissues and foams, and helps explain why cell
shapes are a good structural order parameter for rigidity transitions in
biological tissues.

Coulomb gauge. Furthermore this approach is compared to recent lattice data,
which were obtained by an alternative gauge fixing method and which show an
improved agreement with the continuum results. By relating the Gribov
confinement scenario to the center vortex picture of confinement it is shown
that the Coulomb string tension is tied to the spatial string tension. For the
quark sector a vacuum wave functional is used which explicitly contains the
coupling of the quarks to the transverse gluons and which results in
variational equations which are free of ultraviolet divergences. The
variational approach is extended to finite temperatures by compactifying a
spatial dimension. The effective potential of the Polyakov loop is evaluated
from the zero-temperature variational solution. For pure Yang--Mills theory,
the deconfinement phase transition is found to be second order for SU(2) and
first order for SU(3), in agreement with the lattice results. The corresponding
critical temperatures are found to be $275 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $280 \,
\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. When quarks are included, the deconfinement
transition turns into a cross-over. From the dual and chiral quark condensate
one finds pseudo-critical temperatures of $198 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $170 \,

low-sensitivity phase-difference of two close-sensitive fringes.
Dual-wavelength phase-metrology that additionally uses the phase-sum was first
reported by Di et al. in 2013 [28]; this was an important step to increase the
phase-accuracy in optical metrology. This and its derived papers however do not
offer mathematical analysis for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the
phase-difference and phase-sum. Neither provide the mathematical analysis for
unwrapping the phase-sum without errors. Here a general theory for
super-sensitive two-wavelength phase-metrology is given. In particular
mathematical analysis and formulas for SNR and error-free phase-unwrapping for
two-wavelength metrology is provided. We start by phase-demodulating two
close-sensitivity fringes by phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs). We then
calculate their phase-difference and their phase-sum; the phase-difference is
assumed non-wrapped. However the phase-sum is highly wrapped, super-sensitive
and has much higher SNR. Spatial phase unwrapping for a highly discontinuous
phase-sum is precluded. However as we show, it is possible to unwrap the noisy
phase-sum from the noisier phase-difference without errors. We apply this
super-sensitive phase-metrology theory to profilometry allowing us to obtain
super-sensitive height measurements. To the best of our knowledge the
mathematical analysis and formulas herein presented for the SNR and error-free
unwrapping have not been reported before.

  candidates","Accepted to MNRAS. 12 pages, 1 figure, 4 Table",,"10.1093/mnras/stx1450",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a new sample of 8 weak-line-quasars (WLQs) we report a sensitive search
in 20 intranight monitoring sessions, for blazar-like optical flux variations
on hour-like and longer time scale (day/month/year$-$like). The sample consists
exclusively of the WLQs that are not radio$-$loud and have either been
classified as `radio-weak probable BL Lac candidates' and/or are known to have
exhibited at least one episode of large, blazar$-$like optical variability.
Whereas only a hint of intra$-$night variability is seen for two of these WLQs,
J104833.5$+$620305.0(z = 0.219) and J133219.6$+$622715.9 (z = 3.15),
statistically significant inter$-$night variability at a few per cent level is
detected for three of the sources, including the radio-intermediate WLQ
J133219.6$+$622715.9 (z = 3.15) and the well known bona$-$fide radio$-$quiet
WLQs J121221.5$+$534128.0 (z = 3.10) and WLQ J153259.9$-$003944.1 (z = 4.62).
In the rest$-$frame, this variability is intra-day and in the far$-$UV band. On
the time scale of a decade, we find for three of the WLQs large brightness
changes, amounting to 1.655$\pm$0.009, 0.163$\pm$0.010 and 0.144$\pm$0.018 mag,
for J104833.5$+$620305.0, J123743.1$+$630144.9 and J232428.4$+$144324.4,
respectively. Whereas the latter two are confirmed radio-quiet WLQs, the
extragalactic nature of J104833.5$+$620305.0 remains to be well established,
thanks to the absence of any feature(s) in its available optical spectra. The
present study forms a part of our ongoing campaign of intranight optical
monitoring of radio quiet weak-line quasars, in order to improve the
understanding of this enigmatic class of Active Galactic Nuclei and to look
among them for a possible tiny, elusive population of radio-quiet BL Lacs.

distinguishes qualitatively different regions in state space of dynamical
models representing manageable systems with default dynamics. In this paper, we
connect the framework to viability theory by defining its main components based
on viability kernels and capture basins. This enables us to use the
Saint-Pierre algorithm to visualize the shape and calculate the volume of the
main partition of the Topology of Sustainable Management. We present an
extension of the algorithm to compute implicitly defined capture basins. To
demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we introduce a low-complexity
model coupling environmental and socioeconomic dynamics. With this example, we
also address two common estimation problems: an unbounded state space and
highly varying time scales. We show that appropriate coordinate transformations
can solve these problems. It is thus demonstrated how algorithmic approaches
from viability theory can be used to get a better understanding of the state
space of manageable dynamical systems.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the coherent patterns from
tracer trajectory data. Our new method shows remarkably improved results
compared to the bootstrap particle filter when the physical model exhibits
chaotic advection.

to the luminescence reduction is the hydrogen saturation of fiber samples,
however, even in this case the level of residual luminescence is still too high

determining all such relationships for polynomials of any degree. E.g., in any
septic $f$, letting $\overline{f}_n$ denote the mean $f$ value over all zeroes
of the derivative $f^{\left(n\right)}$, it holds that $37$ $\overline{f}_1-150$
$\overline{f}_3+200\,\overline{f}_4-135\,\overline{f}_5+48\,%

in all odd dimensions there is a two-dimensional family of relationships. We
come upon connections to Tchebyshev, Bernoulli, \& Euler polynomials, and
Stirling numbers.

system by using the temporal correlation of target reflected photons. Because
of the inevitable noise, which is due to background light and dark counts of
the detector, the depth imaging of LiDAR system exists a large estimation
error. Our method combines the Poisson statistical model with the different
distribution feature of signal and noise in the time axis. Due to selecting a
proper threshold, our method can effectively filter out the false alarm of
system and use the ToFs of detected signal photons to rebuild the depth image
of the scene. The experimental results reveal that by our method it can fast
distinguish the distance between two close objects, which is confused due to
the high background noise, and acquire the accurate depth image of the scene.
Our method need not increase the complexity of the system and is useful in
power-limited depth imaging.
