through the context of a dipolar Bose gas condensing from a highly
non-equilibrium thermal state. Our simulations reveal that the dipolar
interactions drive the emergence of polarized turbulence and density
corrugations. The superfluid vortex lines and density fluctuations adopt a
columnar or stratified configuration, depending on the sign of the dipolar
interactions, with the vortices tending to form in the low density regions to
minimize kinetic energy. When the interactions are dominantly dipolar, the
decay of vortex line length is enhanced, closely following a $t^{-3/2}$
behaviour. This system poses exciting prospects for realizing stratified
quantum turbulence and new levels of generating and controlling turbulence
using magnetic fields.

related in the case of a point particle moving in the background of a 3d

paths of the first-quantized particle moving in the bulk geometry. Off-shell

converts the conformal block expansion in CFT from a sum over intermediate

remapping the unlensed CMB fields by a lensing deflection. However the lensing
deflections also change the photon path so that the emission angle is no longer
orthogonal to the background last-scattering surface. We give the first
calculation of the emission-angle corrections to the standard lensing
approximation from dipole (Doppler) sources for temperature and quadrupole
sources for temperature and polarization. We show that while the corrections
are negligible for the temperature and E-mode polarization, additional
large-scale B-modes are produced with a white spectrum that dominates those
from post-Born field rotation (curl lensing). On large scales about one percent
of the total lensing-induced B-mode amplitude is expected to be due to this
effect. However, the photon emission angle does remain orthogonal to the
perturbed last-scattering surface due to time delay, and half of the
large-scale emission-angle B modes cancel with B modes from time delay to give
a total contribution of about half a percent. While not important for planned
observations, the signal could ultimately limit the ability of delensing to
reveal low amplitudes of primordial gravitational waves.We also derive the
rotation of polarization due to multiple deflections between emission and
observation. The rotation angle is of quadratic order in the deflection angle,
and hence negligibly small: polarization typically rotates by less than an
arcsecond, orders of magnitude less than a small-scale image rotates due to
post-Born field rotation (which is quadratic in the shear). The field-rotation
B modes dominate the other effects on small scales.

sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven
individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are
correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well
as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and
efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two
targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed
under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions
between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct
transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's
covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE
is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and
individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding.
Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential
gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during
estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that
estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in
an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation
is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We
illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.

the public opinion. However, a comprehensive model that considers up-to-date
findings to replicate the patterns of emotion contagion in online social media

agent-based emotion contagion model which combines features of emotion
influence and tie strength preference in the dissemination process. The
simulation results indicate that anger-dominated users have higher vitality
than joy-dominated ones, and anger prefers weaker ties than joy in diffusion,
which could make it easier to spread between online groups. Moreover, anger's
high influence makes it competitive and easily to dominate the community,
especially when negative public events occur. It is also surprisingly revealed
that as the ratio of anger approaches joy with a gap less than 10%, angry
tweets and users will eventually dominate the online social media and arrives
the collective outrage in the cyber space. The critical gap disclosed here can
be indeed warning signals at early stages for outrage controlling in online
social media. All the parameters of the presented model can be easily estimated
from the empirical observations and their values from historical data could
help reproduce the emotion contagion of different circumstances. Our model
would shed lights on the study of multiple issues like forecasting of emotion

Introduction of microfibers and superabsorbent polymers is a material solution
to restrict crack propagation and enhance self-healing efficiency. Therefore,
the study proposes a combination of polypropylene(PP) fibers and superabsorbent
polymers (SAP) which would facilitate autonomous healing and recover original
mechanical and durability properties of mortar. Mechanical strength, sorptivity
and water penetration of healed mortars were compared to that of undamaged
mortar at same age to estimate recovery of original properties while crack
sealing was investigated by means of optical microscopy. Experimental results
show mortar with combination of PP fibers and SAP showed full recovery of
mechanical strength after healing while recovery in durability up to 90% was
recorded. Microscopic images show that average crack-sealing ratio of 85% could
be achieved under moist condition by combination of SAP and PP fibers while
sealing under drier air curing condition is also significantly higher than
reference samples with only fibers. Crack width up to 330{\mu}m has been found
to be completely sealed by carbonate crystals. Furthermore, mortar with SAP and
PP fibers retain about 70% of their original 28-day strength after three cycles
of loading while reference mortar samples were found to retain only about
40-50% of their original strength. Effective crack sealing and high recovery of
original properties in mortars with SAP and fibers suggest that this material
combination would reduce the need for environmentally damaging and expensive
repairs during the service life.

1994 to 2016, taking into account the signature of the agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in the early 90's. A
total amount of 1580 papers were processed through co-citation network

emerged with the existence of formal institutional relations, it was made a
qualitative tracking of the authors with respect to their institutional
affiliation, lines of research and meeting places. Both methods show that the
subjects of interest can be grouped into 13 different issues related to

Economics, there are weak linkages between disciplines which could indicate the
construction of a cross-disciplinary field.

ridesharing services, under a pricing model with detour-based discounts for
passengers. We propose greedy heuristics for real-time ride matching that offer
different trade-offs between optimality and speed. Simulations on New York City
(NYC) taxi trip data show that our heuristics are up to 90% optimal and 10^5
times faster than the (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm.
  Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by
matching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings
are typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased
profit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not
clear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would
encourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction
of savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the
decisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount
offered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm
IDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the
provider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the
optimal discount factor in under 16 iterations.
  Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy
based on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept. Such
restricted policies offer a better ride experience, increasing the provider's
market share, but at the cost of decreased average per-ride profit due to the
reduced number of matched rides. We construct a model that captures these
opposing effects, wherein simulations based on NYC data show that a 7% increase
in market share would suffice to offset the decreased average per-ride profit.

timing variations (Gillon et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017) and dynamical
modeling (Quarles et al., 2017). The low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1

mass-radius-composition models, that TRAPPIST-1f and g likely contain
substantial ($\geq50$ wt\%) water/ice, with b and c being significantly drier
($\leq15$ wt\%). We propose this gradient of water mass fractions implies
planets f and g formed outside the primordial snow line whereas b and c formed
inside. We find that compared to planets in our solar system that also formed
within the snow line, TRAPPIST-1b and c contain hundreds more oceans worth of
water. We demonstrate the extent and timescale of migration in the TRAPPIST-1

the primordial snow line. This work provides a framework for understanding the
differences between the protoplanetary disks of our solar system versus M

wealth of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been proposed to obtain
asymptotically correct samples from the posterior. As datasets in applications
grow larger and larger, scalability has emerged as a central problem for MCMC
methods. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and related stochastic
gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods offer scalability by using stochastic
gradients in each step of the simulated dynamics. While these methods are
asymptotically unbiased if the stepsizes are reduced in an appropriate fashion,
in practice constant stepsizes are used. This introduces a bias that is often
ignored. In this paper we study the mean squared error of Lipschitz functionals
in strongly log- concave models with i.i.d. data of growing data set size and
show that, given a batchsize, to control the bias of SGLD the stepsize has to
be chosen so small that the computational cost of reaching a target accuracy is
roughly the same for all batchsizes. Using a control variate approach, the cost
can be reduced dramatically. The analysis is performed by considering the
algorithms as noisy discretisations of the Langevin SDE which correspond to the
Euler method if the full data set is used. An important observation is that the
1scale of the step size is determined by the stability criterion if the
accuracy is required for consistent credible intervals. Experimental results
confirm our theoretical findings.

quantifies accuracy using empirical risk minimization and privacy using
differential privacy. In equilibrium, we identify necessary and sufficient

adopt various control strategies. This brings great challenge to its optimal
operation due to the difficulty of implementing a unified control. This paper
addresses the distributed optimal control of DC microgrids, which intends to
break the restriction of diversity to some extent. Firstly, we formulate the
optimal power flow (OPF) problem of stand-alone DC microgrids as an exact
second order cone program (SOCP) and prove the uniqueness of the optimal
solution. Then a dynamic solving algorithm based on primal-dual decomposition
method is proposed, the convergence of which is proved theoretically as well as
the optimality of its equilibrium point. It should be stressed that the
algorithm can provide control commands for the three types of microgrids: (i)
power control, (ii) voltage control and (iii) droop control. This implies that
each microgrid does not need to change its original control strategy in
practice, which is less influenced by the diversity of microgrids. Moreover,
the control commands for power controlled and voltage controlled microgrids
satisfy generation limits and voltage limits in both transient process and
steady state. Finally, a six-microgrid DC system based on the microgrid
benchmark is adopted to validate the effectiveness and plug-n-play property of
our designs.

nonuniversal couplings to SM fermions dictated by the principle of minimal

The flavor-violating $Z'$ interactions are subject to stringent constraints
from other processes, especially $B$-$\bar B$ mixing, charged lepton decays
$\ell_i\to\ell_j\ell_k\bar\ell_l$ occurring at tree level, and the loop induced

ordering is identified by both the magnetization data and the NMR data, where
the $T_N$ shows a concave shape dependence with pressure. These data suggest
stacking rearrangement along the $c$-axis. With increasing pressure, phase
separation appears prominently at $P\ge$~0.45~GPa, and the magnetic volume
fraction is completely suppressed at $P\ge$~1.05~GPa. Meanwhile, a
phase-transition-like behavior emerges at high pressures in the remaining
volume by a sharp drop of magnetization $M(T)$ upon cooling, with the
transition temperature $T_x$ increased to ~250~K at 1~GPa. The $1/^{35}T_1$ is
reduced by over three orders of magnitude when cooled below 100~K. This
characterizes a high-pressure, low-temperature phase with nearly absent static
susceptibility and low-energy spin fluctuations. The nature of the

projecting/capturing a set of striped patterns and measuring the warping of the
patterns as they reflect off a target object's surface. In the case of phase
measuring profilometry (PMP), the projected patterns are composed of a rolling
sinusoidal wave, but as a set of time-multiplexed patterns, PMP requires the
target surface to remain motionless or for scanning to be performed at such
high rates that any movement is small. But high speed scanning places a
significant burden on the projector electronics to produce contone patterns
inside of short exposure intervals. Binary patterns are, therefore, of great
value, but converting contone patterns into binary comes with significant risk.
As such, this paper introduces a contone-to-binary conversion algorithm for
deriving binary patterns that best mimic their contone counterparts.
Experimental results will show a greater than 3 times reduction in pattern
noise over traditional halftoning procedures.

Eighty-seven percent (21 out of 24) galaxies in our sample show 33 GHz radio
continuum emission at levels of 4.5-240 $\sigma$. Five sources show extended
emission, including one source with two main components and one with three main
components. The remaining detected 16 sources exhibit compact cores within the
sensitivity limits. Little evidence is found for extended jets (>300 pc) in
most sources. Either they do not exist, or our chosen frequency of 33 GHz is
too high for a detection of these supposedly steep spectrum features. In only
one source among those with known maser disk orientation, NGC4388, we found an
extended jet-like feature that appears to be oriented perpendicular to the
water megamaser disk. Smaller 100-300 pc sized jets might also be present, as
is suggested by the beam-deconvolved morphology of our sources. Whenever
possible, central positions with accuracies of 20-280 mas are provided. A
correlation analysis shows that the 33 GHz luminosity weakly correlates with
the infrared luminosity. The 33 GHz luminosity is anticorrelated with the
circular velocity of the galaxy. The black hole masses show stronger
correlations with water maser luminosity than with 1.4 GHz, 33 GHz, or hard
X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, the inner radii of the disks show stronger
correlations with 1.4 GHz, 33 GHz, and hard X-ray luminosities than their outer

formation, or peculiar density distributions.

large, low-surface-brightness galaxies in local galaxy clusters. Various
theories that aim to explain the presence of such ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs)
have since been proposed. A key question that will help to differentiate
between models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and
what their abundance as a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our
previous study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to galaxy groups. We measure the
abundance of UDGs in 325 spectroscopically-selected groups from the Galaxy And
Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We make use of the overlapping imaging from the
ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), from which we can identify galaxies with mean
surface brightnesses within their effective radii down to ~25.5 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ in the r-band. We are able to measure a significant overdensity
of UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun,
a regime where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can
detect. We combine measurements of the abundance of UDGs in haloes that cover
three orders of magnitude in halo mass, finding that their numbers scale quite
steeply with halo mass; N_UDG (R<R200) $\propto$ M200^(1.11+/-0.07). To better
interpret this, we also measure the mass-richness relation for brighter
galaxies down to $M^*_r$+2.5 in the same GAMA groups, and find a much shallower
relation of N_Bright (R<R200) $\propto$ M200^(0.78+/-0.05). This shows that
UDGs are relatively more abundant, compared to bright galaxies, in massive
clusters than in groups. We discuss implications, but whether this difference
is related to a higher destruction rate of UDGs in groups, or whether massive
haloes have a positive effect on their formation, is not yet clear.

sterile neutrinos is accompanied by dark entropy production which increases the
yield of dark matter and leads to a lower characteristic momentum. This
resolves the growing tensions with structure formation and X-ray observations

that a simple estimate based on energy- and entropy conservation describes the

reionisation, it is standard practice to assume a uniform radiation background.
This assumption is not always appropriate; models with radiative transfer show
that large-scale ionisation rate fluctuations can have an observable impact on
statistics of the Lyman-alpha forest. We extend such calculations to include
beaming of sources, which has previously been neglected but which is expected
to be important if quasars dominate the ionising photon budget. Beaming has two
effects: first, the physical number density of ionising sources is enhanced
relative to that directly observed; and second, the radiative transfer itself
is altered. We calculate both effects in a hard-edged beaming model where each
source has a random orientation, using an equilibrium Boltzmann hierarchy in
terms of spherical harmonics. By studying the statistical properties of the
resulting ionisation rate and HI density fields at redshift $z\sim 2.3$, we
find that the two effects partially cancel each other; combined, they
constitute a maximum $5\%$ correction to the power spectrum
$P_{\mathrm{HI}}(k)$ at $k=0.04 \, h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. On very large scales
($k<0.01\, h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) the source density renormalisation dominates; it
can reduce, by an order of magnitude, the contribution of ionising shot-noise
to the intergalactic HI power spectrum. The effects of beaming should be
considered when interpreting future observational datasets.

lines of Mg II 2800 {\AA} and Ca II (H,K) and Na I 5892 {\AA} at z=0.68437 +/-
0.00005 due to intervening interstellar gas. No stellar absorption features
attributable to the lens galaxy are revealed. Thus the assumed redshift of the
lens is dubious. The continuum spectrum of the object exhibits a remarkable
drop towards the short wavelengths likely due to a significant extinction. This
extinction cannot be produced in the lens galaxy at z =0.684 with any value of
R$_V$ under the assumption that the intrinsic shape of the blazar is dominated
by a power law emission. However, the observed continuum is consistent with a
power law emission assuming a standard (R$_V$ = 3.1) extinction at the source
redshift (z=0.95) as supported also by the presence of Mg II absorptions at the
same redshift. HST images of B0218+357 exhibit the double image of the source

different gravity theories. We proceed firstly by identifying the necessary
operators which need to be included in the effective field theory Lagrangian in
order to go beyond the linear order in perturbations and then we construct the
corresponding non-linear action. Moreover, we present the complete recipe to
map any single field dark energy and modified gravity models into the
non-linear effective field theory framework by considering a general action in
the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. In order to illustrate this recipe we
proceed to map the beyond-Horndeski theory and low-energy Horava gravity into
the effective field theory formalism. As a final step we derived the 4th order
action in term of the curvature perturbation. This allowed us to identify the
non-linear contributions coming from the linear order perturbations which at
the next order act like source terms. Moreover, we confirm that the stability
requirements, ensuring the positivity of the kinetic term and the speed of
propagation for scalar mode, are automatically satisfied once the viability of
the theory is demanded at linear level. The approach we present here will allow
to construct, in a model independent way, all the relevant predictions on
observables at mildly non-linear scales.

numerically solved with an initial random wave function and after enough
simulation time, the wave function converges to the ground state wave function.
The excited states are determined by using the same procedure for the ground
state with additional constraints that the wave function must be orthogonal

Establishing a connection between LUTs in a LUT network and reversible
single-target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional
logic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing, despite several
fundamental differences. We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical
Reversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network;
output is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The
framework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum
gates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of
single-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in
the final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each
single-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using
available resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
automatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double
precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation
applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components.
But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it
can be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our
synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm
designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum
algorithms. Thus, the benchmarks and, more generally, the LHRS framework are an
essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will
be practical in the first generations of quantum computers.

- neutrino masses and dark matter - are consistent with the existence of new
degrees of freedom that interact very weakly, if at all, with those in the SM.
We propose that these new degrees of freedom organize themselves into a simple
dark sector, a chiral SU(3) x SU(2) gauge theory with the smallest nontrivial
fermion content. Similar to the SM, the dark SU(2) is spontaneously broken
while the dark SU(3) confines at low energies. At the renormalizable level, the
dark sector contains massless fermions - dark leptons - and stable massive
particles - dark protons. We find that dark protons with masses between 10-100
TeV satisfy all current cosmological and astrophysical observations concerning
dark matter even if dark protons are a symmetric thermal relic. The dark
leptons play the role of right-handed neutrinos and allow simple realizations
of the seesaw mechanism or the possibility that neutrinos are Dirac fermions.
In the latter case, neutrino masses are also parametrically different from
charged-fermion masses and the lightest neutrino is predicted to be massless.
Since the new ""neutrino"" and ""dark matter"" degrees of freedom interact with one
another, these two new-physics phenomena are intertwined. Dark leptons play a
nontrivial role in early universe cosmology while indirect searches for dark
matter involve, decisively, dark matter annihilations into dark leptons. These,
in turn, may lead to observable signatures at high-energy neutrino and
gamma-ray observatories, especially once one accounts for the potential
Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross-section, derived from the
low-energy dark-sector effective theory, a possibility we explore
quantitatively in some detail.

geometry is such that the arbitrary cross section of the torus has rotational
symmetry about the rotation axis $Z$, with a major radius $r_0$. The magnetic
field configuration is thus determined by a scalar flux function $\Psi$ and a

resulting in the range of $r_0$. Benchmark studies of known analytic solutions
to the toroidal GS equation with noise additions are presented to illustrate
the two-step procedures and to demonstrate the performance of the numerical GS
solver, separately. For the cases presented, the errors in $Z$ and $r_0$ are

cover a range in stellar mass that spans almost five orders of magnitude: 7.0 <
log M* < 11.5. We find that the logarithmic power-law slope and normalisation
of the TFR are independent of redshift out to z~3. The scatter in the TFR is
<0.5 dex such that the gas velocity dispersion can be used as a proxy for the
stellar mass of a galaxy independently of its redshift. At z>3 the scatter
increases and the existence of a correlation is not obvious. The
high-luminosity sample exhibits a flatter slope of 1.5$\pm$0.2 at z<3 compared
to the low-luminosity sample slope of 2.9$\pm$0.3, suggesting a turnover in the
TFR. The combined sample is well fit with a break in the TFR at a
characteristic stellar mass scale of M*~10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, with no
significant evolution out to z~3. We demonstrate that a break in the TFR with a
steeper slope at the low-mass end is a natural consequence of galaxy models

popular Landauer-B\""uttiker(LB)+DFT approach. This formalism, when using
approximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) potential with steps at integer
occupation, correctly captures the Kondo plateau in the zero bias conductance
at zero temperature but completely fails to capture the transition to the
Coulomb blockade (CB) regime as temperature increases. To overcome the
limitations of LB+DFT the quantum transport problem is treated from a
time-dependent (TD) perspective using TDDFT, an exact framework to deal with
nonequilibrium situations. The steady-state limit of TDDFT shows that in
addition to an xc potential in the junction, there also exists an xc correction
to the applied bias. Open shell molecules in the CB regime provide the most
striking examples of the importance of the xc bias correction. Using the
Anderson model as guidance we estimate these corrections in the limit of zero
bias. For the general case we put forward a steady-state DFT which is based on
the one-to-one correspondence between the pair of basic variables steady
density on and steady current across the junction and the pair local potential
on and bias across the junction. Like TDDFT, this framework also leads to both
an xc potential in the junction and an xc correction to the bias. Unlike in
TDDFT, these potentials are independent of history. We highlight the universal
features of both xc potential and xc bias corrections for junctions in the CB
regime and provide an accurate parametrization for the Anderson model at
arbitrary temperatures and interaction strengths thus providing a unified DFT
description for both Kondo and CB regimes and the transition between them.

conversion of per unit reactance calculated on system common base to

(denoted $\alpha(V)$). Effective applications of these congruences is limited
by answers to the following questions: (i) under which conditions, is
${\alpha}(V)>1$? and (ii) does there exist an equivariant map with the degree
easy to calculate? In the present paper, we address both questions. We show
that ${\alpha}(V)>1$ for each irreducible non-trivial $C[G]$-module if and only
if $G$ is solvable. For non-solvable groups, we use 2-transitive actions to
construct complex representations with non-trivial ${\alpha}$-characteristic.
Regarding the second question, we suggest a class of Norton algebras without
2-nilpotents giving rise to equivariant quadratic maps, which admit an explicit
formula for the Brouwer degree.

investigates user satisfaction in relation to dialogue characteristics.
However, very little research relates a combination of multimodal social

interaction to the resulting user perception of a robot. In this paper we show
how different emotional facial expressions of human users, in combination with
prosodic characteristics of human speech and features of human-robot dialogue,
correlate with users' impressions of the robot after a conversation. We find
that happiness in the user's recognised facial expression strongly correlates
with likeability of a robot, while dialogue-related features (such as number of
human turns or number of sentences per robot utterance) correlate with
perceiving a robot as intelligent. In addition, we show that facial expression,
emotional features, and prosody are better predictors of human ratings related
to perceived robot likeability and anthropomorphism, while linguistic and
non-linguistic features more often predict perceived robot intelligence and
interpretability. As such, these characteristics may in future be used as an
online reward signal for in-situ Reinforcement Learning based adaptive

can provide objective information to support clinical decision-making.
Noninvasive skin imaging techniques provide complementary information to the
clinician. In recent years, optical coherence tomography has become a powerful
skin imaging technique. According to specific functional needs, skin
architecture varies across different parts of the body, as do the textural
characteristics in OCT images. There is, therefore, a critical need to
systematically analyze OCT images from different body sites, to identify their
significant qualitative and quantitative differences. Sixty-three optical and
textural features extracted from OCT images of healthy and diseased skin are
analyzed and in conjunction with decision-theoretic approaches used to create
computational models of the diseases. We demonstrate that these models provide
objective information to the clinician to assist in the diagnosis of
abnormalities of cutaneous microstructure, and hence, aid in the determination
of treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate the performance of this methodology
on differentiating basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

world. On one hand, our subjective experience is one of a rich visual world,
which we perceive effortlessly. However, when we actually test perception,
observers know surprisingly little. A number of tasks, from search, through
inattentional blindness, to change blindness, suggest that there is
surprisingly little awareness or perception without attention. Meanwhile,
another set of tasks, such as multiple object tracking, dual-task performance,
and visual working memory tasks suggest that both attention and working memory
have low capacity. These two components together - poor perception without
attention, and greatly limited capacity for attention and memory - imply that
perception is impoverished.
  How can we make sense of this awareness puzzle, of the riddle of our rich
subjective experience coupled with poor performance on experimental tasks? I
suggest that, looked at in the right way, there is in fact no awareness puzzle.
In particular, I will argue that the tasks that show limits are inherently
difficult tasks, and that there exists a unified explanation for both the rich
subjective experience and the apparent limits.

Whilst most contemporary theoretical works on metasurfaces deal with continuous

aggressively --- to the extent of having only two cells per spatial period.
Such aggressive discretization can lead to great simplifications in metasurface

continuous metasurfaces. Using this aggressive discretization technique, we
report the design of a binary Huygens' metasurface which reflects an incident

molecular system, i.e. electrons and nuclei, as Coulombic. However, in a more
detailed analysis one may always find small but non-negligible non-Coulombic
interactions in molecular systems originating from the finite size of nuclei,
magnetic interactions, etc. While such small modifications of the Coulombic
interactions do not seem to alter the nature of a molecular system in real
world seriously, they are a serious obstacle for quantum chemical theories and
methodologies which their formalism is strictly confined to the Coulombic
interactions. Although the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has
been formulated originally for the Coulombic systems, some recent studies have
demonstrated that apart from basin energy of an atom in a molecule, its
theoretical ingredients are not sensitive to the explicit form of the potential
energy operator. In this study, it is demonstrated that the basin energy may be
defined not only for coulombic systems but for all real-space subsystems of
those systems that are described by any member of the set of the homogeneous
potential energy functions. On the other hand, this extension opens the door
for seeking novel real-space subsystems, apart from atoms in molecules, in
non-Coulombic systems. These novel real-space subsystems call for an extended
formalism that goes beyond the orthodox QTAIM, which is not confined to the
Coulombic systems nor to the atoms in molecules as the sole real-space
subsystems. It is termed the quantum theory of real-space open subsystems
(QTROS) and its potential applications are detailed. The harmonic trap model,
containing non-interacting fermions or bosons, is considered as an example for
the QTROS analysis. The QTROS analysis of bosonic systems is particularly quite
unprecedented, not attempted before.

database for similar C/C++ functions. Source Forager preprocesses the database
to extract a variety of simple code features that capture different aspects of
code. A search returns the $k$ functions in the database that are most similar
to the query, based on the various extracted code features.
  We tested the usefulness of Source Forager using a variety of code-search

that the GRS spectrum measured by the visual channels of the Cassini VIMS
instrument in 2000 could be accurately fit by a cloud model in which the
chromophore appeared as a physically thin layer of small particles immediately
above the main cloud layer of the GRS. Here we show that the same chromophore
and same layer location can also provide close matches to the short wave
spectra of many other cloud features on Jupiter, suggesting this material may
be a nearly universal chromophore that could explain the various degrees of red
coloration on Jupiter. This is a robust conclusion, even for 12% changes in
VIMS calibration and large uncertainties in the refractive index of the main
cloud layer due to uncertain fractions of NH4SH and NH3 in its cloud particles.
The chromophore layer can account for color variations among north and south
equatorial belts, equatorial zone, and the Great Red Spot, by varying particle
size from 0.12 microns to 0.29 microns and 1-micron optical depth from 0.06 to
0.76. The total mass of the chromophore layer is much less variable, ranging
from 18 to 30 micrograms/cm^2, except in the equatorial zone, where it is only
10-13 micrograms/cm^2. We also found a depression of the ammonia volume mixing
ratio in the two belt regions, which averaged 0.4-0.5 X 10^{-4} immediately
below the ammonia condensation level, while the other regions averaged twice

distribution (MTD) model. Traditionally, MTD is plagued by a nonconvex

The new formulation facilitates the application of MTD to high-dimensional

of autoregressive Bernoulli generalized linear models, has not been previously
applied to the analysis of multivariate categorial time series. We develop
novel identifiability conditions of the MTD model and compare them to those for
mLTD. We further devise novel and efficient optimization algorithm for the MTD

comparison of methods for network inference in categorical time series and
opens the door to modern, regularized inference with the MTD model.

grounding our discussion in cosmology, a subject with increasingly precise data
in which this connection operates at several levels. It is important to take
into account the phenomenon of dangerous irrelevance: over long times or large
field ranges, physics can become sensitive to higher scales than the input
energies. This pertains in inflationary cosmology (and possibly other aspects
of horizon physics). String theory also contributes to our understanding of
observational constraints and search strategies at the level of low energy
field theory. We illustrate this with a current example concerning a new form
of non-Gaussianity generated by very massive degrees of freedom coupling to the
inflaton. New constraints on such fields and couplings can be obtained from
existing data, increasing our empirical knowledge of the universe. This builds
in part from the development of the string landscape, which is neither random

most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less
autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these
characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance
dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid
that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a
dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to
create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player
performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is
done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some
game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial
intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments
were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting
dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative
experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater
influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.

this paper, to study the temporal interaction between the traffic distributions
of two coexisting networks, we develop a renewal-theoretic packet collision
model and derive a generic collision-time distribution (CTD) function of an
interfered system. The CTD function holds for any busy- and idle-time
distributions of the coexisting traffic. As the earlier studies suggest a
long-tailed idle-time statistics in real environments, the developed model only
requires the Laplace transform of long-tailed distributions to find the CTD.
Furthermore, we present a packet error rate (PER) model under the proposed CTD
and multipath fading of the interfering signals. Using this model, a
computationally efficient PER approximation for interference-limited case is
developed to analyze the performance of an interfered link.

varied collection of cluster structures than the linear $k$-means clustering
algorithm. However, kernel $k$-means clustering is computationally expensive
when the non-linear feature map is high-dimensional and there are many input
points. Kernel approximation, e.g., the Nystr\""om method, has been applied in
previous works to approximately solve kernel learning problems when both of the
above conditions are present. This work analyzes the application of this
paradigm to kernel $k$-means clustering, and shows that applying the linear
$k$-means clustering algorithm to $\frac{k}{\epsilon} (1 + o(1))$ features
constructed using a so-called rank-restricted Nystr\""om approximation results
in cluster assignments that satisfy a $1 + \epsilon$ approximation ratio in
terms of the kernel $k$-means cost function, relative to the guarantee provided
by the same algorithm without the use of the Nystr\""om method. As part of the
analysis, this work establishes a novel $1 + \epsilon$ relative-error trace
norm guarantee for low-rank approximation using the rank-restricted Nystr\""om
approximation. Empirical evaluations on the $8.1$ million instance MNIST8M
dataset demonstrate the scalability and usefulness of kernel $k$-means
clustering with Nystr\""om approximation. This work argues that spectral
clustering using Nystr\""om approximation---a popular and computationally
efficient, but theoretically unsound approach to non-linear clustering---should
be replaced with the efficient and theoretically sound combination of kernel
$k$-means clustering with Nystr\""om approximation. The superior performance of
the latter approach is empirically verified.

to consider the stop production recoiling against a hard jet from the initial

particular, the kinematic variable $R_M$ which measures the ratio of the
lightest neutralino mass and the stop mass proved to be crucial in separating
the signals from the backgrounds in both the all-hadronic decay and the
semileptonic decay of the stops. Here we generalize the search method to the
dileptonic stop decays. In this case, due to the two missing neutrinos, there
are not enough kinematic constraint equations to solve for the $R_M$ variable
exactly, but only render an allowed interval consistent with the event.
However, we show that the minimum and the maximum values of this allowed
interval still provide useful variables in discriminating signals from the
backgrounds. Although in the traditional stop decay to a top quark and the
lightest neutralino, the dileptonic mode is not as competitive due to its small
branching ratio, it becomes the main search mode if the stops decay through the
charginos and sleptons with a compressed spectrum. We show that with the new
variables, the dileptonic search of the stop can cover regions of the parameter
space which have not been constrained before.

common regularized regression functions, often resemble neural network layers
with pre-specified weights. This observation has prompted the development of
learning-based approaches that purport to replace these iterations with
enhanced surrogates forged as DNN models from available training data. For
example, important NP-hard sparse estimation problems have recently benefitted
from this genre of upgrade, with simple feedforward or recurrent networks
ousting proximal gradient-based iterations. Analogously, this paper
demonstrates that more powerful Bayesian algorithms for promoting sparsity,
which rely on complex multi-loop majorization-minimization techniques, mirror
the structure of more sophisticated long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or
alternative gated feedback networks previously designed for sequence
prediction. As part of this development, we examine the parallels between
latent variable trajectories operating across multiple time-scales during
optimization, and the activations within deep network structures designed to
adaptively model such characteristic sequences. The resulting insights lead to
a novel sparse estimation system that, when granted training data, can estimate
optimal solutions efficiently in regimes where other algorithms fail, including
practical direction-of-arrival (DOA) and 3D geometry recovery problems. The

suggest a new target object (NGC 2976) that can be used for constraining
annihilating dark matter. The radio and x-ray data of NGC 2976 can put very
tight constraints on the leptophilic channels of dark matter annihilation. The
lower limits of dark matter mass annihilating via $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$ and
$\tau^+\tau^-$ channels are 200 GeV, 130 GeV and 110 GeV respectively with the
canonical thermal relic cross section. We suggest that this kind of large
nearby dwarf galaxies with relatively high magnetic field can be good
candidates for constraining annihilating dark matter in future analysis.

  We propose a flexible model for time series analysis, using exponential
smoothing cells for overlapping time windows. The approach can detect and
remove outliers, denoise data, fill in missing observations, and provide
meaningful forecasts in challenging situations. In contrast to classic
exponential smoothing, which solves a nonconvex optimization problem over the
smoothing parameters and initial state, the proposed approach requires solving
a single structured convex optimization problem. Recent developments in
efficient convex optimization of large-scale dynamic models make the approach
tractable. We illustrate new capabilities using synthetic examples, and then
use the approach to analyze and forecast noisy real-world time series. Code for
the approach and experiments is publicly available.

they fail frequently when there are complex interactions of multiple objects in

need for annotation of large corpus of data by annotating only small amount of

protocol is proposed, where a user with a strong channel condition acts as an
energy-harvesting (EH) relay to help a user with a poor channel condition. The
power splitting (PS) scheme is adopted at the EH relay. By jointly optimizing
the PS ratio and the beamforming vectors, the design objective is to maximize
the data rate of the ""strong user"" while satisfying the QoS requirement of the
""weak user"". It boils down to a challenging nonconvex problem. To resolve this
issue, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is applied to relax the
quadratic terms related with the beamformers, and then it is solved to its
global optimality by two-dimensional exhaustive search. We prove the rank-one
optimality, which establishes the equivalence between the relaxed problem and
the original one. To further reduce the high complexity due to the exhaustive
search, an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA)
is proposed, which can at least attain its stationary point efficiently. In
view of the potential application scenarios, e.g., IoT, the single-input
single-output (SISO) case of the cooperative SWIPT NOMA system is also studied.
The formulated problem is proved to be strictly unimodal with respect to the PS
ratio. Hence, a golden section search (GSS) based algorithm with closed-form
solution at each step is proposed to find the unique global optimal solution.
It is worth pointing out that the SCA method can also converge to the optimal
solution in SISO cases. In the numerical simulation, the proposed algorithm is
numerically shown to converge within a few iterations, and the SWIPT-aided NOMA
protocol outperforms the existing transmission protocols.

bimodal behavior inside the open interval $(0,\pi/2)$, i.e., it has two

for designing optimized multiplexing of filtered groups of CP-OFDM physical
resource blocks (PRBs) in a spectrally well-localized manner, i.e., with narrow

adjacent subbands, thus supporting independent waveform parametrization and
different numerologies for different groups of PRBs, as well as asynchronous
multiuser operation in uplink. These are central ingredients in the 5G waveform
developments, particularly at sub-6-GHz bands. The FC filter optimization
criterion is passband error vector magnitude minimization subject to a given

widths, PRB group sizes, and essential design parameters are compared in terms
of interference levels and implementation complexity. Finally, extensive coded

lasing, and, in most cases, a stronger pump leads to higher laser power at the
output. However, this behavior may be suppressed if two pump beams are used. In
this work, it is shown that lasing around the 1600 nm band can be suppressed
completely if two pumps, at wavelengths of 980 nm and 1550 nm, are applied
simultaneously to a Yb:Er-doped microlaser, whereas it can be revived by
switching one of them off. This phenomenon can be explained by assuming that
the existence of one pump (980 nm) changes the role of the other pump (1550
nm); more specifically, the 1550 nm pump starts to consume the population
inversion instead of increasing it when the 980 nm pump power exceeds a certain
value. As a result, the two pump fields lead to a closed-loop transition within
the gain medium (i.e., erbium ions). This study unveils an interplay similar
with coherence effects between different pump pathways, which provides a

spurious event-by-event fluctuations due to imprecise centrality determination
are eliminated via projecting out the component of the covariance influenced by
the centrality fluctuations. We bring up the relationship of the partial
covariance to the conditional covariance. Importantly, in the superposition
approach, where hadrons are produced independently from a collection of
sources, the framework allows us to impose centrality constraints on the number
of sources rather than hadrons, that way unfolding of the trivial fluctuations
from statistical hadronization and focusing better on the initial-state
physics. We show, using simulated data from hydrodynamics followed with
statistical hadronization, that the technique is practical and very simple to
use, giving insight into the correlations generated in the initial stage. We
also discuss the issues related to separation of the short- and long-range
components of the correlation functions, and show that in our example the
short-range component from the resonance decays is largely reduced by
considering pions of the same sign. We demonstrate the method explicitly on the
cases where centrality is determined with a single central control bin, or with
two peripheral control bins.

randomized block-coordinate version of the algorithm which converges under the

when the functions involved are either piecewise linear-quadratic, or when they
satisfy a certain quadratic growth condition (which is weaker than strong
convexity). Moreover, we apply the developed algorithms to the problem of
multi-agent optimization on a graph, thus obtaining novel synchronous and
asynchronous distributed methods. The proposed algorithms are fully distributed
in the sense that the updates and the stepsizes of each agent only depend on
local information. In fact, no prior global coordination is required. Finally,
we showcase an application of our algorithm in distributed formation control.

set of possible human actions is a critical open problem in computer vision.
Manually labeling training videos is feasible for some action classes but
doesn't scale to the full long-tailed distribution of actions. A promising way
to address this is to leverage noisy data from web queries to learn new
actions, using semi-supervised or ""webly-supervised"" approaches. However, these
methods typically do not learn domain-specific knowledge, or rely on iterative
hand-tuned data labeling policies. In this work, we instead propose a
reinforcement learning-based formulation for selecting the right examples for
training a classifier from noisy web search results. Our method uses Q-learning
to learn a data labeling policy on a small labeled training dataset, and then
uses this to automatically label noisy web data for new visual concepts.
Experiments on the challenging Sports-1M action recognition benchmark as well
as on additional fine-grained and newly emerging action classes demonstrate
that our method is able to learn good labeling policies for noisy data and use
this to learn accurate visual concept classifiers.

several thermodynamic quantities, each of which is associated with negligibly
fluctuating microscopic properties. Under small driving and LTE, locally
conserved quantities are transported as prescribed by linear hydrodynamic laws,
in which the local material properties of the system are represented by the
transport coefficients. In 1-dimensional systems, on the other hand, the
transport coefficients often appear to depend on the global state, rather than
on the local state of the system at hand. We interpret these facts within the
framework of boundary driven 1-dimensional Lennard-Jones chains of $N$
oscillators, observing that they experience non-negligible $O(N)$ lattice
distortions and fluctuations. This implies that standard hydrodynamics and
certain expressions of energy flow do not apply in these cases. One possible

enables numerous experimental techniques that are nowadays routinely used, for
instance, to create isolated attosecond pulses. Extending such techniques to
high-harmonic generation in solids requires a fundamental understanding of the
microscopic mechanism of the high-harmonic generation. Here, using extensive
first-principles simulations within a time-dependent density-functional
framework, we show how intraband and interband mechanisms are strongly and
differently affected by the ellipticity of the driving laser field. The complex
interplay between intraband and interband effects can be used to tune and
improve harmonic emission in solids. In particular, we show that the energy
cutoff of the high-harmonic plateau can be increased by as much as 30\% using a
finite ellipticity of the driving field, opening a new avenue for better
understanding and control of HHG in solids based on ellipticity. Also, we
demonstrate the possibility to generate, from a single circularly polarized
driving field, circularly polarized harmonics with alternating helicity. Our
work shows that ellipticity provides an additional knob to experimentally
control high-order harmonic generation in solids.

In particular, we consider PDEs that originate from variational principles
defined on the surfaces; these include Laplace-Beltrami equations and surface
wave equations. The approach is to systematically formulate extensions of the
variational integrals, derive the Euler-Lagrange equations of the extended
problem, including the boundary conditions} that can be easily discretized on
uniform Cartesian grids or adaptive meshes. In our approach, the surfaces are
defined implicitly by the distance functions or by the closest point mapping.
As such extensions are not unique, we investigate how a class of simple
extensions can influence the resulting PDEs. In particular, we reduce the
surface PDEs to model problems defined on a periodic strip and the
corresponding boundary conditions, and use classical Fourier and Laplace
transform methods to study the well-posedness of the resulting problems. For
elliptic and parabolic problems, our boundary closure mostly yields stable
algorithms to solve nonlinear surface PDEs. For hyperbolic problems, the
proposed boundary closure is unstable in general, but the instability can be
easily controlled by either adding a higher order regularization term or by
periodically but infrequently ""reinitializing"" the computed solutions. Some
numerical examples for each representative surface PDEs are presented.

terrain such as agricultural fields or orchards remains a challenging problem.
These environments involve large variations in both geometry and appearance,
challenging perception systems that rely on only a single sensor modality.
Geometrically, tall grass, fallen leaves, or terrain roughness can mistakenly
be perceived as nontraversable or might even obscure actual obstacles.
Likewise, traversable grass or dirt roads and obstacles such as trees and
bushes might be visually ambiguous. In this paper, we combine appearance- and
geometry-based detection methods by probabilistically fusing lidar and camera
sensing with semantic segmentation using a conditional random field. We apply a
state-of-the-art multimodal fusion algorithm from the scene analysis domain and
adjust it for obstacle detection in agriculture with moving ground vehicles.
This involves explicitly handling sparse point cloud data and exploiting both
spatial, temporal, and multimodal links between corresponding 2D and 3D
regions. The proposed method was evaluated on a diverse data set, comprising a
dairy paddock and different orchards gathered with a perception research robot
in Australia. Results showed that for a two-class classification problem
(ground and nonground), only the camera leveraged from information provided by
the other modality with an increase in the mean classification score of 0.5%.
However, as more classes were introduced (ground, sky, vegetation, and object),
both modalities complemented each other with improvements of 1.4% in 2D and
7.9% in 3D. Finally, introducing temporal links between successive frames
resulted in improvements of 0.2% in 2D and 1.5% in 3D.

integrate-and-fire neurons, in which excitatory connections are subject to a
structural plasticity rule based on firing rate homeostasis. We show that a
subgroup of neurons develop stronger within-group connectivity as a consequence
of receiving stronger external stimulation. In an experimentally
well-documented scenario we show that feature specific connectivity, similar to
what has been observed in rodent visual cortex, can emerge from such a
plasticity rule. The experience-dependent structural changes triggered by

common to a row and a column gives a double array. We propose the term
\emph{sesqui-array} for such an array when only the condition on pairs of
columns is deleted. Thus all triple arrays are sesqui-arrays.
  In this paper we give three constructions for sesqui-arrays. The first gives
$(n+1)\times n^2$ arrays on $n(n+1)$ letters for $n\geq 2$. (Such an array for
$n=2$ was found by Bagchi.) This construction uses Latin squares. The second
uses the \emph{Sylvester graph}, a subgraph of the Hoffman--Singleton graph, to
build a good block design for $36$ treatments in $42$ blocks of size~$6$, and
then uses this in a $7\times 36$ sesqui-array for $42$ letters.
  We also give a construction for $K\times(K-1)(K-2)/2$ sesqui-arrays on
$K(K-1)/2$ letters. This construction uses biplanes. It starts with a block of
a biplane and produces an array which satisfies the requirements for a
sesqui-array except possibly that of having no repeated letters in a row or
column. We show that this condition holds if and only if the \emph{Hussain
chains} for the selected block contain no $4$-cycles. A sufficient condition
for the construction to give a triple array is that each Hussain chain is a
union of $3$-cycles; but this condition is not necessary, and we give a few
further examples.
  We also discuss the question of which of these arrays provide good designs
for experiments.

governing equations are simplified in accordance with common assumptions of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and based on the assumption that the
over-all bulk flow is parallel to the wall, 1-dimensional equations for the
species and heat transport perpendicular to the wall have been formulated. The
equations are solved on a fine grid in order to fully resolve the boundary
layer, and the effect of allowing/disallowing deposition and chemical reactions
was investigated for a simplified test-case (4-component ideal mixture of

magnetograms with a cadence better than one per minute. It has been
continuously observing the Sun 24 hours a day for the past 7 years. The obvious
trade-off between full disk observations and spatial resolution makes HMI not
enough to analyze the smallest-scale events in the solar atmosphere. Our aim is
to develop a new method to enhance HMI data, simultaneously deconvolving and
super-resolving images and magnetograms. The resulting images will mimic
observations with a diffraction-limited telescope twice the diameter of HMI.
Our method, which we call Enhance, is based on two deep fully convolutional
neural networks that input patches of HMI observations and output deconvolved
and super-resolved data. The neural networks are trained on synthetic data
obtained from simulations of the emergence of solar active regions. We have
obtained deconvolved and supper-resolved HMI images. To solve this ill-defined
problem with infinite solutions we have used a neural network approach to add
prior information from the simulations. We test Enhance against Hinode data
that has been degraded to a 28 cm diameter telescope showing very good
consistency. The code is open source.

long-cadence time series observed by the \textit{Kepler} mission for a sample
of 34 M dwarf stars and the Sun in its active phase. Using the Multifractal
Detrending Moving Average algorithm (MFDMA), which enables the detection of
multifractality in nonstationary time series, we define a set of multifractal
indices based on the multifractal spectrum profile as a measure of the level of
stellar magnetic activity. This set of indices is given by the ($A$,$\Delta
\alpha$,$C$,$H$)-quartet, where $A$, $\Delta \alpha$ and $C$ are related to
geometric features from the multifractal spectrum and the global Hurst exponent
$H$ describes the global structure and memorability of time series dynamics. As
a test, we measure these indices and compare them with a magnetic index defined
as $S_{ph}$ and verify the degree of correlation among them. First, we apply
the Poincar\'e plot method and find a strong correlation between the
$\left\langle S_{ph}\right\rangle$ index and one of the descriptors that
emerges from this method. As a result, we find that this index is strongly
correlated with long-term features of the signal. From the multifractal
perspective, the $\left\langle S_{ph}\right\rangle$ index is also strongly
linked to the geometric properties of the multifractal spectrum except for the
$H$ index. Furthermore, our results emphasize that the rotation period of stars
is scaled by the $H$ index, which is consistent with Skumanich's relationship.
Finally, our approach suggests that the $H$ index may be related to the
evolution of stellar angular momentum and a star's magnetic properties.

vacuum expectation values of space-time derivatives of fields, a
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson appears without a canonical kinetic (quadratic

in a simple model allowing (meta)stable modulated vacuum of a phase modulation

normalizing constant (or overall effect) is added or removed are compared in
this paper. The latter setup, in which the exponential family is curved, is
particularly relevant when the sample space is an incomplete Cartesian product
or when it is very large, so that the computational burden is significant. The
lack or presence of the overall effect has a fundamental impact on the
properties of the exponential family. When the overall effect is added, the
family becomes the smallest regular exponential family containing the curved
one. The procedure is related to the homogenization of an inhomogeneous variety
discussed in algebraic geometry, of which a statistical interpretation is given
as an augmentation of the sample space. The changes in the kernel basis
representation when the overall effect is included or removed are derived. The
geometry of maximum likelihood estimates, also allowing zero observed
frequencies, is described with and without the overall effect, and various
algorithms are compared. The importance of the results is illustrated by an
example from cell biology, showing that routinely including the overall effect
leads to estimates which are not in the model intended by the researchers.

the thermal phonon number of a mechanical oscillator can be achieved under the

theoretical predictions, which were based on an optomechanical system's
time-independent steady states, we treat such cooling as a dynamical process of
driving the mechanical oscillator from its initial thermal state, due to its
thermal equilibrium with the environment, to a stabilized quantum state of
higher purity. We find that the stabilized thermal phonon number left in the
end actually depends on how fast the cooling process could be. The cooling
speed is decided by an effective optomechanical coupling intensity, which
constitutes an essential parameter for cooling, in addition to the sideband
resolution parameter that has been considered in other theoretical studies. The
limiting thermal phonon number that any cooling process cannot surpass exhibits
a discontinuous jump across a certain value of the parameter.

100 Myrs, based on the presence of two pairs of nearly bipolar X-ray cavities.
The molecular gas and dust within the central 2kpc is aligned with the
orientation of the inner pair of bipolar X-ray cavities, suggesting that the
most recent AGN outburst had a dynamical impact on the molecular gas. NGC 5044
also hosts many X-ray filaments within the central 8kpc, but there are no
obvious connections between the X-ray and H$\alpha$ filaments and the more
extended X-ray cavities that were inflated during the prior AGN outburst. Using
the linewidth of the blended Fe-L line complex as a diagnostic for multiphase
gas, we find that the majority of the multiphase, thermally unstable gas in NGC
5044 is confined within the X-ray filaments. While the cooling time and entropy
of the gas within the X-ray filaments are very similar, not all filaments show
evidence of gas cooling or an association with Ha emission. We suggest that the
various observed properties of the X-ray filaments are suggestive of an
evolutionary sequence where thermally unstable gas begins to cool, becomes
multiphased, develops Ha emitting plasma, and finally produces cold gas.

According to the DGT, the expression of the rotation of the galaxies is not a
continuous function of the redshift, there is a discontinuity at $\sim 0.77$.
According to their redshift, the galaxies form two groups. (a) Those with
redshift above 0.77 with declining rotation curves like $R^{\beta}$ with $\beta
\leq -0.5$ (Newtonian regime). (b) Those with redshift below 0.77 with rising
rotation curves like $R^{\beta}$ with $\beta \geq 0$ (Mondian regime). At

the dark energy and that at $z\sim 0.77 $, in addition to accelerating the
expansion, boosted the rotation of the galaxies again, inducing a transition
between the Newtonian regime to the Mondian regime. It is possible to check
that the characteristics on galaxy rotations provided by the DGT for a broad

the corresponding $f(z)\equiv f(T(H(z)))$ function. In this perspective, we
distinguish two cases: the first expansion is up to the jerk parameter, the
second expansion is up to the snap parameter. We show that inside the observed
redshift domain $z\leq1$, only the net strength of $f(z)$ is modified passing
from jerk to snap, whereas its functional behavior and shape turn out to be
identical. As first step, we set the cosmographic parameters by means of the
most recent observations. Afterwards, we calibrate our numerical solutions with
the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In both cases, there is a good agreement
with the cosmological standard model around $z\leq 1$, with severe
discrepancies outer of this limit. We demonstrate that the effective dark
energy term evolves following the test-function: $f(z)=\mathcal A+\mathcal
Bz^2e^{\mathcal Cz}$. Bounds over the set $\left\{\mathcal A, \mathcal B,
\mathcal C\right\}$ are also fixed by statistical considerations, comparing
discrepancies between $f(z)$ with data. The approach opens the possibility to
get a wide class of test-functions able to frame the dynamics of $f(T)$ without
postulating any model \emph{a priori}. We thus re-obtain the $f(T)$ function
through a back-scattering procedure once $f(z)$ is known. We figure out the

range of 715-910 K, no evidence of a negative temperature coefficient region in
terms of ignition delay response is found. The present experimental results are
also compared with previously reported RCM data of n-butanol in air. The order
of reactivity of the butanols is
n-butanol>s-butanol$\approx$i-butanol>t-butanol at the lower pressure, but
changes to n-butanol>t-butanol>s-butanol>i-butanol at higher pressure. In
addition, t-butanol shows pre-ignition heat release behavior, which is
especially evident at higher pressures. To help identify the controlling
chemistry leading to this pre-ignition heat release, off-stoichiometric
experiments are further performed at 30 bar compressed pressure, for t-butanol
at $\phi$ = 0.5 and $\phi$ = 2.0 in air. For these experiments, higher fuel
loading (i.e. $\phi$ = 2.0) causes greater pre-ignition heat release (as
indicated by greater pressure rise) than the stoichiometric or $\phi$ = 0.5
cases. Comparison of the experimental ignition delays with the simulated
results using two literature kinetic mechanisms shows generally good agreement,
and one mechanism is further used to explore and compare the fuel decomposition
pathways of the butanol isomers. Using this mechanism, the importance of peroxy

The goal of this paper is to show that the missing regularity can be

linear corrector operator with four central properties: it is computable,
$\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{curl})$-stable, quasi-local and allows for a correction of
coarse finite element functions so that first-order estimates (in terms of the

the right-hand side belongs to $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{div})$. With these four
properties, a practical application is to construct generalized finite element
spaces which can be straightforwardly used in a Galerkin method. In particular,
this characterizes a homogenized solution and a first order corrector,
including corresponding quantitative error estimates without the requirement of

number of schemes for its physical implementation have been put forward.
However, all previous schemes require two noncommuting gates to realize an

An effective attraction between passive particles, due to the surrounding
active medium, leads to true phase separation for large size ratios and volume
fractions of active particles. The effective interaction between active and
passive particles can be attractive or repulsive at short range depending on
the size ratio and volume fractions of the particles. This affects the
clustering of passive particles. We find three distinct phases based on the

radius and a collimated tail extending over 1'. Polarization measurements show
a highly ordered magnetic field in the nebula. It wraps around the edge of the
head and shows an azimuthal configuration near the pulsar, then switches
direction quasi-periodically near the bubble and in the tail. Together with the
flat radio spectrum observed, we suggest that this system is most plausibly a
pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with the head as a bow shock that has a low Mach
number and the bubble as a shell expanding in a dense environment. The bubble
could act as a magnetic bottle trapping the relativistic particles. A
comparison with other bow-shock PWNe with higher Mach numbers shows similar
structure and B-field geometry, implying that pulsar velocity may not be the
most critical factor in determining the properties of these systems.
  We also derive analytic expressions for the projected standoff distance and
shape of an inclined bow shock. It is found that the projected distance is
always larger than the true distance in three dimensions. On the other hand,
the projected shape is not sensitive to the inclination after rescaling with

which, by the elegant change of variables (considering the true anomaly f as
the independent variable), the governing equation of satellite rotation takes
the form of an Abel ODE of the second kind, a sort of generalization of the
Riccati ODE. We note that due to the special character of solutions of a
Riccati-type ODE, there exists the possibility of sudden jumping in the
magnitude of the solution at some moment of time. In the physical sense, this
jumping of the Riccati-type solutions of the governing ODE could be associated
with the effect of sudden acceleration/deceleration in the satellite rotation
around the chosen principle axis at a definite moment of parametric time. This
means that there exists not only a chaotic satellite rotation regime (as per
the results of J. Wisdom et al. (1984)), but a kind of gradient catastrophe
(Arnold 1992) could occur during the satellite rotation process. We especially
note that if a gradient catastrophe could occur, this does not mean that it
must occur: such a possibility depends on the initial conditions. In addition,
we obtained asymptotical solutions that manifest a quasi-periodic character
even with the strong simplifying assumptions e ~ 0, p = 1, which reduce the
governing equation of J. Wisdom et al. (1984) to a kind of Beletskii equation.

trapping, release and retrapping of particles results in a characteristic
step-wise relaxation process, with alternating regions of fast and slow

minimal prototype model which displays these characteristics. We then treat the
effect of dispersive interaction in a model corresponding to an adsorbate
diffusing on a circular membrane interacting with its three lowest vibrational

the distance from thermal equilibrium --and hence the degree of residual

Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), for approximately solving
combinatorial optimization problems. A level-p QAOA circuit consists of p
steps; in each step a classical Hamiltonian, derived from the cost function, is
applied followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. The 2p times for which these two
Hamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be
optimized classically for the best performance. As p increases, parameter
optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. The
success of the QAOA approach will depend, in part, on finding effective
parameter-setting strategies. Here, we analytically and numerically study
parameter setting for QAOA applied to MaxCut. For level-1 QAOA, we derive an
analytical expression for a general graph. In principle, expressions for higher
p could be derived, but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive. For a
special case of MaxCut, the ring of disagrees, or the 1D antiferromagnetic
ring, we provide an analysis for arbitrarily high level. Using a fermionic
representation, the evolution of the system under QAOA translates into quantum
control of an ensemble of independent spins. This treatment enables us to
obtain analytical expressions for the performance of QAOA for any p. It also
greatly simplifies numerical search for the optimal values of the parameters.
By exploring symmetries, we identify a lower-dimensional sub-manifold of
interest; the search effort can be accordingly reduced. This analysis also
explains an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values. Further, we
numerically investigate the parameter landscape and show that it is a simple
one in the sense of having no local optima.

of conventional SMR is observed over a wide range of temperatures as well as
magnetic fields stronger than 0.25T. The negative sign of the SMR can be
explained by the alignment of magnetic moments being almost perpendicular to
the external magnetic field within the easy plane (111) of the antiferromagnet.
This correlation of magnetic moment alignment and external magnetic field
direction is realized just by the easy-plane nature of the material without the
need of any exchange coupling to an additional ferromagnet. The SMR signal
strength decreases with increasing temperature, primarily due to the decrease
in N\'eel order by including fluctuations. An increasing magnetic field
increases the SMR signal strength as there are less domains and the magnetic
moments are more strongly manipulated at high magnetic fields. The SMR is
saturated at an applied magnetic field of $6$~T resulting in a spin-mixing
conductance of $\sim10^{18}~ \Omega^{-1}$m$^{-2}$, which is comparable to that
of Pt on insulating ferrimagnets such as yttrium iron garnet. An argon plasma

vulnerabilities in code. In order to mitigate the risks arising from such
vulnerabilities, various techniques have been proposed to isolate the execution
of sensitive code from the rest of the application and from other software on
the platform (e.g. the operating system). However, even with these partitioning
techniques, it is not immediately clear exactly how they can and should be used
to partition applications. What overall partitioning scheme should be followed;
what granularity of the partitions should be. To some extent, this is dependent
on the capabilities and performance of the partitioning technology in use. For
this work, we focus on the upcoming Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
technology as the state-of-the-art in this field. SGX provides a trusted
execution environment, called an enclave, that protects the integrity of the
code and the confidentiality of the data inside it from other software,
including the operating system. We present a novel framework consisting of four
possible schemes under which an application can be partitioned. These schemes
range from coarse-grained partitioning, in which the full application is
included in a single enclave, through ultra-fine partitioning, in which each
application secret is protected in an individual enclave. We explain the
specific security benefits provided by each of the partitioning schemes and
discuss how the performance of the application would be affected. To compare
the different partitioning schemes, we have partitioned OpenSSL using four
different schemes. We discuss SGX properties together with the implications of
our design choices in this paper.

the world. Its earliest sign are red lesions, a general term that groups both
microaneurysms and hemorrhages. In daily clinical practice, these lesions are
manually detected by physicians using fundus photographs. However, this task is
tedious and time consuming, and requires an intensive effort due to the small
size of the lesions and their lack of contrast. Computer-assisted diagnosis of
DR based on red lesion detection is being actively explored due to its
improvement effects both in clinicians consistency and accuracy. Several
methods for detecting red lesions have been proposed in the literature, most of
them based on characterizing lesion candidates using hand crafted features, and
classifying them into true or false positive detections. Deep learning based
approaches, by contrast, are scarce in this domain due to the high expense of
annotating the lesions manually. In this paper we propose a novel method for
red lesion detection based on combining both deep learned and domain knowledge.
Features learned by a CNN are augmented by incorporating hand crafted features.
Such ensemble vector of descriptors is used afterwards to identify true lesion
candidates using a Random Forest classifier. We empirically observed that
combining both sources of information significantly improve results with
respect to using each approach separately. Furthermore, our method reported the
highest performance on a per-lesion basis on DIARETDB1 and e-ophtha, and for
screening and need for referral on MESSIDOR compared to a second human expert.
Results highlight the fact that integrating manually engineered approaches with
deep learned features is relevant to improve results when the networks are
trained from lesion-level annotated data. An open source implementation of our
system is publicly available online.

in the temperature range 650-900 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and
2.0. Additionally, the initial fuel mole fraction and initial oxygen mole
fraction were varied independently to determine the influence of each on
ignition delay. Over the conditions studied, it was found that the reactivity
of the mixture increased as equivalence ratio, initial fuel mole fraction or
initial oxygen mole fraction increased. A non-linear correlation to the
experimental data was performed and showed nearly second order dependence on
the initial oxygen mole fraction and nearly first order dependence on initial
fuel mole fraction and compressed pressure. This was the first study of the
ignition of n-butanol in this temperature and pressure range, and contributes
to a better understanding of the chemistry of this fuel under the conditions
relevant to practical devices. Experimentally measured ignition delays were
compared against the ignition delay computed from several reaction mechanisms
in the literature. The agreement between experiments and simulations was found
to be unsatisfactory. Sensitivity analysis was performed and indicated that the
uncertainties of the rate constants of parent fuel decomposition reactions play
a major role in causing the poor agreement. Further path analysis of the fuel
decomposition reactions supported this conclusion and highlighted the
particular importance of certain pathways. Based on these results, it was
concluded that further investigation of the fuel decomposition, including
speciation measurements, will be required.

cooperation at a population level. However, stochastic mutation of strategies
was not considered in the analysis of AGoS. Here we analyzed the evolution of
cooperation using AGoS where mutation may occur to strategies of individuals in

novel indications for existing drugs, or drug repositioning, can serve as a
useful strategy to shorten the development cycle. In this study, we present an
approach to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a
particular disease based on expression profiles of drugs, with a focus on
applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the
disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as good candidates for
repurposing. This framework is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with
expression profiles measured, even if the drug targets are unknown. It is also
highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We
applied this approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia
as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches for prediction, including
deep neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), elastic net, random forest
and gradient boosted machines. The performance of the five approaches did not
differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperformed the others. However,
methods with lower predictive accuracy can still reveal literature-supported
candidates that are of different mechanisms of actions. As a further
validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric
medications considered in clinical trials. Notably, many top repositioning hits
are supported by previous preclinical or clinical studies. Finally, we propose
that ML approaches may provide a new avenue to explore drug mechanisms via
examining the variable importance of gene features.

Three red clump (RC) stars are identified at V = 16.00 mag, I = 14.41 mag and
B-V = 1.35 mag. From the mean Ks-band magnitude of RC stars (Ks=12.39 +- 0.21
mag) in Ruprecht 6 from 2MASS photometry and the known absolute magnitudes of
the RC stars (M_Ks = -1.595 +- 0.025 mag), we obtain the distance modulus to
Ruprecht 6 (m-M)_0 = 13.84 +- 0.21 mag (d=5.86 +- 0.60 kpc). From the (J-K_s)
and (B-V) colors of the RC stars, comparison of the (B-V) and (V-I) colors of
the bright stars in Ruprecht 6 with those of the intrinsic colors of dwarf and
giant stars, and the PARSEC isochrone fittings, we derive the reddening values
of E(B-V) = 0.42 mag and E(V-I) = 0.60 mag. Using the PARSEC isochrone fittings
onto the color-magnitude diagrams, we estimate the age and metallicity to be:
log (t) =9.50 +- 0.10 (t =3.16 +- 0.82 Gyr) and [Fe/H] = -0.42 +- 0.04 dex. We
present the Galactocentric radial metallicity gradient analysis for old (age >
1 Gyr) open clusters of Dias et al. catalog, which likely follow a single
relation of [Fe/H] =(-0.034 +- 0.007) R_GC + (0.190 +- 0.080) (rms = 0.201) for
the whole radial range or dual relation of [Fe/H] =(-0.077 +- 0.017) R_GC +
(0.609 +- 0.161) (rms = 0.152) and constant ([Fe/H] ~ -0.3 dex) value, inside
and outside of R_GC ~ 12 kpc, respectively. The metallicity and Galactocentric
radius (13.28 +- 0.54 kpc) of Ruprecht 6 obtained in this study seem to be
consistent with both of the relations.

planet formation, therefore it is important to study their physical and
chemical structure. Because of their volatility, nitrogen-bearing molecules are
key to study the dense and cold gas present in pre-stellar cores. The NH_3
rotational transition detected with Herschel-HIFI provides a unique combination
of sensitivity and spectral resolution to further investigate physical and
chemical processes in pre-stellar cores. Here we present the velocity-resolved
Herschel-HIFI observations of the ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) line at 572 GHz and study
the abundance profile of ammonia across the pre-stellar core L1544 to test
current theories of its physical and chemical structure.
  Recently calculated collisional coefficients have been included in our
non-LTE radiative transfer code to reproduce Herschel observations. A gas-grain
chemical model, including spin-state chemistry and applied to the (static)
physical structure of L1544 is also used to infer the abundance profile of
ortho-NH_3 . The hyperfine structure of ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) is resolved for the
first time in space. All the hyperfine components are strongly self-absorbed.
The profile can be reproduced if the core is contracting in quasi-equilibrium,
consistent with previous work, and if the NH_3 abundance is slightly rising
toward the core centre, as deduced from previous interferometric observations
of para-NH_3(1,1). The chemical model overestimates the NH_3 abundance at radii
between ~ 4000 and 15000 AU by about two orders of magnitude and underestimates
the abundance toward the core centre by more than one order of magnitude. Our
observations show that chemical models applied to static clouds have problems
in reproducing NH_3 observations.

species and as a correction to the Friedmann Equation in the simplest

constraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results
for light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and
the power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark
radiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion
rate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.
This changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its
influence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface
of last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range
for both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\%$ and $+6.2\%$ of
the {\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev. Combining this result with
fits to the CMB power spectrum, produces different results for particle vs.
brane-world dark radiation. In the brane-world, the range decreases to $-6.0\%$
to $+6.2\%$. Thus, we find, that the ratio of dark radiation to the background
total relativistic mass energy density $\rho_{\rm DR}/\rho$ is consistent with
zero although there remains a very slight preference for a positive (rather

literature to study the low-to-intermediate temperature ignition of many fuels.
In a typical RCM, the pressure during and after the compression stroke is
measured. However, measurement of the temperature history in the RCM reaction
chamber is challenging. Thus, the temperature is generally calculated by the
isentropic relations between pressure and temperature, assuming that the
adiabatic core hypothesis holds. To estimate the uncertainty in the calculated
temperature, an uncertainty propagation analysis must be carried out. Our
previous analyses assumed that the uncertainties of the parameters in the
equation to calculate the temperature were normally distributed and
independent, but these assumptions do not hold for typical RCM operating
procedures. In this work, a Monte Carlo method is developed to estimate the
uncertainty in the calculated temperature, while taking into account the
correlation between parameters and the possibility of non-normal probability
distributions. In addition, the Monte Carlo method is compared to an analysis
that assumes normally distributed, independent parameters. Both analysis
methods show that the magnitude of the initial pressure and the uncertainty of
the initial temperature have strong influences on the magnitude of the
uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty estimation methods studied here provide a
reference value for the uncertainty of the reference temperature in an RCM and
can be generalized to other similar facilities.

2.5x10^-5 Hz at 8x10^3 s of integration are achieved over this longest link.
This stability is compared to that achieved over buried links for both radio
and microwave frequencies. The results show that aerial fiber links are a
suitable alternative to buried links for a wide range of frequency transfer
applications.

  Near-Ultraviolet Colors of Type Ia Supernovae",,,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa5f5a",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is
important to their use as cosmological standard candles. Understanding the
effects of reddening and redshift on the observed colors are complicated and
dependent on the intrinsic spectrum, the filter curves, and the wavelength
dependence of reddening. We present ultraviolet and optical data of a growing
sample of SNe Ia observed with the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope on the Swift
spacecraft and use this sample to re-examine the near-UV (NUV) colors of SNe
Ia. We find that a small amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.2 mag) could account for
the difference between groups designated as NUV-blue and NUV-red, and a
moderate amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.5 mag) could account for the whole
NUV-optical differences. The reddening scenario, however, is inconsistent with
the mid-UV colors and color evolution. The effect of redshift alone only
accounts for part of the variation. Using a spectral template of SN2011fe we
can forward model the effects of redshift and reddening and directly compare
with the observed colors. We find that some SNe are consistent with reddened
versions of SN2011fe, but most SNe Ia are much redder in the uvw1-v color than
SN2011fe reddened to the same b-v color. The absolute magnitudes show that two
of five NUV-blue SNe Ia are blue because their near-UV luminosity is high, and
the other three are optically fainter. We also show that SN2011fe is not a
""normal"" SN Ia in the UV, but has colors placing it at the blue extreme of our
sample.

of electromagnetic waves in the vacuum the presence of ML does not change the
consequences of LV. On the other hand, in a material media ML changes the whole

We then considered the set of modified equations in material media and
investigate the metamaterial behaviour as a consequence of LV and ML. We show
that a negative index refraction can be derived from the presence of a
non-commutativity suitably tuned by the $\beta$ parameter, while in the
presence of LV, we obtained the set of modified Maxwell equation in terms of
the corresponding material fields with terms depending explicitly from the
terms of interaction between the material fields depending on non-commutativity
with the background field due to CPT-odd LV. We conclude that a new set of

  Patents and Field-test data",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this research we study productivity trends of hybrid corn - an important
subdomain of food production. We estimate the yearly rate of yield improvement
of hybrid corn (measured as bushel per acre) by using both information on
yields contained in US patent documents for patented hybrid corn varieties and
on field-test data of several hybrid corn varieties performed at US State
level. We have used a generalization of Moore's law to fit productivity trends
and obtain the performance improvement rate by analyzing time series of hybrid
corn performance for a period covering the last thirty years. The linear
regressions results obtained from different data sources indicate that the
estimated improvement rates per year are between 1.2 and 2.4 percent. In
particular, using yields reported in a sample of patents filed between 1985 and
2010, we estimated an improvement rate of 0.015 (R2 = 0.74, Pvalue = 1.37 x
10^-8). Moreover, we apply two predicting models developed by Benson and Magee
(2015) and Triulzi and Magee (2016) that only use patent metadata to estimate
the rate of improvement. We compare these predicted values to the rate
estimated using US States field-test data. We find that, due to a turning point
in patenting practices which begun in 2008, only the predicted rate (rate =
0.015) using patents filed before 2008 is consistent with the empirical rate.
Finally, we also investigate at the micro level - on the basis of 70 patents
(granted between 1986 and 2015) - whether the number of citations received by a
patent is correlated with performance achieved by the patented variety. We find
that the relative performance (yield ratio) of the patented seed is positively
correlated with the total number of citations received by the patent (until
December 2015) but not the citations received within 3 years after the granted
year, with the patent application year used as control variable.

  Society General Meeting (PESGM), Chicago, IL, 2017",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While power systems are reliable infrastructures, their complex
interconnectivities allow for propagation of disturbances through cascading
failures which causes blackouts. Meanwhile the ever increasing penetration
level of renewable generation into power grids introduces a massive amount of
uncertainty to the grid that might have a severe impact on grid vulnerability
to overload cascading failures. There are numerous studies in the literature
that focus on modeling cascading failures with different approaches. However,
there is a need for studies that simulate cascading failure considering the
uncertainty coming from high penetration of renewable generation. In this
study, the impacts of wind generation in terms of its penetration and
uncertainty levels on grid vulnerability to cascading overload failures are
studied. The simulation results on IEEE 300 bus system show that uncertainty
coming from wind energy have severe impact on grid vulnerability to cascading
overload failures. Results also suggest that higher penetration levels of wind
energy if not managed appropriately will add to this severity due to injection
of higher uncertainties into the grid.

characterize the lentigo, a phenomenon that originates at the dermo-epidermic

skin depths and are analyzed for each depth. Histograms of pixel intensities
associated with a given depth are determined, showing that the generalized
gamma distribution (GGD) is a good statistical model for confocal images. A GGD
is parameterized by translation, scale and shape parameters. These parameters
are estimated using a new estimation method based on a natural gradient descent
showing fast convergence properties with respect to state-of-the-art estimation
methods. The resulting parameter estimates can be used to classify clinical
images of healthy and lentigo patients. The obtained results show that the
scale and shape parameters are good features to identify and characterize the
