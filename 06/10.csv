  Recognition","12 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic textures exist in various forms, e.g., fire, smoke, and traffic jams,
but recognizing dynamic texture is challenging due to the complex temporal
variations. In this paper, we present a novel approach stemmed from slow
feature analysis (SFA) for dynamic texture recognition. SFA extracts slowly
varying features from fast varying signals. Fortunately, SFA is capable to
leach invariant representations from dynamic textures. However, complex
temporal variations require high-level semantic representations to fully
achieve temporal slowness, and thus it is impractical to learn a high-level
representation from dynamic textures directly by SFA. In order to learn a
robust low-level feature to resolve the complexity of dynamic textures, we
propose manifold regularized SFA (MR-SFA) by exploring the neighbor
relationship of the initial state of each temporal transition and retaining the
locality of their variations. Therefore, the learned features are not only
slowly varying, but also partly predictable. MR-SFA for dynamic texture
recognition is proposed in the following steps: 1) learning feature extraction
functions as convolution filters by MR-SFA, 2) extracting local features by
convolution and pooling, and 3) employing Fisher vectors to form a video-level
representation for classification. Experimental results on dynamic texture and
dynamic scene recognition datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

which enable users to access intended services and improve services'
efficiency. However, privacy may be a concern of e-ticket users. In this paper,
a privacy-preserving electronic ticket scheme with attribute-based credentials
is proposed to protect users' privacy and facilitate ticketing based on a
user's attributes. Our proposed scheme makes the following contributions: (1)
users can buy different tickets from ticket sellers without releasing their
exact attributes; (2) two tickets of the same user cannot be linked; (3) a
ticket cannot be transferred to another user; (4) a ticket cannot be double
spent; (5) the security of the proposed scheme is formally proven and reduced
to well known (q-strong Diffie-Hellman) complexity assumption; (6) the scheme
has been implemented and its performance empirically evaluated. To the best of
our knowledge, our privacy-preserving attribute-based e-ticket scheme is the
first one providing these five features. Application areas of our scheme
include event or transport tickets where users must convince ticket sellers
that their attributes (e.g. age, profession, location) satisfy the ticket price
policies to buy discounted tickets. More generally, our scheme can be used in
any system where access to services is only dependent on a user's attributes
(or entitlements) but not their identities.

of a multilayer (ML) in which the interfacing gives rise the redistribution of
the electronic charges. The ensuing electrical field couples self-consistently
to the itinerant electrons, so that the properties of the ML crucially depend
on an interplay between the on-site Coulomb forces and the long range
electrostatic forces. The ML is described by the Falicov-Kimball model and the
self-consistent solution is obtained by iterating simultaneously the DMFT and
the Poisson equations. This yields the reconstructed charge profile, the
electrical potential, the planar density of states, the transport function, and
the transport coefficients of the device.
  We find that a heterostructure built of two Mott-Hubbard insulators exhibits,
in a large temperature interval, a linear conductivity and a large
temperature-independent thermopower. The charge and energy currents are
confined to the central part of the ML. Our results indicate that correlated
multilayers have the potential for applications; by tuning the band shift and
the Coulomb correlation on the central planes, we can bring the chemical
potential in the immediate proximity of the Mott-Hubbard gap edge and optimize
the transport properties of the device. In such a heterostructure, a small gate
voltage can easily induce a MI transition. This switching does not involve the
diffusion of electrons over macroscopic distances and it is much faster than in
ordinary semiconductors. Furthermore, the right combination of strongly
correlated materials with small ZT can produce, theoretically at least, a
heterostructure with a large ZT.

layered oxides have emerged among the leading candidates for the
next-generation energy storage cathode material, delivering 50 % excess
capacity over commercially used compounds. Oxygen-redox reactions are believed
to be responsible for the excess capacity, however, voltage fading has
prevented commercialization of these new materials. Despite extensive research
the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning oxygen-redox reactions and
voltage fade remain incomplete. Here, using operando three-dimensional Bragg
coherent diffractive imaging, we directly observe nucleation of a mobile
dislocation network in nanoparticles of lithium-rich layered oxide material.
Surprisingly, we find that dislocations form more readily in the lithium-rich
layered oxide material as compared with a conventional layered oxide material,
suggesting a link between the defects and the anomalously high capacity in
lithium-rich layered oxides. The formation of a network of partial dislocations
dramatically alters the local lithium environment and contributes to the
voltage fade. Based on our findings we design and demonstrate a method to
recover the original high voltage functionality. Our findings reveal that the
voltage fade in lithium-rich layered oxides is reversible and call for new
paradigms for improved design of oxygen-redox active materials.

$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ are vertices of an $n$-gon $P$ in cyclic order, then
$P$ is affinely regular if, and only if there is some $\lambda \geq 0$ such
that $p_{j+2}-p_{j-1} = \lambda (p_{j+1}-p_j)$ for $j=1,2,\ldots, n$. The aim
of this paper is to examine the properties of polygons whose vertices
$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n \in \mathbb{C}$ satisfy the property that
$p_{j+m_1}-p_{j+m_2} = w (p_{j+k}-p_j)$ for some $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and
$m_1,m_2,k \in \mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we show that in `most' cases this
implies that the polygon is affinely regular, but in some special cases there
are polygons which satisfy this property but are not affinely regular. The
proofs are based on the use of linear algebraic and number theoretic tools. In
addition, we apply our method to characterize polytopes with certain symmetry
groups.

avoided due to a quantum bounce. The universe is then launched in a stiff

returning to the dust expanding phase, the final attractor of the model. Hence
one has obtained a nonsingular cosmological model where a single scalar field
can describe both the matter contracting phase of a bouncing model, necessary
to give an almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar cosmological
perturbations, and a transient expanding dark energy phase. As the universe is
necessarily dust dominated in the far past, usual adiabatic vacuum initial

In addition to proving that $G$ is symmetric, he conjectured that $G$ is Schur
positive. We prove this conjecture by expanding $G$ positively in terms of
ribbon Schur functions. We obtain this expansion using a weight-preserving
bijection whose inverse is inspired by the Push-Glide algorithm of

characters. We also construct an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-action on regions of the

compute the character of this action by employing Lagrange inversion. The
resulting expression generalizes Postnikov's formula for the number of regions

computation used in convolutional operations while increasing representational
efficiency. They have been shown to be successful in image classification
models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given
parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the
number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets
family of architectures). Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks
have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work,
we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine
translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet,
called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count
and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a
similar parameter count, achieves new state-of-the-art results. In addition to
showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine
translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we
observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of
convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a
new ""super-separable"" convolution operation that further reduces the number of
parameters and computational cost for obtaining state-of-the-art results.

they deposit angular momentum, opening a gap in the disk. This has been well
studied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far, only
for the primary spiral arm -- the one directly attached to the planet. Using
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and
tertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into
shocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with
time in a low viscosity disk ($\alpha = 5\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass
planets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open
multiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying
our results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet
embedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the
positions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly
reproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm

to the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate
observational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of
multiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment
on the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD~163296 disk.

dramatically improving CHARIS' performance. The $\chi^2$ extraction produces a

strong-interaction effects within a parabolic approximation of the OL wells. We
find that strong antiferromagnetic correlations emerge in deep OLs, and also in
very shallow OLs if the interaction strength approaches the Tonks-Girardeau

regenerative devices: the potential antigenicity, and limited mechanical

cross-linked state and is mechanically tougher than the monomeric,
cross-link-free (acid-soluble) collagen ex vivo. The antigenicity of collagen,
on the other hand, is mainly ascribed to inter-species variations in amino acid
sequences, which are primarily located in the non-helical terminal
telopeptides. Although these can be removed through enzymatic treatment to
produce atelocollagen, the effect of telopeptide removal on triple helix
organization, amino acidic composition and thermal properties is often
disregarded. Here, we compare the structural, chemical and physical properties
of polymeric and monomeric type I collagen with and without telopeptides, in an
effort to elucidate the influence that either covalent crosslinks or
telopeptides possess. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to examine the triple
helical conformation and quantify the denaturation temperature (Td) of both
monomeric collagen (36.5 {\deg}C) and monomeric atelocollagen (35.5 {\deg}C).
CD measurements were combined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in
order to gain insight into the triple helix-to-coil thermal transition and

in terms of the nature of the reconnection process and the energetics of the

asymmetric reconnection, on a thin reconnection region within a broader

easily interpreted as projection of a sheet that is extended along the line of

asymmetric reconnection is also plausible. Other events favor an interpretation
as a thin current sheet embedded in a streamer-like structure.

the parameters of a parameterized function. A learning rule is an algorithm or
mathematical expression that specifies precisely how the parameters should be
changed. When creating an artificial intelligence system, we must make two
decisions: what representation should be used (i.e., what parameterized
function should be used) and what learning rule should be used to search
through the resulting set of representable functions. Using most learning
rules, these two decisions are coupled in a subtle (and often unintentional)
way. That is, using the same learning rule with two different representations
that can represent the same sets of functions can result in two different
outcomes. After arguing that this coupling is undesirable, particularly when
using artificial neural networks, we present a method for partially decoupling
these two decisions for a broad class of learning rules that span unsupervised
learning, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning.

role in describing the physics of quantum systems, and in particular is a
prerequisite for discussing important concepts such as entanglement and
information transfer. While subsystems can be readily defined for finite
quantum systems and in local quantum field theory, a corresponding definition
for gravitational systems is significantly complicated by the apparent
nonlocality arising due to gauge invariance, enforced by the constraints. A
related question is whether ""soft hair"" encodes otherwise localized
information, and the question of such localization also remains an important
puzzle for proposals that gravity emerges from another structure such as a
boundary field theory as in AdS/CFT. This paper describes different approaches
to defining local subsystem structure, and shows that at least classically,
perturbative gravity has localized subsystems based on a split structure,
generalizing the split property of quantum field theory. This, and related
arguments for QED, give simple explanations that in these theories there is
localized information that is independent of fields outside a region, in
particular so that there is no role for ""soft hair"" in encoding such
information. Additional subtleties appear in quantum gravity. We argue that
localized information exists in perturbative quantum gravity in the presence of
global symmetries, but that nonperturbative dynamics is likely tied to a
modification of such structure.

computation where the underlying communication network is the complete graph of
$n$ nodes. In this paper we consider the situation where the joint input to the
nodes is an $n$-node labeled graph $G$, i.e., the local input received by each
node is the indicator function of its neighborhood in $G$. Nodes execute an
algorithm, communicating with each other in synchronous rounds and their goal
is to compute some function that depends on $G$. In every round, each of the
$n$ nodes may send up to $n-1$ different $b$-bit messages through each of its
$n-1$ communication links. We denote by $R$ the number of rounds of the
algorithm. The product $Rb$, that is, the total number of bits received by a
node through one link, is the cost of the algorithm.
  The most difficult problem we could attempt to solve is the reconstruction
problem, where nodes are asked to recover all the edges of the input graph $G$.
Formally, given a class of graphs $\mathcal G$, the problem is defined as
follows: if $G \notin {\mathcal G}$, then every node must reject; on the other
hand, if $G \in {\mathcal G}$, then every node must end up, after the $R$
rounds, knowing all the edges of $G$. It is not difficult to see that the cost
$Rb$ of any algorithm that solves this problem (even with public coins) is at
least $\Omega(\log|\mathcal{G}_n|/n)$, where $\mathcal{G}_n$ is the subclass of
all $n$-node labeled graphs in $\mathcal G$. In this paper we prove that
previous bound is tight and that it is possible to achieve it with only $R=2$
rounds. More precisely, we exhibit (i) a one-round algorithm that achieves this
bound for hereditary graph classes; and (ii) a two-round algorithm that
achieves this bound for arbitrary graph classes.

equation in terms of Airy functions, which are semiclassically concentrated on
certain Lagrangian curves in two-dimensional phase space. These curves are
defined by the eigenvalues and the Hamiltonian function of the associated
one-dimensional Schr\""odinger operator, and they play a crucial role in the
quantum interference mechanism in phase space. We assume that the potential of
the Schr\""odinger operator is a single potential well, such that the spectrum
is discrete.
  The construction starts from an eigenfunction series expansion of the
solution, which is derived here for first time in a systematic way, by
combining the elementary technique of separation of variables with involved
spectral results for the Moyal star exponential operator. The eigenfunctions of
the Wigner equation are the Wigner transforms of the Schr\""odinger
eigenfunctions, and they are approximated in terms of Airy functions by a
uniform stationary phase approximation of the Wigner transforms of the WKB
expansions of the Schr\""odinger eigenfunctions.
  The approximation of the eigenfunction series is an approximated solution of
the Wigner equation, which by projection onto the configuration space provides
an approximate wave amplitude, free of turning point singularities. It is
generally expected that, the derived wave amplitude is bounded, and correctly
scaled, even on caustics, since only finite terms of the approximate terms are
significant for WKB initial wave functions with finite energy.
  The details of the calculations are presented for the simple potential of the
harmonic oscillator, in order to be able to check our approximations
analytically. But, the same construction can be applied to any potential well,
which behaves like the harmonic oscillator near the bottom of the well.

find the best source camera (already installed) to adapt with a newly
introduced target camera, without requiring a very expensive training phase.
Second, we introduce a transitive inference algorithm for re-identification

rates of consistency for cluster tree estimation for Holder smooth densities of
arbitrary degree \alpha. We present a computationally efficient, rate optimal
cluster tree estimator based on a straightforward extension of the popular
density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN by Ester et al. [1996]. The procedure
relies on a kernel density estimator with an appropriate choice of the kernel
and bandwidth to produce a sequence of nested random geometric graphs whose
connected components form a hierarchy of clusters. The resulting optimal rates
for cluster tree estimation depend on the degree of smoothness of the
underlying density and, interestingly, match minimax rates for density
estimation under the supremum norm. Our results complement and extend the
analysis of the DBSCAN algorithm in Sriperumbudur and Steinwart [2012].
Finally, we consider level set estimation and cluster consistency for densities

by close to a factor of 2 for lepton asymmetries departing from those yielding
the coolest distribution functions.
  Our Ly-a forest bounds can be strengthened if we include higher-resolution

  Cross-Correlation Search in Advanced LIGO Data","19 pages, 8 figures. Formatted with AASTeX 6.1. Published in The
  Astrophysical Journal","The Astrophysical Journal, 847:47 (14pp), 2017 September 20","10.3847/1538-4357/aa86f0","LIGO-P1600297","astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the results of a semicoherent search for continuous gravitational
waves from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, using data from the first
Advanced LIGO observing run. The search method uses details of the modelled,
parametrized continuous signal to combine coherently data separated by less
than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to trade off sensitivity
against computational cost. A search was conducted over the frequency range
from 25 Hz to 2000 Hz, spanning the current observationally-constrained range
of the binary orbital parameters. No significant detection candidates were
found, and frequency-dependent upper limits were set using a combination of
sensitivity estimates and simulated signal injections. The most stringent upper
limit was set at 175 Hz, with comparable limits set across the most sensitive
frequency range from 100 Hz to 200 Hz. At this frequency, the 95 pct upper
limit on signal amplitude h0 is 2.3e-25 marginalized over the unknown
inclination angle of the neutron star's spin, and 8.03e-26 assuming the best
orientation (which results in circularly polarized gravitational waves). These
limits are a factor of 3-4 stronger than those set by other analyses of the
same data, and a factor of about 7 stronger than the best upper limits set
using initial LIGO data. In the vicinity of 100 Hz, the limits are a factor of
between 1.2 and 3.5 above the predictions of the torque balance model,
depending on inclination angle, if the most likely inclination angle of 44
degrees is assumed, they are within a factor of 1.7.

\sum_{d\mid n,~d<n}d$. Erd\H{o}s-Granville-Pomerance-Spiro conjectured that for
any set $\mathcal{A}$ of asymptotic density zero, the preimage set
$s^{-1}(\mathcal{A})$ also has density zero. We prove a weak form of this
conjecture: If $\epsilon(x)$ is any function tending to $0$ as $x\to\infty$,
and $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of integers of cardinality at most
$x^{\frac12+\epsilon(x)}$, then the number of integers $n\le x$ with $s(n) \in
\mathcal{A}$ is $o(x)$, as $x\to\infty$. In particular, the EGPS conjecture
holds for infinite sets with counting function $O(x^{\frac12 + \epsilon(x)})$.
We also disprove a hypothesis from the same paper of EGPS by showing that for
any positive numbers $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$, there are integers $n$ with
arbitrarily many $s$-preimages lying between $\alpha(1-\epsilon)n$ and
$\alpha(1+\epsilon)n$. Finally, we make some remarks on solutions $n$ to
congruences of the form $\sigma(n) \equiv a\pmod{n}$, proposing a modification
of a conjecture appearing in recent work of the first two authors. We also
improve a previous upper bound for the number of solutions $n \leq x$, making
it uniform in $a$.

  Sparse Optimization","IEEE Trans. on Multimedia, 2017 (In Press)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most traditional video summarization methods are designed to generate
effective summaries for single-view videos, and thus they cannot fully exploit
the complicated intra and inter-view correlations in summarizing multi-view
videos in a camera network. In this paper, with the aim of summarizing
multi-view videos, we introduce a novel unsupervised framework via joint
embedding and sparse representative selection. The objective function is
two-fold. The first is to capture the multi-view correlations via an embedding,
which helps in extracting a diverse set of representatives. The second is to
use a `2;1- norm to model the sparsity while selecting representative shots for
the summary. We propose to jointly optimize both of the objectives, such that
embedding can not only characterize the correlations, but also indicate the
requirements of sparse representative selection. We present an efficient
alternating algorithm based on half-quadratic minimization to solve the
proposed non-smooth and non-convex objective with convergence analysis. A key
advantage of the proposed approach with respect to the state-of-the-art is that
it can summarize multi-view videos without assuming any prior
correspondences/alignment between them, e.g., uncalibrated camera networks.
Rigorous experiments on several multi-view datasets demonstrate that our
approach clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

charm leptoproduction for the kinematics of the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The
asymmetry is predicted to be large, about 15%. The radiative corrections to the
QCD predictions for the $\cos 2\varphi$ distribution are estimated to be small,
less than 10%. Our calculations show that the azimuthal asymmetry in charm
production is well defined in pQCD: it is stable both perturbatively and
parametrically, and practically insensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the
input parameters. We analyze the nonperturbative contributions to the $\cos
2\varphi$ distribution due to the gluon transverse motion in the target and the
$c$-quark fragmentation. Because of the $c$-quark low mass, the nonperturbative
contributions are expected to be sizable, about (30--40)%. We conclude that
extraction of the azimuthal asymmetries from available COMPASS data will
provide valuable information about the transverse momentum dependent
distribution of the gluon in the proton and the $c$-quark hadronization
mechanism. Finally, we discuss the $\cos 2\varphi$ asymmetry as a probe of the
gluonic analogue of the Boer-Mulders function, $h_{1}^{\perp g}$, describing
the linear polarization of gluons inside unpolarized proton.

Second, its analysis is rather straightforward, relying for the most part on

current density, which is important for suppressing efficiency droop. The
semipolar LED also shows a two-fold lower $C_0$ compared to $c$-plane, which is
consistent with the lower relative efficiency droop for the semipolar LED (57%

Moreover, unlike conventional multi-objective optimization problems, such

solution feasibility with optimality. In this research, we first present the

abundance and the lifetime of the $X^-$ particles are constrained from a BBN
reaction network calculation. We estimate that the derived parameter region for
the $^7$Li reduction is allowed in supersymmetric or Kaluza-Klein (KK) models.
We find that either the selectron, smuon, KK electron or KK muon could be
candidates for the $X^-$ with $m_X\sim {\mathcal O}(1)$ TeV, while the stau and
KK tau cannot.

simulation (DNS) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with level-set
and volume-of-fluid interface capturing methods. PDFs of the local radius of
curvature and the local cross-flow displacement of the liquid-gas interface are
evaluated over wide ranges of the Reynolds number ($Re$), Weber number ($We$),
density ratio and viscosity ratio. The temporal cascade of liquid-structure
length scales and the spread rate of the liquid jet during primary atomization
are analyzed. The formation rate of different surface structures, e.g. lobes,
ligaments and droplets, are compared for different flow conditions and are
explained in terms of the vortex dynamics in each atomization domain that we
identified recently. With increasing $We$, the average radius of curvature of
the surface decreases, the number of small droplets increases, and the cascade
and the surface area growth occur at faster rates. The spray angle is mainly
affected by $Re$ and density ratio, and is larger at higher $We$, at higher
density ratios, and also at lower $Re$. The change in the spray spread rate
versus $Re$ is attributed to the angle of ligaments stretching from the jet
core, which increases as $Re$ decreases. Gas viscosity has negligible effect on
both the droplet-size distribution and the spray angle. Increasing the
wavelength-to-sheet-thickness ratio, however, increases the spray angle and the
structure cascade rate, while decreasing the droplet size. The smallest length
scale is determined more by surface tension and liquid inertia than by the
liquid viscosity, while gas inertia and liquid surface tension are the key
parameters in determining the spray angle.

coefficient, however it is much ""darker"" than common social networks, having
low levels of edge density and network efficiency. On the other side, it has a
very high modularity value, $Q=0.96$. Comparing multiple attack strategies, we
show that it is possible to disrupt the giant component of the network by
removing only $2\%$ of its edges or nodes, according to a module-based
prescription, precisely due to its high modularity. Finally, we show that the

three-layer structure: a cold midplane, warm intermediate layer, and hot wind,
the last having typical speeds $\sim 30~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and mass-loss
rates $\sim 10^{-9}~M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ when driven primarily by ionizing
UV radiation. Observable molecules including CO, OH and H2O re-form in the
intermediate layer and survive at relatively high wind temperatures due to
reactions being out of equilibrium. Mass-loss rates are sensitive to the
intensity of radiation in energy bands that interact directly with hydrogen.
Comparison with previous works shows that mass loss rates are also sensitive to
the treatment of both the hydrodynamics and the thermochemistry. Divergent
results concerning the efficiency of X-ray photoevaporation are traced in part
to differing assumptions about dust and other coolants.

progression, we perform a study to assess the association between
longitudinally collected measures of disease and more than 100,000 genetic
markers located on chromosome 6. The most common approach to analyzing
longitudinal data in this context is linear mixed effects models, which may be
overly simplistic in this case. On the other hand, existing non-parametric
methods may suffer from low power due to high degrees of freedom (DF) and may
be computationally infeasible at the large scale. We propose a functional
principal variance component (FPVC) testing framework which captures the
nonlinearity in the CD4 and viral load with potentially low DF and is fast
enough to carry out thousands or millions of times. The FPVC testing unfolds in
two stages. In the first stage, we summarize the markers of disease progression
according to their major patterns of variation via functional principal
components analysis (FPCA). In the second stage, we employ a simple working
model and variance component testing to examine the association between the
summaries of disease progression and a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
We supplement this analysis with simulation results which indicate that FPVC
testing can offer large power gains over the standard linear mixed effects
model.

  We prove two main results. For a sequence of minuscule weights
$\vec\lambda=(\lambda^1,\ldots,\lambda^n)$ let Poly$(\vec\lambda)$ denote the
configuration space of $n$-tuples of points $(g_1,\ldots,g_n)$ in the affine
Grassmannian such that the weight-valued distances satisfy
$d(g_i,g_{i+1})=\lambda^i$. This is the convolution variety arising in the
geometric Satake correspondence. We show that for a generic point
$(g_1,\ldots,g_n)$ of a component the distances $d(g_i,g_j)$ form an affine
growth diagram and that this gives a bijection between components of
Poly$(\vec\lambda)$ and affine growth diagrams of type $\vec\lambda$. The main
tool used in the proof is the Knutson--Tao hive.
  In the second part, we give a purely combinatorial construction of affine
growth diagrams from natural number entries by applying Greene's theorem to
certain subrectangles of the staircase. From this construction it follows that
affine growth diagrams contain the classical Fomin growth diagrams and realize

disjoint camera views. It attracts increasing attention in computer vision due
to its importance to surveillance system. To combat the major challenge of
cross-view visual variations, deep embedding approaches are proposed by
learning a compact feature space from images such that the Euclidean distances
correspond to their cross-view similarity metric. However, the global Euclidean
distance cannot faithfully characterize the ideal similarity in a complex
visual feature space because features of pedestrian images exhibit unknown
distributions due to large variations in poses, illumination and occlusion.
Moreover, intra-personal training samples within a local range are robust to
guide deep embedding against uncontrolled variations, which however, cannot be
captured by a global Euclidean distance. In this paper, we study the problem of
person re-id by proposing a novel sampling to mine suitable \textit{positives}
(i.e. intra-class) within a local range to improve the deep embedding in the
context of large intra-class variations. Our method is capable of learning a
deep similarity metric adaptive to local sample structure by minimizing each
sample's local distances while propagating through the relationship between
samples to attain the whole intra-class minimization. To this end, a novel
objective function is proposed to jointly optimize similarity metric learning,
local positive mining and robust deep embedding. This yields local
discriminations by selecting local-ranged positive samples, and the learned
features are robust to dramatic intra-class variations. Experiments on
benchmarks show state-of-the-art results achieved by our method.

discovering repeated patterns in temporal data. Once these patterns have been
discovered, seemingly complicated datasets can be interpreted as a temporal
sequence of only a small number of states, or clusters. For example, raw sensor
data from a fitness-tracking application can be expressed as a timeline of a
select few actions (i.e., walking, sitting, running). However, discovering
these patterns is challenging because it requires simultaneous segmentation and
clustering of the time series. Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clusters
is difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional. Here we propose a
new method of model-based clustering, which we call Toeplitz Inverse
Covariance-based Clustering (TICC). Each cluster in the TICC method is defined
by a correlation network, or Markov random field (MRF), characterizing the
interdependencies between different observations in a typical subsequence of
that cluster. Based on this graphical representation, TICC simultaneously
segments and clusters the time series data. We solve the TICC problem through
alternating minimization, using a variation of the expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We derive closed-form solutions to efficiently solve the two
resulting subproblems in a scalable way, through dynamic programming and the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), respectively. We validate
our approach by comparing TICC to several state-of-the-art baselines in a
series of synthetic experiments, and we then demonstrate on an automobile
sensor dataset how TICC can be used to learn interpretable clusters in
real-world scenarios.

executed in memory must remain coherent with the portions of the program that
continue to execute within the processor. Unfortunately, PIM architectures
cannot use traditional approaches to cache coherence due to the high off-chip
traffic consumed by coherence messages, which, as we illustrate in this work,
can undo the benefits of PIM execution for many data-intensive applications. We
propose LazyPIM, a new hardware cache coherence mechanism designed specifically
for PIM. Prior approaches for coherence in PIM are ill-suited to applications
that share a large amount of data between the processor and the PIM logic.
LazyPIM uses a combination of speculative cache coherence and compressed
coherence signatures to greatly reduce the overhead of keeping PIM coherent
with the processor, even when a large amount of sharing exists.We find that
LazyPIM improves average performance across a range of data-intensive PIM
applications by 19.6%, reduces off-chip traffic by 30.9%, and reduces energy
consumption by 18.0%, over the best prior approaches to PIM coherence.

Classical mechanisms, due to disorder or non-uniform current injection, can

evaluating films of different thickness and by correlating the temperature

be sufficient for upcoming surveys. We illustrate our ideas by estimating

  deep-learning algorithm",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate detection of the myocardial infarction (MI) area is crucial for
early diagnosis planning and follow-up management. In this study, we propose an
end-to-end deep-learning algorithm framework (OF-RNN ) to accurately detect the
MI area at the pixel level. Our OF-RNN consists of three different function
layers: the heart localization layers, which can accurately and automatically
crop the region-of-interest (ROI) sequences, including the left ventricle,
using the whole cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences; the motion
statistical layers, which are used to build a time-series architecture to
capture two types of motion features (at the pixel-level) by integrating the
local motion features generated by long short-term memory-recurrent neural
networks and the global motion features generated by deep optical flows from
the whole ROI sequence, which can effectively characterize myocardial
physiologic function; and the fully connected discriminate layers, which use
stacked auto-encoders to further learn these features, and they use a softmax
classifier to build the correspondences from the motion features to the tissue
identities (infarction or not) for each pixel. Through the seamless connection
of each layer, our OF-RNN can obtain the area, position, and shape of the MI
for each patient. Our proposed framework yielded an overall classification
accuracy of 94.35% at the pixel level, from 114 clinical subjects. These
results indicate the potential of our proposed method in aiding standardized MI
assessments.

technique at 1200{\deg}C, pressures from 50 to 500 MPa and water contents from
0.3 (nominally dry) to 2 wt%. The experiments were carried out in an internally
heated pressure vessel, and major element profiles were later acquired by
electron probe microanalysis. The concentration-distance profiles are evaluated
using a concentration-dependent diffusivity approach. Effective binary
diffusion coefficients for four intermediate silica contents are obtained by
the Sauer-Freise modified Boltzmann-Matano method. At the experimental
temperature and pressures, the diffusivity of all studied elements notably
increases with dissolved H2O content. Particularly, diffusion is up to 1.4
orders of magnitude faster in a melt containing 2 wt.% H2O than in nominally
dry melts. This effect is slightly enhanced in the more mafic compositions.
Uphill diffusion was observed for Al, while all other elements can be described
by the concept of effective binary interdiffusion. Ti is the slowest diffusing
element through all experimental conditions and compositions, followed by Si.
Fe, Mg, Ca and K diffuse at similar rates but always more rapidly than Si and
Ti. This trend suggests a strong coupling between melt components. Since
effects of composition (including water content) are dominant, a pressure
effect on diffusion cannot be clearly resolved in the experimental pressure
range.

In this short note we collect some restriction on the image of the classifying

that there are group extensions as above that fail to satisfy this bound, hence

DSA, turbulent acceleration by compressive MHD mode downstream of the shock is
included as well as energy losses of postshock electrons by Coulomb scattering,
synchrotron emission, and inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic background
radiation. Considering that only a small fraction of merging clusters host
radio relics, we favor the reacceleration scenario in which radio relics are
generated preferentially when shocks encounter the regions containing
low-energy ($\gamma_{\rm e} \lesssim 300$) cosmic ray electrons (CRe). We
perform time-dependent DSA simulations of spherically expanding shocks with
physical parameters relevant for the Sausage radio relic, and calculate the
radio synchrotron emission from the accelerated CRe. We find that significant
level of postshock turbulent acceleration is required in order to reproduce
broad profiles of the observed radio flux densities of the Sausage relic.
Moreover, the spectral curvature in the observed integrated radio spectrum can
be explained, if the putative shock should have swept up and exited out of the

medium is the use of periodic patterns known as magnonic crystals (MCs).
However, the fabrication of MCs especially bi-components, with periodicity on
nanoscale, is a challenging task due to the requirement for sharp interfaces.
An alternative method to circumvent this problem is to use homogeneous
ferromagnetic film with modified periodically surrounding. The structure is
also suitable for exploiting nonreciprocal properties of the surface spin
waves. In this work, we demonstrate that the magnonic band structure forms in
thin permalloy film due to dynamical magnetostatic coupling with Ni stripes
near its surface. We show, that the band gap width can be systematically tuned
by the changing interlayer thickness between film and stripes. We show also the
effect of nonreciprocity, which is seen at the band gap edge shifted from the
Brillouin zone boundary and also in nonreciprocal interaction of propagating
spin waves in Py film with the standing spin waves in Ni stripes. Our findings
open possibility for further investigation and exploitation of the
nonreciprocity and band structure in magnonic devices.

bridged by a few overlapping users, dubbed as bridge users. In this work, we
address the problem of cross-domain social recommendation, i.e., recommending
relevant items of information domains to potential users of social networks. To
our knowledge, this is a new problem that has rarely been studied before.
  Existing cross-domain recommender systems are unsuitable for this task since
they have either focused on homogeneous information domains or assumed that
users are fully overlapped. Towards this end, we present a novel Neural Social
Collaborative Ranking (NSCR) approach, which seamlessly sews up the user-item
interactions in information domains and user-user connections in SNSs. In the
information domain part, the attributes of users and items are leveraged to
strengthen the embedding learning of users and items. In the SNS part, the

on a topic rarely investigated: the characterization of anomalies in a large

exploits or other attacks that raise alarms. These anomalous events usually
receive less attention than attack alarms, causing them to be frequently

hand, abnormal behaviors may be legitimate, e.g., misinterpreted protocols or
malfunctioning network equipment, but on the other hand an attacker may
intentionally craft packets to introduce anomalies to evade monitoring systems.

anomalies found in U-Tokyo Network using cooperatively Bro and Snort IDS among

practice, with the main emphasis on nondeterministic tree automata. This
concerns namely techniques for size reduction and language inclusion testing,
which are two problems that are crucial for many applications of tree automata.
For size reduction of tree automata, we adapt the simulation quotient technique
that is well established for finite word automata. We give efficient algorithms
for computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of
relation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward
simulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination
principle is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called
antichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed
originally for finite word automata for tree automata. Subsequently, we improve
the antichain technique for both word and tree automata by combining it with
the simulation-based inclusion checking techniques, significantly improving
efficiency of the antichain method. We then show how the developed reduction
and inclusion checking methods improve the method of abstract regular tree
model checking, the method that was the original motivation for starting the
work on tree automata. Both the reduction and the language inclusion methods
are based on relatively simple and general principles that can be further
extended for other types of automata and related formalisms. An example is our
adaptation of the reduction methods for alternating B\""uchi automata, which
results in an efficient alternating automata size reduction technique.

the strong-field regime but reduces to GR for intermediate and weak fields. Our
studies in cosmology demonstrate how, with this new, scalar-tensor BI gravity,
deviations from GR as well as usual BI gravity, may arise in the weak-field
regime too. For example, we note a late-time acceleration without any dark
energy contribution. Apart from such qualitative differences, we note that
fixing the sign and value of $\kappa$ is no longer a necessity in this theory,

neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) torque induced by plasma response to the
resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) in a tokamak with an edge pedestal. For a
low-$\beta$ equilibrium, the NTV torque is dominated by the toroidal component
with the same dominant toroidal mode number of RMP. The NTV torque profile is
found to be localized, whose peak location is determined by profiles of both
the equilibrium temperature (pressure) and the plasma response. In general, the
peak of NTV torque profile is found to track the pedestal position. The
magnitude of NTV torque strongly depends on the $\beta$ value of pedestal,
which suggests a more significant role of NTV torque in higher plasma $\beta$
regimes. For a fixed plasma $\beta$, decreasing density hence increasing
temperature can also enhance the amplitude of NTV torque due to the reduced
collisionality in the $1/\nu$ regime. Based on those findings, we identify the
tokamak operation regimes where the significance of NTV torque in edge pedestal
induced by RMP can approach those from other momentum sources such as the
neutral beam injections.

research topic in recent years. Robust CS aims to reconstruct the sparse

reconstruction algorithms may perform very poorly due to utilizing $l_2$ norm
of the residual vector in optimization. Most of existing robust CS
reconstruction algorithms are based on greedy pursuit method or convex
relaxation approach. Recently, the adaptive filtering framework has been
introduced to deal with the CS reconstruction, which shows desirable
performance in both efficiency and reconstruction performance under Gaussian
noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive filtering based robust CS
reconstruction algorithm, called $l_0$ regularized maximum correntropy
criterion($l_0$-MCC) algorithm, which combines the adaptive filtering framework
and maximum correntropy criterion(MCC). MCC has recently been successfully used
in adaptive filtering due to its robustness to impulsive non-Gaussian noises
and low computational complexity. We analyze theoretically the stability of the
proposed $l_0$-MCC algorithm. A mini-batch based $l_0$-MCC(MB-$l_0$-MCC)
algorithm is further developed to speed up the convergence. Comparison with
existing robust CS reconstruction algorithms is conducted via simulations,
showing that the proposed $l_0$-MCC and MB-$l_0$-MCC can achieve significantly

direct N-body simulations whose initial conditions are generated by the program
""mkhalo"" ""falcON"" adapted for our models. Our model clusters initially have a
Plummer profile and are in virial equilibrium with the gravitational potential
of the cluster-forming clump. The residual gas contribution is computed based
on the model of Parmentier&Pfalzner(2013). Our simulations include mass loss by
stellar evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that a star
cluster with a minimum global SFE of 15% is able to survive instantaneous gas
expulsion and to produce a bound cluster. Its violent relaxation lasts no
longer than 20 Myr, independently of its global SFE and initial stellar mass.
At the end of violent relaxation the bound fractions of surviving clusters with
the same global SFEs are similar regardless of their initial stellar mass.
Their subsequent lifetime in the gravitational field of the Galaxy depends on
their bound stellar masses. We therefore conclude that the critical SFE needed
to produce a bound cluster is 15%, which is twice smaller than earlier
estimates of 33%. Thus we have improved the survival likelihood of young
clusters after instantaneous gas expulsion. Those can now survive instantaneous
gas expulsion with global SFEs as low as those observed for embedded clusters
of Solar Neighbourhood (15-30%). This is the consequence of the star cluster
having a density profile steeper than that of the residual gas. However, in
terms of the effective SFE, measured by the virial ratio of the cluster at gas
expulsion, our results are in agreement with previous studies.

variations, and cannot drastically change. However, it is possible to design
its entire behaviour as a function of temperature, and to significantly modify
the thermal emissivity of a surface through the combination of different
materials and patterns. Here, we show that smart patterned surfaces consisting
of smaller structures (motifs) may be designed to respond uniquely through
combinatorial design strategies by transforming themselves from 2D to 3D
complex structures with a two-way shape memory effect. The smart surfaces can
passively manipulate thermal radiation without-the use of controllers and power
supplies-because their modus operandi has already been programmed and
integrated into their intrinsic characteristics; the environment provides the
energy required for their activation. Each motif emits thermal radiation in a
certain manner, as it changes its geometry; however, the spatial distribution
of these motifs causes them to interact with each other. Therefore, their
combination and interaction determine the global behaviour of the surfaces,
thus enabling their a priori design. The emissivity behaviour is not random; it
is determined by two fundamental parameters, namely the combination of
orientations in which the motifs open (n-fold rotational symmetry (rn)) and the
combination of materials (colours) on the motifs; these generate functions
which fully determine the dependency of the emissivity on the temperature.

constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of

not have a strong effect on the model. Our bound comes paired with a candidate
attack that often nearly matches the upper bound, giving us a powerful tool for
quickly assessing defenses on a given dataset. Empirically, we find that even

most of spectrum estimation methods are indirect and usually suffered from
various limitations. In this study, we aim to provide a segmentation-free
indirect transmission measurement-based energy spectrum estimation method using

minimize the quadratic error between the polychromatic forward projection and
the raw projection to calibrate a set of unknown weights which are used to
express the unknown spectrum together with a set of model spectra. The
polychromatic forward projection is performed using material-specific images
which are obtained using dual-energy material decomposition. The algorithm has
been evaluated using numerical simulations, experimental phantom data as well
as realistic patient data. The results show the estimated spectrum matches the
reference spectrum quite well and the method is robust. Extensive studies
suggest the method provides accurate estimate of the CT spectrum without
dedicated physical phantom and prolonged work flow. This paper may be
attractive for CT dose calculations, artifacts reduction, polychromatic image

Clustering of dark matter plays the dominant role in the formation of all

Mega-parsecs. Galaxies play a role of lights illuminating these structures so
they can be observed. The observations in the last several decades have
unveiled opulent geometry of these structures currently known as the cosmic
web. Haloes are the highest concentrations of dark matter and host luminous
galaxies. Currently the most accurate modeling of dark matter haloes is
achieved in cosmological N-body simulations. Identifying the haloes from the
distribution of particles in N-body simulations is one of the problems
attracting both considerable interest and efforts. We propose a novel framework
for detecting potential dark matter haloes using the field unique for dark
matter -- multistream field. The multistream field emerges at the nonlinear
stage of the growth of perturbations because the dark matter is collisionless.
Counting the number of velocity streams in gravitational collapses supplements
our knowledge of spatial clustering. We assume that the virialized haloes have
convex boundaries. Closed and convex regions of the multistream field are hence
isolated by imposing a positivity condition on all three eigenvalues of the
Hessian estimated on the smoothed multistream field. In a single-scale analysis
of high multistream field resolution and low softening length, the halo
substructures with local multistream maxima are isolated as individual halo
sites.

study of Hom-Lie bialgebras which were discussed first by D. Yau, then by C.
Bai and Y. Sheng. We provide different ways for constructing Hom-Lie
superbialgebras. Also we define Matched pairs, Manin supertriples and discuss
their relationships. Moreover, we study coboundary and triangular Hom-Lie
bialgebras, as well as infinitesimal deformations of the cobracket.

attribute of quantum biology is correlation and coherence of spin states. Such
correlated spin states are targets of static magnetic field. In this paper, we
report magnetic properties and spectroscopically realizable static magnetic
field effect in photosynthetic materials. Two classes of nano-scale assembly of
chlorophyll (NC) are used for such a study. Magnetic measurements are made
using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Both ferromagnetic
and superparamagnetic states are observed in NC along with a blocking
temperature around 250 K. Low temperature quantum (liquid nitrogen)
spectroscopy is employed to see how optical transitions are affected in
presence of static magnetic field. Plausible practical application aspects of
magnetic properties of this optically active material are discussed in the
text.

  anomalies and comparative analysis of electric versus chemical propulsion
  failure rates","36 pages, 18 figures",,,,"physics.space-ph stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With a few hundred spacecraft launched to date with electric propulsion (EP),
it is possible to conduct an epidemiological study of EP on orbit reliability.
The first objective of the present work was to undertake such a study and
analyze EP track record of on orbit anomalies and failures by different
covariates. The second objective was to provide a comparative analysis of EP
failure rates with those of chemical propulsion. After a thorough data
collection, 162 EP-equipped satellites launched between January 1997 and
December 2015 were included in our dataset for analysis. Several statistical
analyses were conducted, at the aggregate level and then with the data
stratified by severity of the anomaly, by orbit type, and by EP technology.
Mean Time To Anomaly (MTTA) and the distribution of the time to anomaly were
investigated, as well as anomaly rates. The important findings in this work
include the following: (1) Post-2005, EP reliability has outperformed that of
chemical propulsion; (2) Hall thrusters have robustly outperformed chemical
propulsion, and they maintain a small but shrinking reliability advantage over
gridded ion engines. Other results were also provided, for example the
differentials in MTTA of minor and major anomalies for gridded ion engines and
Hall thrusters. It was shown that: (3) Hall thrusters exhibit minor anomalies
very early on orbit, which might be indicative of infant anomalies, and thus
would benefit from better ground testing and acceptance procedures; (4) Strong
evidence exists that EP anomalies (onset and likelihood) and orbit type are
dependent, a dependence likely mediated by either the space environment or
differences in thrusters duty cycles; (5) Gridded ion thrusters exhibit both
infant and wear-out failures, and thus would benefit from a reliability growth
program that addresses both these types of problems.

more reliant on sensors to perform everyday driving operations. These sensors
are omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide
comfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers
themselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data
collected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of
individuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where
our dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by
multiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each
individual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short
road segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI
AG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped
with automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show
that turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across
drivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12
most frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway
on-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning
useful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.
