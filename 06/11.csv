a quantum network, based on shaping the energy landscape using time-invariant,
spatially-varying bias fields, can be successfully designed using numerical
optimization. Such control laws, already departing from classicality by
replacing closed-loop asymptotic stability with alternative notions of
localization, have the intriguing property that for all practical purposes they
achieve the upper bound on the fidelity, yet the (logarithmic) sensitivity of
the fidelity to such structured perturbation as spin coupling errors and bias
field leakages is nearly vanishing. Here, these differential sensitivity
results are extended to large structured variations using $\mu$-design tools to
reveal a crossover region in the space of controllers where objectives usually

modeling of phenomena related to fluid dynamics, electronic circuits, and

model reduction.
  We develop here an algorithmic framework for constructing reduced models that
retains the linear time-periodic structure of the original LTP system. Our
approach generalizes optimal approaches that have been established previously
for linear time-invariant (LTI) model reduction problems. We employ an
extension of the usual H2 Hardy space defined for the LTI setting to
time-periodic systems and within this broader framework develop an a posteriori

active user engagement on these online video-sharing platforms, most of recent
research on online media platforms have restricted themselves to networking
based social media sites, like Facebook or Twitter. We depart from previous
studies in the online media space that have focused exclusively on demand-side
user engagement, by modeling the supply-side of the crowd-contributed videos on
this platform. The current study is among the first to perform a large-scale
empirical study using longitudinal video upload data from a large online video
platform. The modeling and subsequent prediction of video uploads is made
complicated by the heterogeneity of video types (e.g. popular vs. niche video
genres), and the inherent time trend effects associated with media uploads. We
identify distinct genre-clusters from our dataset and employ a self-exciting
Hawkes point-process model on each of these clusters to fully specify and
estimate the video upload process. Additionally, we go beyond prediction to
disentangle potential factors that govern user engagement and determine the
video upload rates, which improves our analysis with additional explanatory
power. Our findings show that using a relatively parsimonious point-process
model, we are able to achieve higher model fit, and predict video uploads to
the platform with a higher accuracy than competing models. The findings from
this study can benefit platform owners in better understanding how their
supply-side users engage with their site over time. We also offer a robust
method for performing media upload prediction that is likely to be
generalizable across media platforms which demonstrate similar temporal and
genre-level heterogeneity.

constant velocity potential. An immediate consequence of the Seifert framing is
that the continuum definition of helicity for a superfluid is trivially zero at
all times. It follows that the Gauss-linking number is a more appropriate
definition of helicity for superfluids. Despite this, we explain how a
quasiclassical limit can arise in a superfluid in which the continuum
definition for helicity can be used. This provides a clear connection between a
microscopic and a macroscopic description of a superfluid as provided by the

problem, we wish to find a triangulation that minimizes the sum of Euclidean
length of its edges. This incredibly challenging problem has been studied for
more than four decades and has been only recently shown to be NP-Hard. In this
paper we present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that computes a
$14$-approximation of the minimum weight triangulation -- a constant that is
significantly smaller than what has been previously known.
  In our algorithm, we use grids to partition the edges into levels where
shorter edges appear at smaller levels and edges with similar lengths appear at
the same level. We then triangulate the point set incrementally by introducing
edges in increasing order of their levels. We introduce the edges of any level
$i+1$ in two steps. In the first step, we add edges using a variant of the
well-known ring heuristic to generate a partial triangulation
$\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i$. In the second step, we greedily add non-intersecting
level $i+1$ edges to $\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i$ in increasing order of their length
and obtain a partial triangulation $\mathcal{A}_{ i+1}$. The ring heuristic is
known to yield only an $O(\log n)$-approximation even for a convex polygon and
the greedy heuristic achieves only a $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$-approximation.
Therefore, it is surprising that their combination leads to an improved
approximation ratio of $14$.
  For the proof, we identify several useful properties of $\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i$
and combine it with a new Euler characteristic based technique to show that
$\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i$ has more edges than $\mathcal{T}_i$; here $\mathcal{T}_i$
is the partial triangulation consisting of level $\le i$ edges of some minimum
weight triangulation. We then use a simple greedy stays ahead proof strategy to
bound the approximation ratio.

to an equilibrium for semi-shallow GAN architectures, i.e. architectures where
the discriminator is a one layer network and the generator is arbitrary. On the

prescription to distinguish healthy from pathologic subjects. Over the last
twenty years two apparently different diagnostic techniques have been

pathologic subjects; the second is based on the observation that heartbeat
dynamics are a superposition of crucial and Poisson events, with pathologic
patients hosting Poisson events with larger probability than the healthy

a dynamic interpretation of multi-fractal processes that has been previously

made from Weyl semimetals, e.g. from NbAs and NbP. Such a lens may have many
practical applications and can be used as a probing tip in a scanning tunneling

semimetal tip, combined with the ideal focusing of the Weyl fermions (by
Veselago lens) on the surface of the tip may create a very narrow electron beam
from the tip to the surface of the studied material. With a Weyl semimetal
probing tip the resolution of the present STMs can be improved significantly,
and one may image not only individual atoms but also individual electron
orbitals or chemical bonding and therewith to resolve the long-term issue of
chemical and hydrogen bond formation. We show that applying a pressure to the
Weyl semimental, having no centre of spacial inversion one may model matter at
extreme conditions such as those arising in the vicinity of a black hole. As
the materials Cd3As2 and Na3Bi show an asymmetry in their Dirac cones, a
scaling factor was used to model this asymmetry. The scaling factor created
additional regions of no propagation and condensed the appearance of
resonances. We argue that under an external pressure there may arise a
topological phase transition in Weyl semimetals, where the electron transport
changes character and becomes anisotropic. There a hyperbolic Dirac phases
occurs where there is a strong light absorption and photo-current generation.

electromagnetic environment. Dielectric materials are usually introduced into
an interaction picture via their classical properties, e.g. permittivity,
appearing in constitutive relations. While this approach was proven to be
applicable in many occasions, it might face limitations when an emitter is
situated very close to a material boundary. In this case nonlocal extend of a
quantum wave function of an emitter becomes comparable with a distance to a
boundary and a lattice constant of a material. Here a semi-classical model,
taking into account material's granularity, is developed. In particular,
spontaneous emission process in the vicinity of flat boundaries is considered.
The material boundary is divided into a pair areas - far zone is modeled as a
continuous phase, while the near zone next to a nonlocal emitter is represented
with a discrete array of polarizable particles. This array resembles optical
properties of the continuous phase under the standard homogenization procedure.
Local field effects were shown to lead orders of magnitude corrections to
spontaneous emission rates in the case of sub-nanometer emitter-surface
separation distances. The developed mesoscopic model enables addressing few
aspects of local field corrections in quite complex scenarios, where quantum ab
initio techniques yet face challenges owing to involved computational
complexity. The developed method could be utilized for designs of quantum
sources and networks, enhanced with structured electromagnetic environment.

separates the polar response into the polarization of the void in the liquid

protein as a solute, its nuclear dynamics do not project on significant
fluctuations of the dipole moment in the terahertz domain of frequencies and
the protein dipole can be viewed as dynamically frozen. Absorption of radiation
then reflects the interfacial polarization. Here we apply an analytical theory
and computer simulation to absorption of radiation by ideal solutions of

describe the polarization of the protein-water interface and the ""Lorentz

current distributed DL implementations can scale poorly due to substantial
parameter synchronization over the network, because the high throughput of GPUs
allows more data batches to be processed per unit time than CPUs, leading to
more frequent network synchronization. We present Poseidon, an efficient
communication architecture for distributed DL on GPUs. Poseidon exploits the
layered model structures in DL programs to overlap communication and
computation, reducing bursty network communication. Moreover, Poseidon uses a
hybrid communication scheme that optimizes the number of bytes required to
synchronize each layer, according to layer properties and the number of
machines. We show that Poseidon is applicable to different DL frameworks by
plugging Poseidon into Caffe and TensorFlow. We show that Poseidon enables
Caffe and TensorFlow to achieve 15.5x speed-up on 16 single-GPU machines, even
with limited bandwidth (10GbE) and the challenging VGG19-22K network for image

electrophysiological properties of the constituent cells of a CPG and their
functional connectivity. That is: experimentally it is challenging to estimate
the values of more than two or three of these properties simultaneously. We
employ a method of statistical data assimilation (D.A.) to estimate the
synaptic weights, synaptic reversal potentials, and maximum conductances of ion

these estimates to predict the functional mode of activity that the network is

Using multiple approaches, we classify our sample as four RRc, four RRab and
three candidates, ten binaries. Especially, the four RRabs show sawtooth light
curves and fall exactly onto the Oosterhoff I division in the Bailey diagram.
Compared to the RRabs reported by Minniti et al, 2016, our new RRabs have
higher extinction (A_K>1.8) and should be closer to the Galactic Centre. The
extinction and distance of one RRab match those for the nuclear star cluster
given in previous works. We perform simulations and find that after correcting
for incompleteness, there could be no more than 40 RRabs within the nuclear
star cluster and in our field-of-view. Through comparing with the known
globular clusters of the Milky Way, we estimate that if there exists an old,

construction of a solver, dubbed SATFC, that determined whether sets of

SATFC. We adopted an approach we dub ""deep optimization"", taking a data-driven,

More specifically, to build SATFC we designed software that could pair both
complete and local-search SAT-encoded feasibility checking with a wide range of

of active time reuse patterns and solve this problem in an approximated way.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that our scheme can efficiently allocate the
time resources and determine the relaying strategies. Furthermore, the proposed

  low-resolution traffic videos",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a major type of transportation equipments, bicycles, including electrical
bicycles, are distributed almost everywhere in China. The accidents caused by
bicycles have become a serious threat to the public safety. So bicycle
detection is one major task of traffic video surveillance systems in China. In
this paper, a method based on multi-feature and multi-frame fusion is presented
for bicycle detection in low-resolution traffic videos. It first extracts some
geometric features of objects from each frame image, then concatenate multiple
features into a feature vector and use linear support vector machine (SVM) to
learn a classifier, or put these features into a cascade classifier, to yield a
preliminary detection result regarding whether an object is a bicycle. It
further fuses these preliminary detection results from multiple frames to
provide a more reliable detection decision, together with a confidence level of
that decision. Experimental results show that this method based on
multi-feature and multi-frame fusion can identify bicycles with high accuracy
and low computational complexity. It is, therefore, applicable for real-time
traffic video surveillance systems.

gas-to-dust ratio. To investigate the utility of CO as an alternate probe of

emission from a sample of 93 protoplanetary disks around stars and brown dwarfs
with masses from 0.03 -- 2 M$_{\odot}$ in the nearby Chamaeleon I star-forming
region. We detect $^{13}$CO emission from 17 sources and C$^{18}$O from only
one source. Gas masses for disks are then estimated by comparing the CO line
luminosities to results from published disk models that include CO freeze-out
and isotope-selective photodissociation. Under the assumption of a typical ISM
CO-to-H$_2$ ratios of $10^{-4}$, the resulting gas masses are implausibly low,
with an average gas mass of $\sim$ 0.05 M$_{Jup}$ as inferred from the average
flux of stacked $^{13}$CO lines. The low gas masses and gas-to-dust ratios for
Cha I disks are both consistent with similar results from disks in the Lupus
star-forming region. The faint CO line emission may instead be explained if
disks have much higher gas masses, but freeze-out of CO or complex C-bearing
molecules is underestimated in disk models. The conversion of CO flux to CO gas
mass also suffers from uncertainties in disk structures, which could affect gas
temperatures. CO emission lines will only be a good tracer of the disk mass
when models for C and CO depletion are confirmed to be accurate.

density profiles of DM halos depend systematically on the ratio of stellar to

fits to the observed rotation curves of galaxies. The DC14 profile is fitted
from the simulations which are confined to $M_{\rm halo}\le 10^{12}M_{\sun}$,
in order to investigate the physical processes that may affect all halos, we
extrapolate it to much larger halo mass, including that of galaxy clusters. The
inner slope of DC14 profile is flat for low halo mass, it approaches 1 when the
halo mass increases towards $10^{12}M_{\sun}$ and decreases rapidly after that
mass. We use DC14 profile for lenses and find that it predicts too few lenses
compared with the most recent strong lensing observations SQLS
(\citealt{Inada12}). We also calculate the strong lensing probabilities for a
simulated density profile which continues the halo mass from the mass end of
DC14 ($\sim 10^{12}M_{\sun}$) to the mass that covers the galaxy clusters
(\citealt{Schaller15}, Schaller15), and find that this Schaller15 model predict
too many lenses compared with other models and SQLS observations.
Interestingly, Schaller15 profile has no core, however, like DC14, the rotation
curves of the simulated halos are in excellent agreement with observational

wave functions are robust under changes of the underlying graph that maintain

Morita-equivalent Frobenius algebras. We also construct boundary quasiparticle

scales only linearly with the problem dimension. Although its derivation is
based on a relaxed formulation of the RA problem, the algorithm is shown to
converge to integer-valued RA variables with probability 1 under mild
assumptions on the distribution of user utilities. Simulations demonstrate
improved performance of the proposed algorithm compared to commonly considered
heuristic RA procedures of comparable complexity.

find the interference between the few occupied one-dimensional modes in the

finite magnetic field should be taken into account when designing circuits

of 1200 pc around the Sun and within 600 pc of the Galactic midplane is
presented. As in the previous 2010 and 2012 versions of the map, photometry
with an accuracy better than $0.05^m$ in the $J$ and $K_s$ bands for more than
70 million stars from the 2MASS catalogue is used in the new version. However,
the data reduction technique is considerably more complicated. As before, an
analysis of the distribution of stars near the main-sequence turnoff on the
$(J-K_s)$ - $K_s$ diagram, where they form a distribution maximum, provides a
basis for the method. The shift of this maximum, i.e., the $mode(J-K_s)$, along
$(J-K_s)$ and $K_s$, given the spatial variations of the mean de-reddened color
$(J-K_s)_0$ of these stars, is interpreted as a growth of the reddening with
increasing distance. The main distinction of the new method is that instead of
the fixed mean absolute magnitude, de-reddened color, distance, and reddening
for each cell, the individual values of these quantities are calculated for
each star by iterations when solving the system of equations relating them.
This has allowed one to increase the random accuracy of the map to $0.01^m$ and
its spatial resolution to 20 pc in coordinates and distance and to $1^{\circ}$
in longitude and latitude. Comparison with other reddening estimates for the
same spatial cells and Gaia DR1 TGAS stars shows that the constructed map is
one of the best maps for the space under consideration. Its systematic errors
have been estimated to be $\sigma(E(J-K_s))=0.025^m$, or
$\sigma(E(B-V))=0.04^m$. The main purpose of the map is to analyze the
characteristics of Galactic structures, clouds, and cloud complexes. For this
purpose, the reddening map within each spatial cell has also been computed by
analyzing the reddening along each line of sight.

and healthcare systems. Note that the group-server queues are always used to
design effectively dynamic control mechanisms through regrouping and
recombining such many servers in a large-scale service system by means of, for
example, bilateral threshold control, and customers transfer to the buffer or
server groups. This leads to the large-scale service system that is divided
into several adaptive and self-organizing subsystems through scheduling of
batch customers and regrouping of service resources, which make the middle
layer of this service system more effectively managed and strengthened under a
dynamic, real-time and even reward optimal framework. Based on this,
performance of such a large-scale service system may be improved greatly in
terms of introducing and analyzing such group-server queues. Therefore, not

direction, but there also exists many theoretical challenges, basic
difficulties and open problems in the area of queueing networks.

on the resulting outage probability as a function of the gap to capacity has

a simple and explicit lower bound on the worst-case outage probability is
derived for the case of a system with two transmit antennas and two or more
receive antennas, leveraging the properties of the Jacobi ensemble. The derived
lower bound is also extended to random space-time precoding, and may serve as a
useful benchmark for assessing the relative merits of various algebraic
space-time precoding schemes. We further show that the lower bound may be
adapted to the case of a $1 \times N_t$ system. As an application of this, we
derive closed-form bounds for the symmetric-rate capacity of the Rayleigh
fading multiple-access channel where all terminals are equipped with a single
antenna. Lastly, we demonstrate that the integer-forcing equalization coupled

groups, particularly subgroups of school-age children and younger adults in
propagating influenza epidemics.
  Methods: For a communicable disease outbreak, some subpopulations may play a
disproportionate role during the ascent of the outbreak due to increased
susceptibility and/or contact rates. Such subpopulations can be identified by
considering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all
cases in the population occurring before the epidemic peak (Bp), the
corresponding proportion after the epidemic peak (Ap), to calculate the
relative risk for a subpopulation, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for several age
groups using data on reported influenza A cases in Germany between 2002-2017.
  Results: Children aged 14-17y had the highest RR estimates for 7 out of 15
influenza A epidemics in the data, including the 2009 pandemic, and the large
2016/17, 2008/09, and 2006/07 seasons. Children aged 10-13y had the highest RR
estimates during 3 epidemics, including the large 2014/15 and 2004/05 seasons.
Children aged 6-9y had the highest RR estimates during two epidemics, including
the large 2012/13 season. Children aged 2-5y had the highest RR estimate during
the moderate 2015/16 season; adults aged 18-24y had the highest RR estimate
during the small 2005/06 season; adults aged 25-34y had the highest RR estimate
during the large, 2002/03 season.
  Conclusions: Our results support the prominent role of all school-age
children, particularly the oldest ones, in propagating influenza epidemics in
the community. We note that national vaccination coverage levels among older
school-age children were lower than among younger school-age children during
the recent influenza seasons in the US, and influenza vaccination program in
England has not been phased in yet for secondary school students.

phase transition point, finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo results for the

conversions almost immediately above the core. Very recently, a novel method
has been proposed to investigate these phenomena, in terms of the dispersion
relation for the complex frequency and wave number ($\omega$,$k$) of
disturbances in the mean field of the $\nu_e\nu_x$ flavor coherence. We discuss
a systematic approach to such instabilities, originally developed in the
context of plasma physics, and based of the time-asymptotic behavior of the
Green's function of the system. Instabilities are typically seen to emerge for
complex $\omega$, and can be further characterized as convective (moving away
faster than they spread) and absolute (growing locally), depending on
$k$-dependent features. Stable cases emerge when $k$ (but not $\omega$) is
complex, leading to disturbances damped in space, or when both $\omega$ and $k$
are real, corresponding to complete stability. The analytical classification of
both unstable and stable modes leads not only to qualitative insights about
their features but also to quantitative predictions about the growth rates of
instabilities. Representative numerical solutions are discussed in a simple
two-beam model of interacting neutrinos. As an application, we argue that
supernova and binary neutron star mergers exhibiting a ""crossing"" in the
electron lepton number would lead to an absolute instability in the flavor

aphelion. To explain the difference, we calculated the subsolar temperature
depending on Ryugu heliocentric distance and performed some analytical
estimations related to internal structure and thermo-physical parameters of
this and similar NEAs. Presumed temporal sublimation and dust activity of Ryugu
is an indication of existence of a residual frozen core in its interior which
could point to a relatively recent transition of the asteroid from the main
asteroid belt to the near-Earth region.

  Link Is Four","21 pages, 33 figures",,,,"math.GT math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  K. Ichihara and E. Matsudo introduced the notions of $\mathbb{Z}$-colorable
links and the minimal coloring number for $\mathbb{Z}$-colorable links, which
is one of invariants for links. They proved that the lower bound of minimal
coloring number of a non-splittable $\mathbb{Z}$-colorable link is 4. In this
paper, we show the minimal coloring number of any non-splittable
$\mathbb{Z}$-colorable link is exactly 4.
