single no-decompression dive of 12 meters to a diver. Methods: There are 29
healthy volunteers divers assigned into SCUBA diving of 12m-depth underwater
(the Experimental Group, EG)and chamber dive under 2.2 ATA for 20min (the
Control Group, CG) matched with the factors of the age,gender,BMI and Forced
Vital Capacity (FVC).Ventilation functions were measured by spirometer before
diving and in 1h and 24h of post-hyperbaric exposure. Used independent samples
T tests to compare the differences between the EG and CG.Analyzed of variance
through repeated measurement data of different time point before or after high
pressure exposure by SPSS 20.0. Results: The Inspiratory Reserve Volume(IRV)
rises while the Expiratory Reserve Volume(ERV) falls significantly in 1h after
high pressure release(p<0.05).So as with the Inspiratory Capacity (IC) and the
Vital Capacity (VC) increased accordingly. The Ratio of FEV1.0 to VC (FEV1.0%t)
is higher in CG than EG (t=-2.189,p=0.033) due to the change of VC. But the
effects did not last for 24 h after high pressure relief. Conclusions:
Ventilation is restricted during the 20min of hyperbaric exposure whether under
12m-depth water or in a 2.2ATA hyperbaric chamber. But the effect recovered
close to normal within 24 h. But the effect recovered close to normal within 24
h. The extent of restriction of underwater diving is larger than the dry air
hyperbaric chamber dive. Higher water medium density, submerged compressing
blood volume of lower limbs and raising inertia added by portable underwater
breathing apparatus all might be attributable to the ventilation effects.

trust stems from their ability to protect and control the use of a private
signing key. The signing key is the key asset of a certificate authority (CA),

primarily distributed by browser vendors. Compromise of a CA private key
represents a single point-of-failure that could have disastrous consequences,
so CAs go to great lengths to attempt to protect and control the use of their
private keys. Nevertheless, keys are sometimes compromised and may be misused
accidentally or intentionally by insiders. We propose splitting a CA's private
key among multiple parties, and producing signatures using a generic secure
multi-party computation protocol that never exposes the actual signing key.
This could be used by a single CA to reduce the risk that its signing key would
be compromised or misused. It could also enable new models for certificate
generation, where multiple CAs would need to agree and cooperate before a new
certificate can be generated, or even where certificate generation would
require cooperation between a CA and the certificate recipient (subject).
Although more efficient solutions are possible with custom protocols, we
demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a decentralized CA using a generic

we develop a new graph cuts based method to segment kidney US images by
integrating original image intensity information and texture feature maps
extracted using Gabor filters. Methods: To handle large appearance variation
within kidney images and improve computational efficiency, we build a graph of
image pixels close to kidney boundary instead of building a graph of the whole
image. To make the kidney segmentation robust to weak boundaries, we adopt
localized regional information to measure similarity between image pixels for
computing edge weights to build the graph of image pixels. The localized graph
is dynamically updated and the GC based segmentation iteratively progresses
until convergence. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared with
state of the art image segmentation methods based on clinical kidney US images

for tuning the parameters, and validated the methods based on US images of the
remaining 65 subjects. The segmentation results have been quantitatively
analyzed using 3 metrics, including Dice Index, Jaccard Index, and Mean
Distance. Results: Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method
obtained segmentation results for bilateral kidneys of 65 subjects with average
Dice index of 0.9581, Jaccard index of 0.9204, and Mean Distance of 1.7166,
better than other methods under comparison (p<10-19, paired Wilcoxon rank sum

all-electrical detection of the helical spin texture has remained elusive owing
to the lack of necessary spin-sensitive measurements. We here provide a general
theory for spin polarized transports of helical Dirac electrons through
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). It is found that different
from conventional magnetic materials, the tunneling conductance through the TI
surface acquires an extra component determined by the in-plane spin texture,
exclusively associated with spin momentum locking. Importantly, this extra
conductance unconventionally depends on the spatial azimuthal angle of the
magnetized STM tip, which is never carried out in previous STM theory. By
magnetically doping to break the symmetry of rotation and time reversal of the
TI surface, we find that the measurement of the spatial resolved conductance
can reconstruct the helical structure of spin texture. Furthermore, one can
extract the SML angle if the in-plane magnetization is induced purely by the
spin-orbit coupling of surface Dirac elections. Our theory offers an
alternative way, rather than using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy,
to electrical identify the helical spin texture on TI surfaces.

question of the Dirac cone stability with respect to interactions. Coulomb
interactions between electrons were shown to induce a logarithmic
renormalization of the Dirac dispersion. With a rapid expansion of the list of
compounds and quasiparticle bands with linear band touching, the concept of
bosonic Dirac materials has emerged. We consider a specific case of
ferromagnets consisting of the Van der Waals-bonded stacks of honeycomb layers,
e.g chromium trihalides CrX3 (X = F, Cl, Br and I), that display two spin wave
modes with energy dispersion similar to that for the electrons in graphene. At
the single particle level, these materials resemble their fermionic
counterparts. However, how different particle statistics and interactions
affect the stability of Dirac cones has yet to be determined. To address the
role of interacting Dirac magnons, we expand the theory of ferromagnets beyond
the standard Dyson theory to a case of non-Bravais honeycomb layers. We
demonstrate that magnon-magnon interactions lead to a significant
momentum-dependent renormalization of the bare band structure in addition to
strongly momentum-dependent magnon lifetimes. We show that our theory

pile asteroids is investigated with regard to their evolution under the
persistent presence of the YORP effect. We find that below a characteristic
size, which is a function of cohesive strength, density and other properties,
rubble pile asteroids can enter a ""disaggregation phase"" in which they are
subject to repeated fissions after which the formation of a stabilizing binary
system is not possible. Once this threshold is passed rubble pile asteroids may
be disaggregated into their constituent components within a finite time span.
These constituent components will have their own spin limits -- albeit
potentially at a much higher spin rate due to the greater strength of a
monolithic body. The implications of this prediction are discussed and include
modification of size distributions, prevalence of monolithic bodies among
meteoroids and the lifetime of small rubble pile bodies in the solar system.
The theory is then used to place constraints on the strength of binary
asteroids characterized as a function of their type.

role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on extreme weather events,
either specific events or classes of events. A common approach to event
attribution uses climate model output under factual (real-world) and
counterfactual (world that might have been without anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions) scenarios to estimate the probabilities of the event of interest
under the two scenarios. Event attribution is then quantified by the ratio of
the two probabilities. While this approach has been applied many times in the
last 15 years, the statistical techniques used to estimate the risk ratio based
on climate model ensembles have not drawn on the full set of methods available
in the statistical literature and have in some cases used and interpreted the
bootstrap method in non-standard ways. We present a precise frequentist
statistical framework for quantifying the effect of sampling uncertainty on
estimation of the risk ratio, propose the use of statistical methods that are
new to event attribution, and evaluate a variety of methods using statistical
simulations. We conclude that existing statistical methods not yet in use for
event attribution have several advantages over the widely-used bootstrap,
including better statistical performance in repeated samples and robustness to
small estimated probabilities. Software for using the methods is available
through the climextRemes package available for R or Python. While we focus on
frequentist statistical methods, Bayesian methods are likely to be particularly
useful when considering sources of uncertainty beyond sampling uncertainty.

flow, neutrino decoupling, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the early

related epochs to electron mass, we consider a parameter space of rest mass
values larger and smaller than the accepted vacuum value. Electromagnetic
equilibrium, coupled with the high entropy of the early universe, guarantees
that significant numbers of electron-positron pairs are present, and dominate
over the number of ionization electrons to temperatures much lower than the
vacuum electron rest mass. Scattering between the electrons-positrons and the
neutrinos largely controls the flow of entropy from the plasma into the
neutrino seas. Moreover, the number density of electron-positron-pair targets
can be exponentially sensitive to the effective in-medium electron mass. This
entropy flow influences the phasing of scale factor and temperature, the
charged current weak-interaction-determined neutron-to-proton ratio, and the
spectral distortions in the relic neutrino energy spectra. Our calculations
show the sensitivity of the physics of this epoch to three separate effects:
finite electron mass, finite-temperature quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects
on the plasma equation of state, and Boltzmann neutrino energy transport. The
ratio of neutrino to plasma component energy scales manifests in Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) observables, namely the baryon density and the
radiation energy density, along with the primordial helium and deuterium

the existence of a maximal continuous family of bistable monotone wavefronts..
Depending on the type of unimodality (equivalently, on the sign of the wave
speed), two different scenarios can be observed for the bistable waves: 1)
independently on the size of delay, each bistable wavefront is monotone; 2)
wavefronts are monotone for moderate values of delays and can oscillate for
large delays.

  with Ag and Al","10 pages, 5 figs",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An elementary approach is employed to show that genuine surface effects could
destabilize surface plasma waves (SPWs) supported on the interface between a
metal and a dielectric (usually the vacuum) and give rise to an intrinsic
channel of gain for these waves. A comprehensive SPW theory is presented taking
into account both the inter-band transition effects and the dielectric effects.
Experimental consequences, especially in regard to the possibility of
overcompensating for the energy losses suffered by SPWs, are exemplified for
two common plasmonic materials: silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al). In both metals,
the intrinsic channel of gain is shown having substantially reduced but
insufficient to overcompensate for the losses, for different reasons. In Ag,
the inter-band transition effects significantly weaken the intrinsic gain
channel and make it unable to overcompensate for the losses, while in Al it is
because the loss rate is too big. Nevertheless, we find it possible to enhance
the intrinsic gain rate by replacing the vacuum with a moderate dielectric so
that the losses can be overcompensated in Ag. This prediction is ready for
experimental exploitation.

$a=0.084$ fm and pion mass 297 MeV, and Wilson-clover fermions with $a=0.114$

insight into the length scales at which lattice discretization errors are

continuum QCD TMD operator continues to apply in the lattice formulation. For
the studied TMD observables, the results are found to be consistent between the
two ensembles at sufficiently large separation of the quark fields within the
operator, whereas deviations are observed in the local limit and in the case of
a straight link gauge connection, which is relevant to the studies of parton

large scale, global maps such as floor plans. Although much work has been done
in topological map extraction, we have found little previous work on the
problem of learning the topological map using a probabilistic model. Learning a
topological map means learning the structure of the large-scale space and
dependency between places, for example, how the evidence of a group of places
influence the attributes of other places. This is an important step towards
planning complex actions in the environment. In this thesis, we consider the
problem of using probabilistic deep learning model to learn the topological
map, which is essentially a sparse undirected graph where nodes represent
places annotated with their semantic attributes (e.g. place category). We
propose to use a novel probabilistic deep model, Sum-Product Networks (SPNs),
due to their unique properties. We present two methods for learning topological
maps using SPNs: the place grid method and the template-based method. We
contribute an algorithm that builds SPNs for graphs using template models. Our

for planet formation theory. In the standard core accretion paradigm planets
are expected to form at radial distances $\lesssim 20$ au in order to form
massive cores (with masses $\gtrsim 10~\textrm{M}_{\oplus}$) able to trigger
the gaseous runaway growth before the dissipation of the disc. This has
encouraged authors to find modifications of the standard scenario as well as
alternative theories like the formation of planets by gravitational
instabilities in the disc to explain the existence of giant planets in wide
orbits. However, there is not yet consensus on how these systems are formed.
  In this letter, we present a new natural mechanism for the formation of giant
planets in wide orbits within the core accretion paradigm. If photoevaporation
is considered, after a few Myr of viscous evolution a gap in the gaseous disc
is opened. We found that, under particular circumstances planet migration
becomes synchronised with the evolution of the gap, which results in an
efficient outward planet migration. This mechanism is found to allow the
formation of giant planets with masses $M_p\lesssim 1 M_{\rm Jup}$ in wide
stable orbits as large as $\sim$130 au from the central star.

as well the number of sample images per class, and 3) the retrieval performance
has saturated. These limitations have severely restricted the development of
novel feature representations for RSIR, particularly the recent deep-learning
based features which require large amounts of training data. We therefore
present in this paper, a new large-scale remote sensing dataset termed
""PatternNet"" that was collected specifically for RSIR. PatternNet was collected
from high-resolution imagery and contains 38 classes with 800 images per class.
We also provide a thorough review of RSIR approaches ranging from traditional
handcrafted feature based methods to recent deep learning based ones. We
evaluate over 35 methods to establish extensive baseline results for future
RSIR research using the PatternNet benchmark.

different phases(cubic, hexagonal and tetragonal) reported experimentally using
density functional theory. The relative structural stabilities, and the
possible phase transformation mechanisms are discussed using results for total
energy, electronic structure and elastic constants. We find that the phase
transformation form hexagonal to ground state tetragonal structure would take
place through a Heusler-like phase which has a pronounced electronic
instability. The electronic structures, the elastic constants and the
supplementary phonon dispersions indicate that the transition from the
Heusler-like to the tetragonal phase is of pure Jahn-Teller origin. We also
describe the ground state magentic structures in each phase by computations of
the exchange interactions. For Heusler-like and tetragonal phases, the
ferromagnetic exchange interactions associated with the Fe atoms balance the
dominating antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn atoms leading to
collinear magnetic structures. In the hexagonal phase, the direction of atomic
moment are completely in the planes with a collinear like structure, in stark
contrast to the well known non-collinear magnetic structure in the hexagonal
phase of Mn$_{3}$Ga, another material with similar structural properties. The
overwhelmingly large exchange interactions of Fe with other magnetic atoms
destroy the possibility of magnetic frustration in the hexagonal phase of
Mn$_{2}$FeGa. This comprehensive study provides significant insights into the
microscopic physics associated with the structural and magnetic orders in this
compound.

shown be quite efficient to describe the diffusion in complex systems, with the
advantage of producing exact expressions for the underlying diffusive
properties. Recently, researchers have proposed different fractional-time
operators (namely: the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu) which, differently
from the well-known Riemann-Liouville operator, are defined by non-singular
memory kernels. Here we proposed to use these new operators to generalize the
usual diffusion equation. By analyzing the corresponding fractional diffusion
equations within the continuous time random walk framework, we obtained waiting
time distributions characterized by exponential, stretched exponential, and
power-law functions, as well as a crossover between two behaviors. For the mean
square displacement, we found crossovers between usual and confined diffusion,
and between usual and sub-diffusion. We obtained the exact expressions for the
probability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions
emerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion
equation is solved without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion
boundary conditions. We have further shown that these new fractional diffusion
equations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic resetting, and to
fractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order. Thus, our
results show that these new operators are a simple and efficient way for
incorporating different structural aspects into the system, opening new
possibilities for modeling and investigating anomalous diffusive processes.

we first construct the Gender Identified Enron Corpus of emails, in which we
semi-automatically assign the gender of around 23,000 individuals who authored
around 97,000 email messages in the Enron corpus. This corpus, which is made
freely available, is orders of magnitude larger than previously existing gender
identified corpora in the email domain. Next, we use this corpus to perform a
large-scale data-oriented study of the interplay of gender and manifestations
of power. We argue that, in addition to one's own gender, the ""gender
environment"" of an interaction, i.e., the gender makeup of one's interlocutors,
also affects the way power is manifested in dialog. We focus especially on
manifestations of power in the dialog structure --- both, in a shallow sense
that disregards the textual content of messages (e.g., how often do the
participants contribute, how often do they get replies etc.), as well as the
structure that is expressed within the textual content (e.g., who issues
requests and how are they made, whose requests get responses etc.). We find
that both gender and gender environment affect the ways power is manifested in
dialog, resulting in patterns that reveal the underlying factors. Finally, we
show the utility of gender information in the problem of automatically
predicting the direction of power between pairs of participants in email

decode-and-forward (DF) relaying network. A legitimate source node, Alice,
sends her data to a legitimate destination node, Bob, with the aid of an
untrusted DF relay node, Charlie. To secure the transmissions from Charlie
during relaying time slots, each data codeword is secured using a secret-key
codeword that has been previously shared between Alice and Bob during the
perfectly secured time slots (i.e., when the channel secrecy rate is positive).
The secret-key bits exchanged between Alice and Bob are stored in a
finite-length buffer and are used to secure data transmission whenever needed.
We model the secret-key buffer as a queueing system and analyze its Markov
chain. Our numerical results show the gains of our proposed scheme relative to
benchmarks. Moreover, the proposed scheme achieves an upper bound on the secure
throughput.

Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) have been frequently observed during
the gradual phase of solar flares near the limb. In coronal emission lines
sensitive to flaring plasmas, they appear as tadpole-like dark voids against
the diffuse fan-shaped ""haze"" above, flowing toward the well-defined flare
arcade.
  Aims. We aim to investigate the evolution of SADs' thermal properties, and to
shed light on the formation mechanism and physical processes of SADs.
  Methods. We carefully studied several selected SADs from two flare events and
calculated their differential emission measures (DEMs) as well as DEM-weighted
temperatures using data obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory.
  Results. Our analysis shows that SADs are associated with a substantial
decrease in DEM above 4 MK, which is 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the
surrounding haze as well as the region before or after the passage of SADs, but
comparable to the quiet corona. There is no evidence for the presence of the
SAD-associated hot plasma (> 20 MK) in the AIA data, and this decrease in DEM
does not cause any significant change in the DEM distribution as well as the
DEM-weighted temperature, which supports this idea that SADs are density
depletion. This depression in DEM rapidly recovers in the wake of the SADs
studied, generally within a few minutes, suggesting that they are discrete
features. In addition, we found that SADs in one event are spatio-temporally
associated with the successive formation of post-flare loops along the flare
arcade.

normal conductor--superconductor (NS) junction, in which electron transport is
mainly governed by Andreev reflection (AR). As excess carriers induced over the
covered region penetrate into the uncovered region over a screening length, the
charge neutrality point (CNP) in the uncovered region shifts only near the NS
interface. We theoretically study the electron transport in a bilayer graphene
junction taking account of such spatial variation of the CNP in the
electron-doped case. When the Fermi level is close to the CNP away from the NS
interface, the AR takes place in a specular manner owing to the diffraction of
a reflected hole occurring at a $pn$ junction, which is naturally formed in the
uncovered region. It is shown that the differential conductance shows an
unusual asymmetric behavior as a function of bias voltage under the influence
of the $pn$ junction. It is also shown that, if the Fermi level is located
below the CNP, the $pn$ junction gives rise to quasi-bound states near the NS

Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) function. Meta-algorithms build on
base algorithms---such as Random Forests (RF), Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART) or neural networks---to estimate the CATE, a function that the
base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a new
meta-algorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of
units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other, and can exploit
structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function
is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz
continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under
regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF
and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner
performs favorably, although none of the meta-learners is uniformly the best.
In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how
our new X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on

analysis. Various methods have been developed for variable selection in recent
years. Well-known examples are forward stepwise regression (FSR) and least
angle regression (LARS), among others. These methods typically add variables
into the model one by one. For such selection procedures, it is crucial to find
a stopping criterion that controls model complexity. One of the most commonly
used techniques to this end is cross-validation (CV) which, in spite of its
popularity, has two major drawbacks: expensive computational cost and lack of
statistical interpretation. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a
flexible and efficient test-based variable selection approach that can be
incorporated into any sequential selection procedure. The test, which is on the
overall signal in the remaining inactive variables, is based on the maximal
absolute partial correlation between the inactive variables and the response
given active variables. We develop the asymptotic null distribution of the
proposed test statistic as the dimension tends to infinity uniformly in the
sample size. We also show that the test is consistent. With this test, at each
step of the selection, a new variable is included if and only if the $p$-value
is below some pre-defined level. Numerical studies show that the proposed
method delivers very competitive performance in terms of variable selection
accuracy and computational complexity compared to CV.

the unit disc in several aspects. This space is known as the Hardy space of the
symmetrized bidisc. We introduce the study of those operators on the Hardy
space of the symmetrized bidisc that are analogous to Toeplitz operators on the
Hardy space of the unit disc. More explicitly, we first study multiplication
operators on a bigger space (an $L^2$-space) and then study compressions of
these multiplication operators to the Hardy space of the symmetrized bidisc and
prove the following major results: (1) Theorem I analyzes the Hardy space of
the symmetrized bidisc, not just as a Hilbert space, but as a Hilbert module
over the polynomial ring and finds three isomorphic copies of it as $\mathbb
D^2$-contractive Hilbert modules. (2) Theorem II provides an algebraic, Brown
and Halmos type, characterization of Toeplitz operators. (3)Theorem III gives
several characterizations of an analytic Toeplitz operator. (4)Theorem IV
characterizes asymptotic Toeplitz operators. (5)Theorem V is a commutant
lifting theorem. (6)Theorem VI yields an algebraic characterization of dual
Toeplitz operators. Every section from Section 1 to Section 6 contains a
theorem each, the main result of that section.

low-density and high-energy electron beam centered on the magnetic field
direction. Our model is based on the solution of the electron drift-kinetic
equation at heliospheric distances where the plasma density, temperature, and
the magnetic field strength decline as power-laws of the distance along a
magnetic flux tube. Our solution for the strahl depends on a number of
parameters that, in the absence of the analytic solution for the full electron
velocity distribution function (eVDF), cannot be derived from the theory. We
however demonstrate that these parameters can be efficiently found from
matching our solution with observations of the eVDF made by the Wind
satellite's SWE strahl detector. The model is successful at predicting the
angular width (FWHM) of the strahl for the Wind data at 1 AU, in particular by
predicting how this width scales with particle energy and background density.
We find the strahl distribution is largely determined by the local temperature
Knudsen number $\gamma \sim |T dT/dx|/n$, which parametrizes solar wind
collisionality. We compute averaged strahl distributions for typical Knudsen
numbers observed in the solar wind, and fit our model to these data. The model
can be matched quite closely to the eVDFs at 1 AU, however, it then
overestimates the strahl amplitude at larger heliocentric distances. This
indicates that our model may be improved through the inclusion of additional
physics, possibly through the introduction of ""anomalous diffusion"" of the
strahl electrons.

environmental and control noise. One of the prime techniques for suppressing
noise is by dynamical decoupling, where one actively applies pulses at a rate
that is faster than the typical time scale of the noise. However, for
boson-mediated gates, current dynamical decoupling schemes require executing
the pulses only when the boson and the quantum systems are disentangled. This
restriction implies an increase of the gate time by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$,
with $N$ being the number of pulses applied. Here we propose and realize a
method that enables dynamical decoupling in a boson mediated system where the
pulses can be applied while spin-boson entanglement persists, resulting in an

magnitude-only measurements, which attracts much attention since it has
numerous applications in many disciplines. However, phase recovery involves
solving a system of quadratic equations, indicating that it is a challenging
nonconvex optimization problem. To tackle phase retrieval in an effective and
efficient manner, we apply coordinate descent (CD) such that a single unknown
is solved at each iteration while all other variables are kept fixed. As a
result, only minimization of a univariate quartic polynomial is needed which is
easily achieved by finding the closed-form roots of a cubic equation. Three
computationally simple algorithms referred to as cyclic, randomized and greedy
CDs, based on different updating rules, are devised. It is proved that the
three CDs globally converge to a stationary point of the nonconvex problem, and
specifically, the randomized CD locally converges to the global minimum and
attains exact recovery at a geometric rate with high probability if the sample
size is large enough. The cyclic and randomized CDs are also modified via
minimization of the $\ell_1$-regularized quartic polynomial for phase retrieval
of sparse signals. Furthermore, a novel application of the three CDs, namely,
blind equalization in digital communications, is proposed. It is demonstrated
that the CD methodology is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques in terms

small perturbation. Solving the relevant equations yields a pattern of entropy
destruction in a spherical core around the perturbation, and entropy creation
in a surrounding halo. This indicates collisional ""de-relaxation"" in the core,
and collisional relaxation in the halo. Core-halo patterns are ubiquitous in
the astrophysics of gravitational collapse, and are found here without any of
the prior assumptions of such a pattern usually made in analytical models.
Motivated by this analysis, the paper outlines a possible scheme for
identifying structure formation in a set of observations or a simulation. This
scheme involves a choice of coarse-graining scale appropriate to the structure
under consideration, and might aid exploration of hierarchical structure
formation, supplementing the usual density-based methods for highlighting
astrophysical and cosmological structure at various scales.

independence problem in separable metric spaces. Suppose we are given finite
collection of samples from an i.i.d. sequence of paired random elements, where
each marginal has values in some separable metric space. The non-parametric
independence problem raises the question on how one can use these samples to
reasonably draw inference on whether the marginal random elements are
independent or not. We will try to answer this question by utilizing the
so-called distance covariance functional in metric spaces developed by Russell
Lyons. We show that, if the marginal spaces are so-called metric spaces of
strong negative type (e.g. seperable Hilbert spaces), then the distance
covariance functional becomes a direct indicator of independence. That is, one
can directly determine whether the marginals are independent or not based
solely on the value of this functional. As the functional formally takes the
simultaneous distribution as argument, its value is not known in the posed
non-parametric independence problem. Hence, we construct estimators of the
distance covariance functional, and show that they exhibit asymptotic
properties which can be used to construct asymptotically consistent statistical
tests of independence. Finally, as the rejection thresholds of these
statistical tests are non-traceable we argue that they can be reasonably
bootstrapped.

emissions. We introduce a model of global expenditures on limiting cumulative
CO2 emissions, taking into account effects of decarbonization and rising global
income and making an approximation to the marginal abatement costs (MAC) of
CO2. Discounted mitigation expenditures are shown to be a convex function of
cumulative CO2 emissions. We also consider minimum-expenditure solutions for
meeting cumulative emissions goals, using a regularized variational method
yielding an initial value problem in the integrated decarbonization rate. A
quasi-stationary solution to this problem can be obtained for a special case,
yielding decarbonization rate that is proportional to annual CO2 emissions.
Minimum-expenditure trajectories in scenarios where CO2 emissions decrease must
begin with rapid decarbonization at rate decreasing with time. Due to the shape
of global MAC the fraction of global income spent on CO2 mitigation (""burden"")
generally increases with time, as cheaper avenues for mitigation are exhausted.
Therefore failure to rapidly decarbonize early on reduces expenditures by a
small fraction (on the order of 0.01 %) of income in the present, but leads to
much higher burden to future generations (on the order of 1 % of income).

range 0.09 to 1.1 solar mass that agree well with the current generation of PMS
evolutionary models. The ages of the stars we measured in the Taurus SFR are in
the range 1-3 MY, and $<1$ MY for those in L1688. We also measured the
dynamical masses of 14 stars in the ALMA archival data for Akeson~\&~Jensen's
Cycle 0 project on binaries in the Taurus SFR. We find that the masses of 7 of
the targets are so large that they cannot be reconciled with reported values of
their luminosity and effective temperature. We suggest that these targets are
themselves binaries or triples.

skyrmion systems, has emerged as a rich playground for finding novel quantum
phenomena and applications in future information technology. Magnetic
topological insulators (TI) have attracted much recent attention, especially
after the experimental realization of quantum anomalous Hall effect. Future
applications of magnetic TI hinge on the accurate manipulation of magnetism and
topology by external perturbations, preferably with a gate electric field. In
this work, we investigate the magneto transport properties of Cr doped
Bi2(SexTe1-x)3 TI across the topological quantum critical point (QCP). We find
that the external gate voltage has negligible effect on the magnetic order for
samples far away from the topological QCP. But for the sample near the QCP, we
observe a ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) phase transition driven by
the gate electric field. Theoretical calculations show that a perpendicular
electric field causes a shift of electronic energy levels due to the Stark
effect, which induces a topological quantum phase transition and consequently a
magnetic phase transition. The in situ electrical control of the topological
and magnetic properties of TI shed important new lights on future topological
electronic or spintronic device applications.

cloud has often been assumed to resemble the evolution of a cloud embedded in a
post-shock flow. However, no direct comparative study of these two processes
currently exists in the literature. We present 2D adiabatic hydrodynamical
simulations of the interaction of a Mach 10 shock with a cloud of density
contrast $\chi = 10$ and compare our results with those of a commensurate
wind-cloud simulation. We then investigate the effect of varying the wind
velocity, effectively altering the wind Mach number $M_{wind}$, on the cloud's
evolution. We find that there are significant differences between the two
processes: 1) the transmitted shock is much flatter in the shock-cloud
interaction; 2) a low-pressure region in the wind-cloud case deflects the flow
around the edge of the cloud in a different manner to the shock-cloud case; 3)
there is far more axial compression of the cloud in the case of the shock. As
$M_{wind}$ increases, the normalised rate of mixing is reduced. Clouds in winds
with higher $M_{wind}$ also do not experience a transmitted shock through the
cloud's rear and are more compressed axially. In contrast with shock-cloud
simulations, the cloud mixing time normalised by the cloud-crushing time-scale
$t_{cc}$ increases for increasing $M_{wind}$ until it plateaus (at $t_{mix}
\simeq 25 \, t_{cc}$) at high $M_{wind}$, thus demonstrating the expected Mach
scaling. In addition, clouds in high Mach number winds are able to survive for
long durations and are capable of being moved considerable distances.

quadruple, and hexadecapole of $m=0$). The characteristic behaviors of the new

multipoles with $m\ne 0$ are also sensitive to redshift-space distortion (RSD)

using the galaxy bispectrum. Analytic approximation formulas for these nonzero
components are also presented; these are useful for understanding the

lifted to a dynamic feature space. Second, we identify a sparse
human-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on
the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV
snapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to
velocity fields is shown to be orders of magnitudes more accurate than optimal
modal expansions of the same order. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal
decomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically
correlated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model,
adding interpretability. Steps 1 and 2 define a black-box model. Optional steps
3 and 4 lift the black-box dynamics to a 'gray-box' model of the coherent
structures, if non-time-resolved full-state data is available. This gray-box
modeling strategy is successfully applied to the transient and post-transient
laminar cylinder wake, and compares favorably with a POD model. We foresee
numerous applications of this highly flexible modeling strategy, including
estimation, prediction and control. Moreover, the feature space may be based on
intrinsic coordinates, which are unaffected by a key challenge of modal
expansion: the slow change of low-dimensional coherent structures with changing

using time-delayed embeddings as inputs. Recently, an alternative formulation
was proposed by defining a gamma-filter explicitly in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space, giving rise to a complex model where multiple kernels operate on
different temporal combinations of the input signal. In the original
formulation, the kernels are then simply combined to obtain a single kernel
matrix (for instance by averaging), which provides computational benefits but
discards important information on the temporal structure of the signal.
Inspired by works on multiple kernel learning, we overcome this drawback by
considering the different kernels separately. We propose an efficient strategy
to adaptively combine and select these kernels during the training phase. The
resulting batch and online algorithms automatically learn to process highly
nonlinear temporal information extracted from the input signal, which is
implicitly encoded in the kernel values. We evaluate our proposal on several

establishes the system unambiguously as a binary, post-collision merger of
massive clusters. Key characteristics include perfect alignment of luminous and
dark matter for one component, a separation of almost 650 kpc (in projection)
between the dark-matter peak of the other subcluster and the second X-ray peak,
extremely hot gas (k$T > 15$ keV) at either end of the merger axis, a potential
cold front in the east, an unusually low gas mass fraction of approximately
0.075 for the western component, a velocity dispersion of $1490_{-130}^{+104}$

perform a given clustering task in a fully decentralized setup. Standard
clustering algorithms usually need to know the number of clusters and are very
sensitive to initialization, which makes them difficult to use in a fully
decentralized setup. In this respect, this paper proposes a decentralized
model-based clustering algorithm that overcomes these issues. The proposed
algorithm is based on a novel theoretical framework that relies on hypothesis
testing and robust M-estimation. More particularly, the problem of deciding
whether two data belong to the same cluster can be optimally solved via Wald's
hypothesis test on the mean of a Gaussian random vector. The p-value of this
test makes it possible to define a new type of score function, particularly
suitable for devising an M-estimation of the centroids. The resulting
decentralized algorithm efficiently performs clustering without prior knowledge
of the number of clusters. It also turns out to be less sensitive to
initialization than the already existing clustering algorithms, which makes it
appropriate for use in a network of sensors without fusion center.

shift, $\delta \omega$, for a sinusoidal electron plasma wave (EPW) that varies
slowly enough for the results derived in the companion paper, on the action
distribution function, to apply. We first consider the situation when the EPW
monotonously grows and then monotonously decays in a homogeneous plasma. In
this situation, we show a hysteresis in the wave frequency, which does not
converge back to its linear value as the wave decays to small amplitudes. We
then address the derivation of $\delta \omega$ for an EPW that keeps growing in
a one-dimensional (1-D) inhomogeneous plasma. We show that, usually, the
frequency shift does not only depend on the local EPW amplitude and wavenumber.
It also depends on the whole history of the density variations, as experienced
by the wave. In a multidimensional inhomogeneous plasma, the values assumed by
$\delta \omega$ are usually different from those derived in 1-D because, due to
the transverse electron motion, one must account for the hysteresis in $\delta
\omega$ in addition to plasma inhomogeneity. Hence, unless the EPW keeps
growing in a homogeneous one-dimensional plasma, one cannot derive $\delta
\omega$ \textit{a priori} as a function of the local wave amplitude and
wavenumber. Due to the nonlocality in the action distribution function, $\delta

equation. This equation was derived in [11] as the limit dynamics of a
singularly perturbed Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with Coriolis force, when
the Mach, Rossby and Weber numbers go to zero at the same rate. The scope of
the present paper is twofold. First of all, we investigate well-posedness of
such a model on the whole space $\R^2$: we prove that it is well-posed in $H^s$
for any $s\geq3$, globally in time. Interestingly enough, we show that this
equation owns two levels of energy estimates, for which one gets existence and
uniqueness of weak solutions with different regularities (namely, $H^3$ and
$H^4$ regularities); this fact can be viewed as a remainder of the so called
BD-entropy structure of the original system. In the second part of the paper we
investigate the long-time behaviour of these solutions. We show that they
converge to the solution of the corresponding linear parabolic type equation,
with same initial datum and external force. Our proof is based on dispersive
estimates both for the solutions to the linear and non-linear problems.

extremely low kinetic energy flux associated with those accretion shocks. On
the other hand, radiative features of internal shocks in the hot intracluster

  The general approach is illustrated by computer algebra experiments,
stressing the interest of performing differentiation, whenever possible, on
high level objects, before any translation in Fortran or C code. We include
ordinary differential systems with discontinuity, with a special interest for
those comming from discontinuous Lagrangians.

isotropy of GRBs based on their sky number density distribution. In this work
we propose an approach to test the isotropy of the Universe through inspecting
the isotropy of the properties of GRBs such as their duration, fluences and
peak fluxes at various energy bands and different time scales. We apply this
method on the {\em Fermi} / Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data sample
containing 1591 GRBs. The most noticeable feature we found is near the Galactic
coordinates $l\approx 30^\circ$, $b\approx 15^\circ$ and radius $r\approx
20^\circ-40^\circ$. The inferred probability for the occurrence of such an
anisotropic signal (in a random isotropic sample) is derived to be less than a
percent in some of the tests while the other tests give results consistent with
isotropy. These are based on the comparison of the results from the real data
with the randomly shuffled data samples. Considering large number of statistics
we used in this work (which some of them are correlated to each other) we can
anticipate that the detected feature could be result of statistical
fluctuations. Moreover, we noticed a considerably low number of GRBs in this
particular patch which might be due to some instrumentation or observational
effects that can consequently affect our statistics through some systematics.
Further investigation is highly desirable in order clarify about this result,
e.g. utilizing a larger future {\em Fermi} / GBM data sample as well as data
samples of other GRB missions and also looking for possible systematics.

per discrete time step. The server has to continuously monitor a given
parameter defined over all information available at the distributed nodes. That
is, in any time step $t$, it has to compute an output based on all values
currently observed across all streams. To do so, nodes can send messages to the
server and the server can broadcast messages to the nodes. The objective is the
minimisation of communication while allowing the server to compute the desired
output.
  We consider monitoring problems related to the domain $D_t$ defined to be the
set of values observed by at least one node at time $t$. We provide randomised
algorithms for monitoring $D_t$, (approximations of) the size $|D_t|$ and the
frequencies of all members of $D_t$. Besides worst-case bounds, we also obtain
improved results when inputs are parameterised according to the similarity of
observations between consecutive time steps. This parameterisation allows to
exclude inputs with rapid and heavy changes, which usually lead to the
worst-case bounds but might be rather artificial in certain scenarios.

collider, i.e., $e^+e^-\to H\gamma$, is known to bear a rather small cross
section in Standard Model, and can serve as a sensitive probe for the potential
new physics signals. Similar to the loop-induced Higgs decay channels $H\to
\gamma\gamma, Z\gamma$, the $e^+e^-\to H\gamma$ process also starts at one-loop
order provided that the tiny electron mass is neglected. In this work, we
calculate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to this associated
$H+\gamma$ production process, which mainly stem from the gluonic dressing to
the top quark loop. The QCD corrections are found to be rather modest at lower
center-of-mass energy range ($\sqrt{s}<300$ GeV), thus of negligible impact on
Higgs factory such as CEPC. Nevertheless, when the energy is boosted to the ILC
energy range ($\sqrt{s}\approx 400$ GeV), QCD corrections may enhance the
leading-order cross section by $20\%$. In any event, the $e^+e^-\to H\gamma$
process has a maximal production rate $\sigma_{\rm max}\approx 0.08$ fb around
$\sqrt{s}= 250$ GeV, thus CEPC turns out to be the best place to look for this
rare Higgs production process. In the high energy limit, the effect of NLO QCD
corrections become completely negligible, which can be simply attributed to the
different asymptotic scaling behaviors of the LO and NLO cross sections, where
the former exhibits a milder decrement $\propto 1/s$ , but the latter undergoes
a much faster decrease $\propto 1/s^2$.

This seems to contradict the possibility of acting entities within such a

multivariate Markov chains based on entity-sets. Entity-sets represent a
largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns that are
considered as all the entities within the Markov chain. For example, the
entity-set can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or
complete specific integration. Importantly, the perception-action loop also
induces an entity-set and is a multivariate Markov chain. We then show that our

specialize to the usual concept of perception in the perception-action loop.

make mobile social networking pervasive by leveraging the feature of
short-range wireless communication technologies (e.g. WiFi Direct). In this
paper, we study local content dissemination in WiFi-Direct-based mobile social
networks (MSNs). We propose a simple GO-coordinated dissemination strategy, as
WiFi Direct does not originally support content dissemination. Due to mobility
and the short transmission range, the duration of nodes in contact tends to be
limited and consequently they compete for the limited airtime to disseminate
their own data. Therefore, fair allocation of the limited airtime among the
nodes is required. We focus on fairness in content dissemination rate, which is
a key application-layer metric, rather than fairness in throughput or airtime
and formulate the allocation problem as a generalized Nash bargaining game
wherein the nodes bargain for a share of the limited airtime. The game is
proved to have a unique optimal solution, and an algorithm with low complexity
is designed to find the optimal solution. Furthermore, we propose a detailed
scheduling approach to implement the optimal solution. We also present
numerical results to evaluate the Nash bargaining based allocation and
scheduling.

predict a maximum mass limit for white dwarfs slightly above the Chandrasekhar

for methods that can extract useful information, for example the relationship

(PLS) method can be used for this dimension reduction task. Within life
sciences, results across studies are compared and combined. Therefore,
parameters need to be identifiable, which is not the case for PLS. In addition,
PLS is an algorithm, while epidemiological study designs are often
outcome-dependent and methods to analyze such data require a probabilistic
formulation. Moreover, a probabilistic model provides a statistical framework
for inference. To address these issues, we develop Probabilistic PLS (PPLS). We
derive maximum likelihood estimators that satisfy the identifiability
conditions by using an EM algorithm with a constrained optimization in the M
step. We show that the PPLS parameters are identifiable up to sign. A
simulation study is conducted to study the performance of PPLS compared to
existing methods. The PPLS estimates performed well in various scenarios, even
in high dimensions. Most notably, the estimates seem to be robust against
departures from normality. To illustrate our method, we applied it to IgG
glycan data from two cohorts. Our PPLS model provided insight as well as
interpretable results across the two cohorts.

promising perspectives for device applications in quantum information
technologies, and their study can reveal fundamentally novel physics in quantum
matter. Quantum spin ice is an appealing proposal of one such state, in which
the fundamental ground state properties and excitations are described by an
emergent U(1) lattice gauge theory [3-7]. This quantum-coherent regime has
quasiparticles that are predicted to behave like magnetic and electric
monopoles, along with a gauge boson playing the role of an artificial photon.
However, this emergent lattice quantum electrodynamics has proved elusive in

pyrochlore magnet Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ that provide evidence for a quantum spin
ice ground state. We find a quasi-elastic structure factor with pinch points -
a signature of a classical spin ice - that are partially suppressed, as
expected in the quantum-coherent regime of the lattice field theory at finite

excitations, which resemble predictions for the fractionalized, topological

that the low-energy physics of Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ can be described by emergent

that $|Q|=k$ and {\em clustering}, which returns an (approximate) minimizer of
$V(Q)$ of size $|Q|=k$. With very large data sets $X$, we seek efficient
constructions of small samples that act as surrogates to the full data for
performing these tasks. Existing constructions that provide quality guarantees
are either worst-case, and unable to benefit from structure of real data sets,
or make explicit strong assumptions on the structure. We show here how to avoid
both these pitfalls using adaptive designs.
  At the core of our design is the {\em one2all} construction of
multi-objective probability-proportional-to-size (pps) samples: Given a set $M$
of centroids and $\alpha \geq 1$, one2all efficiently assigns probabilities to
points so that the clustering cost of {\em each} $Q$ with cost $V(Q) \geq
V(M)/\alpha$ can be estimated well from a sample of size $O(\alpha
|M|\epsilon^{-2})$. For cost queries, we can obtain worst-case sample size
$O(k\epsilon^{-2})$ by applying one2all to a bicriteria approximation $M$, but
we adaptively balance $|M|$ and $\alpha$ to further reduce sample size. For
clustering, we design an adaptive wrapper that applies a base clustering
algorithm to a sample $S$. Our wrapper uses the smallest sample that provides
statistical guarantees that the quality of the clustering on the sample carries
over to the full data set. We demonstrate experimentally the huge gains of
using our adaptive instead of worst-case methods.

are generally too small to train a DL system from scratch. For example, the
BioASQ dataset for biomedical QA comprises less then 900 factoid (single

neural QA system trained on a large open-domain dataset (SQuAD, source) to a
biomedical dataset (BioASQ, target) by employing various transfer learning
techniques. Our network architecture is based on a state-of-the-art QA system,
extended with biomedical word embeddings and a novel mechanism to answer list

rely on domain-specific ontologies, parsers or entity taggers, which are

exhibited by certain partial differential equations, which is detected by
suitable Lebesgue space norms. In most cases the evolution propagator $U(t)$ is
a one parameter group of unitary operators. Motivated by the importance of
decay estimates in group representation theory and ergodic theory,
Strichartz-type estimates seem worth investigating when $U(t)$ is replaced by a
unitary representation of a non-compact Lie group, the group element playing
the role of time. Since the Schr\""odinger group is a subgroup of the metaplectc

interest in this connection. We prove uniform weak-type sharp estimates for
matrix coefficients and Strichartz estimates for that representation. The
crucial point is the choice of function spaces able to detect such a dispersive
effect, which in general will depend on the given group action. The relevant
function spaces here turn out to be the so-called modulation spaces from
Time-frequency Analysis in Euclidean space, and Lebesgue spaces with respect to
Haar measure on the metaplectic group. The proofs make use in an essential way
of the covariance of the Wigner distribution with respect to the metaplectic

PLA the random nature of the communication channel is exploited. In this paper
we compare the various approaches using in all cases the channel as a source of

transcription factors (the drivers of the response). To probe the role of this
feedback, we consider alternative in silico signaling networks implementing
different operating principles. By a comparative analysis, we find that the
presence of a negative regulatory feedback loop allows the system to have a far
larger sensitivity in its dynamical response to auxin. At the same time, this
sensitivity does not prevent the system from being highly resilient. Given this
insight, we reconsider previously published models and build a new quantitative

ergodic, and there exist mixing mean ergodic operators on $\ell^p(\mathbb{N})$,

  Science",,,,"nlin.PS physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ion acoustic (IA) solitons are accompanied by vortex-shaped nonlinear
structures (e.g. hollows, plateaus or humps) in the electron distribution
function, called electron holes, portraying trapped electrons. These structures
appear as charged flexible clouds (shielded by the background plasma) in the
phase space with their own inertia, depending on the number of trapped
electrons. According to simulation studies, electron holes tend to merge in
pairs until one accumulative hole remains in the simulation box. This tendency
has been analytically and qualitatively explained in the frame of the energy
conservation principle. However, electron holes accompanying IA solitons should
not merge due to stability of IA solitons against mutual collisions. In this
report based on a fully kinetic simulation approach, detailed study of the
collisions of IA solitons reveals the behavior of electron holes under these
two conflicting predictions, i.e. stability against mutual collisions and
merging tendency. Four main results are reported here. Firstly, we find that
among the three different types of collisions possible for electron holes, just
two of them happen for electron holes accompanying IA solitons. We present
different collisions, e.g. two large/small and large versus small holes, to
cover all the these three different types of collisions. Secondly, we show that
although electron holes merge during collisions of IA solitons, the stability
of IA solitons forces the merged hole to split and form new electron holes.
Thirdly, we reveal that holes share their trapped population during collisions.
Post-collision holes incorporate some parts of the oppositely propagating
before-collision holes. Finally, it is shown that the newly added population of
trapped electrons goes through a spiral path inside the after-collision holes
hole because of dissipative effects.

associated with wind structures, including the apparently ubiquitous discrete
absorption components (DACs). These features have been proposed to be caused
either by magnetic fields or non-radial pulsations. In this second paper of
this series, we revisit the canonical phenomenological hydrodynamical modelling
used to explain the formation of DACs by taking into account modern
observations and more realistic theoretical predictions. Using constraints on
putative bright spots located on the surface of the O giant $\xi$ Persei
derived from high precision space-based broadband optical photometry obtained
with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) space telescope, we
generate two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of co-rotating interaction
regions in its wind. We then compute synthetic ultraviolet (UV) resonance line
profiles using Sobolev Exact Integration and compare them with historical
timeseries obtained by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to evaluate
if the observed behaviour of $\xi$ Persei's DACs is reproduced. Testing three
different models of spot size and strength, we find that the classical pattern
of variability can be successfully reproduced for two of them: the model with
the smallest spots yields absorption features that are incompatible with
observations. Furthermore, we test the effect of the radial dependence of
ionization levels on line driving, but cannot conclusively assess the
importance of this factor. In conclusion, this study self-consistently links
optical photometry and UV spectroscopy, paving the way to a better
understanding of cyclical wind variability in massive stars in the context of

the filter becomes inconsistent due to the well known linearization issues. So
we perform a keyframe-based visual-inertial bundle adjustment to improve the

multichannel equalization for speech dereverberation and noise reduction. The
time-domain cross-relation method is not suitable for blind room impulse
response identification, due to the near-common zeros of the long impulse
responses. We extend the cross-relation method to the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) domain, in which the time-domain impulse responses are
approximately represented by the convolutive transfer functions (CTFs) with
much less coefficients. The CTFs suffer from the common zeros caused by the
oversampled STFT. We propose to identify CTFs based on the STFT with the
oversampled signals and the critical sampled CTFs, which is a good compromise
between the frequency aliasing of the signals and the common zeros problem of
CTFs. In addition, a normalization of the CTFs is proposed to remove the gain
ambiguity across sub-bands. In the STFT domain, the identified CTFs is used for
multichannel equalization, in which the sparsity of speech signals is
exploited. We propose to perform inverse filtering by minimizing the
$\ell_1$-norm of the source signal with the relaxed $\ell_2$-norm fitting error
between the micophone signals and the convolution of the estimated source
signal and the CTFs used as a constraint. This method is advantageous in that
the noise can be reduced by relaxing the $\ell_2$-norm to a tolerance
corresponding to the noise power, and the tolerance can be automatically set.
The experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed method even under
conditions with high reverberation levels and intense noise.

logarithmic Jensen's gap to a given fading model. We show that as a consequence
of a finite logarithmic Jensen's gap, approximate capacity region can be

We illustrate three instances where a constant capacity gap can be obtained as
a function of the logarithmic Jensen's gap. Firstly for an FF-IC with neither
feedback nor instantaneous channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), if
the fading distribution has finite logarithmic Jensen's gap, we show that a
rate-splitting scheme based on average interference-to-noise ratio (inr) can
achieve its approximate capacity. Secondly we show that a similar scheme can
achieve the approximate capacity of FF-IC with feedback and delayed CSIT, if
the fading distribution has finite logarithmic Jensen's gap. Thirdly, when this
condition holds, we show that point-to-point codes can achieve approximate
capacity for a class of FF-IC with feedback. We prove that the logarithmic
Jensen's gap is finite for common fading models, including Rayleigh and
Nakagami fading, thereby obtaining the approximate capacity region of FF-IC
with these fading models. For Rayleigh fading the capacity gap is obtained as
1.83 bits per channel use for non-feedback case and 2.83 bits per channel use

developed in the computer science community. Numerical operations on big
datasets can be intolerably slow; sketching algorithms address this issue by
generating a smaller surrogate dataset. Typically, inference proceeds on the
compressed dataset. Sketching algorithms generally use random projections to
compress the original dataset and this stochastic generation process makes them
amenable to statistical analysis. We argue that the sketched data can be
modelled as a random sample, thus placing this family of data compression
methods firmly within an inferential framework. In particular, we focus on the
Gaussian, Hadamard and Clarkson-Woodruff sketches, and their use in single pass
sketching algorithms for linear regression with huge $n$. We explore the
statistical properties of sketched regression algorithms and derive new
distributional results for a large class of sketched estimators. A key result
is a conditional central limit theorem for data oblivious sketches. An
important finding is that the best choice of sketching algorithm in terms of
mean square error is related to the signal to noise ratio in the source
dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the theory and the limits of its applicability
on two real datasets.

Given a set of partitions, CHAMP identifies the domain of modularity

has the largest modularity relative to the input set---discarding partitions
with empty domains to obtain the subset of partitions that are ""admissible""
candidate community structures that remain potentially optimal over indicated

parameter spaces, such as those for multilayer networks where one includes a
resolution parameter and interlayer coupling. Using the results from CHAMP, a
user can more appropriately select robust community structures by observing the
sizes of domains of optimization and the pairwise comparisons between
partitions in the admissible subset. We demonstrate the utility of CHAMP with
several example networks. In these examples, CHAMP focuses attention onto
pruned subsets of admissible partitions that are 20-to-1785 times smaller than
the sets of unique partitions obtained by community detection heuristics that

We show that the spin toroidization is comprised of two contributions: one is

the coordinate shift of the electron as spin carrier in response to the
inhomogeneous magnetic field. We then establish a direct and elengant relation

Search, aiming for the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles

by two orders of magnitude compared to its predecessor XENON100. This requires
a water Cherenkov muon veto surrounding the XENON1T TPC, both to shield
external backgrounds and to tag muon-induced energetic neutrons through
detection of a passing muon or the secondary shower induced by a muon
interacting in the surrounding rock. The muon veto is instrumented with $84$
$8""$ PMTs with high quantum efficiency (QE) in the Cherenkov regime and the
walls of the watertank are clad with the highly reflective DF2000MA foil by 3M.
Here, we present a study of the reflective properties of this foil, as well as
the measurement of its wavelength shifting (WLS) properties. Further, we
present the impact of reflectance and WLS on the detection efficiency of the
muon veto, using a Monte Carlo simulation carried out with Geant4. The
measurements yield a specular reflectance of $\approx100\%$ for wavelengths
larger than $400\,$nm, while $\approx90\%$ of the incoming light below
$370\,$nm is absorbed by the foil. Approximately $3-7.5\%$ of the light hitting
the foil within the wavelength range $250\,$nm $\leq \lambda \leq 390\,$nm is
used for the WLS process. The intensity of the emission spectrum of the WLS
light is slightly dependent on the absorbed wavelength and shows the shape of a
rotational-vibrational fluorescence spectrum, peaking at around $\lambda
\approx 420\,$nm. Adjusting the reflectance values to the measured ones in the
Monte Carlo simulation originally used for the muon veto design, the veto
detection efficiency remains unchanged. Including the wavelength shifting in
the Monte Carlo simulation leads to an increase of the efficiency of

proposals widely accepted in the ICN community however, they do not provide an
efficient pub/sub mechanism. COPSS enhances CCN/NDN with an efficient pub/sub
capability. Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing topic of interest in both
Academia and Industry. The current designs for IoT relies on IP. However, the
IoT devices are constrained in their available resources and IP is heavy for
their operation.We observed that IoT's are information centric in nature and
hence ICN is a more suitable candidate to support IoT environments. Although
NDN and COPSS work well for the Internet, their current full fledged
implementations cannot be used by the resource constrained IoT devices.
CCN-lite is a light weight, inter-operable version of the CCNx protocol for
supporting the IoT devices. However, CCN-lite like its ancestors lacks the
support for an efficient pub/sub mechanism. In this paper, we developed
COPSS-lite, an efficient and light weight implementation of pub/sub for IoT.
COPSS-lite is developed to enhance CCN-lite and also support multi-hop
connection by incorporating the famous RPL protocol for low power and lossy
networks. We provide a preliminary evaluation to show proof of operability with
real world sensor devices in IoT lab. Our results show that COPSS-lite is

wide geographical area. One particular case is when two neighboring agents
share a common observation. For example, to estimate voltage in the direct

proportional to the voltage difference between two neighboring buses. When
applying the Gaussian BP algorithm to this type of problem, the convergence

analytically that the updating information matrix converges at a geometric rate
to a unique positive definite matrix with arbitrary positive semidefinite

widely used in diverse applications, including optical engineering, aerospace

conventional PSDs has become a bottleneck limiting its applications. Herein, we
present a high performance graphene based PSDs with revolutionary interfacial
amplification mechanism. Signal amplification in the order of ~10^4 has been
demonstrated by utilizing the ultrahigh mobility of graphene and long lifetime
of photo-induced carriers at the interface of SiO2/Si. This would improve the
detection limit of Si-based PSDs from uW to nW level, without sacrificing the
spatial resolution and response speed. Such interfacial amplification mechanism
is compatible with current Si technology and can be easily extended to other

nonlinearity of dynamics, strong noise impacts and low measurement frequencies
jointly affect. In this Letter, we propose a general method that introduces a
number of nonlinear terms of the measurable variables as artificial and new
variables, and uses the expanded variables to linearize nonlinear differential
equations. Moreover, we use two-time correlations to decompose effects of
system dynamics and noise driving. With these transformations, reconstructing
nonlinear dynamics of the original system is equivalent to solving linear
dynamics of the expanded system at the least squares approximations. We can
well reconstruct nonlinear networks, including all dynamic nonlinearities,
network links, and noise statistical characteristics, as sampling frequency is
rather low. Numerical results fully verify the validity of theoretical
derivations.

contents of large, unstructured corpora of text documents. Although topic
models often perform well on traditional training vs. test set evaluations, it
is often the case that the results of a topic model do not align with human
interpretation. This interpretability fallacy is largely due to the
unsupervised nature of topic models, which prohibits any user guidance on the
results of a model. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised method called
topic supervised non-negative matrix factorization (TS-NMF) that enables the
user to provide labeled example documents to promote the discovery of more
meaningful semantic structure of a corpus. In this way, the results of TS-NMF
better match the intuition and desired labeling of the user. The core of TS-NMF
relies on solving a non-convex optimization problem for which we derive an
iterative algorithm that is shown to be monotonic and convergent to a local
optimum. We demonstrate the practical utility of TS-NMF on the Reuters and
PubMed corpora, and find that TS-NMF is especially useful for conceptual or
broad topics, where topic key terms are not well understood. Although
identifying an optimal latent structure for the data is not a primary objective
of the proposed approach, we find that TS-NMF achieves higher weighted Jaccard
similarity scores than the contemporary methods, (unsupervised) NMF and latent
Dirichlet allocation, at supervision rates as low as 10% to 20%.

cytoplasmatic membrane, following lengthwise regularly spaced, forming a
skeleton of the CIS, located above the OLM. IFBs follow along the cone outer
segment (COS), with single IFs separating from the IFB, touching and entering
in-between the light-sensitive disks of the cone membrane. We propose a
mechanism of exciton transfer from the inner retinal surface to the visual
pigments in the photoreceptor cells. This includes excitation transfer in
donor-acceptor systems, from the IF donors to the rhodopsin acceptors, with
theoretic efficiency over 80%. This explains high image contrast in fovea and
foveola in daylight, while the classical mechanism that describes M\""uller
cells as optical lightguides operates in night vision, with loss of resolution
traded for sensitivity. Our theory receives strong confirmation in morphology
and function of the cones and pigment cells. In daylight the lateral surface of
the photosensor disks is blocked from the (scattered or oblique) light by the
pigment cells. Thus the light energy can only get to the cone via intermediate
filaments that absorb photons in the M\""uller cell endfeet and conduct excitons
to the cone. Thus, the disks are consumed at their lateral surfaces, moving to
the apex of the cone, with new disks produced below. An alternative hypothesis
of direct light passing through the cone with its organelles and hitting the
lowest disk contradicts morphological evidence, as thus all of the other disks
would have no useful function in daylight vision.
