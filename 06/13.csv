$m = 12$ magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in a uniformly twisted flux tube
moving along its axis become unstable in order to model the Kelvin--Helmholtz
(KH) instability in a twisting solar coronal hole jet near the northern pole of
the Sun. Using a twisting jet of 2010 August 21 by \emph{SDO}/AIA and other
observations of coronal jets we set the parameters of our theoretical model and
have obtained that in a twisted magnetic flux tube of radius of $9.8$~Mm, at a
density contrast of $0.474$ and fixed Alfv\'en Mach number of ${\cong}0.76$,
for three MHD modes there exist instability windows whose width crucially
depends upon the internal magnetic field twist. It is found that for the
considered modes an azimuthal magnetic field of $1.3$--$1.4$~G (computed at the
tube boundary) makes the width of the instability windows equal to zero, that
is, it suppress the KH instability onset. On the other hand, the times for
developing KH instability of the $m = 12$ MHD mode at instability wavelengths
between $15$ and $12$~Mm turn out to be in the range of $1.9$ to $4.7$~minutes
that is in agreement with the growth rates estimated from the temporal
evolution of the observed unstable jet's blobs in their initial stage.

common assumption in conic optimization. Without strict feasibility,
first-order optimality conditions may be meaningless, the dual problem may
yield little information about the primal, and small changes in the data may
render the problem infeasible. Hence, failure of strict feasibility can
negatively impact off-the-shelf numerical methods, such as primal-dual interior
point methods, in particular. New optimization modelling techniques and convex
relaxations for hard nonconvex problems have shown that the loss of strict
feasibility is a more pronounced phenomenon than has previously been realized.
In this text, we describe various reasons for the loss of strict feasibility,
whether due to poor modelling choices or (more interestingly) rich underlying
structure, and discuss ways to cope with it and, in many pronounced cases, how
to use it as an advantage. In large part, we emphasize the facial reduction
preprocessing technique due to its mathematical elegance, geometric
transparency, and computational potential.

disc ICL stars are more centrally concentrated than halo ICL stars. The

galaxy that falls to the centre of the cluster and is heavily disrupted,
producing part of the cD galaxy. At radial distances greater than 200kpc, well
beyond the stellar envelope of the cD galaxy, stars formerly from the stellar

filaments are detected in the Herschel 250 microns image and seem to be
radially directed to the massive clump. It resembles more of a ""hub-filament""
system. Deeply embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified using
the 1-5 microns photometric data, and a significant fraction of YSOs and their
clustering are spatially found toward the massive clump, revealing the intense
SF activities. An infrared counterpart (IRc) of the maser is investigated in
the Spitzer 3.6-4.5 microns images. The IRc does not appear point-like source

indicating that the massive clump harbors an early phase of massive protostar
before the onset of an ultracompact H II region. Together, the I05480+2545 is
embedded in a very similar ""hub-filament"" system to those seen in Rosette

coherent quantum bus operation. Such a long-distance coherent coupling could be
used to investigate coherent spin teleportation and super-exchange effects and
to construct a spin qubit with an improved long coherent time and with spin

envelope evolution (CEE) with a giant star accretes mass from the remaining
envelope outside its deep orbit and launches jets that facilitate the removal
of the remaining envelope. The jets that the accretion disk launches collide
with the envelope and form hot bubbles that energize the envelope. Due to
gravitational interaction with the envelope, that might reside in a
circumbinary disk, the companion migrates further in, but the inner boundary of
the circumbinary disk continues to feed the accretion disk. While near the
equatorial plane mass leaves the system at a very low velocity, along the polar
directions velocities are very high. When the primary is an asymptotic giant
branch star, this type of flow forms a bipolar nebula with very narrow waists.
We compare this envelope removal process with four others last-phase common
envelope removal processes. We also note that the accreted gas from the
envelope outside the orbit in the last-phase of the CEE might carry with it
angular momentum that is antialigned to the orbital angular momentum. We

dynamic changes and a biological system will not pass the
survival-of-the-fittest test unless it exhibits certain features that enable
fast recovery from these changes. In particular, a question that is crucial in
the context of biological cellular networks, is whether the system can keep the
changing components \emph{confined} so that only nodes in their vicinity may be
affected by the changes, but nodes sufficiently far away from any changing
component remain unaffected.
  Based on this notion of confinement, we propose a new metric for measuring
the dynamic changes recovery performance in distributed network algorithms
operating under the \emph{Stone Age} model (Emek \& Wattenhofer, PODC 2013),
where the class of dynamic topology changes we consider includes
inserting/deleting an edge, deleting a node together with its incident edges,
and inserting a new isolated node. Our main technical contribution is a
distributed algorithm for maximal independent set (MIS) in synchronous networks
subject to these topology changes that performs well in terms of the
aforementioned new metric. Specifically, our algorithm guarantees that nodes
which do not experience a topology change in their immediate vicinity are not
affected and that all surviving nodes (including the affected ones) perform
$\mathcal{O}((C + 1) \log^{2} n)$ computationally-meaningful steps, where $C$
is the number of topology changes; in other words, each surviving node performs
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{2} n)$ steps when amortized over the number of topology
changes. This is accompanied by a simple example demonstrating that the linear
dependency on $C$ cannot be avoided.

structures below a kpc-scale de Broglie wavelength, has become a viable dark
matter candidate. Compared to the conventional free-particle $\psi {\rm DM}$
(${\rm FP} \psi {\rm DM}$), the extreme-axion $\psi \rm{DM}$ model (${\rm EA}
\psi {\rm DM}$) proposed by Zhang & Chiueh (2017) features a larger cut-off
wavenumber and a broad spectral bump in the matter transfer function. Here we
conduct cosmological simulations to compare the halo abundances and assembly
histories at $z=4-11$ between three different scenarios: ${\rm FP} \psi {\rm
DM}$, ${\rm EA} \psi {\rm DM}$, and cold dark matter (CDM). We show that ${\rm
EA} \psi {\rm DM}$ produces significantly more abundant low-mass haloes than
${\rm FP} \psi {\rm DM}$ with the same $m_{\psi}$, and therefore could
alleviate the tension in $m_{\psi}$ required by the Ly$\alpha$ forest data and
by the kpc-scale dwarf galaxy cores. We also find that, compared to the CDM
counterparts, massive ${\rm EA} \psi {\rm DM}$ haloes are on average $3-4$
times more massive at $z=10-11$ due to their earlier formation, undergo a
slower mass accretion at $7 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$, and then show a rapidly
rising major merger rate exceeding CDM by $\sim 50\%$ at $4 \lesssim z \lesssim
7$. This fact suggests that ${\rm EA} \psi {\rm DM}$ haloes may exhibit more
prominent starbursts at $z \lesssim 7$.

attributes' great potential as a pose and view-invariant representation.
However, existing attribute-centric approaches have thus far underperformed
state-of-the-art conventional approaches. This is due to their non-scalable
need for extensive domain (camera) specific annotation. In this paper we
present a new semantic attribute learning approach for person re-identification
and search. Our model is trained on existing fashion photography datasets --
either weakly or strongly labelled. It can then be transferred and adapted to
provide a powerful semantic description of surveillance person detections,
without requiring any surveillance domain supervision. The resulting
representation is useful for both unsupervised and supervised person
re-identification, achieving state-of-the-art and near state-of-the-art
performance respectively. Furthermore, as a semantic representation it allows
description-based person search to be integrated within the same framework.

simulated galaxies in a cosmological context. We analyse simulated disc
galaxies selected from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that includes
chemical evolution and a physically motivated Supernova feedback capable of
driving mass-loaded galactic winds. We detect a mild evolution with redshift in
the metallicity slopes of $-0.02 \pm 0.01$ dex~kpc$^{-1}$ from $z\sim 1$. If
the metallicity profiles are normalised by the effective radius of the stellar
disc, the slopes show no clear evolution for $z < 1$, with a median value of
approximately $-0.23$ dex ~$r_{\rm reff}^{-1}$. As a function of stellar mass,
we find that metallicity gradients steepen for stellar masses smaller than
$\sim 10^{10.3} {\rm M_{\odot}}$ while the trend reverses for higher stellar
masses, in the redshift range $z=[0,1]$. Galaxies with small stellar masses
have discs with larger $r_{\rm reff}$ and flatter metallicity gradients than
expected. We detect migration albeit weaker than in previous works. Our stellar
discs show a mild evolution of the stellar metallicity slopes up to $z\sim 1,$
which is well-matched by the evolution calculated archeologically from the
abundance distributions of mono-age stellar populations at $z\sim 0$. Overall,
Supernova feedback could explain the trends but an impact of migration can not
be totally discarded. Galaxy-galaxy interactions or small satellite accretions
can also contribute to modify the metallicity profiles in the outer parts.

numerical simulation (DNS) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with
level-set (LS) and volume-of-fluid (VoF) surface tracking methods. $\lambda_2$
contours are used to relate the vortex dynamics to the surface dynamics at
different stages of the jet breakup, namely, lobe formation, lobe perforation,
ligament formation, stretching, and tearing. Three distinct breakup mechanisms
are identified in the primary breakup, which are well categorized on the
parameter space of gas Weber number ($We_g$) versus liquid Reynolds number
($Re_l$). These mechanisms are analyzed here from a vortex dynamics
perspective. Vortex dynamics explains the hairpin formation, and the
interaction between the hairpins and the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roller explains
the perforation of the lobes, which is attributed to the streamwise overlapping
of two oppositely-oriented hairpin vortices on top and bottom of the lobe. The
formation of corrugations on the lobe front edge at high $Re_l$ is also related
to the location and structure of the hairpins with respect to the KH vortex.
The lobe perforation and corrugation formation are inhibited at low $Re_l$ and
low $We_g$ due to the high surface tension and viscous forces, which damp the
small scale corrugations and resist hole formation. Streamwise vorticity
generation - resulting in three-dimensional instabilities - is mainly caused by
vortex stretching and baroclinic torque at high and low density ratios,
respectively. Generation of streamwise vortices and their interaction with
spanwise vortices produce the liquid structures seen at various flow
conditions. Understanding the liquid sheet breakup and the related vortex
dynamics are crucial for controlling the droplet size distribution in primary
atomization.

group and cluster halos can be probed by stacking maps of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Perhaps surprisingly, recent observational
results have indicated that the scaling relation between integrated pressure
and mass follows the prediction of simple, self-similar models down to halo
masses as low as $10^{12.5} \, M_{\odot}$. Hydrodynamical simulations that
incorporate energetic feedback processes suggest that gas should be depleted
from such low-mass halos, thus decreasing their tSZ signal relative to
self-similar predictions. Here, we build on the modeling of Vikram, Lidz, and
Jain (2017) to evaluate the bias in the interpretation of stacked tSZ
measurements due to the signal from correlated halos (the ""two-halo"" term),
which has generally been neglected in the literature. We fit theoretical models
to a measurement of the tSZ -- galaxy group cross-correlation function,
accounting explicitly for the one- and two- halo contributions. We find
moderate evidence of a deviation from self-similarity in the pressure -- mass
relation, even after marginalizing over conservative miscentering effects. We
explore pressure -- mass models with a break at $10^{14} \, M_{\odot}$, as well
as other variants. We discuss and test for sources of uncertainty in our
analysis, in particular a possible bias in the halo mass estimates and the
coarse resolution of the Planck beam. We compare our findings with earlier
analyses by exploring the extent to which halo isolation criteria can reduce
the two-halo contribution. Finally, we show that ongoing third-generation CMB
experiments will explicitly resolve the one-halo term in low-mass groups; our
methodology can be applied to these upcoming data sets to obtain a clear answer
to the question of self-similarity and an improved understanding of hot gas in
low-mass halos.

applied here to study the formation of two-body gravitational wave captures,

becomes possible only if one can produce high-resolution
chrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale astrometric
and spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a well-defined view of the
current chemo-kinematical structure of the Milky Way, but will only enable a
blurred view on the temporal sequence that led to the present-day Galaxy. As
demonstrated by the (ongoing) exploitation of data from the pioneering
photometric missions CoRoT, Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the way
forward: solar-like oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks
to the availability of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight
age-initial-mass relation they adhere to. In this paper we identify five key
outstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution of the Milky Way
that will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of stars to be
addressed, and we identify the requirements in terms of number of targets and
the precision on the stellar properties that are needed to tackle such
questions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields expected from PLATO for
red-giant stars, we demonstrate that these requirements are within the
capabilities of the current instrument design, provided that observations are
sufficiently long to identify the evolutionary state and allow robust and
precise determination of acoustic-mode frequencies. This will allow us to
harvest data of sufficient quality to reach a 10% precision in age. This is a
fundamental pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a similar
level of accuracy, which will only be possible if we have to hand a careful
appraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving from our limited
understanding of stellar physics, a goal which conveniently falls within the
main aims of PLATO's core science.

generating the observed properties of a set of objects. It is often used to
make predictions either for new values of interest or missing information in
the original data, as well as to perform data exploratory analysis. However,
although there is an extensive literature on latent feature models for
homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of
the same (continuous or discrete) nature, there is a lack of work on latent
feature modeling for heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we introduce a
general Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model suitable for heterogeneous
datasets, where the attributes describing each object can be either discrete,
continuous or mixed variables. The proposed model presents several important
properties. First, it accounts for heterogeneous data while keeping the
properties of conjugate models, which allow us to infer the model in linear
time with respect to the number of objects and attributes. Second, its Bayesian
nonparametric nature allows us to automatically infer the model complexity from
the data, i.e., the number of features necessary to capture the latent
structure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are
binary-valued variables, easing the interpretability of the obtained latent
features in data exploratory analysis. We show the flexibility of the proposed
model by solving both prediction and data analysis tasks on several real-world
datasets. Moreover, a software package of the GLFM is publicly available for
other researcher to use and improve it.

stellar mass over 0.5<z<2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE)

of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass
completeness of our survey, $\log(M/M_\odot)>9 (9.5)$ at z=1.3 (2.0). This
method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision
($\sigma_z / (1+z) \lesssim 0.02$), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density
environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency,
and show that at z> 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that
the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not
separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching
efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ($\log (M/M_\odot)\gtrsim$
10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ($\log (M/M)_\odot) \lesssim$
10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at $z\gtrsim$ 1.5, but
increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account
for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim$ 9-10),
which appear primarily at $z\lesssim$ 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass
quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched
star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the
morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The
evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas
starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through
star-formation and outflows (""overconsumption""), and additional processes such
as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the
morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy
populations.

outflow rates and OH absorption strengths at solar metallicity agree with
observations, although the maximum line of sight velocities from the model CO
spectra are a factor $\approx$2 lower than is observed. We derive a CO (1-0) to
H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm{CO} (1-0)}$ = 0.13 M$_\odot$ (K km
s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$, 6 times lower than is commonly assumed in observations
of such systems. We find strong emission from the mid-infrared lines of H$_2$.
The mass of H$_2$ traced by this infrared emission is within a few per cent of
the total H$_2$ mass. This H$_2$ emission may be observable by JWST.

distributed along filaments connecting galaxies. Illuminated by the cosmic UV
background (UVB), these structures are expected to glow in fluorescent Lyman
alpha emission with a Surface Brightness (SB) that is well below current
observational limits for individual detections. Here, we perform a stacking
analysis of the deepest MUSE/VLT data using three-dimensional regions
(subcubes) with orientations determined by the position of neighbouring Lyman
alpha galaxies (LAEs) at 3<z<4. Our method should increase the probability of
detecting filamentary Lyman alpha emission, provided that these structures are
Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs). By stacking 390 oriented subcubes we reach a 2
sigma sensitivity level of SB ~ 0.44e-20 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 in an aperture of
1 arcsec^2 x 6.25 Angstrom, which is three times below the expected fluorescent
Lyman alpha signal from the Haardt-Madau 2012 (HM12) UVB at z~3.5. No
detectable emission is found on intergalactic scales, implying that at least
two thirds of our subcubes do not contain oriented LLSs for a HM12 UVB. On the
other hand, significant emission is detected in the circum-galactic medium
(CGM) of galaxies in the direction of the neighbours. The signal is stronger
for galaxies with a larger number of neighbours and appears to be independent
of any other galaxy properties such as luminosity, redshift and neighbour
distance. We estimate that preferentially oriented satellite galaxies cannot
contribute significantly to this signal, suggesting instead that gas densities
in the CGM are typically larger in the direction of neighbouring galaxies on
cosmological scales.

sequence structure in enhancing or suppressing the sensitivity of quantum

treat in the limiting cases of quasi-DC miscalibration and white noise power

performance. Experiments on RB validate predictions that the distribution of
measured fidelities over sequences is described by a gamma distribution varying
between approximately Gaussian for rapidly varying noise, and a broad, highly
skewed distribution for the slowly varying case. Similarly we find a strong
gate set dependence of GST in the presence of correlated errors, leading to
significant deviations between estimated and calculated diamond distances in
the presence of correlated $\sigma^z$ errors. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that expansion of the gate set to include negative rotations can suppress these
discrepancies and increase reported diamond distances by orders of magnitude
for the same error processes. Similar effects do not occur for correlated
$\sigma^x$ or $\sigma^y$ errors or rapidly varying noise processes,
highlighting the critical interplay of selected gate set and the gauge
optimisation process on the meaning of the reported diamond norm in correlated

To understand the
roles of star cluster environments in shaping the dynamical evolution of
planetary systems, we carry out direct $N$-body simulations of four planetary
systems models in three different star cluster environments with respectively
N=2k, 8k and 32k stars. In each cluster, an ensemble of initially identical
planetary systems are assigned to solar-type stars with $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ and
evolved for 50~Myr. We found that following the depletion of protoplanetary
disks, external perturbations and planet-planet interactions are two driving
mechanisms responsible for the destabilization of planetary systems. The planet
survival rate varies from $\sim 95\%$ in the N=2k cluster to $\sim 60\%$ in the
N=32k cluster, which suggests that most planetary systems can indeed survive in
low-mass clusters, except in the central regions. We also find that planet
ejections through stellar encounters are cumulative processes, as only $\sim
3\%$ of encounters are strong enough to excite the eccentricity by $\Delta e
\geq 0.5$. Short-period planets can be perturbed through orbit crossings with
long-period planets. When taking into account planet-planet interactions, the
planet ejection rate nearly doubles, and therefore multiplicity contributes to
the vulnerability of planetary systems. In each ensemble, $\sim 0.2\%$ of
planetary orbits become retrograde due to random directions of stellar
encounters. Our results predict that young low-mass star clusters are promising
sites for next-generation planet surveys, yet low planet detection rates are
expected in dense globular clusters such as 47 Tuc. Nevertheless, planets in
denser stellar environments are likely to have shorter orbital periods, which
enhances their detectability.

algorithm for large-scale scientific data. Our key contribution is
significantly improving the prediction hitting rate (or prediction accuracy)
for each data point based on its nearby data values along multiple dimensions.
We derive a series of multilayer prediction formulas and their unified formula
in the context of data compression. One serious challenge is that the data
prediction has to be performed based on the preceding decompressed values
during the compression in order to guarantee the error bounds, which may
degrade the prediction accuracy in turn. We explore the best layer for the
prediction by considering the impact of compression errors on the prediction
accuracy. Moreover, we propose an adaptive error-controlled quantization
encoder, which can further improve the prediction hitting rate considerably.
The data size can be reduced significantly after performing the variable-length
encoding because of the uneven distribution produced by our quantization
encoder. We evaluate the new compressor on production scientific data sets and
compare it with many other state-of-the-art compressors: GZIP, FPZIP, ZFP,
SZ-1.1, and ISABELA. Experiments show that our compressor is the best in class,
especially with regard to compression factors (or bit-rates) and compression
errors (including RMSE, NRMSE, and PSNR). Our solution is better than the
second-best solution by more than a 2x increase in the compression factor and
3.8x reduction in the normalized root mean squared error on average, with
reasonable error bounds and user-desired bit-rates.

the Schur index for T_X and, by studying this quantity in the limit of small

storage, and deeper understanding of the effect of flow rate on RFB performance
is needed to develop efficient, low-cost designs. In this study we highlight
the importance of modeling tanks, which can limit the charge/discharge capacity
of redox-active polymer (RAP) based RFBs. The losses due to tank mixing
dominate over the polarization-induced capacity losses that arise due to
resistive processes in the reactor. A porous electrode model is used to
separate these effects by predicting the time variation of active species
concentration in electrodes and tanks. A simple transient model based on
species conservation laws developed in this study reveals that charge
utilization and polarization are affected by two dimensionless numbers
quantifying (1) flow rate relative to stoichiometric flow and (2) size of flow
battery tanks relative to the reactor. The RFB's utilization is shown to
increase monotonically with flow rate, reaching 90% of the theoretical value
only when flow rate exceeds twenty-fold of the stoichiometric value. We also
identify polarization due to irreversibilities inherent to RFB architecture as
a result of tank mixing and current distribution internal to the reactor, and
this polarization dominates over that resulting from ohmic resistances
particularly when cycling RFBs at low flow rates and currents. These findings
are summarized in a map of utilization and polarization that can be used to

mergers at $z\sim$1.8-1.5 with a subsequent passive evolution of the resulting
S0 remnants since $z \sim$0.8-1 is compatible with observational data of S0s in
the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We studied a set of major and minor merger
experiments from the GalMer database that generate massive S0 remnants. We
analysed the location of these remnants in the photometric and stellar TFRs
assuming that they correspond to $z\sim0.8$ galaxies. We then estimated their
evolution in these planes over the last 7 Gyr. The results were compared with
data of real S0s and spirals at different redshifts. We also tested how the use
of Vcirc or Vrot,max affects the results. We found that just after $\sim$1-2
Gyr of coalescence, major mergers generate S0 remnants that are outliers of the
local photometric and stellar TFRs at $z\sim0.8$. After $\sim$4-7 Gyr of
passive evolution in isolation, the S0 remnants move towards the local TFR,
although the initial scatter among them persists. This scatter is sensitive to
the indicator used for the rotation velocity: Vcirc values yield a lower
scatter than when Vrot,max values are considered instead. In the planes
involving Vrot,max, a clear segregation of the S0 remnants in terms of the
spin-orbit coupling of the model is observed, in which the remnants of
retrograde encounters overlap with local S0s hosting counter-rotating discs.
The location of the S0 remnants at $z\sim 0$ agrees well with the observed
distribution of local S0 galaxies in the $\sigma_0$-$M_K$, Vcirc-$\sigma_0$ and
Vrot,max-$\sigma_0$ planes. Thus, massive S0 galaxies may have been formed
through major mergers that occurred at high redshift and have later evolved
towards the local TFR through passive evolution in relative isolation, a
mechanism that would also contribute to the scatter observed in this relation.

with the AREPO code that have initial conditions ranging from super-Alfv\'enic
(weakly magnetized) to sub-Alfv\'enic (strongly magnetized). These simulations
achieve the spatial dynamic range necessary to resolve the collapse of
protostars from the parsec scale of star-forming clouds down to the ~100 au
scale probed by ALMA. Only in the very strongly magnetized simulation do we see
both the preservation of the field direction from cloud to disk scales and an
hourglass-shaped field at < 1000 au scales. We conduct an analysis of the
relative orientation of the magnetic field and the density structure in both
the Ser-emb 8 ALMA observations and the synthetic observations of the four

weakly magnetized simulations, which exhibit random alignment, in contrast to
the strongly magnetized simulation, where the magnetic field plays a role in
shaping the density structure in the source. In the weak-field case, it is
turbulence -- not the magnetic field -- that shapes the material that forms the

Scala. Its distinguishing feature is abstract type members, fields in objects
that hold types rather than values. Proving soundness of DOT has been
surprisingly challenging, and existing proofs are complicated, and reason about
multiple concepts at the same time (e.g. types, values, evaluation). To serve
as a core calculus for Scala, DOT should be easy to experiment with and extend,
and therefore its soundness proof needs to be easy to modify.
  This paper presents a simple and modular proof strategy for reasoning in DOT.
The strategy separates reasoning about types from other concerns. It is centred
around a theorem that connects the full DOT type system to a restricted variant
in which the challenges and paradoxes caused by abstract type members are
eliminated. Almost all reasoning in the proof is done in the intuitive world of
this restricted type system. Once we have the necessary results about types, we
observe that the other aspects of DOT are mostly standard and can be
incorporated into a soundness proof using familiar techniques known from other
calculi.

melting scenario in mixtures of hard disks. Here we employ specialized Monte

as small disks are added to a system of large ones, the stability window of the

terminates at an end point beyond which melting becomes a first-order

normalizes over all possible target words. To address this problem, it is
widely common to restrict the target vocabulary with candidate lists based on

work, we propose a simple and yet novel approach to learn candidate lists
directly from the attention layer during NMT training. The candidate lists are
highly optimized for the current NMT model and do not need any external

decoders utilize a novel decomposition technique for ML metric which divides
the metric into independent positive parts and a positive interference part.
Search spaces of symbols are substantially reduced by employing the independent
parts and statistics of noise. Finally, the members of search spaces are
successively evaluated until the metric is minimized. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed decoder is superior to some of the most recently

particular, we study three different cosmological models: the $\Lambda$ Cold
Dark Matter model, the Logotropic universe and a bulk viscous matter-dominated

probe, we found that the predicted number of events computed with the best fit

model are the same, while a bulk viscous matter-dominated cosmological model
predicts $\sim 3$ times more events. We show that the current limit set by
Super-Kamiokande on the diffuse supernova neutrino background flux gives
complementary constraints on the free parameters of a bulk viscous
matter-dominated universe. Furthermore, this limit implies, within a $\Lambda$
Cold Dark Matter model, that the universe should be expanding with $H_0 > 21.5

well-being. These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended
wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify.
Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is
characterized by long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in cortex, which are
supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks.
  Here we assess LRTCs in resting state human EEG data during a 40-hour sleep
deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the
scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from EEG amplitude
fluctuations. We find with both measures that LRTCs decline as sleep
deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in
signal power into appropriate consideration.
  Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain LRTCs in the
human brain. In complex networks, LRTCs naturally emerge in the vicinity of a
critical state. The observation of declining LRTCs during wake thus provides
additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks
towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.

long-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended
periods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision-making and

characterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations; detailed measurements
of neuronal timescales that support this view, however, have so far been
lacking. Here we show that the long timescales measured at the individual
neuron level in freely-behaving rats during the awake state are abrogated
during non-REM (NREM) sleep. We provide evidence for the existence of two
distinct states in terms of timescale dynamics in cortex: one which is
characterized by long timescales which dominate during wake and REM sleep, and
a second one characterized by the absence of long-range temporal correlations
which characterizes NREM sleep. We observe that both timescale regimes can
co-exist and, in combination, lead to an apparent gradual decline of long
timescales during extended wake which is restored after sleep. Our results
provide a missing link between the observed long timescales in individual
neuron fluctuations during wake and the reported absence of long-term
correlations during deep sleep in EEG and fMRI studies. They furthermore
suggest a network-level function of sleep, to reorganize cortical networks
towards states governed by slow cortex dynamics to ensure optimal function for
the time awake.

threshold---which we referred to as a metal-insulator phase
transition---between an exponential growth and a low photon production. The low
photon production is due to Bloch-like oscillations that produce a strong
localization of the initial vacuum state, thus preventing higher generation of
photons. To break localization of the vacuum state, and enhance the photon
generation, we impose a dephasing mechanism, based on dynamic disorder, into
the driving frequency of the mirror. Additionally, we explore the effects of
finite temperature on the photon production. Concurrently, we propose a
classical analogue of the dynamical Casimir effect in engineered photonic
lattices, where the propagation of classical light emulates the photon
generation from the quantum vacuum of a single-mode tunable cavity.

fills its Roche lobe after core helium burning is completed and donates helium
on its thermal timescale to the WD, $\dot{M}\approx3\times10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr,
a rate high enough that the accreting helium burns stably on the WD. The
accumulated carbon/oxygen ashes from the helium burning undergo an unstable
shell flash that initiates an inwardly moving carbon burning flame. This flame
is only quenched when it runs out of carbon at the surface of the original O/Ne
core. Subsequent accumulation of fresh carbon/oxygen layers also undergo
thermal instabilities, but no mass loss is triggered, allowing $M_{\rm

O/Ne WDs, and then, under continuing mass transfer, lead to AIC. Studies of the

to elastic nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering and the deuteron breakup process at
the lab. nucleon energies up to 135 MeV. The formalism of the Faddeev equations
is used to obtain 3N scattering states. We compare predictions based on the
JISP16 force with data and with results based on various NN interactions: the
CD Bonn, the AV18, the chiral force with the semi-local regularization at the
5th order of the chiral expansion and with low-momentum interactions obtained
from the CD Bonn force as well as with the predictions from the combination of
the AV18 NN interaction and the Urbana IX 3N force. JISP16 provides a
satisfactory description of some observables at low energies but strong
deviations from data as well as from standard and chiral potential predictions
with increasing energy. However, there are also polarization observables at low
energies for which the JISP16 predictions differ from those based on the other
forces by a factor of two. The reason for such a behavior can be traced back to
the P-wave components of the JISP16 force. At higher energies the deviations
can be enhanced by an interference with higher partial waves and by the
properties of the JISP16 deuteron wave function. In addition, we compare the
energy and angular dependence of predictions based on the JISP16 force with the
results of the low-momentum forces obtained with different values of the
momentum cutoff parameter. We found that such low-momentum forces can be
employed to interpret the Nd elastic scattering data only below some specific
energy which depends on the cutoff parameter. Since JISP16 is defined in a
finite oscillator basis, it has properties similar to low momentum interactions
and its application to the description of Nd scattering data is limited to a
low momentum transfer region.

  Processor Implementations",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a renowned technique to hide the access patterns of
an application to an untrusted memory. According to the standard ORAM
definition presented by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, two ORAM access sequences must
be computationally indistinguishable if the lengths of these sequences are
identically distributed. An artifact of this definition is that it does not
apply to modern ORAM implementations adapted in current secure processors
technology because of their arbitrary lengths of memory access sequences
depending on programs' behaviors (their termination times). As a result, the
ORAM definition does not directly apply; the theoretical foundations of ORAM do
not clearly argue about the timing and termination channels.
  This paper conducts a first rigorous study of the standard
Goldreich-Ostrovsky ORAM definition in view of modern practical ORAMs (e.g.,
Path ORAM) and demonstrates the gap between theoretical foundations and real
implementations. A new ORAM formulation which clearly separates out termination
channel leakage is proposed. It is shown how this definition implies the
standard ORAM definition (for finite length input access sequences) and better
fits the modern practical ORAM implementations. The proposed definition relaxes
the constraints around the stash size and overflow probability for Path ORAM,
and essentially transforms its security argument into a performance
consideration problem.
  Finally, a `strong' ORAM formulation which clearly includes obfuscation of
termination leakage is shown to imply our new ORAM formulation and applies to
ORAM for outsourced disk storage. In this strong formulation constraints are
not relaxed and the security argument for Path ORAM remains complex as one
needs to prove that the stash overflows with negligible probability.

analysis of the fractal dimension of the largest cluster frontier provides
evidence that this regime is reminiscent of gradient percolation. By increasing
further the confining potential, most of the particles coalesce in a giant
cluster, and we observe a regime where the jump size distribution takes the
form of a power law. The onset of this second regime is signaled by a maximum
in the fluctuation of energy.

plane waves for the description of gravitational waves. Mathematically, it
becomes equivalent to a problem on the Euclidean plane ${\mathbb R}^2$ with a
very simple formulation in Classical Mechanics: given a non-necessarily
autonomous potential $V(z,u)$, $(z,u)\in {\mathbb R}^2\times {\mathbb R}$,
harmonic in $z$ (i.e. source-free), the trajectories of its associated
dynamical system $\ddot{z}(s)=-\nabla_z V(z(s),s)$ are complete (they live
eternally) if and only if $V(z,u)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree at most $2$
(so that $V$ is a standard mathematical idealization of vacuum). Here, the
conjecture is solved in the significative case that $V$ is bounded polynomially
in $z$ for finite values of $u\in {\mathbb R}$. The mathematical and physical
implications of this {\em polynomial EK conjecture}, as well as the
non-polynomial one, are discussed beyond their original scope.

in phononic crystals and suggest a computationally efficient strategy to
distinguish them from normal cross points. This process is essential for the
correct sorting of the phononic bands and, subsequently, for the accurate
determination of mode continuation, group velocities, and emergent properties
which depend on them such as thermal conductivity. Through explicit phononic
calculations using generalized Rayleigh quotient, we identify exact locations
of exceptional points in the complex wavenumber domain which results in level
repulsion in the real domain. We show that in the vicinity of the exceptional
point the relevant phononic eigenvalue surfaces resemble the surfaces of a 2 by
2 parameter-dependent matrix. Along a closed loop encircling the exceptional
point we show that the phononic eigenvalues are exchanged, just as they are for
the 2 by 2 matrix case. However, the behavior of the associated eigenvectors is
shown to be more complex in the phononic case. Along a closed loop around an
exceptional point, we show that the eigenvectors can flip signs multiple times
unlike a 2 by 2 matrix where the flip of sign occurs only once. Finally, we
exploit these eigenvector sign flips around exceptional points to propose a
simple and efficient method of distinguishing them from normal crosses and of
correctly sorting the band-structure. Our proposed method is roughly an
order-of magnitude faster than the zoom-in method and correctly identifies >
97% of the cases considered. Both its speed and accuracy can be further
improved and we suggest some ways of achieving this. Our method is general and,
as such, would be directly applicable to other eigenvalue problems where the
eigenspectrum needs to be correctly sorted.

probability density function does not cover non-modal behavior as well as the
CR hazard rate function (hrf) assumes only one form. To outperform this
difficulty, we introduce an extended CR model, called exponentiated

decreasing, decreasing-increasing-decreasing and upside-down bathtub forms. In
this paper, several closed-form mathematical expressions for the ECR model are

performance of estimators. An application to survival time of heart problem

ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves. The pulsar data sets are affected by
numerous noise processes including varying dispersive delays in the
interstellar medium and from the solar wind. The solar wind can lead to rapidly
changing variations that, with existing telescopes, can be hard to measure and
then remove. In this paper we study the possibility of using a low frequency
telescope to aid in such correction for the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA)
and also discuss whether the ultra-wide-bandwidth receiver for the FAST
telescope is sufficient to model the solar wind variations. Our key result is
that a single wide-bandwidth receiver can be used to model and remove the
effect of the solar wind. However, for pulsars that pass close to the Sun such
as PSR J1022+1022, the solar wind is so variable that observations at two
telescopes separated by a day are insufficient to correct the solar wind
effect.

a controlled environment, e.g., using a tripod and direct current (DC) light
sources, reduces camera movements and minimizes light fluctuations; we aim to
reduce the external factors as much as possible. The acquired video is then
stabilized and a proposed algorithm used to reduce the illumination variations.
Lastly, the Euler magnification is utilized to magnify the color changes on the
light invariant video. The proposed system does not require any special purpose
instruments as it uses a digital camera with a regular frame rate. The results
of magnified color changes on both natural and plastic leaves show that the
live green leaves have color changes in contrast to the plastic leaves. Hence,
we can argue that the color changes of the leaves are due to biological
operations, such as photosynthesis. To date, this is possibly the first work

joining unbendable plates. For applications to mechanical design and
self-folding structures, it is essential to understand the interplay between
the set of folds in the unfolded origami and the possible 3D folded
configurations. When deforming a structure that has been folded, one can often
linearize the geometric constraints, but the degeneracy of the unfolded state
makes a linear approach impossible there. We derive a theory for the
second-order infinitesimal rigidity of an initially unfolded triangulated
origami structure and use it to study the set of nearly-unfolded configurations
of origami with four boundary vertices. We find that locally, this set consists
of a number of distinct ""branches"" which intersect at the unfolded state, and
that the number of these branches is exponential in the number of vertices. We
find numerical and analytical evidence that suggests that the branches are
characterized by choosing each internal vertex to either ""pop up"" or ""pop
down"". The large number of pathways along which one can fold an
initially-unfolded origami structure strongly indicate that a generic structure
is likely to become trapped in a ""misfolded"" state. Thus, new techniques for
creating self-folding origami are likely necessary; controlling the popping
state of the vertices may be one possibility.

suppress its interaction with the thermal phonon bath. Strain control allows
for both an impressive range of optical tunability and significantly improved

achieve strong coupling between the SiV spin and single phonons, which can lead

remains still poorly understood. Via a combination of precision experiments on
elastomeric spherical bilayer shells, simulations, and theory, we show a
spontaneous curvature-induced rotational symmetry-breaking as well as a
snapping instability reminiscent of the Venus fly trap closure mechanism. The
instabilities and their dependence on geometry are rationalized by reducing the
spontaneous curvature to an effective mechanical load. This formulation reveals
a combined pressurelike bulk term and a torquelike boundary term, allowing
scaling predictions for the instabilities in excellent agreement with
experiments and simulations. Moreover, the effective pressure analogy suggests
a curvature-induced buckling in closed shells. We determine the critical
buckling curvature via a linear stability analysis that accounts for the
combination of residual membrane and bending stresses. The prominent role of

galaxies has been studied previously by the ""Multiphase Galaxy Halos"" survey,
where the kinematics and absorption properties of the CGM have been
investigated. We extend these studies to group environments. We define a galaxy
group to have two or more galaxies having a line-of-sight velocity difference
of no more than 1000 km/s and located within 350 kpc (projected) of a
background quasar sightline. We identified a total of six galaxy groups
associated with OVI absorption $W_{\rm r}>0.06$ {\AA} that have a median
redshift of $\langle z_{\rm gal} \rangle = 0.1669$ and a median impact
parameter of $\langle D \rangle = 134.1$ kpc. An additional 12 non-absorbing
groups were identified with a median redshift of $\langle z_{\rm gal} \rangle =
0.2690$ and a median impact parameter of $\langle D \rangle = 274.0$ kpc. We
find the average equivalent width to be smaller for group galaxies than for
isolated galaxies $(3\sigma)$. However, the covering fractions are consistent
with both samples. We used the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function
method and find that the velocity spread of OVI in the CGM of group galaxies is
significantly narrower than that of isolated galaxies $(10\sigma)$. We suggest
that the warm/hot CGM does not exist as a superposition of halos, instead, the
virial temperature of the halo is hot enough for OVI to be further ionised. The
remaining OVI likely exists at the interface between hot, diffuse gas and
cooler regions of the CGM.

around a few deka-keV, that cannot be explained by isotropic albedo or
non-uniform ionization alone. We identify these breaks at the HXR peak time,
but we obtain 8 s-cadence spectra of the entire impulsive phase. Electrons with
an initially power-law distribution and a sharp low-energy cutoff lose energy
through return-current losses until they reach the thick target, where they
lose their remaining energy through collisions. Our main results are: (1) The
return-current collisional thick-target model (RCCTTM) provides acceptable fits
for spectra with strong breaks. (2) Limits on the plasma resistivity are
derived from the fitted potential drop and deduced electron-beam flux density,
assuming the return-current is a drift current in the ambient plasma. These
resistivities are typically 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer
resistivity at the fitted temperature, and provide a test for the adequacy of
classical resistivity and the stability of the return current. (3) Using the
upper limit of the low-energy cutoff, the return current is always stable to
the generation of ion acoustic and electrostatic ion cyclotron instabilities
when the electron temperature is lower than 9 times the ion temperature. (4) In
most cases the return current is most likely primarily carried by runaway
electrons from the tail of the thermal distribution rather than the bulk
drifting thermal electrons. For these cases, anomalous resistivity is not
required.

X-ray flux variation that can be observed using RXTE ASM, Swift BAT, and MAXI.
The spin-up rate over the entire dataset is consistent with previously reported
values; however, the local spin-up rate is considerably higher. The
corresponding local spin-up timescale is comparable to the local spin-up rate
of OAO 1657-415, indicating that 4U 0114+650 could also have a transient disk.
Moreover, the spin period evolution shows two ~1000-day spin-down/random-walk
epochs that appeared together with depressions of the superorbital modulation
amplitude. This implies that the superorbital modulation was closely related to
the presence of the accretion disk, which is not favored in the
spin-down/random-walk epochs because the accretion is dominated by the direct
wind accretion.The orbital period is stable during the entire time span;
however, the orbital profile changes with time significantly. We found that the
depth of the dip near the inferior conjunction of the companion is highly
variable, which disfavors the eclipsing scenario. Moreover, the dip was less
obvious during the spin-down/random-walk epochs, indicating its correlation
with the accretion disk. Further monitoring in both X-ray and optical bands

initialisation of all filters in all layers which severely reduces the forward
signal and back-propagated error and leads to slow and sub-optimal training.
Techniques that counter that focus on either increasing the signal or
increasing the gradients adaptively but the model behaves very differently at
the beginning of training compared to later when stable pathways through the
net have been established. To compound this problem the effective minibatch
size varies greatly between layers at different depths and between individual
filters as activation sparsity typically increases with depth leading to a
reduction in effective learning rate since gradients may superpose rather than
add and this further compounds the covariate shift problem as deeper neurons
are less able to adapt to upstream shift.
  Proposed here is a method of automatic gain control of the signal built into
each convolutional neuron that achieves equivalent or superior performance than
batch normalisation and is compatible with single sample or minibatch gradient
descent. The same model is used both for training and inference.
  The technique comprises a scaled per sample map mean subtraction from the raw
convolutional filter output followed by scaling of the difference.

convolutional neural networks (CNN), going smaller for CNN has received
increasing attention recently due to its attractiveness for mobile/embedded
applications. It remains an active and important topic how to design a small
network while retaining the performance of large and deep CNNs (e.g., Inception
Nets, ResNets). Albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the
size of CNNs, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in
many designs. This paper addresses this concern with several new contributions.
First, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep
CNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most
previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different
treatments of $1\times 1$ convolutions and $k\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$),
where we only binarize $k\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. The
resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show
that previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be
compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of
the different functionalities of $1\times 1$ (data projection/transformation)
and $k\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block
structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature
maps generated by $1\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps
generated by $k\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network
with $\sim 1$ million parameters. Combining with our parameter binarization, we
achieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks
including recently released Google MobileNets.

discrepancies mainly come from the numerical convergence, which is the first
detailed benchmark of four independent numerical approaches for gyrokinetic

interchange mode are on the same branch in Z-pinch, and the entropy mode can
have both electron and ion branches. And, at strong gradient, more than one
eigenstate of the ion temperature gradient mode (ITG) can be unstable and the
most unstable one can be on non-ground eigenstates. The propagation of ITGs
from ion to electron diamagnetic direction at strong gradient is also observed,
which implies that the propagation direction is not a decisive criterion for

common in recently established populations. Earlier studies have suggested that
this pattern arises from natural selection favouring asexual recruitment in
young populations. Alternatively, as we show here, this pattern may result from
stochastic processes during species-range expansions. We model a dioecious
species expanding into a new area in which all individuals are capable of both
sexual and asexual reproduction, and all individuals have equal survival rates
and dispersal distances. Even under conditions that eventually favour sexual
recruitment, colonisation starts with an asexual wave. Long after colonisation
is completed, a sexual wave erodes clonal dominance. If individuals reproduce
more than one season, and with only local dispersal, a few large clones
typically dominate for thousands of reproductive seasons. Adding occasional
long-distance dispersal, more dominant clones emerge, but they persist for a
shorter period of time. The general mechanism involved is simple: edge effects
at the expansion front favour asexual (uniparental) recruitment where potential
mates are rare. Specifically, our stochastic model makes detailed predictions
different from a selection model, and comparing these with empirical data from
a postglacially established seaweed species (Fucus radicans) shows that in this
case a stochastic mechanism is strongly supported.

candidates amongst eclipsing binaries (EB) observed by the CoRoT spacecraft. We
calculate and check eclipse timing variation (ETV) diagrams for almost 1500 EBs
in an automated manner. We identify five relatively short-period Algol systems
for which our combined light curve and complex ETV analyses (including both the
light-travel time effect and short-term dynamical third-body perturbations)
resulted in consistent third-body solutions. The computed periods of the outer
bodies are between 82 and 272 days, (with an alternative solution of 831 days
for one of the targets). We find that the inner and outer orbits are near
coplanar in all but one case. The dynamical masses of the outer subsystems
determined from the ETV analyses are consistent with both the results of our
light curve analyses and the spectroscopic information available in the
literature. One of our candidate systems exhibits outer eclipsing events as
well, the locations of which are in good agreement with the ETV solution. We
also report another certain triply eclipsing triple system which, however, is
lacking a reliable ETV solution due to the very short time range of the data,
and four new blended systems (composite light curves of 2 eclipsing binaries
each), where we cannot decide whether the components are gravitationally binded
or not. Amongst these blended systems we identify the longest period and
highest eccentricity eclipsing binary in the entire CoRoT sample.

semi-rigidity assumption which requires that the areas of the outermost trapped
surfaces are preserved. We argue that the condition that the area of the event
horizon should not decrease is necessary -but not sufficient- for the
semi-rigidity assumption to hold. It is known that the presence of a naked
singularity in the exterior region invalidates Hawking's proof of the area
theorem. In this sense, the third law assumes the validity of the strong form
of the cosmic censorship conjecture, contrary to general acceptance. Still, one
cannot guarantee that the semi-rigidity assumption holds. Therefore the current
proof is incomplete. Recent studies on the interactions of black holes with
fermionic fields imply a generic formation of naked singularities. The presence
of these singularities invalidates the laws of black hole dynamics and cosmic
censorship conjecture for the processes that satisfy the weak energy condition.

However, foams are known to undergo a jamming transition from a fluid-like to a
solid-like state at an intermediate gas fraction,$\phi_c$. Much less is known
about coarsening dynamics in wet foams near jamming, and the link to mechanical
response, if any, remains poorly understood. Here, we probe coarsening and
mechanical response using numerical simulations of a variant of the Durian
bubble model for wet foams. As in other coarsening systems we find a steady
state scaling regime with an associated particle size distribution. We relate
the time-rate of evolution of the coarsening process to the wetness of the foam
and identify a characteristic coarsening time that diverges approaching
jamming. We further probe mechanical response of the system to strain while
undergoing coarsening. There are two competing time scales, namely the
coarsening time and the mechanical relaxation time. We relate these to the
evolution of the elastic response and the mechanical structure.

generated by the coefficients of the polynomial.
  In this article, we describe, analyze and compare both from the theoretical
and practical points of view, two algorithms computing such a weighted sums of
squares decomposition for univariate polynomials with rational coefficients.
  The first algorithm, due to the third author relies on real root isolation,
quadratic approximations of positive polynomials and square-free decomposition
but its complexity was not analyzed. We provide bit complexity estimates, both
on runtime and output size of this algorithm. They are exponential in the
degree of the input univariate polynomial and linear in the maximum bitsize of
its complexity. This analysis is obtained using quantifier elimination and root
isolation bounds.
  The second algorithm, due to Chevillard, Harrison, Joldes and Lauter, relies
on complex root isolation and square-free decomposition and has been introduced
for certifying positiveness of polynomials in the context of computer
arithmetics. Again, its complexity was not analyzed. We provide bit complexity
estimates, both on runtime and output size of this algorithm, which are
polynomial in the degree of the input polynomial and linear in the maximum
bitsize of its complexity. This analysis is obtained using Vieta's formula and
root isolation bounds.
  Finally, we report on our implementations of both algorithms. While the
second algorithm is, as expected from the complexity result, more efficient on
most of examples, we exhibit families of non-negative polynomials for which the
first algorithm is better.

introduced. Its defining principle is that universally and existentially
quantified variables may not occur together in atoms. SF properly generalizes
both the Bernays-Sch\""onfinkel-Ramsey (BSR) fragment and the relational monadic
fragment. In this paper the restrictions on variable occurrences in SF
sentences are relaxed such that universally and existentially quantified
variables may occur together in the same atom under certain conditions. Still,
satisfiability can be decided. This result is established in two ways: firstly,
by an effective equivalence-preserving translation into the BSR fragment, and,
secondly, by a model-theoretic argument.
  Slight modifications to the described concepts facilitate the definition of
other decidable classes of first-order sentences. The paper presents a second
fragment which is novel, has a decidable satisfiability problem, and properly
contains the Ackermann fragment and---once more---the relational monadic
fragment. The definition is again characterized by restrictions on the
occurrences of variables in atoms. More precisely, after certain
transformations, Skolemization yields only unary functions and constants, and
every atom contains at most one universally quantified variable. An effective
satisfiability-preserving translation into the monadic fragment is devised and
employed to prove decidability of the associated satisfiability problem.

along the nodal line and the line-node semimetal would evolve into a

density $f$. Let $\tilde{F}$ be the distribution function of $X_1 - X_2$,
$X_i\sim F,\, i=1,2,\text{ iid}$. We show that for a critical Hawkes process
with displacement density (= `excitement function' = `decay kernel') $f$, the
random walk induced by $\tilde{F}$ is necessarily transient. Our conjecture is
that this condition is also sufficient for existence of a critical Hawkes
process. Our train of thought relies on the interpretation of critical Hawkes
processes as cluster-invariant point processes. From this property, we identify
the law of critical Hawkes processes as a limit of independent cluster
operations. We establish uniqueness, stationarity, and infinite divisibility.
Furthermore, we provide various constructions: a Poisson embedding, a
representation as Hawkes process with renewal immigration, and a backward
construction yielding a Palm version of the critical Hawkes process. We give
specific examples of the constructions, where $F$ is regularly varying with
tail index $\alpha\in(0,0.5)$. Finally, we propose to encode the genealogical
structure of a critical Hawkes process with Kesten (size-biased) trees. The
presented methods lay the grounds for the open discussion of multitype critical
Hawkes processes as well as of critical integer-valued autoregressive time

three fully convective M dwarfs with similar rotation rates. We secured high
cadence spectral time series observations of the 5.5 AU separation binary GJ
65, comprising GJ 65A (M5.5V, Prot = 0.24 d) and GJ 65B (M6V, Prot = 0.23 d).
We also present new observations of GJ 791.2A (M4.5V, Prot = 0.31 d).
Observations of each star were made on two nights with UVES, covering a
wavelength range from 0.64 - 1.03 microns. The time series spectra reveal
multiple line distortions, which we interpret as cool starspots and which are
persistent on both nights suggesting stability on the timescale of 3 days.
Spots are recovered with resolutions down to 8.3 degs at the equator. The
global spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar to observations made a year
earlier. Similar high latitude and circumpolar spot structure is seen on
GJ791.2A and GJ 65A. However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which
instead reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at intermediate
latitudes. All three stars show small amplitude latitude-dependent rotation
that is consistent with solid body rotation. We compare our measurements of
differential rotation with previous Doppler imaging studies and discuss the
results in the wider context of other observational estimates and recent
theoretical predictions.

estimator is based on an importance sampling strategy that hinges on the
heavy-tailed sample path large deviations result recently established in Rhee,
Blanchet, and Zwart (2016). The new estimators are straightforward to implement
and can be used to systematically evaluate the probability of a wide range of
rare events with bounded relative error. They are ""universal"" in the sense that
a single importance sampling scheme applies to a very general class of rare
events that arise in heavy-tailed systems. In particular, our estimators can
deal with rare events that are caused by multiple big jumps (therefore, beyond
the usual principle of a single big jump) as well as multidimensional processes
such as the buffer content process of a queueing network. We illustrate the
versatility of our approach with several applications that arise in the context
of mathematical finance, actuarial science, and queueing theory.

constraints for identifying a linear multi-input multi-output system. It is
assumed that the nominal system parameters are specified. The key idea is to
use the spectral decomposition theorem and write the power spectrum as
$\phi_{u}(j\omega)=\frac{1}{2}H(j\omega)H^*(j\omega)$. The matrix $H(j\omega)$
is expressed in terms of a truncated basis for
$\mathcal{L}^2\left(\left[-\omega_{\mbox{cut-off}},\omega_{\mbox{cut-off}}\right]\right)$.
With this parameterization, the elements of the Fisher Information Matrix and
the power constraints turn out to be homogeneous quadratics in the basis
coefficients. The optimality criterion used are the well-known
$\mathcal{D}-$optimality, $\mathcal{A}-$optimality, $\mathcal{T}-$optimality
and $\mathcal{E}-$optimality. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex
in general. A lower bound on the optimum is obtained through a bi-linear
formulation of the problem, while an upper bound is obtained through a convex
relaxation. These bounds can be computed efficiently as the associated problems
are convex. The lower bound is used as a sub-optimal solution, the
sub-optimality of which is determined by the difference in the bounds.
Interestingly, the bounds match in many instances and thus, the global optimum
is achieved. A discussion on the non-convexity of the optimization problem is
also presented. Simulations are provided for corroboration.

scenario to explicitly break an $S^{}_{3{\rm L}} \times S^{}_{3{\rm R}}$ flavor
symmetry in the leptonic sector. It turns out that the leptonic flavor mixing
matrix is completely determined by the mass ratios of charged leptons (i.e.,
$m^{}_e/m^{}_\mu$ and $m^{}_\mu/m^{}_\tau$) and those of light neutrinos (i.e.,
$m^{}_1/m^{}_2$ and $m^{}_2/m^{}_3$). The latest global-fit results of three
neutrino mixing angles $\{\theta^{}_{12}, \theta^{}_{13}, \theta^{}_{23}\}$ and
two neutrino mass-squared differences $\{\Delta m^2_{21}, \Delta m^2_{31}\}$ at
the $3\sigma$ level are used to constrain the parameter space of
$\{m^{}_1/m^{}_2, m^{}_2/m^{}_3\}$. The predictions for the mass spectrum and
flavor mixing are highlighted: (1) The neutrino mass spectrum shows a
hierarchical pattern and a normal ordering, e.g., $m^{}_1 \approx 2.2~{\rm
meV}$, $m^{}_2 \approx 8.8~{\rm meV}$ and $m^{}_3 \approx 52.7~{\rm meV}$; (2)
Only the first octant of $\theta^{}_{23}$ is allowed, namely, $41.8^\circ
\lesssim \theta^{}_{23} \lesssim 43.3^\circ$; (3) The Dirac CP-violating phase
$\delta \approx -22^\circ$ deviates significantly from the maximal value
$-90^\circ$. All these predictions are ready to be tested in the ongoing and
forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry can be explained via resonant
leptogenesis, including the individual lepton-flavor effects. In our scenario,
the leptonic CP violation at low- and high-energy scales are closely connected.

techniques in these latter works were shown not to generalize to larger cycles
$C_k$ with $k\geq 5$. In this paper, we completely settle the problem of cycle

exists a distributed property testing algorithm for $C_k$-freeness, performing
in a constant number of rounds. All these results hold in the classical CONGEST

round-complexity is $O(1/\epsilon)$ where $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ is the property

these algorithms tend to have large input and output dimensionalities that
dominate their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, due to the
limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile
devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom
embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output
of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded
instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously
compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some
cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up
to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4
alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of
further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as 'on-the-fly' constant-time
operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the
fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or
training configuration.

that ""global"" tasks such as minimum spanning tree, diameter, and all-pairs
shortest paths, consume large bandwidth, for their running-time is
$\Omega(\mbox{poly}(n))$ rounds in $n$-node networks with constant diameter.
Surprisingly, ""local"" tasks such as detecting the presence of a 4-cycle as a

randomized algorithms, and the best known upper bound for detecting the
presence of a 3-cycle is $\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$ rounds. The objective
of this paper is to better understand the landscape of such subgraph detection
tasks. We show that, in contrast to \emph{cycles}, which are hard to detect in
the CONGEST model, there exists a deterministic algorithm for detecting the
presence of a subgraph isomorphic to $T$ running in a \emph{constant} number of
rounds, for every tree $T$. Our algorithm provides a distributed implementation
of a combinatorial technique due to Erd\H{o}s et al. for sparsening the set of
partial solutions kept by the nodes at each round. Our result has important
consequences to \emph{distributed property-testing}, i.e., to randomized
algorithms whose aim is to distinguish between graphs satisfying a property,
and graphs far from satisfying that property. In particular, we get that, for
every graph pattern $H$ composed of an edge and a tree connected in an
arbitrary manner, there exists a distributed testing algorithm for
$H$-freeness, performing in a constant number of rounds. Although the class of
graph patterns $H$ formed by a tree and an edge connected arbitrarily may look
artificial, all previous results of the literature concerning testing
$H$-freeness for classical patterns such as cycles and cliques can be viewed as
direct consequences of our result, while our algorithm enables testing more

multimedia effect, but instead an effect to confirm statements that were
accompanied by graphs, irrespective of whether these statements were true or
false. Eye movement and verbal data shed light on this surprising finding.
Students looked proportionally less at the text and the problem statement when
a graph was present. Moreover, they experienced more mental effort with the
graph, as indicated by more silent pauses in thinking aloud. Hence, students
actively processed the graphs. This, however, was not sufficient. Further
analysis revealed that the more students looked at the statement, the better
they performed. Thus, in the multimedia condition the graph drew students'
attention and cognitive capacities away from focusing on the statement. A good
alternative strategy in the multimedia condition was to frequently look between
graph and problem statement, and thus to integrate their information. In
conclusion, graphs influence where students look and what they process, and may
even mislead them into believing accompanying information. Thus, teachers and
textbook designers should be very critical on when to use graphs and carefully
consider how the graphs are integrated with other parts of the problem.

parameters in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. However, the
relation among these is still a matter of debate for luminous infrared
galaxies, which carry a bulk of SFR budget of the universe at $z\sim1$. We have
investigated the relation among stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and
SFR of AKARI-detected mid-IR galaxies at $z\sim0.88$ in the AKARI NEP deep
field. We observed about 350 AKARI sources with Subaru/FMOS NIR spectrograph,
and detected secure and expected H$\alpha$ emission lines from 25 and 44
galaxies, respectively. The SFR of our sample is almost constant ($\sim
25M_{\odot}/yr$) over the stellar mass range of our sample. Compared with
main-sequence (MS) galaxies at a similar redshift range, the average SFR of our
detected sample is comparable for massive galaxies
($\sim10^{10.58}~M_{\odot}$), while higher by $\sim$0.6dex for less massive
galaxies ($\sim 10^{10.05}~M_{\odot}$). We measure metallicities from the
[NII]/H$\alpha$ emission line ratio.
  We find that the mass-metallicity relation of our individually measured
sources agrees with that for optical-selected star-forming galaxies at
$z\sim0.1$, while metallicities of stacked spectra agree with that of MS
galaxies at $z\sim0.78$. Considering high SFR of individually measured sources,
FMR of the IR galaxies is different from that at $z\sim0.1$. However, on the
mass-metallicity plane, they are consistent with the MS galaxies, highlighting
higher SFR of the IR galaxies. This suggests the evolutionary path of our IR
galaxies is different from that of MS galaxies. A possible physical
interpretation includes that the star-formation activities of IR galaxies at
$z\sim0.88$ in our sample are enhanced by interaction and/or merger of
galaxies, but the inflow of metal-poor gas is not yet induced, keeping the
metallicity intact.

on moving away from hand-chosen inference algorithms and towards learned

interpreted as a recurrent neural network (RNN) which allows for joint learning
of model and inference parameters with back-propagation through time. In this
framework, the RNN architecture is directly derived from a hand-chosen

learning framework, called Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), in which we turn
algorithm construction the other way round: Given data and a task, train an RNN
to learn an inference algorithm. Because RNNs are Turing complete [1, 2] they
are capable to implement any inference algorithm. The framework allows for an
abstraction which removes the need for domain knowledge. We demonstrate in

stage of galaxy mergers, from kpc to pc scales. In particular, we capture the
formation of the binary, a necessary step before the final coalescence, and
trace back the main processes causing the decay of the orbit. We use
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers with different resolutions, from
$20\,\rm pc$ down to $1\,\rm pc$, in order to study the effects of the
resolution on our results, remove numerical effects, and assess that resolving
the influence radius of the orbiting black hole is a minimum condition to fully
capture the formation of the binary. Our simulations include the relevant
physical processes, namely star formation, supernova feedback, accretion onto
the black holes and the ensuing feedback. We find that, in these mergers,
dynamical friction from the smooth stellar component of the nucleus is the main
process that drives black holes from kpc to pc scales. Gas does not play a
crucial role and even clumps do not induce scattering or perturb the orbits. We
compare the time needed for the formation of the binary to analytical
predictions and suggest how to apply such analytical formalism to obtain
estimates of binary formation times in lower resolution simulations.

curves space-time and thus deforms lightlike geodesics, giving rise to
gravitational lensing. This phenomenon is well understood in the case of the
Schwarzschild metric, and has been accurately described in the past; however,
lensing in the Kerr space-time has received less attention in the literature
despite potential practical observational applications. In particular, lensing
in such space is not expressible as the gradient of a scalar potential and as
such is a source of curl-like signatures and an asymmetric shear pattern. In
this paper, we develop a differentiable lensing map in the Kerr metric,
reworking and extending previous approaches. By using standard tools of weak
gravitational lensing, we isolate and quantify the distortion that is uniquely
induced by the presence of angular momentum in the metric. We apply this
framework to the distortion induced by a Kerr-like foreground object on a
distribution of background of sources. We verify that the new unique lensing
signature is orders of magnitude below current observational bounds for a range
of lens configurations.

investigated with the focus on coherent structures in the form of travelling
waves on the film surface, in particular, single-hump solitary pulses and their
interactions. The flow structures are analysed first using a long-wave model,
which is valid in the presence of weak inertia, and second using the Stokes
equations. For obtuse angles, gravity is destablising and solitary pulses exist
even in the absence of an electric field. For acute angles, spatially
non-uniform solutions exist only beyond a critical value of the electric field
strength; moreover, solitary-pulse solutions are present only at sufficiently
high supercritical elec- tric field strengths. The electric field increases the
amplitude of the pulses, can generate recirculation zones in the humps, and
alters the far-field decay of the pulse tails from ex- ponential to algebraic
with a significant impact on pulse interactions. A weak-interaction theory
predicts an infinite sequence of bound-state solutions for non-electrified
flow, and a finite set for electrified flow. The existence of single-hump pulse
solutions and two-pulse bound states is confirmed for the Stokes equations via
boundary-element computations. In addition, the electric field is shown to
trigger a switch from absolute instability to convective instability, thereby
regularising the dynamics, and this is confirmed by time- dependent simulations
of the long-wave model.

from a single galaxy which is both complete and has a large number of objects

if its boundary is a union of confocal conical arcs and appropriate geodesic
segments. We also present a complexification of these results. These are joint
results of Mikhail Bialy, Andrey Mironov and the author. The proof is split
into two parts. The first part is given by Bialy and Mironov in their two joint
papers. They considered the tautological projection of the boundary to
$\mathbb{RP}^2$ and studied its orthogonal-polar dual curve, which is piecewise
algebraic, by S.V.Bolotin's theorem. By their arguments and another Bolotin's
theorem, it suffices to show that each non-linear complex irreducible component
of the dual curve is a conic. They have proved that all its singularities and
inflection points (if any) lie in the projectivized zero locus of the
corresponding quadratic form on $\mathbb C^3$. The present paper provides the
second part of the proof: we show that each above irreducible component is a
conic and finish the solution of the Algebraic Birkhoff Conjecture in constant
curvature.

Unfortunately, the results are not only inconclusive, but seem to suggest that

galaxies with thick and thin discs. Similar to thin-disc-only models, galaxies
with appropriate non-axisymmetric structures reproduce observational
constraints on radial disc heating in and migration to the Solar Neighbourhood
(Snhd). The presence of thick discs can suppress non-axisymmetries and thus
higher baryonic-to-dark matter fractions are required than in models that only
have a thin disc. Models that are baryon-dominated to roughly the Solar radius
R_0 are favoured, in agreement with data for the Milky Way. For inside-out
growing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards
migrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators
depends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.
There is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars
born in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the
fading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0. Our models compare well to Snhd
kinematics from RAVE-TGAS. For such comparisons it is important to take into
account the azimuthal variation of kinematics at R ~ R_0 and biases from survey
selection functions. The vertical heating of thin disc stars by giant molecular
clouds is only mildly affected by the presence of thick discs. Our models
predict higher vertical velocity dispersions for the oldest stars than found in
the Snhd age-velocity dispersion relation, possibly because of measurement
uncertainties or an underestimation of the number of old cold stars in our
models.

by two means: (a) manually written details of each PT trip during the day, and
(b) measurements using sensors of travellers' mobile devices. The manual log is
used to cross-check and verify the results derived from automatic measurements.
The mobile client application used for our data collection provides a fully
automated measurement service and implements a set of algorithms for decreasing
battery consumption. The live locations of some of the public transport
vehicles in the region were made available by the local transport provider and
sampled with a 30-second interval. The stopping times of local trains at
stations during the day were retrieved from the railway operator. The static
timetable information of all the PT vehicles operating in the area is made

is to correctly detect as many manually logged trips as possible by using the
automatically collected data. This paper includes an analysis of challenges due
to missing or partially sampled information in the data, and initial results
from automatic recognition using a set of algorithms. Improvement of correct
recognitions is left as an ongoing challenge.

determines each action by enormous simulations in a broad and deep search tree.
However, human experts select most actions by pattern analysis and careful
evaluation rather than brute search of millions of future nteractions. In this
paper, we propose a computer Go system that follows experts way of thinking and
playing. Our system consists of two parts. The first part is a novel deep
alternative neural network (DANN) used to generate candidates of next move.
Compared with existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), DANN inserts
recurrent layer after each convolutional layer and stacks them in an
alternative manner. We show such setting can preserve more contexts of local
features and its evolutions which are beneficial for move prediction. The
second part is a long-term evaluation (LTE) module used to provide a reliable
evaluation of candidates rather than a single probability from move predictor.
This is consistent with human experts nature of playing since they can foresee
tens of steps to give an accurate estimation of candidates. In our system, for
each candidate, LTE calculates a cumulative reward after several future
interactions when local variations are settled. Combining criteria from the two
parts, our system determines the optimal choice of next move. For more
comprehensive experiments, we introduce a new professional Go dataset (PGD),
consisting of 253233 professional records. Experiments on GoGoD and PGD
datasets show the DANN can substantially improve performance of move prediction
over pure DCNN. When combining LTE, our system outperforms most relevant
approaches and open engines based on MCTS.

another layer of uncertainty at the controller inputs/outputs. The
implementation uncertainties are mostly due to data sampling and quantization
via the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) unit. The failure to address the
model and ADC uncertainties during the early stages of a controller design
cycle results in a costly and time consuming verification and validation (V&V)
process. In this paper, new formulations of the first and second order discrete
sliding mode controllers (DSMC) are presented for a general class of uncertain

proposed DSMCs via an online ADC uncertainty prediction mechanism to improve
the controller robustness characteristics. Moreover, the DSMCs are equipped
with adaptation laws to remove two different types of modeling uncertainties
(multiplicative and additive) from the parameters of the linear system model.
The proposed adaptive DSMCs are evaluated on a DC motor speed control problem

active for ORR catalysis. Using DFT calculations we show that, to a first
approximation, the catalytic activity of nickel sulfides is determined by the
Ni-S coordination numbers at surface exposed sites through a simple geometric
descriptor. In particular, we find that the surface sites formed dynamically on
the surface of amorphous NiS during surface restructuring provide an optimal

modules parametrized over the real line. Bubenik et al. subsequently extended
the definition to categories of functors on a poset, the objects in these

typically depend on the choice of a lax semigroup of endomorphisms of the
poset. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a more general framework

Specifically, we extend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary

$[0,\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category acquires the
structure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are colax

concise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by considering

during compression changes the benzene molecules from slightly physisorbed to
strongly chemisorbed. Further compression causes deformation and chemical
linkage of the benzene molecules. Finally, the two contacts detach, with one
having a complex organic molecule attached and the other with a more reactive
surface. The complex organic molecule, which has an oxabicyclic segment, can be

trigger the next adsorption--reaction--tribopolymer formation cycle. Based on
these results, we also predict tribopolymer formation rates by using
transition--state theory and the second--order rate law. This study deepens our
understanding of tribopolymer formation (especially on metal oxides) and
provides strategies for suppressing tribopolymerization.

  Factorization with Strong Correlations","Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML),
  2017",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS cs.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-negative matrix factorization is a basic tool for decomposing data into
the feature and weight matrices under non-negativity constraints, and in
practice is often solved in the alternating minimization framework. However, it
is unclear whether such algorithms can recover the ground-truth feature matrix
when the weights for different features are highly correlated, which is common
in applications. This paper proposes a simple and natural alternating gradient
descent based algorithm, and shows that with a mild initialization it provably
recovers the ground-truth in the presence of strong correlations. In most
interesting cases, the correlation can be in the same order as the highest
possible. Our analysis also reveals its several favorable features including
robustness to noise. We complement our theoretical results with empirical
studies on semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating its advantage over several
popular methods in recovering the ground-truth.

Relativity and Electromagnetism after one century, in the light of the formal
theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups (D.C.
Spencer, 1970) or Algebraic Analysis, namely a mixture of differential geometry
and homological algebra (M. Kashiwara, 1970). Among the new results obtained,
we may quote: 1) In dimension 4 only, the 9 Bianchi identities that must be
satisfied by the 10 components of the Weyl tensor are described by a second
order operator and have thus nothing to do with the 20 first order Bianchi
identities for the 20 components of the Riemann tensor. This result, not known
after one century, has been recently confirmed by A. Quadrat (INRIA) using new
computer algebra packages. 2) The Ricci tensor R is a section of the Ricci
bundle of symmetric covariant 2-tensors which is the kernel of the canonical
projection of the Riemann bundle onto the Weyl bundle, induced by the canonical
inclusion of the classical Killing system (Poincare group) into the conformal
Killing system (Conformal group). It has only to do with the second order jets
(elations) of the conformal Killing system because any 1-form with value in the
bundle of elations can be decomposed in the direct sum (R,F) where the
electromagnetic field F is a section of the vector bundle of skewsymmetric
covariant 2-tensors. It follows therefore that electromagnetism and gravitation
have only to do with second order jets. 3) The 10 linearized second order
Einstein equations are parametrizing the 4 first order Cauchy stress equations
but cannot be parametrized themselves. As a byproduct of this negative result,
these 4 Cauchy stress equations have nothing to do with the 4 divergence-type
equations usually obtained from the 20 Bianchi identities by contraction of
indices.

galaxies, with stellar masses between $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$,
which are currently not easily detectable in all these lines even with ALMA and
NOEMA. We perform PDR modeling and apply different IR diagnostics to derive the
main physical parameters of the FIR emitting gas and dust and we compare the
derived ISM properties to those of galaxies on and above the MS at different
redshifts. We find that the ISM properties of LBAs are quite extreme (low gas
temperature, high density and thermal pressure) with respect to those found in
local normal spirals and more active local galaxies. LBAs have no [CII] deficit
despite having the high specific star formation rates (sSFRs) typical of
starbursts. Although LBAs lie above the local MS, we show that their ISM
properties are more similar to those of high-redshift MS galaxies than of local
galaxies above the main sequence. This data set represents an important
reference for planning future ALMA [CII] observations of relatively low-mass MS
galaxies at the epoch of the peak of the cosmic star formation.

discovered and analyzed in the context of the jamming transition. We
theoretically investigate the existence of marginal stability in a prototypical
model for structural glass-formers, combining analytical calculations in
infinite dimensions to computer simulations in three dimensions. While
mean-field theory predicts the existence of a Gardner phase transition towards
a marginally stable glass phase at low temperatures, simulations show no hint
of diverging timescales or lengthscales, but reveal instead the presence of
sparse localized defects. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition is
deeply affected by finite dimensional fluctuations, and raise issues about the
relevance of marginal stability in structural glasses far away from jamming.

framework is easy to implement using readily available technologies, and one of
its key advantages is that it supports containers, which is a promising

network analysis. We use centrality---a family of measures that quantify how

regression modeling shows that students' centrality predicts future academic

engagement in the classroom is critical to supporting academic performance.

inflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential, where
R-symmetry is either restored or spontaneously broken, with the inflaton
rolling down to a minimum describing the present phase of our Universe. To
avoid the Goldstone boson and remain with a single (real) scalar field (the

massive. This framework generalises a model studied recently by the present

description of both the cavity field and the oscillating mirror. We do not
linearize the dynamics, nor do we adopt any parametric or perturbative
approximation. By numerically diagonalizing the full optomechanical
Hamiltonian, we show that the resonant generation of photons from the vacuum is
determined by a ladder of mirror-field {\em vacuum Rabi splittings}. We find
that vacuum emission can originate from the free evolution of an initial pure
mechanical excited state, in analogy with the spontaneous emission from excited
atoms. By considering a coherent drive of the mirror, using a master-equation
approach to take losses into account, we are able to study the dynamical
Casimir effect for optomechanical coupling strengths ranging from weak to
ultrastrong. We find that a resonant production of photons out of the vacuum
can be observed even for mechanical frequencies lower than the cavity-mode
frequency. Since high mechanical frequencies, which are hard to achieve
experimentally, were thought to be imperative for realizing the dynamical
Casimir effect, this result removes one of the major obstacles for the
observation of this long-sought effect. We also find that the dynamical Casimir
effect can create entanglement between the oscillating mirror and the radiation
produced by its motion in the vacuum field, and that vacuum Casimir-Rabi
oscillations can occur.

  Architecture for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","Thesis of PhD completed at Flinders University of South Australia,
  2017",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) should carry out complex tasks in a
limited time interval. Since existing AUVs have limited battery capacity and
restricted endurance, they should autonomously manage mission time and the
resources to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. Task
assignment requires making decisions subject to resource constraints, while
tasks are assigned with costs and/or values that are budgeted in advance. Tasks
are distributed in a particular operation zone and mapped by a waypoint covered
network. Thus, design an efficient routing-task priority assign framework
considering vehicle's availabilities and properties is essential for increasing
mission productivity and on-time mission completion. This depends strongly on
the order and priority of the tasks that are located between node-like
waypoints in an operation network. On the other hand, autonomous operation of
AUVs in an unfamiliar dynamic underwater and performing quick response to
sudden environmental changes is a complicated process. Water current
instabilities can deflect the vehicle to an undesired direction and perturb
AUVs safety. The vehicle's robustness to strong environmental variations is
extremely crucial for its safe and optimum operations in an uncertain and
dynamic environment. To this end, the AUV needs to have a general overview of
the environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task
selection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in
dealing with continuously changing situations. This research deals with
developing a novel reactive control architecture to provide a higher level of
decision autonomy for the AUV operation that enables a single vehicle to
accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission in the face of periodic
disturbances in a turbulent and highly uncertain environment.

components the E2g and the A1g vibration mode of graphene correspond. These
modes are typically related with the G-peak and the D-peak, respectively, and
are strongly related to the stress distribution along the specimen. We adopt
the theoretical framework of Admal and Tadmor ([1]) for the macroscopic
definition of the Cauchy stress tensor and we introduce into this framework the
E2g and the A1g as appropriate perturbations. We use these perturbations to the
stress tensor expression and evaluate which stress tensor components are
related to each vibrational mode. This approach, though qualitative in nature,
incorporates all the main physics and reveals that E2g and A1g vibration modes
should be related to shear as well as axial stress components when graphene is
at rest (i.e. no external applied loading). To bring our framework closer to
more concrete results, we evaluate the instantaneous Hardy stress tensor for a
pair potential which correspond to the E2g and A1g modes at rest. Our analysis
expands to take into account an applied external tensile field. Taking the
armchair direction to be along the x-axis, when tension applies along the
armchair direction, it is the axial $\sigma$11 stress component which dominates
over $\sigma$12, $\sigma$22, which are of smaller order. When tension is along
the zig-zag direction, it is the axial $\sigma$22 stress component that
dominates over $\sigma$12, $\sigma$11. When tension is at an arbitrary
direction between the armchair and the zig-zag direction, all stress components
are of the same order and should all be taken into account even at small

been well understood. It was originally suggested as a fitting constant to
explain the black-body radiation. Although Planck had proposed a theoretical
justification of h, he was never satisfied with that. To solve this outstanding
problem, we used the Maxwell theory to directly calculate the energy and
momentum of a radiation wave packet. We found the energy of the wave packet is
indeed proportional to its oscillation frequency. This allows us to derive the
value of the Planck's constant. Furthermore, we showed that the emission and
transmission of a photon follows the principle of all-or-none. The ""strength""
of the wave packet can be characterized by zeta, which represents the
integrated strength of the vector potential along a transverse axis. We
reasoned that zeta should have a fixed cut-off value for all photons. Our
results suggest that a wave packet can behave like a particle. This offers a
simple explanation to the recent satellite observations that the cosmic

the Planck's law.

  This paper is a step towards answering this question. We formulate this

The technique builds on existing model checking algorithms and tools, obviating

through discrete event simulation. Discrete event simulators are essentially

key consideration is the stopping condition for the algorithm. A frequently
used stopping condition in runtime analysis, known as ""First Hitting Time"", is
to stop the algorithm as soon as it encounters the optimal solution. However,
this is unrealistic for real-world problems, as if the optimal solution were
already known, there would be no need to search for it. This paper argues that
the use of First Hitting Time, despite being a commonly used approach, is
significantly flawed and overestimates the quality of many algorithms in
real-world cases, where the optimum is not known in advance and has to be
genuinely searched for. A better alternative is to measure the quality of the
solution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus
on final solution quality. This paper argues that focussing on final solution
quality is more realistic and demonstrates cases where the results produced by
each algorithm evaluation method lead to very different conclusions regarding
the quality of each noisy optimisation algorithm.

the segmentation-based multi-scale analysis to locate tampered areas in digital
images. First, to deal with color input sliding windows of different scales, a
unified CNN architecture is designed. Then, we elaborately design the training
procedures of CNNs on sampled training patches. With a set of robust
multi-scale tampering detectors based on CNNs, complementary tampering
possibility maps can be generated. Last but not least, a segmentation-based
method is proposed to fuse the maps and generate the final decision map. By
exploiting the benefits of both the small-scale and large-scale analyses, the
segmentation-based multi-scale analysis can lead to a performance leap in
forgery localization of CNNs. Numerous experiments are conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

number of existing mean-field approximation methods for the SIS epidemic model
on complex networks. We derive the framework, which we call the Universal
Mean-Field Framework (UMFF), as a set of approximations of the exact Markovian
SIS equations. Our main novelty is that we describe the mean-field
approximations from the perspective of the isoperimetric problem, an insight
which results in bounds on the UMFF approximation error. These new bounds
provide insight in the accuracy of existing mean-field methods, such as the
widely-used N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA) and Heterogeneous
Mean-Field method (HMF). Additionally, the geometric perspective of the
isoperimetric problem enables the UMFF approximation accuracy to be related to
the regularity notions of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma, which yields a
prediction about the behavior of the SIS process on large graphs.

  Application",,"10.1177/1094342017737147",,"cs.OH astro-ph.IM cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because of vast volume of data being produced by today's scientific
simulations and experiments, lossy data compressor allowing user-controlled
loss of accuracy during the compression is a relevant solution for
significantly reducing the data size. However, lossy compressor developers and
users are missing a tool to explore the features of scientific datasets and
understand the data alteration after compression in a systematic and reliable
way. To address this gap, we have designed and implemented a generic framework
called Z-checker. On the one hand, Z-checker combines a battery of data
analysis components for data compression. On the other hand, Z-checker is
implemented as an open-source community tool to which users and developers can
contribute and add new analysis components based on their additional analysis
demands. In this paper, we present a survey of existing lossy compressors. Then
we describe the design framework of Z-checker, in which we integrated
evaluation metrics proposed in prior work as well as other analysis tools.
Specifically, for lossy compressor developers, Z-checker can be used to
characterize critical properties of any dataset to improve compression
strategies. For lossy compression users, Z-checker can detect the compression
quality, provide various global distortion analysis comparing the original data
with the decompressed data and statistical analysis of the compression error.
Z-checker can perform the analysis with either coarse granularity or fine
granularity, such that the users and developers can select the best-fit,
adaptive compressors for different parts of the dataset. Z-checker features a
visualization interface displaying all analysis results in addition to some
basic views of the datasets such as time series. To the best of our knowledge,
Z-checker is the first tool designed to assess lossy compression
comprehensively for scientific datasets.
