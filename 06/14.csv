example, point-to-point reaching movements are almost universally performed

constructing crafted malware samples; examine how machine-learning classifiers
can be misled under three different threat models; then conclude that injecting
carefully crafted data into training data can significantly reduce detection

enhancing approach that learns mobile malware by adversarial detection.
KuafuDet includes an offline training phase that selects and extracts features
from the training set, and an online detection phase that utilizes the

environment, these two phases are intertwined through a self-adaptive learning
scheme, wherein an automated camouflage detector is introduced to filter the
suspicious false negatives and feed them back into the training phase. We
finally show that KuafuDet can significantly reduce false negatives and boost
the detection accuracy by at least 15%. Experiments on more than 250,000 mobile
applications demonstrate that KuafuDet is scalable and can be highly effective

the decrease in a ratio between the LC cell thickness d and the cholesteric

owing to the unwinding of the photosensitive cholesteric helix during UV

achieved. The undulation structure 1D|| with a controlled period of a grating

pencils have several appealing properties, namely they are always strong
linearizations of $P(\lambda)$, they are easy to construct from the
coefficients of $P(\lambda)$, the eigenvectors of $P(\lambda)$ can be recovered
easily from those of $\mathcal{T}_P(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{R}_P(\lambda)$, the
two pencils are symmetric (resp. Hermitian) when $P(\lambda)$ is, and they
preserve the sign characteristic of $P(\lambda)$ when $P(\lambda)$ is
Hermitian. In this paper we study the numerical behavior of
$\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{R}_P(\lambda)$. We compare the
conditioning of a finite, nonzero, simple eigenvalue $\delta$ of $P(\lambda)$,
when considered an eigenvalue of $P(\lambda)$ and an eigenvalue of
$\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$. We also compare the backward error of an
approximate eigenpair $(z,\delta)$ of $\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$ with the
backward error of an approximate eigenpair $(x,\delta)$ of $P(\lambda)$, where
$x$ was recovered from $z$ in an appropriate way. When the matrix coefficients
of $P(\lambda)$ have similar norms and $P(\lambda)$ is scaled so that the
largest norm of the matrix coefficients of $P(\lambda)$ is one, we conclude
that $\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{R}_P(\lambda)$ have good
numerical properties in terms of eigenvalue conditioning and backward error.
Moreover, we compare the numerical behavior of $\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$ with
that of other well-studied linearizations in the literature, and conclude that
$\mathcal{T}_{P}(\lambda)$ performs better than these linearizations when
$P(\lambda)$ has odd degree and has been scaled.

redundancy to reduce computation. This can be an obscene waste of energy. We
present a variant on backpropagation for neural networks in which computation
scales with the rate of change of the data - not the rate at which we process
the data. We do this by having neurons communicate a combination of their
state, and their temporal change in state. Intriguingly, this simple
communication rule give rise to units that resemble biologically-inspired leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons, and to a weight-update rule that is equivalent to a
form of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a synaptic learning rule
observed in the brain. We demonstrate that on MNIST and a temporal variant of
MNIST, our algorithm performs about as well as a Multilayer Perceptron trained
with backpropagation, despite only communicating discrete values between
layers.

conclusively. More recently, attention shifted to higher frequencies, where

price impact has a universal non-linear shape for trades aggregated on any
intra-day scale. Its shape varies little across instruments, but drastically
different master curves are obtained for order-volume and -sign impact. The
scaling is largely determined by the relevant Hurst exponents. We further show
that extreme order flow imbalance is not associated with large returns. To the
contrary, it is observed when the price is ""pinned"" to a particular level.
Prices move only when there is sufficient balance in the local order flow. In
fact, the probability that a trade changes the mid-price falls to zero with
increasing (absolute) order-sign bias along an arc-shaped curve for all
intra-day scales. Our findings challenge the widespread assumption of linear
aggregate impact. They imply that market dynamics on all intra-day timescales

We show that the transfer matrix ""building"" the fishnet graphs emerges from the
$R-$matrix of non-compact conformal $SU(2,2)$ Heisenberg spin chain with spins
belonging to principal series representations of the four-dimensional conformal
group. We demonstrate explicitly a relationship between this integrable spin
chain and the Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Using QSC
and spin chain methods, we construct Baxter equation for $Q-$functions of the
conformal spin chain needed for computation of the anomalous dimensions of
operators of the type $\text{tr}(\phi_1^J)$ where $\phi_1$ is one of the two
scalars of the theory. For $J=3$ we derive from QSC a quantization condition
that fixes the relevant solution of Baxter equation. The scaling dimensions of
the operators only receive contributions from wheel-like graphs. We develop
integrability techniques to compute the divergent part of these graphs and use
it to present the weak coupling expansion of dimensions to very high orders.
Then we apply our exact equations to calculate the anomalous dimensions with
$J=3$ to practically unlimited precision at any coupling. These equations also
describe an infinite tower of local conformal operators all carrying the same
charge $J=3$. The method should be applicable for any $J$ and, in principle, to
any local operators of bi-scalar theory. We show that at strong coupling the
scaling dimensions can be derived from semiclassical quantization of finite gap
solutions describing an integrable system of noncompact $SU(2,2)$ spins. This
bears similarities with the classical strings arising in the strongly coupled
limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.

physically aligned, that is, they are clustered in longitude of perihelion and
have similar orbital planes. Questions have remained, however, about the
effects of observational bias on these observations, particularly on the
longitudes of perihelion. Specifically, distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects
tend to be faint and only observable near their perihelia, suggesting that the
longitudes of perihelion of the known distant objects could be strongly biased
by the limited number of locations in the sky where deep surveys have been
carried out. We have developed a method to rigorously estimate the longitude of
perihelion bias for Kuiper belt observations. We find that the probability that
the 10 known Kuiper belt objects with semimajor axis beyond 230 AU are drawn
from a population with uniform longitude of perihelion is 1.2%. Combined with
the observation that the orbital poles of these object are also clustered, the

which are not in conjugate limbs of the Mandelbrot set. When the Thurston
Algorithm for the unmodified formal mating is iterated in the case of
postcritical identifications, it will diverge to the boundary of Teichm\""uller
space, because marked points collide. Here it is shown that the colliding
points converge to postcritical points of f , and the associated sequence of
rational maps converges to f as well, unless the orbifold of f is of type (2,
2, 2, 2). So to compute f , it is not necessary to encode the topology of
postcritical ray-equivalence classes for the modified mating, but it is enough
to implement the pullback map for the formal mating. The proof combines the
Selinger extension to augmented Teichm\""uller space with local estimates.
  Moreover, the Thurston Algorithm is implemented by pulling back a path in
moduli space. This approach is due to Bartholdi--Nekrashevych in relation to
one-dimensional moduli space maps, and to Buff--Ch\'eritat for slow mating.
Here it is shown that slow mating is equivalent to the Thurston Algorithm for
the formal mating. An initialization of the path is obtained for
repelling-preperiodic captures as well, which provide an alternative
construction of matings.

removed, among labels still present in any of the queues, that is, the distance
from the optimal choice at each step. Variants of this strategy are prevalent
in state-of-the-art concurrent priority queue implementations. Nonetheless, it
is not known whether such implementations provide any rank guarantees, even in
a sequential model.
  We answer this question, showing that this strategy provides surprisingly
strong guarantees: Although the single-choice process, where we always insert
and remove from a single randomly chosen queue, has degrading cost, going to
infinity as we increase the number of steps, in the two choice process, the
expected rank of a removed element is $O( n )$ while the expected worst-case
cost is $O( n \log n )$. These bounds are tight, and hold irrespective of the
number of steps for which we run the process.
  The argument is based on a new technical connection between ""heavily loaded""

chemical signatures of their nucleosynthesis in the interstellar medium,
visible today in the atmospheres of low-mass stars formed afterwards. Sampling
the chemistry of low-mass provides insight into the first stars. Aims. We aim
to increase the samples of stars with extremely low metal abundances,
identifying ultra metal-poor stars from spectra with modest spectral resolution
and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Achieving this goal involves deriving reliable
metallicities and carbon abundances from such spectra. Methods. We carry-out
follow-up observations of faint, V>19, metal-poor candidates selected from SDSS
spectroscopy and observed with OSIRIS at GTC. The SDSS and follow-up OSIRIS
spectra have been analyzed using the FERRE code to derive effective
temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities and carbon abundances. In
addition, a well-known extremely metal-poor star has been included in our
sample to calibrate the analysis methodology. Results. We have observed and
analyzed five metal-poor candidates from modest-quality SDSS spectra. All stars
in our sample have been confirmed as extremely metal-poor stars, in the
[Fe/H]<-3.3 regime. We report the recognition of J173403+644632, a
carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor dwarf star with [Fe/H]=-4.3 and [C/Fe]=+3.1.

magnetic excitations (psinons and antipsinons) in the field-induced critical

that two-string and three-string states govern the quantum spin dynamics close
to the quantum criticality, while the fractional excitations are dominant at
low energies, reflecting the antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuations.

suite of Monte Carlo simulations that test different binary fractions using
Bayesian analysis and determine that the binary fraction for Leo II ranges from
$0.30^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ to $0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$, depending on the
distributions of binary orbital parameters assumed. This value is smaller than
what has been found for the solar neighborhood (~0.4-0.6) but falls within the
wide range of values that have been inferred for other dwarf spheroidals
(0.14-0.69). The distribution of orbital periods has the greatest impact on the
binary fraction results. If the fraction we find in Leo II is present in
low-mass ultra-faints, it can artificially inflate the velocity dispersion of
those systems and cause them to appear more dark matter rich than in actuality.
For a galaxy with an intrinsic dispersion of 1 km/s and an observational sample
of 100 stars, the dispersion can be increased by a factor of 1.5-2 for Leo

the OGLE-III survey, together with accurate new made-to-measure dynamical
models of the Galactic bulge/bar region, to measure the IMF in the inner Milky
Way. The timescale of each event depends on the mass of the lensing object,
together with the relative distances and velocities of the lens and source. The
dynamical model provides statistically these distances and velocities allowing
us to constrain the lens mass function, and from this to infer the IMF.
Parameterising the IMF as a broken power-law, we find slopes in the main
sequence $\alpha_{\rm ms}=1.31\pm0.10|_{\rm stat}\pm0.10|_{\rm sys}$ and brown
dwarf region $\alpha_{\rm bd}=-0.7\pm0.9|_{\rm stat}\pm0.8|_{\rm sys}$ where we
use a fiducial 50% binary fraction, and the systematic uncertainty covers the
range of binary fractions 0-100%. Similarly for a log-normal IMF we conclude
$M_c=(0.17\pm0.02|_{\rm stat}\pm0.01|_{\rm sys})M_\odot$ and
$\sigma_m=0.49\pm0.07|_{\rm stat}\pm0.06|_{\rm sys}$. These values are very
similar to a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF respectively, showing that the IMF in the
bulge is indistinguishable from that measured locally, despite the lenses lying
in the inner Milky Way where the stars are mostly ~10Gyr old and formed on a
fast $\alpha$-element enhanced timescale. This therefore constrains models of
IMF variation that depend on the properties of the collapsing gas cloud.

photometry are becoming increasingly available and can be used to constrain the

Way (MW) and Virgo core GCs based on five optical-near-infrared colors and ten
synthetic stellar population models. For the MW GCs, the models tend to agree
on photometric ages and metallicities, with values similar to those obtained
with previous studies. When used with Virgo core GCs, for which photometry is
provided by the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS), the same models
generically return younger ages. This is a consequence of the systematic
differences observed between the locus occupied by Virgo core GCs and models in
panchromatic color space. Only extreme fine-tuning of the adjustable parameters
available to us can make the majority of the best-fit ages old. Although we
cannot exclude that the formation history of the Virgo core may lead to more
conspicuous populations of relatively young GCs than in other environments, we
emphasize that the intrinsic properties of the Virgo GCs are likely to differ
systematically from those assumed in the models. Thus, the large wavelength
coverage and photometric quality of modern GC samples, such as used here, is
not by itself sufficient to better constrain the GC formation histories. Models
matching the environment-dependent characteristics of GCs in multi-dimensional
color space are needed to improve the situation.

degree is of the order of 0.1-0.2 %. The polarization angles are determined

Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 GHz and 8.35 GHz with a cadence of around
1.2 months. The polarized emission of the Moon was used to calibrate the
polarization angle. Our analysis showed a small system-induced rotation of
about 1$^{\circ}$ at both observing frequencies. Finally, we identify five
sources with significant and stable linear polarization; three sources remain
constantly linearly unpolarized over the period we examined; a total of 11
sources have stable circular polarization degree $m_\mathrm{c}$ and four of
them with non-zero $m_\mathrm{c}$. We also identify eight sources that maintain
a stable polarization angle over the examined period. All this is provided to
the community for polarization observations reference. We finally show that our
analysis method is conceptually different from the traditionally used ones and

recently emerged as a challenge to LCDM: in dark matter (DM) only simulations,
DM halos have a universal cuspy density profile that results in self-similar RC
shapes. We compare RC shapes of simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project with
observed galaxies from the homogeneous SPARC dataset. The DM halos of the NIHAO
galaxies can expand to form cores, with the degree of expansion depending on
their stellar-to-halo mass ratio. By means of the $V_{\rm 2kpc}-V_{\rm Rlast}$
relation (where $V_{\rm Rlast}$ is the outermost measured rotation velocity),
we show that both the average trend and the scatter in RC shapes of NIHAO
galaxies are in reasonable agreement with SPARC: this represents a significant
improvement compared to simulations that do not result in DM core formation,
suggesting that halo expansion is a key process in matching the diversity of
dwarf galaxy RCs. Note that NIHAO galaxies can reproduce even the extremely
slowly rising RCs of IC 2574 and UGC 5750. Revealingly, the range where
observed galaxies show the highest diversity corresponds to the range where
core formation is most efficient in NIHAO simulations, 50$<V_{\rm Rlast}$\km
s$^{-1}<$100. A few observed galaxies in this range cannot be matched by any
NIHAO RC nor by simulations that predict a universal halo profile.
Interestingly, the majority of these are starbursts or emission-line galaxies,
with steep RCs and small effective radii. Such galaxies represent an
interesting observational target providing new clues to the process/viability
of cusp-core transformation, the relationship between starburst and inner
potential well, and the nature of DM.

best observed when the merger occurs in the plane of the sky. Mergers can also
produce radio halos, through complex processes likely linked to turbulent
re-acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons. However, only some clusters with
double relics also show a radio halo. Here, we present a novel method to derive
upper limits on the radio halo emission, and analyse archival X-ray Chandra
data, as well as galaxy velocity dispersions and lensing data, in order to
understand the key parameter that switches on radio halo emission. We place
upper limits on the halo power below the $P_{\rm 1.4 \, GHz}\, M_{500}$
correlation for some clusters, confirming that clusters with double relics have
different radio properties. Computing X-ray morphological indicators, we find
that clusters with double relics are associated with the most disturbed
clusters. We also investigate the role of different mass-ratios and
time-since-merger. Data do not indicate that the merger mass ratio has an
impact on the presence or absence of radio halos (the null hypothesis that the
clusters belong to the same group cannot be rejected). However, the data
suggests that the absence of radio halos could be associated with early and
late mergers, but the sample is too small to perform a statistical test. Our
study is limited by the small number of clusters with double relics. Future
surveys with LOFAR, ASKAP, MeerKat and SKA will provide larger samples to
better address this issue.

detecting and analysing light from the lens itself. Compact objects are ideal
gravitational lenses, because they have relatively large masses and are dim. In
this paper we describe the prospects for predicting lensing events generated by
the local population of compact objects, consisting of 250 neutron stars, 5
black holes, and approximately 35,000 white dwarfs. By focusing on a population
of nearby compact objects with measured proper motions and known distances from
us, we can measure their masses by studying the characteristics of any lensing
event they generate. Here we concentrate on shifts in the position of a
background source due to lensing by a foreground compact object. With HST,
JWST, and Gaia, measurable centroid shifts caused by lensing are relatively
frequent occurrences. We find that 30-50 detectable events per decade are
expected for white dwarfs. Because relatively few neutron stars and black holes
have measured distances and proper motions, it is more difficult to compute
realistic rates for them. However, we show that at least one isolated neutron
star has likely produced detectable events during the past several decades.
This work is particularly relevant to the upcoming data releases by the Gaia
mission and also to data that will be collected by JWST. Monitoring predicted
microlensing events will not only help to determine the masses of compact
objects, but will also potentially discover dim companions to these stellar
remnants, including orbiting exoplanets.

Band Antennas, at frequencies between 110 and 190~MHz. We apply a forward

associated with scattering by a single thin screen, has a power-law dependence
on frequency $\tau \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, with indices ranging from $\alpha =
1.50$ to $4.0$, despite simplest theoretical models predicting $\alpha = 4.0$
or $4.4$. Modelling the screen as an isotropic or extremely anisotropic
scatterer, we find anisotropic scattering fits lead to larger power-law
indices, often in better agreement with theoretically expected values. We
compare the scattering models based on the inferred, frequency dependent
parameters of the intrinsic pulse, and the resulting correction to the
dispersion measure (DM). We highlight the cases in which fits of extreme
anisotropic scattering are appealing, while stressing that the data do not
strictly favour either model for any of the 13 pulsars. The pulsars show
anomalous scattering properties that are consistent with finite scattering
screens and/or anisotropy, but these data alone do not provide the means for an
unambiguous characterization of the screens. We revisit the empirical $\tau$

scattering and scintillation properties of these sources at higher frequencies,

detectable electromagnetic (EM) emission. However, the gravitational wave (GW)
events GW150914 and GW170104, detected by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) to be the result of merging, ~60 solar
mass binary black holes (BBHs), each have claimed coincident gamma-ray
emission. Motivated by the intriguing possibility of an EM counterpart to BBH
mergers, we construct a model that can reproduce the observed EM and GW signals
for GW150914- and GW170104-like events, from a single-star progenitor.
Following Loeb (2016), we envision a massive, rapidly rotating star within
which a rotating bar instability fractures the core into two overdensities that
fragment into clumps which merge to form BHs in a tight binary with arbitrary
spin-orbit alignment. Once formed, the BBH inspirals due to gas and
gravitational-wave drag until tidal forces trigger strong feeding of the BHs
with the surrounding stellar-density gas about 10 seconds before merger. The
resulting giga-Eddington accretion peak launches a jet that breaks out of the
progenitor star and drives a powerful outflow that clears the gas from the
orbit of the binary within one second, preserving the vacuum GW waveform in the
LIGO band. The single-progenitor scenario predicts the existence of variability
of the gamma-ray burst, modulated at the ~0.2 second chirping period of the BBH
due to relativistic Doppler boost. The jet breakout should be accompanied by a
low-luminosity supernova. Finally, because the BBHs of the single progenitor
model do not exist at large separations, they will not be detectable in the low
frequency gravitational wave band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). Hence, the single-progenitor BBHs will be unambiguously discernible
from BBHs formed through alternate, double-progenitor evolution scenarios.

without a bounding box around the objects or the space in the image depicting

  We then introduce a peer recommender system in the model, showing that, even
with very local iteraction and a small probability of appeal to the
recommender, its presence is sufficient to make both symmetry breaking and

recommendation system is to uniform the opinions of a community, reducing
minority opinions or making them disappear. Although the recommender system
does uniform the community opinion, it doesn't constrain it, in the sense that
all opinions have the same probability of becoming the dominating one. We do a
partial study, however, that suggests that a ""mischievous"" recommender might be

correction of up to +0.69 dex largest for our 5000K models. The corrections are
correlated with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and are also affected by the metallicity. The
shape of the strong $^{24}$MgH component in the 3D syntheses is poorly
reproduced in 1D. This results in 1D syntheses underestimating $^{25}$MgH by up

for dwarfs. This discrepancy increases with decreasing metallicity. $^{26}$MgH

SDO/AIA) have revealed a presence of propagating intensity disturbances in
solar coronal loops. These disturbances are typically interpreted as slow
magnetoacoustic waves. Recent spectroscopic observations with Hinode/EIS of
active region loops, however, revealed that the propagating intensity
disturbances are associated with intermittent plasma upflows (or jets) at the
footpoints which are presumably generated by magnetic reconnection. For this
reason, whether these disturbances are waves or periodic flows is still being
studied. This study is aimed at understanding the physical properties of
observed disturbances by investigating the excitation of waves by hot plasma
injections from below and the evolution of flows and wave propagation along the
loop. We expand our previous studies based on isothermal 3D MHD models of
active region to a more realistic model that includes full energy equation
accounting for effects of radiative losses. Computations are initialized with
an equilibrium state of a model active region using potential (dipole) magnetic
field, gravitationally stratified density and temperature obtained from
polytropic equation of state. We model an impulsive injection of hot plasma
into the steady plasma outflow along the loops of different temperature, warm
($\sim$1 MK) and hot ($\sim$6 MK). The simulations show that hot jets launched
at the coronal base excite slow magnetoacoustic waves that propagate along the
loops to the high corona, while the injected hot flows decelerates rapidly with
heights. The simulated results support that the observed coronal disturbances
are mainly the wave features. We also find that the effect of radiative cooling

can be quite challenging due to the rarity of successful startup companies and
the complexity of factors which impact such success. In this work we collect
data on tens of thousands of startup companies, their performance, the
backgrounds of their founders, and their investors. We develop a novel model
for the success of a startup company based on the first passage time of a
Brownian motion. The drift and diffusion of the Brownian motion associated with
a startup company are a function of features based its sector, founders, and
initial investors. All features are calculated using our massive dataset. Using
a Bayesian approach, we are able to obtain quantitative insights about the
features of successful startup companies from our model.
  To test the performance of our model, we use it to build a portfolio of
companies where the goal is to maximize the probability of having at least one
company achieve an exit (IPO or acquisition), which we refer to as winning.
This $\textit{picking winners}$ framework is very general and can be used to
model many problems with low probability, high reward outcomes, such as
pharmaceutical companies choosing drugs to develop or studios selecting movies
to produce. We frame the construction of a picking winners portfolio as a
combinatorial optimization problem and show that a greedy solution has strong
performance guarantees. We apply the picking winners framework to the problem
of choosing a portfolio of startup companies. Using our model for the exit
probabilities, we are able to construct out of sample portfolios which achieve
exit rates as high as 60%, which is nearly double that of top venture capital
firms.

$n$-dimensional, continuous-time, distributed linear system of the form
$\dot{x} = Ax,\;y_i = C_ix,\;i\in\{1,2,\ldots, m\}$. The system's state $x$ is
simultaneously estimated by $m$ agents assuming each agent $i$ senses $y_i$ and
receives appropriately defined data from each of its current neighbors.
Neighbor relations are characterized by a time-varying directed graph
$\mathbb{N}(t)$ whose vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict
neighbor relations. Agent $i$ updates its estimate $x_i$ of $x$ at ""event
times"" $t_1,t_2,\ldots $ using a local observer and a local parameter
estimator. The local observer is a continuous time linear system whose input is
$y_i$ and whose output $w_i$ is an asymptotically correct estimate of $L_ix$
where $L_i$ a matrix with kernel equaling the unobservable space of $(C_i,A)$.
The local parameter estimator is a recursive algorithm designed to estimate,
prior to each event time $t_j$, a constant parameter $p_j$ which satisfies the
linear equations $w_k(t_j-\tau) =
L_kp_j+\mu_k(t_j-\tau),\;k\in\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$, where $\tau$ is a small
positive constant and $\mu_k$ is the state estimation error of local observer
$k$. Agent $i$ accomplishes this by iterating its parameter estimator state
$z_i$, $q$ times within the interval $[t_j-\tau, t_j)$, and by making use of
the state of each of its neighbors' parameter estimators at each iteration. The
updated value of $x_i$ at event time $t_j$ is then $x_i(t_j) =
e^{A\tau}z_i(q)$. Subject to the assumptions that (i) the neighbor graph
$\mathbb{N}(t)$ is strongly connected for all time, (ii) the system whose state
is to be estimated is jointly observable, (iii) $q$ is sufficiently large, it
is shown that each estimate $x_i$ converges to $x$ exponentially fast as
$t\rightarrow \infty$ at a rate which can be controlled.

$L_{\omega_1,\omega}$-sentences is absolute for transitive models of ZFC, in
the sense that if $V \subseteq W$ are transitive models of ZFC with the same
ordinals, $\varphi\in V$ and $V\models ""\varphi \text{ is an }

  From [FHK13] we know that the answer is positive for $\alpha=0,1$ and under
the negation of CH, the answer is negative for all $\alpha>1$. Under GCH, and
assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, the answer remains
negative for each $\alpha>1$, except the case when $\alpha=\omega$ which is an
open question in [FHK13].
  We answer the open question by providing a negative answer under GCH even for
$\alpha=\omega$. Our examples are incomplete sentences. In fact, the same
sentences can be used to prove a negative answer under GCH for all $\alpha>1$
assuming the consistency of a Mahlo cardinal. Thus, the large cardinal
assumption is relaxed from a supercompact in [FHK13] to a Mahlo cardinal.
  Finally, we consider the absoluteness question for the
$\aleph_\alpha$-amalgamation property of $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$-sentences (under
substructure). We prove that assuming GCH, $\aleph_\alpha$-amalgamation is
non-absolute for $1<\alpha<\omega$. This answers a question from [SS]. The
cases $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha$ infinite remain open. As a corollary we get that
it is non-absolute that the amalgamation spectrum of an
$L_{\omega_1,\omega}$-sentence is empty.

Linac with world-record current and normalized brightness in a bunch train, a
high-current linac cryomodule, and a high-power beam stop, and several
diagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. All these are now
being used to construct a novel one-cryomodule ERL in Cornell's Wilson Lab.
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has designed a multi-turn ERL for eRHIC,
where beam is transported more than 20 times around the 4km long RHIC tunnel.
The number of transport lines is minimized by using two arcs with
strongly-focusing permanent magnets that can control many beams of different
energies. A collaboration between BNL and Cornell has been formed to
investigate this multi-turn eRHIC ERL design by building a 4-turn,
one-cryomodule ERL at Cornell. It also has a return loop built with strongly
focusing permanent magnets and is meant to accelerate 40mA beam to 150MeV. This
high-brightness beam will have applications beyond accelerator research, in
industry, in nuclear physics, and in X-ray science.

the disk warping as a significant kinematical twist of the major axis of the

work. Evidence for a new low brightness HI component with anomalous velocity is
reported. It harbours a large velocity scatter, as its kinematics both exceeds
and lags the rotation of the disk, and leaks in the forbidden velocity zone of
apparent counter-rotation. The observations also reveal wide and multiple peak
HI profiles which can be partly explained by crowded orbits in the framework of
the warp model. Asymmetric motions are identified in the velocity field, as
possible signatures of a lopsided potential and the warp. The mass distribution
modeling of the hybrid Halpha-HI rotation curve favours a cuspy dark matter
halo with a concentration in disagreement with the LambdaCDM dark halo
mass-concentration relationship. The total mass enclosed in 23 kpc is 8 10^10
Msol, of which 11% are stars and gas. At the virial radius of the cuspy halo,
the resulting total mass is 5 10^11 Msol, but with a baryonic mass fraction of

including the spread of behavior, norms, and ideas --- on networks. Most models
of social influence tend to assume that individuals react to changes in the
states of their neighbors without any time delay, but this is often not true in
social contexts, where (for various reasons) different agents can have
different response times. To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of
a timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on
nodes delays the adoption --- i.e., change of state --- of each agent, which in
turn delays the adoptions of its neighbors. With a homogeneous-distributed
timer, in which all nodes exhibit the same amount of delay, adoption delays are
also homogeneous, so the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However,
heterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and
hence the ""adoption paths"" through which state changes spread in a network.
Using a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous
timers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to
an analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the
relationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to timer
distribution and network structure. We derive an analytical approximation for
the temporal evolution of the fraction of adopters by modifying a pair
approximation of the Watts threshold model, and we find good agreement with
numerical computations. We also examine our new timer model on networks

some ISPs are not observed using invalid routes in uncontrolled experiments,
they are actually using different routes for (non-security) traffic engineering
purposes, without performing ROV. We conclude with a description of a

addresses) across different sources, is powerful in dealing with variety in big
data, especially web data. Threshold-driven similarity join, which has been
extensively studied in the past, assumes that a user is able to specify a
similarity threshold, and then focuses on how to efficiently return the object
pairs whose similarities pass the threshold. We argue that the assumption about
a well set similarity threshold may not be valid for two reasons. The optimal
thresholds for different similarity join tasks may vary a lot. Moreover, the
end-to-end time spent on similarity join is likely to be dominated by a
back-and-forth threshold-tuning process.
  In response, we propose preference-driven similarity join. The key idea is to
provide several result-set preferences, rather than a range of thresholds, for
a user to choose from. Intuitively, a result-set preference can be considered
as an objective function to capture a user's preference on a similarity join
result. Once a preference is chosen, we automatically compute the similarity
join result optimizing the preference objective. As the proof of concept, we
devise two useful preferences and propose a novel preference-driven similarity
join framework coupled with effective optimization techniques. Our approaches
are evaluated on four real-world web datasets from a diverse range of
application scenarios. The experiments show that preference-driven similarity
join can achieve high-quality results without a tedious threshold-tuning
process.

prescribed probability distributions, we assume the distributions are only
observable through a finite training dataset. By utilizing the Wasserstein

robust optimization OPF problem to search for power schedules and reserve

relied upon to ensure the safety of systems operating in uncertain
environments. However, the nonlinearity of the resulting closed-loop system
complicates verification that the system does in fact satisfy those
requirements at all possible operating conditions. While analytical proof-based
techniques and finite abstractions can be used to provably verify the
closed-loop system's response at different operating conditions, they often
produce conservative approximations due to restrictive assumptions and are
difficult to construct in many applications. In contrast, popular statistical
verification techniques relax the restrictions and instead rely upon
simulations to construct statistical or probabilistic guarantees. This work
presents a data-driven statistical verification procedure that instead
constructs statistical learning models from simulated training data to separate
the set of possible perturbations into ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" subsets. Binary
evaluations of closed-loop system requirement satisfaction at various
realizations of the uncertainties are obtained through temporal logic
robustness metrics, which are then used to construct predictive models of
requirement satisfaction over the full set of possible uncertainties. As the
accuracy of these predictive statistical models is inherently coupled to the
quality of the training data, an active learning algorithm selects additional
sample points in order to maximize the expected change in the data-driven model
and thus, indirectly, minimize the prediction error. Various case studies
demonstrate the closed-loop verification procedure and highlight improvements
in prediction error over both existing analytical and statistical verification
techniques.

obtained a construction for the reticulation of any algebra $A$ from a
semi-degenerate congruence-modular variety ${\cal C}$ in the case when the
commutator of $A$, applied to compact congruences of $A$, produces compact
congruences, in particular when ${\cal C}$ has principal commutators;
furthermore, it turns out that weaker conditions than the fact that $A$ belongs
to a congruence-modular variety are sufficient for $A$ to have a reticulation.
This construction generalizes the reticulation of a commutative unitary ring,
as well as that of a residuated lattice, which in turn generalizes the
reticulation of a BL-algebra and that of an MV-algebra. The purpose of
constructing the reticulation for the algebras from ${\cal C}$ is that of
transferring algebraic and topological properties between the variety of

we adopt an integral operator approach with periodic semigroup kernels.
Spectral decomposition theorems are derived that cover the important cases of
two-time statistics drawn from a mixing invariant measure.
  The corresponding eigenvalues can be grouped per Fourier frequency, and are
actually given, at each frequency, as the singular values of a cross-spectral
matrix depending on the data. These eigenvalues obey furthermore a variational
principle that allows us to define naturally a multidimensional power spectrum.
The eigenmodes, as far as they are concerned, exhibit a data-adaptive character
manifested in their phase which allows us in turn to define a multidimensional
phase spectrum.
  The resulting data-adaptive harmonic (DAH) modes allow for reducing the
data-driven modeling effort to elemental models stacked per frequency, only
coupled at different frequencies by the same noise realization. In particular,
the DAH decomposition extracts time-dependent coefficients stacked by Fourier
frequency which can be efficiently modeled---provided the decay of temporal
correlations is sufficiently well-resolved---within a class of multilayer
stochastic models (MSMs) tailored here on stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators.
  Applications to the Lorenz 96 model and to a stochastic heat equation driven
by a space-time white noise, are considered. In both cases, the DAH
decomposition allows for an extraction of spatio-temporal modes revealing key
features of the dynamics in the embedded phase space. The multilayer

  This review article highlights the impact of detector simulation on particle

made a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication

two-dimensional classical systems with short-range interactions and the
critical theories in two-dimensions are parametrized by a dimensional number,
termed central charge or conformal anomaly $c$. However, experimental
determination of the central charge of a conformal field theory has not been
done before. Here we propose to extract the central charge of the conformal
field theory corresponding to a critical point of a two-dimensional lattice
models from the quantum decoherence measurement of a probe spin which is
coupled to the two-dimensional lattice models. Conformal invariance predicts
that the leading finite-size correction to the free energy for a
two-dimensional system at a conformal invariant critical point is linearly
related to the conformal anomaly for various boundary conditions. A recent
discovery of thermodynamic holography allows us to obtain the free energy of
many-body system from central spin decoherence measurement. Thus the central
charge of the conformal field theory could be extracted from central spin
decoherence measurement. We have applied the method to the two-dimensional
Ising model and extracted the central charge of two-dimensional Ising model
with good precision. This work provides a useful approach to extracting the
central charge of conformal field theory in various two-dimensional lattice

formulated with an additional source compression step where, prior to the
public discussion phase, users independently compress their private sources to
filter out strongly correlated components for generating a common secret key.
The objective is to maximize the achievable key rate as a function of the joint
entropy of the compressed sources. Since the maximum achievable key rate
captures the total amount of information mutual to the compressed sources, an
optimal compression scheme essentially maximizes the multivariate mutual
information per bit of randomness of the private sources, and can therefore be
viewed more generally as a dimension reduction technique. Single-letter lower
and upper bounds on the maximum achievable key rate are derived for the general
source model, and an explicit polynomial-time computable formula is obtained
for the pairwise independent network model. In particular, the converse results
and the upper bounds are obtained from those of the related secret key
agreement problem with rate-limited discussion. A precise duality is shown for
the two-user case with one-way discussion, and such duality is extended to
obtain the desired converse results in the multi-user case. In addition to
posing new challenges in information processing and dimension reduction, the
compressed secret key agreement problem helps shed new light on resolving the
difficult problem of secret key agreement with rate-limited discussion, by
offering a more structured achieving scheme and some simpler conjectures to

the DoFs are uncoupled, it fails at capturing key features of the field's
coherence if the DOFs are indeed correlated -- a situation that arises often.
By viewing coherence as a `resource' that can be shared among the DoFs, it
becomes possible to convert the entropy associated with the fluctuations in one
DoF to another DoF that is initially fluctuation-free. Here, we verify
experimentally that coherence can indeed be reversibly exchanged -- without
loss of energy -- between polarization and the spatial DoF of a partially
coherent field. Starting from a linearly polarized spatially incoherent field
-- one that produces no spatial interference fringes -- we obtain a spatially
coherent field that is unpolarized. By reallocating the entropy to
polarization, the field becomes invariant with regards to the action of a
polarization scrambler, thus suggesting a strategy for avoiding the deleterious
effects of a randomizing system on a DoF of the optical field.

Our setup comprises a quantum dot coupled to two contacts that drive heat flow

both as batteries and as engines, depending on the parameter range. The
electrons in the quantum dot interact with the nuclear spins via hyperfine
spin-flip processes as typically seen in solid state systems such as GaAs
quantum dots. The hyperfine interaction in such systems, which is often treated
as a deterrent for quantum information processing, can favorably be regarded as
a driving agent for classical information flow into a heat engine setup. We
relate this information flow to Landauer's erasure of the nuclear spin bath,
leading to a battery operation. We further demonstrate that the setup can
perform as a transient power source even under a voltage bias across the dot.
Focusing on the transient thermoelectric operation, our analysis clearly
indicates the role of Landauer's erasure to deliver a higher output power than
a conventional quantum dot thermoelectric setup and an efficiency greater than
that of an identical Carnot cycle in steady state, which is consistent with
recently proposed bounds on efficiency for systems subject to a feedback
controller. The role of nuclear spin relaxation processes on these aspects is
also studied. Finally, we introduce the Coulomb interaction in the dot and
analyze the transient thermoelectric response of the system. Our results
elaborate on the effective use of somewhat undesirable scattering processes as
a non-equilibrium source of Shannon information flow in thermal machines and

present the mathematical implementation of a tomographic algorithm, termed
GENeralized Fourier Iterative REconstruction (GENFIRE). By iterating between
real and reciprocal space, GENFIRE searches for a global solution that is
concurrently consistent with the measured data and general physical
constraints. The algorithm requires minimal human intervention and also
incorporates angular refinement to reduce the tilt angle error. We demonstrate
that GENFIRE can produce superior results relative to several other popular
tomographic reconstruction techniques by numerical simulations, and by
experimentally by reconstructing the 3D structure of a porous material and a
frozen-hydrated marine cyanobacterium. Equipped with a graphical user
interface, GENFIRE is freely available from our website and is expected to find
broad applications across different disciplines.

obtained by analysing line strengths and fitting line profiles, which were
calculated with a 1D LTE model atmosphere. The main properties of KIC 11145123
are: (1) A low $ {\rm [Fe/H]} = -0.71\pm0.11$ dex and a high radial velocity of
$-135.4 \pm 0.2$ km s$^{-1}$. These are remarkable among late-A stars. Our best
asteroseismic models with this low [Fe/H] have slightly high helium abundance
and low masses of 1.4 M$_\odot$. All of these results strongly suggest that KIC
11145123 is a Population II blue straggler; (2) The projected rotation velocity
confirms the asteroseismically predicted slow rotation of the star; (3)
Comparisons of abundance patterns between KIC 11145123 and Am, Ap, and blue

abundances consistent with a blue straggler. We conclude that the remarkably
long 100-d rotation period of this star is a consequence of it being a blue
straggler, but both pathways for the formation of blue stragglers -- merger and
mass loss in a binary system -- pose difficulties for our understanding of the
exceedingly slow rotation. In particular, we show that there is no evidence of
any secondary companion star, and we put stringent limits on the possible mass
of any such purported companion through the phase modulation (PM) technique.

most crucial aspects of person re-identification (re-id). In this paper, we
present novel meta-descriptors based on a hierarchical distribution of pixel
features. Although hierarchical covariance descriptors have been successfully
applied to image classification, the mean information of pixel features, which
is absent from the covariance, tends to be the major discriminative information
for person re-id. To solve this problem, we describe a local region in an image
via hierarchical Gaussian distribution in which both means and covariances are
included in their parameters. More specifically, the region is modeled as a set
of multiple Gaussian distributions in which each Gaussian represents the
appearance of a local patch. The characteristics of the set of Gaussians are
again described by another Gaussian distribution. In both steps, we embed the
parameters of the Gaussian into a point of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
matrix manifold. By changing the way to handle mean information in this
embedding, we develop two hierarchical Gaussian descriptors. Additionally, we
develop feature norm normalization methods with the ability to alleviate the
biased trends that exist on the descriptors. The experimental results conducted
on five public datasets indicate that the proposed descriptors achieve
remarkably high performance on person re-id.

addressed within the conventional strong-field approximation (SFA) in standard
velocity gauge (VG) formulation under condition of arbitrary value of the
so-called Keldysh parameter $\gamma$ , including both the multiphoton (for
$\gamma \gg 1$) and tunneling (for $\gamma \ll 1$) regimes of ionization.
According to such VG-SFA consideration, the calculated photoelectron momentum
distributions (PMD) demonstrate a clear spatial asymmetry (viz., the
photoelectron emission proved to be different along the opposite directions
with respect to incident laser field polarization) even for particular
bichromatic field(s) with polar symmetry of its total electric field strength.
Moreover, a clear correlation between the spatial symmetry/asymmetry of
photoelectron emission and that of applied vector potential of bichromatic
field is reliably established, so that the symmetry of calculated PMD proved to
follow precisely the symmetry of applied vector potential of incident laser
bichromatic field, in a close analogy with the well-known Aharonov-Bohm effect.
Based on these our findings, the attempt is undertaken to identify the physical
mechanism underlying this intriguing phenomenon and provide it with a kind of

location, we calculate the particle differential intensities as observed by ACE

combines the characteristics of destructive SRAM reads with the error

proposes a new method for the anonymization of the information within system

presented in this work indicate that apart from eliminating the sensitive data

motion. We aim to demonstrate that interpreting this motion as a magneto
hydrodynamic (MHD) wave is faulty. We also connect the decrease of the apparent
velocity over time with the phase mixing process, which depends on the
curvature of the magnetic field lines. By measuring the displacement of the
prominence at different heights to calculate the apparent velocity, we show
that the propagation slows down over time, in accordance with the theoretical
work of Kaneko et al. We also show that this propagation speed drops below what
is to be expected for even slow MHD waves for those circumstances. We use a
modified Kippenhahn-Schl\""uter prominence model to calculate the curvature of
the magnetic field and fit our observations accordingly. Measuring three of the
apparent waves, we get apparent velocities of 14, 8, and 4 km/s. Fitting a
simple model for the magnetic field configuration, we obtain that the filament
is located 103 Mm below the magnetic centre. We also obtain that the scale of
the magnetic field strength in the vertical direction plays no role in the
concept of apparent superslow waves and that the moment of excitation of the
waves happened roughly one oscillation period before the end of the eruption
that excited the oscillation. Some of the observed phase velocities are lower
than expected for slow modes for the circumstances, showing that they rather
fit with the concept of apparent superslow propagation. A fit with our magnetic
field model allows for inferring the magnetic geometry of the prominence.

and density profiles (e.g. constant, piecewise) for obtaining good qualitative
and quantitative predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such
simple profiles provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic
understanding of otherwise elusive shear instabilities. However, except a few
specific cases, the efficacy of simple profiles has remained limited to the
linear stability paradigm. In this work we have proposed a general framework
that can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution of a variety of stratified
shear instabilities as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction
problems having simple profiles. To this effect, we have modified the classical
vortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces,
and furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface.
The latter is more subtle, and originates from the understanding that
Bernoulli's equation is not just limited to irrotational flows, but can be
modified to make it applicable for piecewise velocity profiles. We have solved
diverse problems that can be essentially reduced to the multiple interacting
interfaces paradigm, e.g. spilling and plunging breakers, stratified shear
instabilities like Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield, jet flows, and even
wave-topography interaction problem like Bragg resonance. Free-slip boundary
being a vortex sheet, its effect can also be effectively captured using vortex
method. We found that the minimal models capture key nonlinear features, e.g.
wave breaking features like cusp formation and roll-ups, which are observed in
experiments and/or extensive simulations with smooth, realistic profiles.

than the exception. Different approaches on high performance computing (HPC)
systems have been introduced, to prevent failures (e. g., redundancy) or at
least minimize their impacts (e. g., checkpoint and restart). In most cases,
when these approaches are employed to increase the resilience of certain parts
of a system, energy consumption rapidly increases, or performance significantly
degrades. To address this challenge, we propose on-demand resilience as an
approach to achieve adaptive resilience in HPC systems. In this work, the HPC
system is considered in its entirety and resilience mechanisms such as
checkpointing, isolation, and migration, are activated on-demand. Using the
proposed approach, the unavoidable increase in total energy consumption and
system performance degradation is decreased compared to the typical
checkpoint/restart and redundant resilience mechanisms. Our work aims to
mitigate a large number of failures occurring at various layers in the system,
to prevent their propagation, and to minimize their impact, all of this in an
energy-saving manner. In the case of failures that are estimated to occur but

utilizing the gradient-descent method. We calculate the weights in the cost
function by taking into account perturbations in both RSSI measurements and
anchor node position information while assuming normal distribution for the
perturbations in the anchor node position information and log-normal
distribution for the RSSI-induced distance estimates. The latter assumption is
due to considering the log-distance path-loss model with normally-distributed
perturbations for the RSSI measurements in the logarithmic scale. We also
derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound associated with the considered position

considering various arbitrary network topologies and compare it with an
existing algorithm that is based on a similar approach but only accounts for
perturbations in the RSSI measurements. The experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm yields significant improvement in localization performance

This makes the proposed algorithm suitable for real-world applications where
the information available about the positions of anchor nodes often suffer from

large oscillations, by fast return to a weakly excited state. Such behavior
corresponds to an integrable Hamiltonian of the form $H\propto
\sigma(E_2^{(1)}-E)(|b_+|^2 + |b_-|^2) -\epsilon(b_+ b_- + b_+^* b_-^*)
+u(|b_+|^4 +|b_-|^4) + w |b_+|^2|b_-|^2$ for two complex envelopes $b_\pm(t)$.
The results have been compared to parametric instabilities of vortex ring in
condensate with density $\rho(z,r)=1-r^2-\alpha z^2$, which take place at
$\alpha\approx 8/5$ and at $\alpha\approx 16/7$.

shear instability (VSI). Embedded planets feel a stochastic component in the

the interplay between a growing planet embedded in a protoplanetary disc and
the VSI-turbulence. We performed a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations for locally isothermal discs with embedded planets in the mass
range from 5 to 100 Earth masses. We study planets embedded in an inviscid disc
that is VSI unstable, becomes turbulent and generates angular momentum
transport with an effective $\alpha = 5 \cdot 10^{-4}$. This is compared to the
corresponding viscous disc using exactly this $\alpha$-value.
  In general we find that the planets have only a weak impact on the disc
turbulence. Only for the largest planet ($100 M_\oplus$) the turbulent activity
becomes enhanced inside of the planet. The depth and width of a gap created by
the more massive planets ($30, 100 M_\oplus$) in the turbulent disc equal
exactly that of the corresponding viscous case, leading to very similar torque
strengths acting on the planet, with small stochastic fluctuations for the VSI
disc. At the gap edges vortices are generated that are stronger and longer
lived in the VSI disc. Low mass planets (with $M_p \leq 10 M_\oplus$) do not
open gaps in the disc in both cases but generate for the turbulent disc an
over-density behind the planet that exerts a significant negative torque. This
can boost the inward migration in VSI turbulent discs well above the Type I
rate.
  Due to the finite turbulence level in realistic three-dimensional discs the
gap depth will always be limited and migration will not stall in inviscid
discs.

abundance of satellite galaxies corresponding to our observed number in the

suppressed power spectrum compared to the Cold Dark Matter case, independently
of the galaxy luminosity distribution. In particular, requiring the observed
number of satellite galaxies not to exceed the predicted abundance of Dark
Matter sub-halos yields a limit m_X >3 keV at 1-{\sigma} and m_X > 2.3 keV at

ultra-faint satellite galaxies in the Milky Way, is completely independent of

appreciable improvements with next observations. We extend our analysis to Dark

that are likely to be established. However, most of such methods overlook the
impact that the suggested links have on the capability of the network to spread
information. Indeed, such capability is directly correlated with both the
engagement of a single user and the revenue of online social networks. In this
paper, we study link recommendation systems from the point of view of
information diffusion. In detail, we consider the problem in which we are
allowed to spend a given budget to create new links so to suggest a bounded
number of possible persons to whom become friend in order to maximize the
influence of a given set of nodes. We model the influence diffusion in a
network with the popular Independent Cascade model.

of BFO. We present a systematic study of the effects of the U parameter on the
structural, ferroelectric and electronic properties of BFO. We find that the
structural and ferroelectric properties change negligibly in the range of U
typically considered for BFO (3-5 eV). In contrast, the electronic structure
varies significantly with U. In particular, we see large changes to the
character and curvature of the valence band maximum and conduction band
minimum, in addition to the expected increase in band gap, as U increases. Most
significantly, we find that the $t_{2g}$/$e_{g}$ ordering, expected from
crystal field theory, is inverted for U values larger than 4 eV. We therefore
recommend a U value of at most 4 eV to be applied to the Fe $d$ orbitals in
BFO. More generally, this study emphasises the need for systematic
investigations of the effects of the U parameter not merely on band gaps but on
the electronic structure as a whole, especially for strongly correlated
materials.

big data. Traditional dimensionality reduction approaches, such as principal
component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), have been
studied extensively in the past few decades. However, as the dimensionality of
data increases, the computational cost of traditional dimensionality reduction
methods grows exponentially, and the computation becomes prohibitively
intractable. These drawbacks have triggered the development of random
projection (RP) techniques, which map high-dimensional data onto a
low-dimensional subspace with extremely reduced time cost. However, the RP
transformation matrix is generated without considering the intrinsic structure
of the original data and usually leads to relatively high distortion.
Therefore, in recent years, methods based on RP have been proposed to address
this problem. In this paper, we summarize the methods used in different
situations to help practitioners to employ the proper techniques for their
specific applications. Meanwhile, we enumerate the benefits and limitations of
the various methods and provide further references for researchers to develop
novel RP-based approaches.

four bounding boxes generated from the automatically learned attention maps are
enough to cover 80% of the lesions labeled by an experienced ophthalmologist,
which shows good localization ability of the attention maps. By clustering
features at high response locations on the attention maps, we discover
meaningful clusters which contain potential lesions in diabetic retinopathy.

i.e., the magnitudes $|V_\varphi f|$ of its Gabor transform $$V_\varphi f
(x,y):=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)e^{-\pi (t-x)^2}e^{-2\pi \i y t}dt, \quad x,y\in
\mathbb{R}.$$ Such problems occur in a wide range of applications, from optical
imaging of nanoscale structures to audio processing and classification. While
it is well-known that the solution of the above Gabor phase retrieval problem
is unique up to natural identifications, the stability of the reconstruction
has remained wide open. The present paper discovers a deep and surprising
connection between phase retrieval, spectral clustering and spectral geometry.
We show that the stability of the Gabor phase reconstruction is bounded by the
reciprocal of the Cheeger constant of the flat metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$,
conformally multiplied with $|V_\varphi f|$. The Cheeger constant, in turn,
plays a prominent role in the field of spectral clustering, and it precisely
quantifies the `disconnectedness' of the measurements $V_\varphi f$.
  It has long been known that a disconnected support of the measurements
results in an instability -- our result for the first time provides a converse
in the sense that there are no other sources of instabilities.
  Due to the fundamental importance of Gabor phase retrieval in coherent
diffraction imaging, we also provide a new understanding of the stability
properties of these imaging techniques: Contrary to most classical problems in
imaging science whose regularization requires the promotion of smoothness or
sparsity, the correct regularization of the phase retrieval problem promotes
the `connectedness' of the measurements in terms of bounding the Cheeger
constant from below. Our work thus, for the first time, opens the door to the
development of efficient regularization strategies.

with variable dielectric permittivity, involving a parabolic equation with
singular nonlinearity. We study the touchdown, or quenching, phenomenon.
Recently, the question whether or not touchdown can occur at zero points of the
premittivity profile f, which had long remained open, was answered negatively
for the case of interior points.
  The first aim of this article is to go further by considering the same
question at points of positive but small permittivity. We show that, in any
bounded domain, touchdown cannot occur at an interior point where the
permittivity profile is suitably small. We also obtain a similar result in the
boundary case, under a smallness assumption on f in a neighborhood of the
boundary. This allows in particular to construct f producing touchdown sets
concentrated near any given sphere.
  Our next aim is to obtain more information on the structure and properties of
the touchdown set. In particular, we show that the touchdown set need not in
general be localized near the maximum points of the premittivity profile f. In
the radial case in a ball, we show the existence of M-shaped profiles for which
the touchdown set is located far away from the maximum points of f and we even
obtain strictly convex f for which touchdown occurs at the unique minimum point
of f. These results show that some kind of smallness condition as above cannot
be avoided in order to rule out touchdown at a point.
  On the other hand, we construct profiles f producing more complex behaviors:
in any bounded domain the touchdown set may be concentrated near two
arbitrarily given points, or two arbitrarily given (n-1)-dimensional spheres in
a ball. These examples are obtained as a consequence of stability results for
the touchdown time and touchdown set under small perturbations of the
permittivity profile.

Hamiltonian systems which can exhibit secular energy transfer from

analogous to the steady transfer of energy in a combustion engine from the high
Terahertz frequencies of molecular excitations to the low kilohertz frequencies
of piston motion. Classical daemons achieve downconversion within a small,
closed system by exploiting nonlinear resonances; the adiabatic theorem permits
their operation but imposes non-trivial limitations on their efficiency. Here
we investigate a simple example of a quantum mechanical daemon. In the
correspondence regime it obeys similar efficiency limits to its classical
counterparts, but in the strongly quantum mechanical regime the daemon operates
in an entirely different manner. It maintains an engine-like behavior in a
distinctly quantum mechanical form: a weight is lifted at a steady average
speed through a long sequence of quantum jumps in momentum, at each of which a
quantum of fuel is consumed. The quantum daemon can cease downconversion at any
time through non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions, and continuing operation
of the quantum daemon is associated with steadily growing entanglement between
fast and slow degrees of freedom.

results in unfeasible amounts of computation and high memory requirements. In
this paper, we demonstrate how the localized orthogonal decomposition method

low cost of solving a series of small, localized elliptic problems. We prove
second-order convergence (except for a logarithmic factor) in the $L^2$

These results are both independent of the multiscale variations in the state

several fundamental results such as the homotopy extension and lifting
property, which we use to prove the $M$-equivariant Whitehead theorems. We

left-$\mathrm{F}_n$ and left geometric dimension are then defined for monoids

monoids which are important in the theory of string rewriting systems,
including $\mathrm{FP}_n$, cohomological dimension, and Hochschild
cohomological dimension. We also develop the corresponding theory of
$M$-equivariant collapsing schemes (that is, $M$-equivariant discrete Morse
theory), and among other things apply it to give topological proofs of results
of Anick, Squier and Kobayashi that monoids which admit presentations by
complete rewriting systems are left-, right- and bi-$\mathrm{FP}_\infty$.

processes can be thought of as being generated by a time-varying generative
model. A nearby descriptive model for visual processes is thus a statistical
distribution that varies over time. Specifically, modeling visual processes as
streams of histograms generated by a kernelized linear dynamic system turns out
to be efficient. We refer to such a model as a System of Bags. In this work, we
investigate Systems of Bags with special emphasis on dynamic scenes and dynamic
textures. Parameters of linear dynamic systems suffer from ambiguities. In
order to cope with these ambiguities in the kernelized setting, we develop a
kernelized version of the alignment distance. For its computation, we use a
Jacobi-type method and prove its convergence to a set of critical points. We
employ it as a dissimilarity measure on Systems of Bags. As such, it
outperforms other known dissimilarity measures for kernelized linear dynamic
systems, in particular the Martin Distance and the Maximum Singular Value
Distance, in every tested classification setting. A considerable margin can be
observed in settings, where classification is performed with respect to an
abstract mean of video sets. For this scenario, the presented approach can
outperform state-of-the-art techniques, such as Dynamic Fractal Spectrum or
Orthogonal Tensor Dictionary Learning.

such as end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection
fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and ventricular mass (VM) are clinically
well established. Image segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming, due
to the complex anatomy of the human heart.
  Objectives: This study introduces $\nu$-net (/nju:n$\varepsilon$t/) -- a deep
learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of
right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction
of cardiac function parameters.
  Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to
train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4
different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases.
  Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95,
and 80 % (95 %), and for RV EF 96, and 87 % (80 %) on the respective data sets
(human expert ICCs reported in parenthesis). The LV VM ICC is 95, and 94 % (84
%), and the RV VM ICC is 83, and 83 % (54 %). This study proposes a simple
adjustment procedure, allowing for the adaptation to distinct segmentation
philosophies. $\nu$-net exhibits state of-the-art performance in terms of dice
coefficient.
  Conclusions: Biventricular mass and function parameters can be determined
reliably in high quality by applying a deep neural network for cardiac MRI
segmentation, especially in the anatomically complex right ventricle. Adaption
to individual segmentation styles by applying a simple adjustment procedure is
viable, allowing for the processing of novel data without time-consuming
additional training.

demonstrate the fundamental mystery of quantum physics. The puzzling feature is
that the probability of an electron arriving at the detector when both slits
are open is not the sum of the probabilities when the slits are open
separately. The superposition principle of quantum mechanics tells us to add
amplitudes rather than probabilities and this results in interference. This
experiment defies our classical intuition that the probabilities of exclusive
events add. In understanding the emergence of the classical world from the
quantum one, there have been suggestions by Feynman, Diosi and Penrose that
gravity is responsible for suppressing interference. This idea has been pursued
in many different forms ever since, predominantly within Newtonian approaches
to gravity. In this paper, we propose and theoretically analyse two `gedanken'
or thought experiments which lend strong support to the idea that gravity is
responsible for decoherence. The first makes the point that thermal radiation
can suppress interference. The second shows that in an accelerating frame,
Unruh radiation plays the same role. Invoking the Einstein equivalence
principle to relate acceleration to gravity, we support the view that gravity
is responsible for decoherence.

in HBL, 1ES 1959+650, during January 2015-June 2016. The source underwent
significant flux enhancements showing two major outbursts (March 2015 and
October 2015) in optical, UV, X-rays and gamma-rays. Normally, HBLs are not
very active but 1ES 1959+650 has shown exceptional outburst activity across the
whole electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). We used the data from Fermi-LAT,
Swift-XRT & UVOT and optical data from Mt. Abu InfraRed Observatory (MIRO)
along with archival data from Steward Observatory to look for possible
connections between emissions at different energies and the nature of
variability during flaring state. During October 2015 outburst, thirteen nights
of optical follow-up observations showed brightest and the faintest nightly
averaged V-band magnitudes as 14.45(0.03) and 14.85(0.02), respectively. In
optical, the source showed a hint of optical intra-night variability during the
outburst. A significant short-term variability in optical during MJD 57344 to
MJD 57365 and in gamma-rays during MJD 57360 and MJD 57365 was also noticed.
Multiwavelength study suggests the flaring activity at all frequencies to be
correlated in general, albeit with diverse flare durations. We estimated the
strength of the magnetic field as 4.21 G using the time-lag between optical and
UV bands as synchrotron cooling time scale (2.34 hrs). The upper limits on the
sizes of both the emission regions, gamma-ray and optical, are estimated to be
of the order of 10^16cm using shortest variability time scales. The
quasi-simultaneous flux enhancements in 15 GHz and VHE gamma-ray emissions
indicates to a fresh injection of plasma into the jet, which interacts with a
standing sub-mm core resulting in co-spatial emissions across the EMS. The
complex and prolonged behavior of the second outburst in October 2015 is
discussed in detail.

independence structure between variables. In this class of models, Bayesian
structure learning is often done by search algorithms over the graph space. The
conjugate prior for the precision matrix satisfying graphical constraints is
the well-known G-Wishart. With this prior, the transition probabilities in the
search algorithms necessitate evaluating the ratios of the prior normalizing
constants of G-Wishart. In moderate to high-dimensions, this ratio is often
approximated using sampling-based methods as computationally expensive updates

computational bottleneck. We overcome this issue by representing a search
algorithm in which the ratio of normalizing constant is carried out by an
explicit closed-form approximation. Using this approximation within our search
algorithm yields significant improvement in the scalability of structure
learning without sacrificing structure learning accuracy. We study the
conditions under which the approximation is valid. We also evaluate the

states that the number of probabilistic or algorithmic facts which can be
inferred from a text drawn from a process must be roughly smaller than the
number of distinct word-like strings detected in this text by means of the PPM
compression algorithm. We also observe that the number of the word-like strings
for a sample of plays by Shakespeare follows an empirical stepwise power law,
in a stark contrast to Markov processes. Hence we suppose that natural language

transmitter and receiver, where neither node has the information about the
battery state or energy availability at the other node. We consider a model
where data is successfully delivered only in slots where both nodes are active.
Energy loss occurs whenever one node turns on while the other node is in sleep
mode. In each slot, based on their own energy availability, the transmitter and
receiver need to independently decide whether or not to turn on, with the aim
of maximizing the long-term time-average throughput. We present an upper bound
on the throughput achievable by analyzing a genie-aided system that has
noncausal knowledge of the energy arrivals at both the nodes. Next, we propose
an online policy requiring an occasional one-bit feedback whose throughput is
within one bit of the upper bound, asymptotically in the battery size. In order
to further reduce the feedback required, we propose a time-dilated version of
the online policy. As the time dilation gets large, this policy does not
require any feedback and achieves the upper bound asymptotically in the battery
size. Inspired by this, we also propose a near-optimal fully uncoordinated
policy. We use Monte Carlo simulations to validate our theoretical results and
illustrate the performance of the proposed policies.

(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models, focusing on different control
policies: vaccination, isolation, culling, and reduction of transmission.
Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control
problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove
that, for all the policies investigated, only bang-bang controls with at most
one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay
the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the
maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with
previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total
infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the
maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our
results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be
impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the
epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted
additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed
also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the
switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak
of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for
livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority

Crossing symmetries determine their free field value up to numeric constants.
The contributions from different supermultiplets to the partial wave expansion

established results at strong and weak coupling. In the large $N$, strong
coupling limit, non-trivial cancellations are found between the free field
values and results from supergravity. In the perturbative case values are
obtained for the anomalous dimensions of lowest twist operators and the
correction to the coupling by analysing the conformal wave expansions of
certain hypergeometric and logarithmic functions. Next, we attempt to count
shortened ${\cal N}=4$ SYM operators, beginning by constructing from
fundamental fields the most general operators belonging to certain $SU(4)_R$
representations at low twists. The number of independent solutions to the
conditions imposed on such operators is found via a combinatoric approach.
Generating functions for the number of operators with spin $\ell=0,1,2,\dotsc$

representations at low twist in various sectors of the theory. The asymptotic
behaviour at large twist is also considered. Finally the conformal field theory

In particular, in the context of deep learning, we empirically show that the

zero, (2) and outliers away from the bulk. We present numerical evidence and
mathematical justifications to the following conjectures laid out by Sagun et
al. (2016): Fixing data, increasing the number of parameters merely scales the
bulk of the spectrum; fixing the dimension and changing the data (for instance
adding more clusters or making the data less separable) only affects the
outliers. We believe that our observations have striking implications for
non-convex optimization in high dimensions. First, the flatness of such
landscapes (which can be measured by the singularity of the Hessian) implies
that classical notions of basins of attraction may be quite misleading. And
that the discussion of wide/narrow basins may be in need of a new perspective
around over-parametrization and redundancy that are able to create large
connected components at the bottom of the landscape. Second, the dependence of
small number of large eigenvalues to the data distribution can be linked to the
spectrum of the covariance matrix of gradients of model outputs. With this in
mind, we may reevaluate the connections within the data-architecture-algorithm
framework of a model, hoping that it would shed light into the geometry of
high-dimensional and non-convex spaces in modern applications. In particular,
we present a case that links the two observations: small and large batch
gradient descent appear to converge to different basins of attraction but we
show that they are in fact connected through their flat region and so belong to
the same basin.

three-dimensional ($\nu, St, e$)-space that delineates the regions of ignited

particle-phase shear viscosity and the normal stress differences are obtained,
along with related scaling relations on the quenched and ignited states. At any
$e$, the shear-viscosity undergoes a discontinuous jump with increasing shear
rate (i.e.~ discontinuous shear-thickening) at the ""quenched-ignited""

sign-change of ${\mathcal N}_2$ identified with the system making a transition

streetlights, residential, and vehicle lights) present specific time
signatures, and this feature makes it possible to estimate the amount of sky
brightness contributed by each one of them. Our approach is based on
transforming the time representation of the zenithal sky brightness into a
modal coefficients one, in terms of the time course signatures of the sources.
The modal coefficients, and hence the absolute and relative contributions of
each type of source, can be estimated from the measured brightness by means of
linear least squares fits. A method for determining the time signatures is
described, based on wide-field time-lapse photometry of the urban nightscape.
Our preliminary results suggest that artificial light leaking out of the

the field of robotics. In the large environment, mapping can be significantly
accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment.
Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by
different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an
approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion
averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for
map merging from a set of relative motions. Therefore, it firstly adopts the
pair-wise map merging method to estimate relative motions for grid map pairs.
To obtain as many reliable relative motions as possible, a graph-based sampling
scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable relative motions obtained
from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can
be recovered from the set of reliable relative motions by the motion averaging.
Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that proposed
approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good
performances.

the internal rotation of the Sun. The goal is to measure CH rotation rates and
study their distribution over latitude and their area sizes. In addition, the
CH rotation rates are compared with the solar photospheric and inner layer
rotational profiles. We study coronal holes observed within $\pm 60$ latitude
and longitude degrees from the solar disc centre during the time span from the
1 January 2013 to 20 April 2015, which includes the extended peak of solar
cycle 24.We used data created by the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm
(SPoCA), which provides the exact location and characterisation of solar
coronal holes using SDO=AIA 193 {\AA} channel images. The CH rotation rates are
measured with four-hour cadence data to track variable positions of the CH
geometric centre. North-south asymmetry was found in the distribution of
coronal holes: about 60 percent were observed in the northern hemisphere and 40
percent were observed in the southern hemisphere. The smallest and largest CHs
were present only at high latitudes. The average sidereal rotation rate for 540
examined CHs is $13:86 (\pm 0:05)$ degrees/d. Conclusions. The latitudinal
characteristics of CH rotation do not match any known photospheric rotation
profile. The CH angular velocities exceed the photospheric angular velocities
at latitudes higher than 35-40 degrees. According to our results, the CH
rotation profile perfectly coincides with tachocline and the lower layers of
convection zone at around 0.71 $R_{\odot}$; this indicates that CHs may be
linked to the solar global magnetic field, which originates in the tachocline
region.

is developed for an optomechanical system composed of a single mode cavity

which depend on the relative phase of the coupling strengths of the field modes
to the mechanical mode. We show several interesting phase dependent effects
such as reversible population transfer from one field mode to the other,
creation of collective modes, and induced coherence without induced emission.
These effects result from perfect mutual coherence between the field modes
which is preserved even if one of the modes is not populated. Depending on the
phase, the field modes can act on the mechanical mode collectively or
individually resulting, respectively, in tripartite or bipartite entanglement.
In addition, we examine the phase sensitivity of quantum steering of the
mechanical mode by the field modes is investigated. Deterministic phase
transfer of the steering from bipartite to collective is predicted and optimum
steering corresponding to perfect EPR state can be achieved. These different
types of quantum steering can be distinguished experimentally by measuring the
coincidence rate between two detectors adjusted to collect photons of the
output cavity modes. In particular, we find that the minima of the interference
pattern of the coincidence rate signal the bipartite steering, while the maxima
signal the collective steering.

recognized to follow binomial distribution. Is this recognition exactly true?
This study presents a solid theoretical derivation to prove whether the
isotopologue distributions of organochlorines are binomial or not, and
investigates the implications of the distributions to relevant experimental
studies. During synthetic reactions, the C-Cl bonds with stronger strengths are
more readily to be formed with heavy isotopes. The chlorine KIEs are higher
during the breakages of the stronger C-Cl bonds than during the breaking of the
weaker ones. For a synthetic organochlorine, if the rate-limiting step during a
chlorination reaction is the formation of C-Cl bonds, then chlorine KIE takes
effect in the reaction, resulting in always higher chlorine isotope ratio on
the reaction position than that of the initial chlorine atoms from the chlorine
source. Chlorine KIEs vary during different chlorination reactions, leading to
inconsistent chlorine isotope ratios on different reaction positions of
asymmetric reaction intermediates and final products. If the rate-determining
step is the generation of reactive chlorine atoms and the initial isotope ratio
of the chlorine source is constant, then the chlorine isotope ratios on the
reaction positions of all intermediates and final products are equivalent,
demonstrating that the isotopologues follow binomial distribution. After
physical changes and dechlorination reactions, organochlorines in the
environment are unlikely binomially distributed. Experimental data show that
the detected isotopologues of all the investigated organochlorines disobeyed
binomial distribution. This study may bring a new perspective about the
chlorine isotopologue distributions of organochlorines, and the proposed
solutions may help to obtain better data for quantification and CSIA-Cl of
organochlorines.

precession effects is possible provided that the Fermi level electron passes
many times near the same adatom with the same momentum. In order to arrange for
these conditions a circular n-p junction can be introduced to the ribbon by
e.g. potential of the tip of an atomic force microscope. In the quantum Hall

complex domain have been located in mathematical and physical literature for
some decades. Polynomials traditionally called complex Hermite ones are mostly
understood as polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$ which in fact makes them
polynomials in two real variables with complex coefficients. The present paper
proposes to investigate for the first time holomorphic Hermite polynomials in
two variables. Their algebraic and analytic properties are developed here.
While the algebraic properties do not differ too much for those considered so
far, their analytic features are based on a kind of non-rotational
orthogonality invented by van Eijndhoven and Meyers. Inspired by their
invention we merely follow the idea of Bargmann's seminal paper (1961) giving
explicit construction of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces based on those
polynomials. ""Homotopic"" behavior of our new formation culminates in comparing
it to the very classical Bargmann space of two variables on one edge and the
aforementioned Hermite polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$ on the other. Unlike in
the case of Bargmann's basis our Hermite polynomials are not product ones but
factorize to it when bonded together with the first case of limit properties
leading both to the Bargmann basis and suitable form of the reproducing kernel.
Also in the second limit we recover standard results obeyed by Hermite
polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$.

flux of helicity in or out of the computational domain. We circumvent the
problem of the lack of gauge invariance in open domains by choosing a
particular gauge -- the winding gauge -- that provides a natural interpretation
in terms of average winding number of pairwise field lines. We use this gauge
precisely to define and measure the helicity and helicity flux for several
realizations of dynamo action. We find in these cases, that the system as a
whole does not break reflectional symmetry and the total helicity remains small
even in cases when substantial magnetic flux is generated. We find no
particular connection between the generation of magnetic flux and the helicity
or the helicity flux through the boundaries. We suggest that this result may be
due to the essentially nonlinear nature of the dynamo processes in MRT.

wide range of shape analysis problems such as point correspondences, semantic
segmentation, affordance prediction, and shape-to-scan matching. The descriptor
is produced by a convolutional network that is trained to embed geometrically
and semantically similar points close to one another in descriptor space. The
network processes surface neighborhoods around points on a shape that are
captured at multiple scales by a succession of progressively zoomed out views,
taken from carefully selected camera positions. We leverage two extremely large
sources of data to train our network. First, since our network processes
rendered views in the form of 2D images, we repurpose architectures pre-trained
on massive image datasets. Second, we automatically generate a synthetic dense
point correspondence dataset by non-rigid alignment of corresponding shape
parts in a large collection of segmented 3D models. As a result of these design
choices, our network effectively encodes multi-scale local context and
fine-grained surface detail. Our network can be trained to produce either
category-specific descriptors or more generic descriptors by learning from
multiple shape categories. Once trained, at test time, the network extracts
local descriptors for shapes without requiring any part segmentation as input.
Our method can produce effective local descriptors even for shapes whose
category is unknown or different from the ones used while training. We
demonstrate through several experiments that our learned local descriptors are
more discriminative compared to state of the art alternatives, and are
effective in a variety of shape analysis applications.

shells may be deviated from chemical equilibrium in neutron stars which accrete
at several tenths of the local Eddington accretion rate. The deviation depends
on the energy threshold of the parent and daughter nuclei, the transition
strength, the temperature, and the local accretion rate. In a typical crust
model of accreting neutron stars, the chemical departures range from a few
tenths of kBT to tens of kBT for various Urca pairs. If the Urca shell can
exist in crusts of accreting neutron stars, compression may enhance the net
neutrino cooling rate by a factor of about 1 ? 2 relative to the neutrino
emissivity in chemical equilibrium. For some cases, such as Urca pairs with
small energy thresholds and/or weak transition strength, the large chemical
departure may result in net heating rather than cooling, although the released
heat can be small. Strong Urca pairs in the deep crust are hard to be deviated

by structured losses. Further, it introduces discrepancies between training and
predicting (such as exposure bias) that may hurt test performance. Instead,
SEARNN leverages test-alike search space exploration to introduce global-local
losses that are closer to the test error. We first demonstrate improved
performance over MLE on two different tasks: OCR and spelling correction. Then,
we propose a subsampling strategy to enable SEARNN to scale to large vocabulary

  Classification",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Videos are inherently multimodal. This paper studies the problem of how to
fully exploit the abundant multimodal clues for improved video categorization.
We introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates useful clues from
multiple modalities, including static spatial appearance information, motion
patterns within a short time window, audio information as well as long-range
temporal dynamics. More specifically, we utilize three Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) operating on appearance, motion and audio signals to extract
their corresponding features. We then employ a feature fusion network to derive
a unified representation with an aim to capture the relationships among
features. Furthermore, to exploit the long-range temporal dynamics in videos,
we apply two Long Short Term Memory networks with extracted appearance and
motion features as inputs. Finally, we also propose to refine the prediction
scores by leveraging contextual relationships among video semantics. The hybrid
deep learning framework is able to exploit a comprehensive set of multimodal
features for video classification. Through an extensive set of experiments, we
demonstrate that (1) LSTM networks which model sequences in an explicitly
recurrent manner are highly complementary with CNN models; (2) the feature
fusion network which produces a fused representation through modeling feature
relationships outperforms alternative fusion strategies; (3) the semantic
context of video classes can help further refine the predictions for improved
performance. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101
and the Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV), provide strong quantitative evidence
that our framework achieves promising results: $93.1\%$ on the UCF-101 and
$84.5\%$ on the CCV, outperforming competing methods with clear margins.

aerofoil with leading edge serration in a subsonic turbulent stream. The model
makes use of the Fourier Expansion and Schwarzschild techniques in order to
solve a set of coupled differential equations iteratively and express the
far-field sound power spectral density in terms of the statistics of incoming
turbulent upwash velocity. The model has shown that the primary noise reduction
mechanism is due to the destructive interference of the scattered pressure
induced by the leading edge serrations. It has also shown that in order to
achieve significant sound reduction, the serration must satisfy two geometrical
criteria related to the serration sharpness and hydrodynamic properties of the
turbulence. A parametric study has been carried out and it is shown that
serrations can reduce the overall sound pressure level at most radiation
angles, particularly at downstream angles close to the aerofoil surface. The
sound directivity results have also shown that the use of leading edge
serration does not particularity change the dipolar pattern of the far-field
noise at low frequencies, but it changes the cardioid directivity pattern
associated with radiation from straight-edge scattering at high frequencies to
a tilted dipolar pattern.

the interacting system of neutral pions and photons at zero baryon chemical

The resulting spectrum contains one usual, relativistic photon state, and two
nonrelativistic modes, one of which is gapless and the other gapped.
Furthermore, we calculate the leading, one-loop contribution to the pressure of

exists, which features an unusual scaling with temperature and magnetic field,
$T^3B/f_\pi$, at low temperatures, $T\ll B/f_\pi$. Finally, we determine the

result is affected by a competition of the anisotropic kinematics and the

bubbles can be nucleated due to the quantum tunneling effect. It was recently
suggested that an evaporating black hole (BH) can be a catalyst of bubble
nucleations and dramatically shortens the lifetime of the false vacuum. In
particular, in the context of the Standard Model valid up to a certain energy
scale, even a single evaporating BH may spoil the successful cosmology by
inducing the decay of our electroweak vacuum. In this paper, we reinterpret
catalyzed vacuum decay by BHs, using an effective action for a thin-wall bubble
around a BH to clarify the meaning of bounce solutions. We calculate bounce
solutions in the limit of a flat spacetime and in the limit of negligible
backreaction to the metric, where it is much easier to understand the physical
meaning, and compare these results with the full calculations done in the
literature. As a result, we give a physical interpretation of the enhancement
factor: it is nothing but the probability of producing states with a finite
energy. This makes it clear that all the other states such as plasma should
also be generated through the same mechanism, and calls for finite-density
corrections to the tunneling rate which tend to stabilize the false vacuum. We
also clarify that the dominant process is always consistent with the
periodicity indicated by the BH Hawking temperature after summing over all
possible remnant BH masses or bubble energies, although the periodicity of each
bounce solution as a function of a remnant BH can be completely different from
the inverse temperature of the system as mentioned in the previous literature.

introduces a systematic error in fat percentage quantification in patients
where the differences in lipid chemical composition are significant, such as
for neuromuscular disorders, because of the spatial dependence of the peak
amplitudes. The present work aims to overcome this limitation by taking
advantage of an unsupervised clusterization-based approach offering a reliable
criterion to carry out a data-driven segmentation of the input MRI dataset into
multiple regions. The idea is to apply the clusterization for partitioning the
multi-echo MRI dataset into a finite number of clusters whose internal voxels
exhibit similar distance metrics. For each cluster, the estimation of the fat
spectral properties are evaluated with a self-calibration technique and finally
the fat-water percentages are computed via a non-linear fitting. The method is
tested in ad-hoc and public datasets. The overall performance and results in
terms of fitting accuracy, robustness and reproducibility are compared with
other state-of-the-art CSE algorithms. This approach provides a more accurate
and reproducible identification of chemical species, hence fat-water
separation, when compared with other calibrated and non-calibrated approaches.

The preserved global $U(1)$ of the clockwork appears as an accidental symmetry,
resulting from discrete or $U(1)$ gauge symmetries, and it is spontaneously
broken by the chiral condensates. We apply such a dynamical clockwork to
construct models with an effectively invisible QCD axion from TeV-scale strong
dynamics. The axion couplings are determined by the localisation of the
Standard Model interactions along the clockwork sequence. The TeV spectrum

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). The observations were made of a solar active region on
2015 December 18 as part of the ALMA science verification effort. A map of the
Sun's continuum emission of size $2.4' \times 2.3'$ was obtained by ALMA at a
wavelength of 1.25 mm (239 GHz) using mosaicing techniques. A contemporaneous
map of size $1.9'\times 2.9'$ was obtained in the Mg II h doublet line at
2803.5\AA\ by IRIS. Both mm/submm$-\lambda$ continuum emission and ultraviolet
(UV) line emission are believed to originate from the solar chromosphere and
both have the potential to serve as powerful and complementary diagnostics of
physical conditions in this poorly understood layer of the solar atmosphere.
While a clear correlation between mm-$\lambda$ brightness temperature $T_B$ and
the Mg II h line radiation temperature $T_{rad}$ is observed the slope is $<1$,
perhaps as a result of the fact that these diagnostics are sensitive to
different parts of the chromosphere and/or the Mg II h line source function
includes a scattering component. There is a significant offset between the mean
$T_B$(1.25 mm) and mean $T_{rad}$(Mg II), the former being $\approx 35\%$
greater than the latter. Partitioning the maps into ""sunspot"", ""quiet regions"",
and ""plage regions"" we find that the slope of the scatter plots between the
IRIS Mg II h line $T_{rad}$ and the ALMA brightness temperature $T_B$ is 0.4
(sunspot), 0.56 (quiet regions), and 0.66 (plage regions). We suggest that this
change may be caused by the regional dependence of the formation heights of the
IRIS and ALMA diagnostics, and/or the increased degree of coupling between the
UV source function and the local gas temperature in the hotter, denser gas in
plage regions.

the central 200 pc of the Milky Way by H.E.S.S. was found to follow the dense
matter distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) up to a longitudinal
distance of about 130 pc to the Galactic Centre (GC), where the flux rapidly
decreases. Recent sensitive H.E.S.S. analysis revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR)
density profile drops with the distance to the centre, making data compatible
with a steady cosmic PeVatron at the GC. In this paper, we extend this analysis
to obtain for the first time a detailed characterisation of the correlation
with matter and to search for additional features and individual gamma-ray
sources in the inner 200 pc. Taking advantage of 250 hours of H.E.S.S. data and
improved analysis techniques we perform a detailed morphology study of the
diffuse VHE emission observed from the GC ridge and reconstruct its total
spectrum. We show that the emission correlated with dense matter covers the
full CMZ and that its flux is about half the total diffuse emission flux. We
also detect some emission at higher latitude likely produced by hadronic
collisions of CRs in less dense regions of the GC interstellar medium. We
detect an additional emission component centred on the GC and extending over
about 15 pc that is consistent with the existence of a strong CR density
gradient and confirms the presence of a CR accelerator at the very centre of
our Galaxy. We show that the spectrum of the full ridge diffuse emission is
compatible with the one previously derived from the central regions, suggesting
that a single population of particles fills the entire CMZ. Finally, we report
the discovery of a VHE gamma-ray source near the GC radio arc and argue that it
is produced by the pulsar wind nebula candidate G0.13-0.11.

and relevant to many physical phenomena, ranging from electronic and magnetic
properties, metal-insulator transitions to improper ferroelectricity.
Hydrostatic pressure is an efficient way to tune and control octahedral
tiltings. However, the pressure behavior of such tiltings can dramatically
differ from one material to another, with the origins of such differences
remaining controversial. In this work, we discover several new mechanisms and
formulate a set of simple rules that allow to understand how pressure affects
oxygen octahedral tiltings, via the use and analysis of first-principles
results for a variety of compounds. Besides the known A-O interactions, we
reveal that the interactions between specific B-ions and oxygen ions contribute
to the tilting instability. We explain the previously reported trend that the
derivative of the oxygen octahedral tilting with respect to pressure (dR/dP)
usually decreases with both the tolerance factor and the ionization state of
the A-ion, by illustrating the key role of A-O interactions and their change
under pressure. Furthermore, three new mechanisms/rules are discovered. We
further predict that the polarization associated with the so-called hybrid
improper ferroelectricity could be manipulated by hydrostatic pressure, by
indirectly controlling the amplitude of octahedral rotations.

in magnetized plasmas in linear devices and tokamaks, so the study of
turbulence is important in limiting and controlling this transport. Linear
devices provide an axial magnetic field that serves to confine a plasma in
cylindrical geometry as it travels along the magnetic field from the source to
the strike point. Due to perpendicular transport, the plasma density and
temperature have a roughly Gaussian radial profile with gradients that drive
instabilities, such as resistive drift-waves and Kelvin-Helmholtz. If unstable,
these instabilities cause perturbations to grow resulting in saturated
turbulence, increasing the cross-field transport of heat and particles. When
the plasma emerges from the source, there is a time, $\tau_{\parallel}$, that
describes the lifetime of the plasma based on parallel velocity and length of
the device. As the plasma moves down the device, it also moves azimuthally
according to $E\times B$ and diamagnetic velocities. There is a balance point
in these parallel and perpendicular times that sets the stabilisation
threshold. We simulate plasmas with a variety of parallel lengths and magnetic
fields to vary the parallel and perpendicular lifetimes, respectively, and find
that there is a clear correlation between the saturated RMS density
perturbation level and the balance between these lifetimes. The threshold of
marginal stability is seen to exist where
$\tau_{\parallel}\approx11\tau_{\perp}$. This is also associated with the
product $\tau_{\parallel}\gamma_*$, where $\gamma_*$ is the drift-wave linear
growth rate, indicating that the instability must exist for roughly 100 times
the growth time for the instability to enter the non-linear growth phase. We
explore the root of this correlation and the implications for linear device
design.

satisfy passivity and have restrictions on not only a few, but all derivatives
of the relaxation modulus. This is the important class of completely monotone
systems. It is the only class where the medium is modeled as a system of
springs and dampers with positive parameters. It is shown here that the
attenuation as a function of frequency for such media has to increase slower
than a linear function. Likewise the phase velocity has to increase
monotonically. This gives criteria on which one may judge whether a proposed
wave equation is passive or not, as illustrated by comparing two different
versions of the viscous wave equation.

mass dispersion relation, which is equivalent to the relativistic
energy-momentum dispersion, however, with a positive quadratic norm of the
resulting quaternion space. Then, we define the quaternion particle velocity,
which can be applied to relativistic particles and electrons in non-parabolic
solid-state materials. We show that the relativistic Lorentz expressions apply
only to the absolute values of the time, mass and velocity while the physical
4-vector quantities are described by real quaternions. Finally, we introduce
the quaternion electromagnetic potential and demonstrate that it has an effect
on the particle mass and velocity. In particular, we show a direct connection
between the electrostatic potential and the particle rest mass. We compare the
present model to experimental measurements of the electron velocity in InSb
where we demonstrate quasi-relativistic electron velocity saturation at high
electric fields. Therefore, it appears that physical quantities can be

Lorentz transformations correspond to the quaternion absolute values. It seems
that the quaternion approach presented here can be used as a basis for an

flat-panel cone-beam CT (FP-CBCT) systems, typical implementations ignore both
spatial correlations in the projection data as well as system blurs due to the
detector and focal spot in the x-ray source. In this work, we develop a forward
model for flat-panel-based systems that includes blur and noise correlation
associated with finite focal spot size and an indirect detector (e.g.,
scintillator). This forward model is used to develop a staged reconstruction
framework where projection data are deconvolved and log-transformed, followed
by a generalized least-squares reconstruction that utilizes a non-diagonal
statistical weighting to account for the correlation that arises from the
acquisition and data processing chain. We investigate the performance of this
novel reconstruction approach in both simulated data and in CBCT test-bench

methods that ignore noise correlation, the proposed approach yields a superior
noise-resolution tradeoff. For example, for a system with 0.34 mm FWHM
scintillator blur and 0.70 FWHM focal spot blur, using the a correlated noise
model instead of an uncorrelated noise model increased resolution by 42% (with
variance matched at 6.9 x 10^-8 mm^-2 ). While this advantage holds across a
wide range of systems with differing blur characteristics, the improvements are
greatest for systems where source blur is larger than detector blur.

unknown inputs in time fractional diffusion models. In many inference problems,
the posterior may be concentrated in a small portion of the entire prior
support. It will be much more efficient if we build and simulate a surrogate
only over the significant region of the posterior. To this end, we construct a
coarse model using Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM), and
solve a least-squares problem for the coarse model with a regularizing
Levenberg-Marquart algorithm. An intermediate distribution is built based on
the approximate sampling distribution. For Bayesian inference, we use GMsFEM
and least-squares stochastic collocation method to obtain a reduced coarse
model based on the intermediate distribution. To increase the sampling speed of
Markov chain Monte Carlo, the DREAM$_\text{ZS}$ algorithm is used to explore
the surrogate posterior density, which is based on the surrogate likelihood and
the intermediate distribution. The proposed method with lower gPC order gives
the approximate posterior as accurate as the the surrogate model directly based
on the original prior.
  A few numerical examples for time fractional diffusion equations are carried
out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with applications of
the Bayesian inversion.

families; family history is therefore an important aspect for clinicians when
making risk predictions. Familial aggregation is often quantified in terms of a
familial relative risk (FRR), and although at first glance this measure may
seem simple and intuitive as an average risk prediction, its implications are
not straightforward.
  Methods: We use two statistical models for the distribution of disease risk
in a population: a dichotomous risk model that gives an intuitive understanding
of the implication of a given FRR, and a continuous risk model that facilitates
a more detailed computation of the inequalities in disease risk. Published
estimates of FRRs are used to produce Lorenz curves and Gini indices that
quantifies the inequalities in risk for a range of diseases.
  Results: We demonstrate that even a moderate familial association in disease
risk implies a very large difference in risk between individuals in the
population. We give examples of diseases for which this is likely to be true,
and we further demonstrate the relationship between the point estimates of FRRs
and the distribution of risk in the population.
  Conclusions: The variation in risk for several severe diseases may be larger
than the variation in income in many countries. The implications of familial
risk estimates should be recognized by epidemiologists and clinicians.

global channel state information (CSI) from the sole knowledge of individual
received signal power measurements, which makes dedicated feedback or
inter-transmitter signaling channels unnecessary. To make this possible, we
resort to a completely new technique whose key idea is to exploit the transmit
power levels as symbols to embed information and the observed interference as a
communication channel the transmitters can use to exchange coordination
information. Although the used technique allows any kind of {low-rate}
information to be exchanged among the transmitters, the focus here is to
exchange local CSI. The proposed procedure also comprises a phase which allows
local CSI to be estimated. Once an estimate of global CSI is acquired by the
transmitters, it can be used to optimize any utility function which depends on
it. While algorithms which use the same type of measurements such as the
iterative water-filling algorithm (IWFA) implement the sequential best-response
dynamics (BRD) applied to individual utilities, here, thanks to the
availability of global CSI, the BRD can be applied to the sum-utility.
Extensive numerical results show that significant gains can be obtained and,
this, by requiring no additional online signaling.
