transport along the $c$-axis of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ (YBCO),
induced by a mid-infrared optical pump pulse tuned to a specific lattice
vibration. To understand this transient non-equilibrium state, we develop a
pump-probe formalism for a stack of Josephson junctions, and we consider the
tunneling strengths in presence of modulation with an ultrashort optical pulse.
We demonstrate that a transient enhancement of the Josephson coupling can be
obtained for pulsed excitation and that this can be even larger than in a
continuously driven steady-state. Especially interesting is the conclusion that
the effect is largest when the material is parametrically driven at a frequency
immediately above the plasma frequency, in agreement with what is found
experimentally. For bilayer Josephson junctions, an enhancement similar to that
experimentally is predicted below the critical temperature $T_c$. This model
reproduces the essential features of the enhancement measured below $T_c$. To
reproduce the experimental results above $T_c$, we will explore extensions of
this model, such as in-plane and amplitude fluctuations, elsewhere.

MSSM gauge group is extended by an additional U(1)' group. Implementing the
universal boundary conditions at the GUT scale we target phenomenologically
interesting regions of UMSSM where the necessary radiative contributions to the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass are significantly small and LSP is always the
lightest neutralino. We find that the smallest amount of radiative
contributions is about 50 GeV in UMSSM, this result is much lower than that
obtained in MSSM, which is around 90 GeV. Additionally, we examine the Higgs
boson properties in these models to check if it can behave similar to the SM
Higgs boson under the current experimental constraints. We find that
enforcement of smaller radiative contribution mostly restricts the U(1)'
breaking scale as v_S <~ 10 TeV. Besides, such low contributions demand h_S ~
0.2 - 0.45. Because of the model dependency in realizing these radiative
contributions theta_E_6 < 0 are more favored, if one seeks for the solutions
consistent with the current dark matter constraints. As to the mass spectrum,
we find that stop and stau can be degenerate with the LSP neutralino in the
range from 300 GeV to 700 GeV; however, the dark matter constraints restrict
this scale as m_stop, m_stau >~ 500$ GeV. Such degenerate solutions also
predict stop-neutralino and stau-neutralino coannihilation channels, which are
effective to reduce the relic abundance of neutralino down to the ranges
consistent with the current dark matter observations. Finally, we discuss the
effects of heavy M_Z' in the fine-tuning. Even though the radiative
contributions are significantly low, the required fine-tuning can still be
large. We comment about reinterpretation of the fine-tuning measure in the
UMSSM framework, which can yield efficiently low results for the fine-tuning at

Earth's magnetic field. The primary detection mechanism of this compass sense
is uncertain but appears to involve the quantum spin dynamics of radical pairs
formed transiently in cryptochrome proteins. We propose here a new version of
the current model in which spin-selective recombination of the radical pair is
not essential. One of the two radicals is imagined to react with a paramagnetic
scavenger via spin-selective electron transfer. By means of simulations of the
spin dynamics of cryptochrome-inspired radical pairs, we show that the new
scheme offers two clear and important benefits. The sensitivity to a 50 {\mu}T
magnetic field is greatly enhanced and, unlike the current model, the radicals
can be more than 2 nm apart in the magnetoreceptor protein. The latter means
that animal cryptochromes that have a tetrad (rather than a triad) of
tryptophan electron donors can still be expected to be viable as magnetic
compass sensors. Lifting the restriction on the rate of the spin-selective
recombination reaction also means that the detrimental effects of inter-radical
exchange and dipolar interactions can be minimised by placing the radicals much
further apart than in the current model.

allows a software system to inspect and/or modify the behaviour of its classes,
interfaces, methods and fields at runtime, enabling the software to adapt to
dynamically changing runtime environments. However, this dynamic language
feature imposes significant challenges to static analysis, because the
behaviour of reflection-rich software is logically complex and statically hard
to predict, especially when manipulated frequently by statically unknown string
values. As a result, existing static analysis tools either ignore reflection or
handle it partially, resulting in missed, important behaviours, i.e., unsound
results. Therefore, improving or even achieving soundness in (static)
reflection analysis -- an analysis that infers statically the behaviour of
reflective code -- will provide significant benefits to many analysis clients,
such as bug detectors, security analyzers and program verifiers. This paper
makes two contributions: we provide a comprehensive understanding of Java
reflection through examining its underlying concept, API and real-world usage,
and, building on this, we introduce a new static approach to resolving Java
reflection effectively in practice. We have implemented our reflection analysis
in an open-source tool, called SOLAR, and evaluated its effectiveness
extensively with large Java programs and libraries. Our experimental results
demonstrate that SOLAR is able to (1) resolve reflection more soundly than the
state-of-the-art reflection analysis; (2) automatically and accurately identify
the parts of the program where reflection is resolved unsoundly or imprecisely;
and (3) guide users to iteratively refine the analysis results by using
lightweight annotations until their specific requirements are satisfied.

and the metallicity dependence of mass-loss rate. Our simulations follow
hydrodynamics, extreme and far ultra-violet radiative transfer, and
non-equilibrium chemistry in a self-consistent manner. Dust grain temperatures
are also calculated consistently by solving the radiative transfer of the
stellar irradiation and grain (re-)emission. We vary the disk gas metallicity
over a wide range of $10^{-4}~ Z_\odot \leq Z \leq 10 ~Z_\odot$. The
photoevaporation rate is lower with higher metallicity in the range of $10^{-1}
\,Z_\odot \lesssim Z \lesssim 10 \,Z_\odot$, because dust shielding effectively
prevents far-ultra violet (FUV) photons from penetrating into and heating the
dense regions of the disk. The photoevaporation rate sharply declines at even
lower metallicities in $10^{-2} \,Z_\odot \lesssim Z \lesssim
10^{-1}\,Z_\odot$, because FUV photoelectric heating becomes less effective
than dust-gas collisional cooling. The temperature in the neutral region
decreases, and photoevaporative flows are excited only in an outer region of
the disk. At $10^{-4}\,Z_\odot \leq Z \lesssim 10^{-2}\,Z_\odot$, HI
photoionization heating acts as a dominant gas heating process and drives
photoevaporative flows with roughly a constant rate. The typical disk lifetime
is shorter at $Z=0.3~Z_\odot$ than at $Z = Z_\odot$, being consistent with
recent observations of the extreme outer galaxy.

Due to dephasing, the entropy eventually saturates to a stationary value, in
spite of the lack of equilibration. We show that this long time limit of the
entropy reflects the semiclassical dynamics of the system, revealing the
self-trapping phase transition of the condensates at large interaction strength
by a sudden entropy jump. We compare the stationary limit of the entropy to the
prediction of a classical microcanonical ensemble, and find surprisingly good
agreement in spite of the non-equilibrium state of the system. Our predictions

dissipation) on the phenomenology of the gap softness in the tunnel
spectroscopy of the normal-superconductor junction as a function of spin
splitting and chemical potential. We find that all three mechanisms
individually can produce a soft gap, leading to calculated conductance spectra
qualitatively mimicking experimental results. We also show that the
phenomenology of the soft gap is intrinsically tied to the broadening and the
height of the Majorana zero mode(MZM)-induced differential conductance peak
above the topological quantum phase transition point with both the soft gap and
the quality of the MZM being simultaneously affected by tunnel barrier,
temperature, and dissipation. We establish that the MZM splitting oscillations
can be suppressed by temperature or dissipation, but not by the tunnel barrier.
Since all three mechanisms are likely to be present in any realistic nanowires,
discerning the effects of various mechanisms is difficult, necessitating
detailed experimental data as a function of all the system parameters, some of
which (e.g., dissipation, chemical potential, tunnel barrier) may not be known
experimentally. While the tunneling-induced soft-gap behavior is benign with no
direct adverse effect on the Majorana topological properties with the zero-bias
peak remaining quantized at $2e^2/h$, the soft gap induced by finite
temperature and/or finite dissipation is detrimental to topological properties
and must be avoided as much as possible.

vacancy should significantly enhance the sensing ability of the WSe2 monolayer
toward the H2O and N2 molecules. In contrast, CO and NO molecules highly prefer
to be molecularly chemisorbed on the VSe surface with the non-oxygen atom
occupying the Se site. Further, the exposed O atoms of the molecularly
chemisorbed CO or NO can be reacted with the additional CO or NO molecule, to
produce the C-doped or N-doped WSe2 monolayer. Our electronic structure
calculations show that the WSe2 monolayers are p-doped by the CO and NO
molecules, as well as the C and N atoms. The calculated energies suggest that
the filling of the CO or NO molecule and the removal of the exposed O atom by
the additional CO or NO molecule are both energetically and dynamically
favorable. However, only the NO molecule and N atom doped WSe2 monolayers
exhibit significantly improved electronic structures compared with the

form a O-doped WSe2 with a physisorbed NO or N2. After desorbing the

defect levels due to the Se vacancy can be completely removed. The calculated

various real-world node-attack and node-failure scenarios. We show that failure
mitigation through increased node protection can be effectively achieved
against single node failures. However, mitigating against multiple node

witness to having a working quantum repeater. In this paper, we extend a recent
advance [Liuzzo-Scorpo et al., arXiv:1705.03017] in the theory of the

consequence of this extension, we find tighter upper bounds on the

a more realistic model of communication than the pure-loss bosonic channel,

  Power Company","IEEE PES General Meeting 2017 (Best Paper Award)",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An online PMU-assisted Power System Parameter Calibration System (PSPCS) was
recently developed and implemented at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company
(JEPC). PSPCS leverages high-resolution PMU data and data mining techniques to
perform online screening of the EMS and Production Management System (PMS)
databases for data cleaning, model validation, and parameter calibration. PSPCS
calculates transmission line and generator parameters on a regular real-time
basis and compares the results with databases to identify record(s) with
significant discrepancy, if any. Once consistent discrepancy is observed, the
system will raise a flag and further investigation will be initiated, including
a novel density-based spatial clustering procedure for parameter/data
calibration. A novel metric is proposed to quantify the credibility of
PMU-based parameter identification. This paper discusses the proposed
methodologies, challenges, as well as implementation issues identified during
the development and deployment of PSPCS.

to a significant effort towards their experimental realization. In particular,
the Fermi surfaces of chiral semimetals carry quantized Chern numbers, making
them an attractive platform for the observation of exotic transport and optical
phenomena. While the simplest example of a chiral fermion in condensed matter
is a conventional $|C|=1$ Weyl fermion, recent theoretical works have proposed
a number of unconventional chiral fermions beyond the Standard Model which are
protected by unique combinations of topology and crystalline symmetries.
However, materials candidates for experimentally probing the transport and
response signatures of these unconventional fermions have thus far remained
elusive. In this paper, we propose the RhSi family in space group (SG) $\#$198
as the ideal platform for the experimental examination of unconventional chiral
fermions. We find that RhSi is a filling-enforced semimetal that features near
its Fermi surface a chiral double six-fold-degenerate spin-1 Weyl node at $R$
and a previously uncharacterized four-fold-degenerate chiral fermion at
$\Gamma$. Each unconventional fermion displays Chern number $\pm4$ at the Fermi
level. We also show that RhSi displays the largest possible momentum separation
of compensative chiral fermions, the largest proposed topologically nontrivial
energy window, and the longest possible Fermi arcs on its surface. We conclude
by proposing signatures of an exotic bulk photogalvanic response in RhSi.

variety of reasons, e.g. efficient use of labeled data (semi-supervised
learning), transfer learning and understanding hidden structure of data.
Popular techniques for representation learning include clustering, manifold
learning, kernel-learning, autoencoders, Boltzmann machines, etc.
  To study the relative merits of these techniques, it's essential to formalize
the definition and goals of representation learning, so that they are all
become instances of the same definition. This paper introduces such a formal
framework that also formalizes the utility of learning the representation. It
is related to previous Bayesian notions, but with some new twists. We show the
usefulness of our framework by exhibiting simple and natural settings -- linear
mixture models and loglinear models, where the power of representation learning
can be formally shown. In these examples, representation learning can be
performed provably and efficiently under plausible assumptions (despite being
NP-hard), and furthermore: (i) it greatly reduces the need for labeled data
(semi-supervised learning) and (ii) it allows solving classification tasks when
simpler approaches like nearest neighbors require too much data (iii) it is
more powerful than manifold learning methods.

raising the temperature close to the clearing point. The shell confinement
leads to new states and associated surface structures: a state where large
stripes on the shell can be filled with smaller, perpendicular sub-stripes, and
a focal conic domain (FCD) state, where thin stripes wrap into at least two,
topologically required, double spirals. Focusing on the latter state, we use a
Landau-de Gennes model of the CLC to simulate its detailed configurations as a
function of anchoring strength. By abruptly changing the topological
constraints on the shell, we are able to study the interconversion between
director defects and pitch defects, a phenomenon usually restricted by the
complexity of the cholesteric phase. This work extends the knowledge of
cholesteric patterns, structures that not only have potential for use as
intricate, self-assembly blueprints but are pervasive in biological systems.

nearest minimum energy path. The computational effort can be large, especially
when ab initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate
the energy and atomic forces. Here, we show how the number of such evaluations

approach where an approximate energy surface is generated and refined in each
iteration. When the goal is to evaluate the transition rate within harmonic
transition state theory, the evaluation of the Hessian matrix at the initial

minimum energy path calculation, thereby improving stability and reducing the
number of iterations needed for convergence. A Gaussian process model also
provides an uncertainty estimate for the approximate energy surface, and this
can be used to focus the calculations on the lesser-known part of the path,
thereby reducing the number of needed energy and force evaluations to a half in
the present calculations. The methodology is illustrated using the

one step closer to many practical implications. Here we push forward this

of silver nanoantennas and the distance between them, we obtain an enhancement
of optical-to-THz conversion efficiency 2-fold larger compared with previously
reported results, and the strongest enhancement is around 1 THz, a frequency
range barely achievable by other compact THz sources. Moreover, we propose a
cost-effective fabrication procedure to realize such hybrid THz antennas with
optimized plasmonic nanostructures via thermal dewetting process, which does
not require any post processing and makes the proposed solution very attractive
for applications.

walking and running. The medial longitudinal arch (MLA) and the transverse
tarsal arch (TTA) are key adaptations that increase the human midfoot's
longitudinal bending stiffness. The TTA is hypothesized to increase stiffness
through a cross-axis coupling between transverse tissue stiffness and
longitudinal midfoot stiffness. However, we currently lack in vivo tests of
this hypothesis. Such tests are crucial because muscle contraction considerably
modulates MLA function and may also affect the TTA's predicted cross-axis
coupling. Here we show in vivo evidence for substantial cross-axis coupling in
standing human subjects. We found that longitudinal midfoot bending stiffness
increased upon increasing transverse forefoot stiffness using an elastic tape
(mean$\pm$standard error = $76\% \pm 19\%$, p=0.0002), thus supporting the TTA
hypothesis. The cross-axis coupling could be a potential therapeutic target for
some foot disorders and help augment foot stiffness for athletics.

flux larger than the observed) even considering the synchrotron self-absorption
effect. We investigate the possibility of this excess being produced from the

that (1) similar to one-zone modeling, the spine emissions provide good

such sources at z > 6 using the far-infrared [C II]{\lambda}157.74{\mu}m

for two galaxies at z = 6.8540+/-0.0003 and z = 6.8076+/-0.0002. Remarkably,
the [C II] line luminosity from these galaxies is higher than previously found
in `normal' star-forming galaxies at z > 6.5. This suggests that we are
sampling a part of the galaxy population different from the galaxies found

would suggest these galaxies have turbulent, yet rotation-dominated disks, with
similar stellar-to-dynamical mass fractions as observed for H{\alpha} emitting

the background are commonly observed in both atomic and molecular clouds. They
are also prominent in MHD simulations with turbulent converging shocks. The
simulated striations develop within a dense, stagnated sheet in the mid plane
of the post-shock region where magnetically-induced converging flows collide.
We show analytically that the secondary flows are an inevitable consequence of
the jump conditions of oblique MHD shocks. They produce the stagnated,
sheet-like sub-layer through a secondary shock when, roughly speaking, the
Alfv\'enic speed in the primary converging flows is supersonic, a condition
that is relatively easy to satisfy in interstellar clouds. The dense sub-layer
is naturally threaded by a strong magnetic field that lies close to the plane
of the sub-layer. The substantial magnetic field makes the sheet highly
anisotropic, which is the key to the striation formation. Specifically,
perturbations of the primary inflow that vary spatially perpendicular to the
magnetic field can easily roll up the sheet around the field lines without
bending them, creating corrugations that appear as magnetically-aligned
striations in column density maps. On the other hand, perturbations that vary
spatially along the field lines curve the sub-layer and alter its orientation
relative to the magnetic field locally, seeding special locations that become
slanted overdense filaments and prestellar cores through enhanced mass
accumulation along field lines. In our scenario, the dense sub-layer unique to
magnetized oblique shocks is the birthplace for both magnetically-aligned
diffuse striations and massive star-forming structures.

of the wireless propagation channels when calculating the downlink precoders
based on uplink pilots. However, the effective uplink and downlink channels
incorporating the analog radio front-ends of the base station (BS) and user
equipments (UEs) exhibit non-reciprocity due to non-identical behavior of the
individual transmit and receive chains. When downlink precoder is not aware of
such channel non-reciprocity (NRC), system performance can be significantly
degraded due to NRC induced interference terms. In this work, we consider a
general TDD-based massive MIMO system where frequency-response mismatches at
both the BS and UEs, as well as the mutual coupling mismatch at the BS
large-array system all coexist and induce channel NRC. Based on the
NRC-impaired signal models, we first propose a novel iterative estimation
method for acquiring both the BS and UE side NRC matrices and then also propose
a novel NRC-aware downlink precoder design which utilizes the obtained
estimates. Furthermore, an efficient pilot signaling scheme between the BS and
UEs is introduced in order to facilitate executing the proposed estimation
method and the NRC-aware precoding technique in practical systems.
Comprehensive numerical results indicate substantially improved spectral

an interesting issue. We can constrain the strength of the new gravitational
terms through observations of inflationary imprints in the actual universe. In
this paper we analyze the effects on slow-roll models due to a Chern-Simons
term coupled to the inflaton field through a generic coupling function
$f(\phi)$. A well known result is the polarization of primordial gravitational
waves (PGW) into left and right eigenstates, as a consequence of parity
breaking. In such a scenario the modifications to the power spectrum of PGW are
suppressed under the conditions that allow to avoid the production of ghost
gravitons at a certain energy scale, the so-called Chern-Simons mass $M_{CS}$.
In general it has been recently pointed out that there is very little hope to
efficiently constrain chirality of PGW on the basis solely of two-point
statistics from future CMB data, even in the most optimistic cases. Thus we
search if significant parity breaking signatures can arise at least in the
bispectrum statistics. We find that the tensor-tensor-scalar bispectra $\langle
\gamma \gamma \zeta \rangle$ for each polarization state are the only ones that
are not suppressed. Their amplitude, setting the level of parity breaking
during inflation, is proportional to the second derivative of the coupling
function $f(\phi)$ and they turn out to be maximum in the squeezed limit. We
comment on the squeezed-limit consistency relation arising in the case of
chiral gravitational waves, and on possible observables to constrain these
signatures.

bounds that scale as $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ under only the assumption that
inter-arrival times have finite second moment, and service times have finite
$2+\epsilon$ moment for some $\epsilon > 0$. Here $\rho$ denotes the
corresponding traffic intensity. Conceptually, our results can be viewed as a
multi-server analogue of Kingman's bound. Our main results are bounds for the
tail of the steady-state queue length and the steady-state probability of
delay. The strength of our bounds (e.g. in the form of tail decay rate) is a
function of how many moments of the service distribution are assumed finite.
Our bounds scale gracefully even when the number of servers grows large and the
traffic intensity converges to unity simultaneously, as in the Halfin-Whitt
scaling regime. Some of our bounds scale better than $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ in
certain asymptotic regimes. In these same asymptotic regimes we also prove
bounds for the tail of the steady-state number in service.
  Our main proofs proceed by explicitly analyzing the bounding process which
arises in the stochastic comparison bounds of Gamarnik and Goldberg for
multi-server queues. Along the way we derive several novel results for suprema
of random walks and pooled renewal processes which may be of independent
interest. We also prove several additional bounds using drift arguments (which
have much smaller pre-factors), and point out a conjecture which would imply
further related bounds and generalizations. We also show that when all moments
of the service distribution are finite and satisfy a mild growth rate
assumption, our bounds can be strengthened to yield explicit tail estimates
decaying as $O\big(\exp(-x^{\alpha})\big)$, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ depending
on the growth rate of these moments.

of gaseous clouds in a wide range of astronomical environments, including
interstellar and intergalactic space. In particular, considerable effort in
circumgalactic medium (CGM) studies focuses on metallicity measurements,
because gas metallicity serves as a critical discriminator for whether the
observed heavy ions in the CGM originate in chemically-enriched outflows or in
more chemically-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. However,
because the gas is ionized, a necessary first step in determining CGM
metallicity is to constrain the ionization state of the gas which, in addition
to gas density, depends on the ultraviolet background radiation field (UVB).
While it is generally acknowledged that both the intensity and spectral slope
of the UVB are uncertain, the impact of an uncertain spectral slope has not
been properly addressed in the literature. This Letter shows that adopting a
different spectral slope can result in an order of magnitude difference in the
inferred CGM metallicity. Specifically, a harder UVB spectrum leads to a higher
estimated gas metallicity for a given set of observed ionic column densities .
Therefore, such systematic uncertainties must be folded into the error budget
for metallicity estimates of ionized gas. An initial study shows that empirical
diagnostics are available for discriminating between hard and soft ionizing
spectra. Applying these diagnostics helps reduce the systematic uncertainties
in CGM metallicity estimates.

the chiral theory and its mirror conjugate and then introduce interactions that
gap out only the mirror theory. The connection between topological states and
anomalies shows that such interactions exist if the chiral theory is free of

Smith et al. (2010) trace outflowing gas. Proper motions constrain the location
of the jet-driving source and provide kinematic confirmation of the
intermediate-mass protostars that we identify for 20/37 jets. Jet velocities do
not correlate with the estimated protostar mass and embedded driving sources do
not have slower jets. Instead, transverse velocities (median $\sim 75$ km
s$^{-1}$) are similar to those in jets from low-mass stars. Assuming a constant
velocity since launch, we compute jet dynamical ages (median $\sim 10^4$ yr).
If continuous emission from inner jets traces the duration of the most recent
accretion bursts, then these episodes are sustained longer (median $\sim 700$
yr) than the typical decay time of an FU Orionis outburst. These jets can carry
appreciable momentum that may be injected into the surrounding environment. The
resulting outflow force, $dP/dt$, lies between that measured in low- and
high-mass sources, despite the very different observational tracers used.
Smooth scaling of the outflow force argues for a common physical process
underlying outflows from protostars of all masses. This latest kinematic result
adds to a growing body of evidence that intermediate-mass star formation
proceeds like a scaled-up version of the formation of low-mass stars.

conduction through the topological insulator whose conductivity is a few orders

anti-localization (negative magneto-conductance) to weak localization (positive
magneto-conductance) as the temperature is lowered or as the chemical potential
approaches the Dirac point. This is accompanied by a systematic emergence of an
anomalous Hall effect. These results are interpreted in terms of the opening of
a gap at the Dirac point as a result of the exchange coupling between the
topological insulator surface state and the ferromagnetic ordering in the

explore star formation in the nucleus using radio recombination line (RRL) and
continuum emission at 5, 6.7, 33, and 35 GHz with the JVLA. These radio tracers
are largely unaffected by dust and therefore sensitive to all of the thermal
emission from the ionized gas produced by early-type stars. We resolve two
components in the RRL and continuum emission within the nuclear region that lie
east and west of the central star cluster. These components are associated both
spatially and kinematically with two giant molecular clouds. We model these
regions in two ways: a simple model consisting of uniform gas radiating in
spontaneous emission, or as a collection of many compact HII regions in
non-LTE. The multiple HII region model provides a better fit to the data and
predicts many dense (ne ~ 10^4-10^5 cm-3), compact (< 0.1 pc) HII regions. For
the whole nuclear region as defined by RRL emission, we estimate a hydrogen
ionizing rate of NL ~ 2 x 10^{52} s^{-1}, corresponding to equivalent ~ 2000 O6
stars and a star formation rate of ~ 0.15 Msun/year. We detect radio continuum
emission west of the southern molecular mini spiral arm, consistent with
trailing spiral arms.

the strong interaction, a number of significant violations have been observed
in scattering and bound states of nucleons. Many of these violations can be
attributed to the electromagnetic interaction but the question of how much of
the violation is due to it remains open. A schematic model based on clustering
of quarks in the interior of the confinement region of the two-nucleon system
is introduced and evaluated. In this model the Coulomb interaction is the
source of all isospin breaking. It draws on a picture of the quark density
based on the diquark-quark model of hadron structure which has been
investigated by a number of groups. The model produces three isospin breaking
potentials connecting This illustrative model suggests that the breaking seen
in the low-energy NN interaction may be understood in terms of the Coulomb
force between members of diquark clusters. It allows the prediction of the
charge symmetry breaking interaction and the $nn$ scattering length from the
well measured $np$ singlet scattering length. Values of the $nn$ scattering
length around $-18$ fm are favored. Since the model is based on the quark
picture, it can be easily extended, in the SU(3) limit, to calculate isospin
breaking in the strange sector in the corresponding channels. A natural
consequence of isospin breaking from diquark clustering is that the breaking in
the strange sector, as measured by the separation energy difference between
$_{\Lambda}^4$H and $_{\Lambda}^4$He, is several times larger than that seen in
the comparison of three-nucleon mirror nuclei as observed experimentally.

mJy arcsec^-2). The 24-mic surface brightness also shows a factor of 3 offset
between the two classes of objects (0.13 vs 0.44 mJy arcsec^-2, respectively),
which is driven by the association between the very small dust grains and
higher density gas found at higher nebular optical depths. In contrast, PAH and
dust formation in the low-metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud is strongly
inhibited such that we find no variation in either 8-mic or 24-mic emission
between our optically thick and thin samples. This is attributable to extremely
low PAH and dust production together with high, corrosive UV photon fluxes in
this low-metallicity environment. The dust mass surface densities and

radiation, attributed to the electron cyclotron maser instability, a phenomenon
that occurs in the solar system at planets with strong auroral emission. In
this paper we examine magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents in UCDs,
adopting processes used in models of Jovian emission. We consider the angular
velocity gradient arising from a steady outward flux of angular momentum from
an internal plasma source, as analogous to the jovian main oval current system,
as well as the interaction of a rotating magnetosphere with the external
medium. Both of these mechanisms are seen in the solar system to be responsible
for the production of radio emission. We present the results of an
investigation over a range of relevant plasma and magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling parameters to determine regimes consistent with observed UCD radio
luminosities. Both processes are able to explain observed UCD luminosities with
ionospheric Pedersen conductances of ~1-2 mho, either for a closed
magnetosphere with a plasma mass outflow rate of ~10$^5$ kg/s, i.e. a factor of
~100 larger than that observed at Jupiter's moon Io, or for a dwarf with an
open magnetosphere moving through the interstellar medium at ~50 km/s and a
plasma mass outflow rate of ~1000 kg/s. The radio luminosity resulting from
these mechanisms have opposing dependencies on the magnetic field strength, a
point which may be used to discriminate between the two models as more data

variations thereof were the only methods achieving acceleration in this
standard blackbox model. In contrast, our algorithm is significantly different
from AGD, as it relies on a predictor-corrector approach similar to that used
by Mirror-Prox [Nemirovski, 2004] and Extra-Gradient Descent [Korpelevich,
1977] in the solution of convex-concave saddle point problems. For this reason,
we dub our algorithm Accelerated Extra-Gradient Descent (AXGD). Its
construction is motivated by the discretization of an accelerated
continuous-time dynamics [Krichene et al., 2015] using the classical method of
implicit Euler discretization. Our analysis explicitly shows the effects of
discretization through a conceptually novel primal-dual viewpoint. Moreover, we
show that the method is quite general: it attains optimal convergence rates for
other classes of objectives (e.g., those with generalized smoothness properties
or that are non-smooth and Lipschitz-continuous) using the appropriate choices
of step lengths. Finally, we present experiments showing that our algorithm
matches the performance of Nesterov's method, while appearing more robust to
noise in some cases.

with a focus on its potential to melt and maintain layers of subsurface liquid
water. Depending on their past orbital evolution, tidal heating may be an
important part of the heat budget for a number of discovered and hypothetical
TNO systems and may enable formation of, and increased access to, subsurface
liquid water. Tidal heating induced by the process of despinning is found to be
particularly able to compete with heating due to radionuclide decay in a number
of different scenarios. In cases where radiogenic heating alone may establish
subsurface conditions for liquid water, we focus on the extent by which tidal
activity lifts the depth of such conditions closer to the surface. While it is
common for strong tidal heating and long lived tides to be mutually exclusive,
we find this is not always the case, and highlight when these two traits occur
together.

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Using recent dynamical model predictions
for the dust influx rates to the giant planets (Poppe, A.R.~et al.~[2016],
Icarus 264, 369), we calculate the ablation profiles and investigate the
subsequent coupled oxygen-hydrocarbon neutral photochemistry in the
stratospheres of these planets. We find that dust grains from the
Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt, Jupiter-family comets, and Oort-cloud comets supply an
effective oxygen influx rate of 1.0$^{+2.2}_{-0.7} \, \times \, 10^7$ O atoms
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ to Jupiter, 7.4$^{+16}_{-5.1} \, \times 10^4$ cm$^{-2}$

Uranus, and 7.5$^{+16}_{-5.1} \, \times \, 10^5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ to Neptune.
The fate of the ablated oxygen depends in part on the molecular/atomic form of
the initially delivered products, and on the altitude at which it was
deposited. The dominant stratospheric products are CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$,
which are relatively stable photochemically. Model-data comparisons suggest
that interplanetary dust grains deliver an important component of the external
oxygen to Jupiter and Uranus but fall far short of the amount needed to explain
the CO abundance currently seen in the middle stratospheres of Saturn and
Neptune. Our results are consistent with the theory that all of the giant
planets have experienced large cometary impacts within the last few hundred
years. Our results also suggest that the low background H$_2$O abundance in
Jupiter's stratosphere is indicative of effective conversion of meteoric oxygen
to CO during or immediately after the ablation process -- photochemistry alone
cannot efficiently convert the H$_2$O into CO on the giant planets.

behavior of their peers, are posited by multiple theories in the social
sciences. Other processes can also produce behaviors that are correlated in
networks and groups, thereby generating debate about the credibility of
observational (i.e. nonexperimental) studies of peer effects. Randomized field
experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often expensive or
infeasible. Thus, many studies of peer effects use observational data, and
prior evaluations of causal inference methods for adjusting observational data
to estimate peer effects have lacked an experimental ""gold standard"" for
comparison. Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion on
Facebook, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group
(677 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of
peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those from using a large
randomized experiment (220 million observations). Naive observational
estimators overstate peer effects by 320% and commonly used variables (e.g.,
demographics) offer little bias reduction, but adjusting for a measure of prior
behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces bias by 91%.
High-dimensional models adjusting for over 3,700 past behaviors provide
additional bias reduction, such that the full model reduces bias by over 97%.
This experimental evaluation demonstrates that detailed records of individuals'
past behavior can improve studies of social influence, information diffusion,
and imitation; these results are encouraging for the credibility of some
studies but also cautionary for studies of rare or new behaviors. More
generally, these results show how large, high-dimensional data sets and
statistical learning techniques can be used to improve causal inference in the

expansion of $\lambda$-terms that this operation commutes with normalization:
the expansion of a $\lambda$-term is always normalizable and its normal form is
the expansion of the B\""ohm tree of the term. We generalize this result to the
non-uniform setting of the algebraic $\lambda$-calculus, i.e.
$\lambda$-calculus extended with linear combinations of terms. This requires us
to tackle two difficulties: foremost is the fact that Ehrhard and Regnier's
techniques rely heavily on the uniform, deterministic nature of the ordinary
$\lambda$-calculus, and thus cannot be adapted; second is the absence of any
satisfactory generic extension of the notion of B\""ohm tree in presence of
quantitative non-determinism, which is reflected by the fact that the Taylor
expansion of an algebraic $\lambda$-term is not always normalizable. Our
solution is to provide a fine grained study of the dynamics of
$\beta$-reduction under Taylor expansion, by introducing a notion of reduction
on resource vectors, i.e. infinite linear combinations of resource
$\lambda$-terms. The latter form the multilinear fragment of the differential
$\lambda$-calculus, and resource vectors are the target of the Taylor expansion
of $\lambda$-terms. We show the reduction of resource vectors contains the
image of any $\beta$-reduction step, from which we deduce that Taylor expansion
and normalization commute on the nose. We moreover identify a class of
algebraic $\lambda$-terms, encompassing both normalizable algebraic
$\lambda$-terms and arbitrary ordinary $\lambda$-terms: the expansion of these

constraint that links the toroidal flux-to-mass ratio and the pitch angle of
the helical field to the rotation laws, which we find to be an important

luminosity distribution of WR stars of WC and WO types and the SN Ic progenitor
properties. Here we suggest some improvements in the WR mass-loss rate
prescription and discuss its implications for the evolution of WR stars and SN
Ib/Ic progenitors. Recent studies on Galactic WR stars clearly indicate that
the mass-loss rates of WC stars are systematically higher than those of WNE
stars for a given luminosity. The luminosity and initial metallicity
dependencies of WNE mass-loss rates are also significantly different from those
of WC stars. These factors have not been adequately considered together in
previous stellar evolution models. We also find that an overall increase of WR
mass loss rates by about 60 per cent compared to the empirical values obtained
with a clumping factor of 10 is needed to explain the most faint WC/WO stars.
This moderate increase with our new WR mas-loss rate prescription results in SN
Ib/Ic progenitor models more consistent with observations than those given by
the Nugis & Lamers prescription. In particular, our new models predict that the
properties of SN Ib and SN Ic progenitors are distinctively different, rather

classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), as training
samples tend to be highly limited due to the expensive and laborious task of
ground truthing. The temporal correlation and spectral similarity between
multitemporal images have opened up an opportunity to alleviate this problem.
In this study, a SVM-based Sequential Classifier Training (SCT-SVM) approach is
proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image classification. The approach
leverages the classifiers of previous images to reduce the required number of
training samples for the classifier training of an incoming image. For each
incoming image, a rough classifier is firstly predicted based on the temporal
trend of a set of previous classifiers. The predicted classifier is then
fine-tuned into a more accurate position with current training samples. This
approach can be applied progressively to sequential image data, with only a
small number of training samples being required from each image. Experiments
were conducted with Sentinel-2A multitemporal data over an agricultural area in
Australia. Results showed that the proposed SCT-SVM achieved better
classification accuracies compared with two state-of-the-art model transfer
algorithms. When training data are insufficient, the overall classification
accuracy of the incoming image was improved from 76.18% to 94.02% with the
proposed SCT-SVM, compared with those obtained without the assistance from
previous images. These results demonstrate that the leverage of a priori
information from previous images can provide advantageous assistance for later
images in multitemporal image classification.

supramassive magnetars are one attractive interpretation for at least some
short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), based on the internal plateau commonly observed
in the early X-ray afterglow. The rapid decay phase in this scenario signifies
the epoch when the star collapses to a black hole after it spins down, and
could effectively shed light on the underlying unclear equation of state (EoS)
of dense matter. In the present work, we confront the protomagnetar masses of
the internal plateau sample from representative EoS models, with the one
independently from the observed galactic NS-NS binary, aiming to contribute new
compact star EoSs from SGRB observations. For this purpose, we employ various
EoSs covering a wide range of maximum mass for both NSs and quark stars (QSs),
and in the same time satisfying the recent observational constraints of the two
massive pulsars whose masses are precisely measured (around $2 M_{\odot}$). We
first illustrate that how well the underlying EoS would reconcile with the
current posterior mass distribution, is largely determined by the static
maximum mass of that EoS. We then construct 3 new postmerger QS EoSs (PMQS1,
PMQS2, PMQS3), respecting fully the observed distribution. We also provide

  Boolean Networks","Accepted for publication in JMLR issue 18",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the effect of introducing a curriculum of targets when training
Boolean models on supervised Multi Label Classification (MLC) problems. In
particular, we consider how to order targets in the absence of prior knowledge,
and how such a curriculum may be enforced when using meta-heuristics to train
discrete non-linear models.
  We show that hierarchical dependencies between targets can be exploited by
enforcing an appropriate curriculum using hierarchical loss functions. On
several multi output circuit-inference problems with known target difficulties,
Feedforward Boolean Networks (FBNs) trained with such a loss function achieve
significantly lower out-of-sample error, up to $10\%$ in some cases. This
improvement increases as the loss places more emphasis on target order and is
strongly correlated with an easy-to-hard curricula. We also demonstrate the
same improvements on three real-world models and two Gene Regulatory Network
(GRN) inference problems.
  We posit a simple a-priori method for identifying an appropriate target order
and estimating the strength of target relationships in Boolean MLCs. These
methods use intrinsic dimension as a proxy for target difficulty, which is
estimated using optimal solutions to a combinatorial optimisation problem known
as the Minimum-Feature-Set (minFS) problem. We also demonstrate that the same
generalisation gains can be achieved without providing any knowledge of target
difficulty.

workflows that can handle the massive volume of data streams that are relevant
to understand the dynamics of transit networks which are entirely deterministic

the fundamental issues in developing a streaming analytical workflow for
analyzing the continuous arrival of multiple, unbounded transit data feeds for
automatically processing and enriching them with additional information
containing higher level concepts accordingly to a particular mobility context.
This workflow consists of three tasks: (1) stream data retrieval for creating
time windows; (2) data cleaning for handling missing data, overlap data or
redundant data; and (3) data contextualization for computing actual arrival and
departure times as well as the stops and moves during a bus trip, and also
performing mobility context computation. The workflow was implemented in a
Hadoop cloud ecosystem using data streams from the CODIAC Transit System of the
city of Moncton, NB. The Map() function of MapReduce is used to retrieve and
bundle data streams into numerous clusters which are subsequently handled in a
parallel manner by the Reduce() function in order to execute the data
contextualization step. The results validate the need for cloud computing for
achieving high performance and scalability, however, due to the delay in
computing and networking, it is clear that data cleaning tasks should not only
be deployed using a cloud environment, paving the way to combine it with fog
computing in the near future.

\sim s^{-\tau} \tilde{n} (s/V^{d^*_{\rm f}})$ with identical volume fractal
dimension $d^*_{\rm f}=2/3$ and exponent $\tau = 1+1/d^*_{\rm f}=5/2$. We then
classify occupied bonds into {\em bridge} bonds, which includes {\em branch}
and {\em junction} bonds, and {\em non-bridge} bonds; a bridge bond is a branch
bond if and only if its deletion produces at least one tree. Deleting branch
bonds from percolation configurations produces {\em leaf-free} configurations,
whereas, deleting all bridge bonds leads to {\em bridge-free} configurations.
It is shown that the fraction of non-bridge (bi-connected) bonds vanishes
$\rho_{\rm n, CG}$$\rightarrow$0 for large CGs, but converges to a finite value
$ \rho_{\rm n, 7D} =0.006 \, 193 \, 1(7)$ for the 7D hypercube. Further, we
observe that while the bridge-free dimension $d^*_{\rm bf}=1/3$ holds for both
the CG and 7D cases, the volume fractal dimensions of the leaf-free clusters
are different: $d^*_{\rm \ell f, 7D} = 0.669 (9) \approx 2/3$ and $d^*_{\rm
\ell f, CG} = 0. 333 7 (17) \approx 1/3$. We also study the behavior of the
number and the size distribution of leaf-free and bridge-free clusters. For the
number of clusters, we numerically find the number of leaf-free and bridge-free
clusters on the CG scale as $\sim \ln V$, while for 7D they scale as $\sim V$.
Our work demonstrates that the geometric structure of high-dimensional
percolation clusters cannot be fully accounted for by their complete-graph

easy to implement and performs more efficiently with the increase of the system

Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising results on many

training data. This can incur a great deal of annotation effort and cost,
because only biomedical experts can annotate effectively, and often there are

performing a threat, several apps are working together, i.e., they exchange
information which they could not obtain on their own. In this context, we
developed the Kandroid tool, which provides an encoding of the Android/Smali

the theory of pseudo-differential operators with a large parameter. Second, by
carefully analyzing the analyticity of the local parametrix in the Laplace

solutions is thousand times larger than the cell. Moreover, it is not separated
from the rest of the cell by a membrane. Nevertheless, it occupies only a small
fraction of the cell called the nucleoid. The mechanisms leading to such
compaction are the matter of ongoing debates. The present work aims at
exploring a newly proposed mechanism, according to which the formation of the
nucleoid would result from the demixing of the DNA and non-binding globular
macromolecules of the cytoplasm, like ribosomes. To this end, a coarse-grained
model of prokaryotic cells was developed and demixing was analyzed as a
function of the size and number of crowders. The model suggests that compaction
of the DNA is actually governed by the volume occupancy ratio of the crowders
and remains weak almost up to the jamming critical density. Strong compaction
is however observed just before jamming, suggesting that crowding and
electrostatic repulsion work synergetically in this limit. Finally, simulations
performed with crowders with different sizes indicate that the DNA and the
largest crowders demix preferentially. Together with the recent observation of
the gradual compaction of long DNA molecules upon increase of the concentration
of BSA proteins and silica nanoparticles, this work supports the demixing
mechanism as a key player for the formation of the nucleoid.

the Zeeman energy of the NV centers depends on the direction of the axis, we
can independently control the four types of NV centers using microwave pulses

the second spatial derivative. The latter arises from the single particle
diluted gas pressure, and this observation allows to interpret the quantum Bohm

omnidirectional path loss in those frequency bands, the deployment of a very
large number of antenna elements at the base station is crucial. The
complexity, power consumption and costs resulting from the large number of
antenna elements can be reduced by limiting the number of RF chains. This leads
to hybrid precoding and combining, which, in contrast to the traditional fully
digital precoding and combining, moves a part of the signal processing from the
digital to the analog domain. This paper proposes new algorithms for the design
of hybrid precoders and combiners in a multiuser scenario. The algorithms are
based on the previously proposed Linear Successive Allocation method developed
for the traditional fully digital version. It successively allocates data
streams to users and suppresses the respective interstream interference in two
stages, which perfectly matches the hybrid architecture. Furthermore, a
low-complexity version is developed by exploiting the typical structure of
mmWave channels. The good performance of the proposed method and its
low-complexity version is demonstrated by simulation results.

molecules (typically with $D_{2h}$ symmetry) take into account couplings
between their uniaxial and biaxial tensors. While the attractive contributions
arising from interactions between similar tensors of the participating
molecules provide for eventual condensation of the respective orders at
suitably low temperatures, the role of cross-coupling between unlike tensors is
not fully appreciated. Our recent study with an advanced Monte Carlo technique
(entropic sampling) showed clearly the increasing relevance of this cross term
in determining the phase diagram, contravening in some regions of model
parameter space, the predictions of mean field theory and standard Monte Carlo
simulation results. In this context, we investigated the phase diagrams and the
nature of the phases therein, on two trajectories in the parameter space: one
is a line in the interior region of biaxial stability believed to be
representative of the real systems, and the second is the extensively
investigated parabolic path resulting from the London dispersion approximation.
In both the cases, we find the destabilizing effect of increased cross-coupling
interactions, which invariably result in the formation of local biaxial
organizations inhomogeneously distributed. This manifests as a small, but
unmistakable, contribution of biaxial order in the uniaxial phase.The free
energy profiles computed in the present study as a function of the two dominant
order parameters indicate complex landscapes, reflecting the difficulties in
the ready realization of the biaxial phase in the laboratory.

novel algorithmic challenges in the operation of communication networks. NFV
introduces volatility in the management of network functions, which can be

existing virtual network embedding formulations in the state of the art. We
also design a math-heuristic able to scale with multiple objectives and large

achievable between classical traffic engineering (TE) and NFV infrastructure
efficiency goals, evaluating both Internet access and Virtual Private Network

\textsc{KnapWindowPlus} framework (KW$^{+}$) to improve upon KW. KW$^{+}$
builds an index \textsc{SubKnapChk} to manage the checkpoints and KS instances.
\textsc{SubKnapChk} deletes a checkpoint whenever it can be approximated by its
successors. By keeping much fewer checkpoints, KW$^{+}$ achieves higher
efficiency than KW while still guaranteeing a
$\frac{1-\varepsilon'}{2+2d}$-approximate solution for SMDK. Finally, we
evaluate the efficiency and solution quality of KW and KW$^{+}$ in real-world

orders of magnitude speedups over the batch baseline and preserves high-quality

(NNs). These are based on recent developments in the field of non-convex
optimization, going under the general name of successive convex approximation
(SCA) techniques. The basic idea is to iteratively replace the original
(non-convex, highly dimensional) learning problem with a sequence of (strongly
convex) approximations, which are both accurate and simple to optimize.
Differently from similar ideas (e.g., quasi-Newton algorithms), the
approximations can be constructed using only first-order information of the
neural network function, in a stochastic fashion, while exploiting the overall
structure of the learning problem for a faster convergence. We discuss several
use cases, based on different choices for the loss function (e.g., squared loss
and cross-entropy loss), and for the regularization of the NN's weights. We
experiment on several medium-sized benchmark problems, and on a large-scale
dataset involving simulated physical data. The results show how the algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, providing faster convergence to a
better minimum. Additionally, we show how the algorithm can be easily
parallelized over multiple computational units without hindering its
performance. In particular, each computational unit can optimize a tailored
surrogate function defined on a randomly assigned subset of the input
variables, whose dimension can be selected depending entirely on the available
computational power.

non-negligible CMB absorption and decline of the CMB intensity because the
opacity steeply increases with redshift. The CMB should be distorted even

the maximum spectral distortion of the CMB is at least $20 \times 10^{-22}

distorted also in a perfectly transparent universe due to dust in galaxies but

improve the spatial-temporal resolution trade-off and increase statistical
robustness through increased degrees-of-freedom. High quality reconstruction of

We present an fMRI reconstruction approach based on modeling the fMRI signal as
a sum of periodic and fixed rank components, for improved reconstruction from
undersampled measurements. We decompose the fMRI signal into a component which
a has fixed rank and a component consisting of a sum of periodic signals which
is sparse in the temporal Fourier domain. Data reconstruction is performed by
solving a constrained problem that enforces a fixed, moderate rank on one of
the components, and a limited number of temporal frequencies on the other. Our
approach is coined PEAR - PEriodic And fixed Rank separation for fast fMRI.
  Experimental results include purely synthetic simulation, a simulation with
real timecourses and retrospective undersampling of a real fMRI dataset.
Evaluation was performed both quantitatively and visually versus ground truth,
comparing PEAR to two additional recent methods for fMRI reconstruction from
undersampled measurements. Results demonstrate PEAR's improvement in estimating
the timecourses and activation maps versus the methods compared against at
acceleration ratios of R=8,16 (for simulated data) and R=6.66,10 (for real
data). PEAR results in reconstruction with higher fidelity than when using a
fixed-rank based model or a conventional Low-rank+Sparse algorithm. We have
shown that splitting the functional information between the components leads to
better modeling of fMRI, over state-of-the-art methods.

nearby systems, we do not find a separation between cooling flow clusters and
non-cooling flow clusters based on the radio luminosity of the central radio
source. This lack may be due to the increased incidence of galaxy-galaxy
mergers at higher redshift that triggers AGN activity. In support of this
scenario, we find evidence for evolution in the radio luminosity function of
the central radio source: while the lower-luminosity sources do not evolve
much, the higher-luminosity sources show a strong increase in the frequency of
their occurrence at higher redshifts. We interpret this evolution as an
increase in high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) in massive clusters at
$z>0.6$, implying a transition from HERG-mode accretion to lower-power
low-excitation radio galaxy (LERG)-mode accretion at intermediate redshifts.
Additionally, we use local radio-to-jet power scaling relations to estimate
feedback power and find that half of the cooling flow systems in our sample
probably have enough heating to balance cooling. However, we postulate that the
local relations are likely not well suited to predict feedback power in
high-luminosity HERGs, as they are derived from samples composed mainly of
lower-luminosity LERGs.

of $41$ $\delta$ Scuti stars. The selected objects are located near the
$\gamma$ Doradus instability strip to make a reliable comparison between both
types of variables. Spectral classification, stellar atmospheric parameters
($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, $\xi$) and $v \sin i$ values were determined. The
spectral types and luminosity classes of stars were found to be A1$-$F5 and
III$-$V, respectively. The $T_{\rm eff}$ ranges from $6600$ to $9400$ K,
whereas the obtained $\log g$ values are from $3.4$ to $4.3$. The $v \sin i$
values were found between $10$ and $222$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived chemical
abundances of $\delta$ Scuti stars were compared to those of the non-pulsating
stars and $\gamma$ Doradus variables. It turned out that both $\delta$ Scuti
and $\gamma$ Doradus variables have similar abundance patterns, which are
slightly different from the non-pulsating stars. These chemical differences can
help us to understand why there are non-pulsating stars in classical
instability strip. Effects of the obtained parameters on pulsation period and
amplitude were examined. It appears that the pulsation period decreases with
increasing $T_{\rm eff}$. No significant correlations were found between
pulsation period, amplitude and $v \sin i$.

advection of closed coronal loops located at peripheries of the flaring active

lower part of the vortex. Here, we examine two eruptive solar flares, an
X1.1-class flare SOL2012-03-05T03:20 and a C3.5-class SOL2013-06-19T07:29. In
both flares, we find that the coronal loops observed by the Atmospheric Imaging

expanding and contracting motions, in accordance with the model prediction. In
the X-class flare, multiple expanding/contracting loops coexist for more than
35 minutes, while in the C-class flare, an expanding loop in 193\,\AA~appears
to be close-by and co-temporal with an apparently imploding loop arcade seen in
171\,\AA. Later, the 193\,\AA~loop also switches to contraction. These
observations are naturally explained by vortex flows present in a model of

component; with a 95 per cent confidence the power-law contributes less than 1
per cent to the total flux of the source in $0.5-10.0$ keV. The fits show
significant residuals at around 0.5 keV which can be explained by either a hot
gas component around the neutron star or a moderately broad emission line from
a residual accretion disc. The temperature of the neutron-star has decreased
significantly compared to the previous observation, from 124 eV to 105 eV, with
the cooling curve being consistent with either an exponential decay plus a
constant or a (broken) power law. The best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius
can be better constrained if we extend the fits down to the lowest possible
energy available. For an assumed distance of 7.1 kpc, the best-fitting
neutron-star mass and radius are $2.00_{-0.24}^{+0.07}~M_\odot$ and
$11.3_{-1.0}^{+1.3}$ km if we fit the spectrum over the $0.3-10$ keV range, but
$1.50_{-1.0}^{+0.4}~M_\odot$ and $12.2_{-3.6}^{+0.8}$ km if we restrict the

distance to the source upon the best-fitting neutron-star mass and radius. As
systematic uncertainties in the deduced mass and radius depending on the

inverted-triangular, and horizontal-bar obstacles to discuss the obstacle-shape

spin transport phenomena induced by ISOC in a bilayer metallic system. In this
model a non-equilibrium steady state carrying a spin current is created by
applying a spin dependent bias across the metallic junction. Physical
observables are then calculated using the scattering matrix approach. In
particular we calculate the absorption of the spin current at the interface
(the interface spin-loss) and study the interface spin-to-charge conversion.
The latter consists of an in-plane interface charge current generated by the
spin dependent bias applied to the junction, which can be viewed as a spin
galvanic effect mediated by ISOC. Finally we demonstrate that ISOC leads to an
interfacial spin current swapping, that is, the ""primary"" spin current flowing

""secondary' swapped spin current flowing along the interface and polarized in

divides the space of model's phases onto two distinct regions. If the lattice
aspect ratio $\alpha>\alpha^*$, we recover both types of the second-order phase
transitions and find that they are of mean-field type with the critical
exponent $\beta = 1/2$. If $\alpha<\alpha^*$, the phase transition associated
with the discontinuity of dimer's angles on alternating sublattices becomes of
first order. For $\alpha=\alpha^*$, the first- and second-order phase
transitions meet at the tricritical point, characterized by the different
critical index $\beta = 1/4$. Such phenomenon is known from literature about
the Landau theory of one-component fields, but in our two-component version the
scenario is more complicated.

  Umberto Zannier",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a monic polynomial $D(X)$ of even degree, express $\sqrt D$ as a Laurent
series in $X^{-1}$; this yields a continued fraction expansion (similar to
continued fractions of real numbers): \[\sqrt
D=a_0+\dfrac{1}{a_1+\dfrac{1}{a_2+\dfrac{1}{\ddots}}},\quad a_i\text{
polynomials in }X.\] Such continued fractions were first considered by Abel in
1826, and later by Chebyshev. It turns out they are rarely periodic unless $D$
is defined over a finite field.
  Around 2001 van der Poorten studied non-periodic continued fractions of
$\sqrt D$, with $D$ defined over the rationals, and simultaneously the
continued fraction of $\sqrt D$ modulo a suitable prime $p$; the latter
continued fraction is automatically periodic. He found that one recovers all
the convergents (rational function approximations to $\sqrt D$ obtained by
cutting off the continued fraction) of $\sqrt D \mod{p}$ by appropriately
normalising and then reducing the convergents of $\sqrt D$.
  By developing a general specialization theory for continued fractions of
Laurent series, I produced a rigorous proof of this result stated by van der
Poorten and further was able to show the following:
  If $D$ is defined over the rationals and the continued fraction of $\sqrt D$
is non-periodic, then for all but finitely many primes $p \in \mathbb Z$, this
prime $p$ occurs in the denominator of the leading coefficient of infinitely
many $a_i$.
  For $\mathrm{deg}\,D = 4$, I can even give a description of the orders in
which the prime appears, and the $p$-adic Gauss norms of the $a_i$ and the
convergents. These results also generalise to number fields.
  Moreover, I derive optimised formulae for computing quadratic continued
fractions, along with several example expansions. I discuss a few known results
on the heights of the convergents, and explain some relations with the
reduction of hyperelliptic curves and Jacobians.

investigate the morphological changes fallback accretion has on model light

frequency of the magnetar over time. We then apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo

SGRB sample that are morphologically and energetically consistent with the data
provided by Swift BAT and XRT telescopes. The parameters derived from these
fits are consistent with predictions for magnetar properties and fallback

$\Delta$, it is well known that a fundamental matrix solution has singularities
at $\Delta$. When the system also has a Fuchsian singularity at $z=0$, we show
under minimal vanishing conditions on the residue matrix at $z=0$ that
isomonodromic deformations can be extended to the whole polydisc, including
$\Delta$, in such a way that the fundamental matrix solutions and the constant
monodromy data are well defined in the whole polydisc. These data can be
computed just by considering the system at fixed $t=0$. Conversely, if the
$t$-dependent system is isomonodromic in a small domain contained in the
polydisc not intersecting $\Delta$, if the entries of the Stokes matrices with

the observed PAH features are excited predominantly by SF. With current
ground-based telescopes and the upcoming JWST, much smaller spatial scales can
be probed and we aim at testing this assumption in the range of few tens to few
hundreds of pc. For that, we spatially map the emitted 11.3{\mu}m PAH surface
flux as a function of distance from 0.4-4 arcsec from the centre in 28 nearby
AGN using ground-based high-angular resolution mid-IR spectroscopy. We detect
and extract the 11.3{\mu}m PAH feature in 13 AGN. The fluxes within each
aperture are scaled to a luminosity-normalised distance from the nucleus to be
able to compare intrinsic spatial scales of AGN radiation spanning about 2
orders of magnitude in luminosity. For this, we establish an empirical relation
between the absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity and the sublimation radius in
these sources. Once normalised, the radial profiles of the emitted PAH surface
flux show similar radial slopes, with a power-law index of approximately -1.1,
and similar absolute values, consistent within a factor of a few of each other
as expected from the uncertainty in the intrinsic scale estimate. We interpret
this as evidence that the profiles are caused by a common compact central
physical process, either the AGN itself or circumnuclear SF linked in strength
to the AGN power. A photoionisation-based model of an AGN exciting dense clouds
in its environment can reproduce the observed radial slope and confirms that
the AGN radiation field is strong enough to explain the observed PAH surface

intensifies light by efficiently nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a
few tens of nanometres, generating a nonlinear response so strong that
efficient four-wave mixing accumulates in just a micron. This is significant as
our technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime where phase matching and

studied heating in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a driven
one-dimensional optical lattice. We find interaction-dependent heating rates
that depend both on the scattering length and the driving strength and identify
the underlying resonant intra- and interband scattering processes. By comparing
experimental data and theory, we find that for driving frequencies well above
the trap depth, the heating rate is dramatically reduced by the fact that
resonantly scattered atoms leave the trap before dissipating their energy into
the system. This mechanism of Floquet evaporative cooling offers a powerful
strategy to minimize heating in Floquet engineered quantum gases.

Since the quality of the LPA beam inside the undulator is the critical issue,
any LPA based FEL experiment requires a refined characterization of the beam

modern semiconductor technology for spintronic applications. For this purpose,
one needs good crystalline ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) semiconductors with
high Curie temperatures. Rutile CrO$_2$ is a half-metallic spintronic material
with Curie temperature 394 K and can have nearly-full spin polarization at room
temperature. Here, we find through first-principles investigation that when a
biaxial compressive stress is applied on rutile CrO$_2$, the density of states
at the Fermi level decreases with the in-plane compressive strain, there is a
structural phase transition to an orthorhombic phase at the strain of -5.6\%,
and then appears an electronic phase transition to a semiconductor phase at
-6.1\%. Further analysis shows that this structural transition, accompanying
the tetragonal symmetry breaking, is induced by the stress-driven distortion
and rotation of the oxygen octahedron of Cr, and the half-metal-semiconductor
transition originates from the enhancement of the crystal field splitting due
to the structural change. Importantly, our systematic total-energy comparison
indicates the ferromagnetic Curie temperature remains almost independent of the
strain, near 400 K. This biaxial stress can be realized by applying biaxial
pressure or growing the CrO$_2$ epitaxially on appropriate substrates. These
results should be useful for realizing full (100\%) spin polarization of
controllable carriers as one uses in modern semiconductor technology.

arbitary bounded domain is approximated using a classical Fourier series on a
bounding box. On the smaller domain the Fourier series exhibits redundancy, and
it has the mathematical structure of a frame rather than a basis. It is not
trivial to construct approximations in this frame using function evaluations in
points that belong to the domain only, but one way to do so is through a
discrete least squares approximation. The corresponding system is extremely
ill-conditioned, due to the redundancy in the frame, yet its solution via a
regularized SVD is known to be accurate to very high (and nearly spectral)
precision. Still, this computation requires ${\mathcal O}(N^3)$ operations. In
this paper we describe an algorithm to compute such Fourier extension frame
approximations in only ${\mathcal O}(N^2 \log^2 N)$ operations for general 2D
domains. The cost improves to ${\mathcal O}(N \log^2N)$ operations for simpler
tensor-product domains. The algorithm exploits a phenomenon called the plunge
region in the analysis of time-frequency localization operators, which
manifests itself here as a sudden drop in the singular values of the least
squares matrix. It is known that the size of the plunge region scales like
${\mathcal O}(\log N)$ in one dimensional problems. In this paper we show that
for most 2D domains in the fully discrete case the plunge region scales like
${\mathcal O}(N \log N)$, proving a discrete equivalent of a result that was
conjectured by Widom for a related continuous problem. The complexity estimate
depends on the Minkowski or box-counting dimension of the domain boundary, and
as such it is larger than ${\mathcal O}(N \log N)$ for domains with fractal
shape.

produce statistics that characterize the extent and impact of convective

simulations which treat non-local convection, throughout a large portion of the
stellar radius, with simulations designed to treat local convection in a small

compare simulations of different resolution, which have different velocity
magnitudes. We also compare statistical results between simulations that
radiate energy at a constant rate to those that allow energy to radiate from
the stellar surface according to the local surface temperature. Based on the
frequency and depth of penetrating convective structures, we observe two
distinct layers that form between the convection zone and the stable radiative

convective penetration at any time corresponds closely in space with the radial
position where internal waves are excited. We find that the maximal penetration
depth can be modeled by a Weibull distribution with a small shape parameter.

Training for neural networks, which is a method for incorporating these target

neural networks to not only approximate the function's outputs but also the
function's derivatives we encode additional information about the target

the quality of our predictors, as well as the data-efficiency and

availability of an up-to-date and spatially consistent map of the location and
distribution of human settlements. It is here that the Global Urban Footprint

settlement mask shows a so far unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.4 arcsec
($\sim12 m$) that provides - for the first time - a complete picture of the
entirety of urban and rural settlements. The GUF has been derived by means of a
fully automated processing framework - the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) -
that was used to analyze a global coverage of more than 180,000 TanDEM-X and
TerraSAR-X radar images with 3m ground resolution collected in 2011-2012.
Various quality assessment studies to determine the absolute GUF accuracy based
on ground truth data on the one hand and the relative accuracies compared to
established settlements maps on the other hand, clearly indicate the added
value of the new global GUF layer, in particular with respect to the
representation of rural settlement patterns. Generally, the GUF layer achieves
an overall absolute accuracy of about 85\%, with observed minima around 65\%
and maxima around 98 \%. The GUF will be provided open and free for any
scientific use in the full resolution and for any non-profit (but also
non-scientific) use in a generalized version of 2.8 arcsec ($\sim84m$).
Therewith, the new GUF layer can be expected to break new ground with respect
to the analysis of global urbanization and peri-urbanization patterns,
population estimation or vulnerability assessment.

membrane to acquire an outer envelope of lipid membrane and viral
glycoproteins. However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for
assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid
core, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate
budding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions,
as well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a
transition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed
budding which occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions.
The simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to
significantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This
polydispersity can be qualitatively explained by a theoretical model accounting
for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein
shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads
to a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially
budded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of
budded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could
establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid
interactions. Although our model is motivated by alphaviruses, we discuss

is $\sim$ 1/5 of the Milky Way (MW). The ALMA observations first reveal sub-pc
scale molecular structures in $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) and $^{13}$CO($J=2-1$)
emission. We found strong CO peaks associated with young stellar objects (YSOs)
identified by the $Spitzer$ Space Telescope, and also found that overall
molecular gas is distributed along the edge of the neighboring HII region. We
derived a gas density of $\sim 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ in molecular clouds associated
with YSOs based on the virial mass estimated from $^{12}$CO($J=2-1$) emission.
This high gas density is presumably due to the effect of the HII region under
the low-metallicity (accordingly small-dust content) environment in the SMC;
far-UV radiation from the HII region can easily penetrate and photo-dissociate
the outer layer of $^{12}$CO molecules in the molecular clouds, and thus only
the innermost parts of the molecular clouds are observed even in $^{12}$CO
emission. We obtained the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor $X_{\rm CO}$ of $7.5

and CO luminosities, which is four times larger than that in the MW, 2 $\times

require only $\mathcal{O}(t)$ time and space per iteration, and, when the only
information on the losses is their convexity, achieve a minimax optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Nonetheless, many common losses in kernel
problems, such as squared loss, logistic loss, and squared hinge loss posses
stronger curvature that can be exploited. In this case, second-order KOCO
methods achieve $\mathcal{O}(\log(\text{Det}(\boldsymbol{K})))$ regret, which
we show scales as $\mathcal{O}(d_{\text{eff}}\log T)$, where $d_{\text{eff}}$

framing rather than a fundamental inability to solve the problems or
misconceptions about physics content. Using the theoretical lens of
epistemological framing, we applied previously developed frames to seek an
underlying structure to the long lists of published difficulties that span many
topics in quantum mechanics. Mapping descriptions of published difficulties
into errors in epistemological framing and resource use, we analyzed
descriptions of students' problem solving to find their frames, and compared
students' framing to the framing (and frame shifting) required by problem
statements. We found three categories of error: mismatches between students'
framing and problem statement framing; inappropriate or absent shifting between
frames; and insufficient resource activation within an appropriate frame.

  Capability for Distributed Storage Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are a class of erasure codes that are
widely adopted to enhance the reliability of distributed storage systems (DSS).
In (n, k) MDS coded DSS, the original data are stored into n distributed nodes
in an efficient manner such that each storage node only contains a small amount
(i.e., 1/k) of the data and a data collector connected to any k nodes can
retrieve the entire data. On the other hand, a node failure can be repaired
(i.e., stored data at the failed node can be successfully recovered) by
downloading data segments from other surviving nodes. In this paper, we develop
a new approach to construction of simple (5, 3) MDS codes. With judiciously
block-designed generator matrices, we show that the proposed MDS codes have a
minimum stripe size {\alpha} = 2 and can be constructed over a small (Galois)
finite field F4 of only four elements, both facilitating low-complexity
computations and implementations for data storage, retrieval and repair. In
addition, with the proposed MDS codes, any single node failure can be repaired
through interference alignment technique with a minimum data amount downloaded
from the surviving nodes; i.e., the proposed codes ensure optimal exact-repair
of any single node failure using the minimum bandwidth. The low-complexity and
all-node-optimal-repair properties of the proposed MDS codes make them readily
deployed for practical DSS.

that the commonly observed carrier density hysteresis in graphene on SiO$_2$
due to interface water/oxygen vanishes at temperatures below 250 K. The state
of these species, which affects the graphene carrier density, at low
temperatures can be reversibly controlled by thermal cycling to room
temperature at different gate voltages. Further, devices prepared with
relatively dry interface, and thus showing negligible hysteresis at room
temperature, show a marked increase in hysteresis on heating above room
temperature. Thus thermal-cycling, to high temperatures and under gate-voltage,
provides a reversible handle on carrier density. These results are discussed in
terms of temperature and interface-water density dependence of redox-reaction

light curve, the time-resolved X-ray spectra provided by the EPIC cameras on
board and the first high-resolution spectrum of this source, provided by the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer, were analysed. An X-ray pulse of $9350\pm 160$
s was measured, confirming the secular spin up of this source. We also fit the
pulse-phase-resolved spectra with Comptonisation models. These models imply a
very small ($r\sim 3$ km) and hot ($kT\sim 2-3$ keV) emitting region and
therefore point to a hot spot over the neutron star (NS) surface as the most
reliable explanation for the X-ray pulse. The long NS spin period, the spin-up
rate, and persistent X-ray emission can be explained within the theory of
quasi-spherical settling accretion, which may indicate that the magnetic field
is in the magnetar range. Thus, 4U 0114$+$65 could be a wind-accreting
magnetar. We also observed two episodes of low luminosity. The first can be
explained as an absorption by an over-dense structure in the wind of the donor.
The second episode may be due to temporal cessation of accretion onto one
magnetic pole caused by non-spherical matter capture from the structured
stellar wind. The light curve displays two types of dips seen during the
high-flux intervals. The short dips, with durations of tens of seconds, are
produced through absorption by wind clumps. The long dips might be associated
with the rarefied interclump medium. We also found evidence of emission lines
in the X-ray photoionised wind of the B1Ia donor. The Fe K$\alpha$ line is
highly variable and much weaker than in other X-ray binaries with supergiant
donors. The degree of wind clumping, measured through the covering fraction, is
much lower than in supergiant donor stars with earlier spectral types.

to fabricate a lattice of physical qubits embedded on a manifold with a
non-trivial topology such that the quantum information is encoded in the global
degrees of freedom (i.e. the topology) of the manifold. However, the
manufacturing of large-scale topological devices will undoubtedly suffer from
fabrication errors---permanent faulty components such as missing physical
qubits or failed entangling gates---introducing permanent defects into the
topology of the lattice and hence significantly reducing the distance of the
code and the quality of the encoded logical qubits. In this work we investigate
how fabrication errors affect the performance of topological codes, using the
surface code as the testbed. A known approach to mitigate defective lattices
involves the use of primitive SWAP gates in a long sequence of syndrome
extraction circuits. Instead, we show that in the presence of fabrication
errors the syndrome can be determined using the supercheck operator approach
and the outcome of the defective gauge stabilizer generators without any
additional computational overhead or the use of SWAP gates. We report numerical
fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both qubit fabrication and gate
fabrication errors using a circuit-based noise model and the minimum-weight
perfect matching decoder. Our numerical analysis is most applicable to 2D
chip-based technologies, but the techniques presented here can be readily
extended to other topological architectures. We find that in the presence of 8%
qubit fabrication errors, the surface code can still tolerate a computational
error rate of up to 0.1%.

formation of the flux emergence of a twisted flux tube, inducing the formation
of stable and unstable magnetic flux ropes of Leake (2013, 2014). We use these
numerical simulations to investigate the eruptive signatures observable in
various magnetic scalar parameters and provide highlights on data analysis
processing. Time series of 2D photospheric-like magnetograms are used from
parametric simulations of stable and unstable flux emergence, to compute a list
of about 100 different indicators. This list includes parameters previously
used for operational forecasting, physical parameters used for the first time,
as well as new quantities specifically developed for this purpose. Our results
indicate that only parameters measuring the total non-potentiality of active
regions associated with magnetic inversion line properties, such as the
Falconer parameters $L_{ss}$, $WL_{ss}$, $L_{sg}$ and $WL_{sg}$, as well as the
new current integral $WL_{sc}$ and length $L_{sc}$ parameters, present a
significant ability to distinguish the eruptive cases of the model from the
non-eruptive cases, possibly indicating that they are promising flare and
eruption predictors.

explicitly solved and analysed, as a first step towards higher dimensional
models of physical relevance. We analyse the behaviour of the change in the
energy levels when an interaction of the type $-\lambda\,\delta(x)$ or
$-\lambda\,\delta(x-x_0)$ is switched on. In the first case, even energy levels
(pertaining to antisymmetric bound states) remain invariant with $\lambda$
although odd energy levels (pertaining to symmetric bound states) decrease as
$\lambda$ increases. In the second, all energy levels decrease when the form
factor $\lambda$ increases. A similar study has been performed for the so
called nonlocal $\delta'$ interaction, requiring a coupling constant
renormalization, which implies the replacement of the form factor $\lambda$ by
a renormalized form factor $\beta$. In terms of $\beta$, even energy levels are
unchanged. However, we show the existence of level crossings: after a fixed
value of $\beta$ the energy of each odd level, with the natural exception of
the first one, becomes lower than the constant energy of the previous even
level. Finally, we consider an interaction of the type
$-a\delta(x)+b\delta'(x)$, and analyse in detail the discrete spectrum of the
resulting self-adjoint Hamiltonian.

simulating autocorrelated draws from target distributions, including posterior
distributions in Bayesian analysis. An important consideration in using
simulated MCMC draws for inference is that the sampling algorithm has converged
to the distribution of interest. Since the distribution is typically of a
non-standard form, convergence cannot generally be proven and, instead, is
assessed with convergence diagnostics. Although parameters used in the MCMC
framework are typically continuous, there are many situations in which
simulating a categorical variable is desired. Examples include indicators for
model inclusion in Bayesian variable selection and latent categorical component
variables in mixture modeling. Traditional convergence diagnostics are designed
for continuous variables and may be inappropriate for categorical variables. In
this paper two convergence diagnostic methods are considered which are
appropriate for MCMC data. The diagnostics discussed in the paper utilize
chi-squared test statistics for dependent data. Performance of the convergence
diagnostics is evaluated under various simulations. Finally, the diagnostics
are applied to a real data set where reversible jump MCMC is used to sample
from a finite mixture model.

is realized as an element-wise multiplication of the mixture signal's T-F

shown that the performance of the overall source estimation scheme is subject

mode-dependent. This means that, at switching instants, some of the slow
variables can become fast and vice-versa. Firstly, we show that using a

form in which the variables preserve their nature over time. Secondly, we
establish, through singular perturbation techniques, an upper bound on the
minimum dwell-time ensuring the overall system's stability. Remarkably, this
bound is the sum of two terms. The first term corresponds to an upper bound on
the minimum dwell-time ensuring the stability of the reduced order linear
hybrid system describing the slow dynamics. The order of magnitude of the
second term is determined by that of the parameter defining the ratio between
the two time-scales of the singularly perturbed system. We show that the

the Hirota equations amount to saying that merging 3rd kind cycles (monopoles)
yields a 2nd kind cycle (dipole). The lecture is divided into 3 parts: 1)
classical case, perturbative: the spectral curve is a ramified cover of a base
Riemann surface -- with some additional structure -- and the integrable system
is defined as a formal power series of a small ""dispersion"" parameter
$\epsilon$. 2) dispersive classical case, non perturbative: the spectral curve
is defined not as a ramified cover (which would be a bundle with discrete
fiber), but as a vector bundle -- whose dispersionless limit consists in
chosing a finite set of vectors in each fiber. 3) non-commutative case, and
perturbative. The spectral curve is here a ""non-commutative"" surface, whose
geometry will be defined in lecture III. 4) the full non-commutative

essential role in various fields of biomedicine, engineering, and physical

lensfree holography provides a new way to effectively bypass the intrinsical
trade-off between the spatial resolution and FOV of conventional microscopes.
Unfortunately, due to the limited sensor pixel-size, unpredictable disturbance
during image acquisition, and sub-optimum solution to the phase retrieval
problem, typical lensfree microscopes only produce compromised imaging quality
in terms of lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we
propose an adaptive pixel-super-resolved lensfree imaging (APLI) method which
can solve, or at least partially alleviate these limitations. Our approach
addresses the pixel aliasing problem by Z-scanning only, without resorting to
subpixel shifting or beam-angle manipulation. Automatic positional error
correction algorithm and adaptive relaxation strategy are introduced to enhance
the robustness and SNR of reconstruction significantly. Based on APLI, we
perform full-FOV reconstruction of a USAF resolution target ($\sim$29.85
$m{m^2}$) and achieve half-pitch lateral resolution of 770 $nm$, surpassing
2.17 times of the theoretical Nyquist-Shannon sampling resolution limit imposed
by the sensor pixel-size (1.67 $\mu m$). Full-FOV imaging result of a typical

(OGLE survey) and X-ray (SWIFT telescope). During these campaigns a tight
coincidence of X-ray and optical outbursts is observed. We interpret this as
typical Type I outbursts as often detected in Be X-ray binaries at periastron
passage of the neutron star. To study different X-ray luminosity regimes in
depth, during the source quiescence we observed it with XMM-Newton while
Chandra observations followed an X-ray outburst. Nearly simultaneously with
Chandra observations in X-rays, in optical the RSS/SALT telescope obtained
spectra of SXP 1062. On the basis of our multi-wavelength campaign we propose a
simple scenario where the disc of the Be star is observed face-on, while the
orbit of the neutron star is inclined with respect to the disc. According to
the model of quasi-spherical settling accretion our estimation of the magnetic
field of the pulsar in SXP 1062 does not require an extremely strong magnetic

precisely measuring the masses of two charged particles moving in opposite

  arXiv:1706.04796",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classical Morse--Sard theorem claims that for a mapping $v:\mathbb
R^n\to\mathbb R^{m+1}$ of class $C^k$ the measure of critical values
$v(Z_{v,m})$ is zero under condition $k\ge n-m$. Here the critical set, or
$m$-critical set is defined as $Z_{v,m} = \{ x \in \mathbb R^n : \, {\rm
rank}\,\nabla v(x)\le m \}$. Further Dubovitski\u{\i} in 1957 and independently
Federer and Dubovitski\u{\i} in 1967 found some elegant extensions of this
theorem to the case of other (e.g., lower) smoothness assumptions. They also
established the sharpness of their results within the $C^k$ category.
  Here we formulate and prove a \textit{bridge theorem} that includes all the
above results as particular cases: namely, if a function $v:\mathbb
R^n\to\mathbb R^d$ belongs to the Holder class $C^{k,\alpha}$,
$0\le\alpha\le1$, then for every $q>m$ the identity $$\mathcal
H^{\mu}(Z_{v,m}\cap v^{-1}(y))=0$$ holds for $\mathcal H^q$-almost all
$y\in\mathbb R^d$, where $\mu=n-m-(k+\alpha)(q-m)$.
  The result is new even for the classical $C^k$-case (when $\alpha=0$); a
similar result is established for the Sobolev classes of mappings
$W^k_p(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb R^d)$ with minimal integrability assumptions
$p=\max(1,n/k)$, i.e., it guarantees in general only the continuity (not
everywhere differentiability) of a mapping. However, using some $N$-properties
for Sobolev mappings, established in our previous paper, we obtained that the
sets of nondifferentiability points of Sobolev mappings are fortunately
negligible in the above bridge theorem. We cover also the case of fractional
Sobolev spaces.
  The proofs of the most results are based on our previous joint papers with J.
Bourgain and J. Kristensen (2013, 2015).

improve accuracy in relay settings and power flow modeling. To improve TL
parameter estimates, various algorithms have been proposed in the past to
identify TL parameters based on measurements from Phasor Measurement Units
(PMUs). These methods are based on the positive sequence TL models and can
generate accurate positive sequence impedance parameters for a fully-transposed
TL when measurement noise is absent; however these methods may generate
erroneous parameters when the TLs are not fully transposed or when measurement
noise is present. PMU field-measure data are often corrupted with noise and
this noise is problematic for all parameter identification algorithms,
particularly so when applied to short transmission lines. This paper analyzes
the limitations of the positive sequence TL model when used for parameter
estimation of TLs that are untransposed and proposes a novel method using
linear estimation theory to identify TL parameters more reliably. This method
can be used for the most general case: short or long lines that are fully
transposed or untransposed and have balanced or unbalance loads. Besides the
positive or negative sequence impedance parameters, the proposed method can
also be used to estimate the zero sequence parameters and the mutual impedances
between different sequences. This paper also examines the influence of noise in
the PMU data on the calculation of TL parameters. Several case studies are
conducted based on simulated data from ATP to validate the effectiveness of the
new method. Through comparison of the results generated by this novel method
and several other methods, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated.

together into one big system by passing information from subsystems as
parameters into the subsystems under influence. As executed at fixed time
points, this data exchange gives the global method a strong explicit component,
and as flows of conserved quantities are passed across subsystem boundaries, it
is not ensured that systemwide balances are fulfilled: the system is not solved
as one single equation system. These balance errors can accumulate and make
simulation results inaccurate. Use of higher-order extrapolation in exchanged
data can reduce this problem but cannot solve it. The remaining balance error
has been handled in past work with balance correction methods which compensate
these errors by adding corrections for the balances to the signal in next
coupling time step. Further past work combined smooth extrapolation of
exchanged data and balance correction. This gives rise to the problem that
establishing balance of one quantity a posteriori due to the time delay in
general cannot establish or even disturbs the balances of quantities that
depend on the exchanged quantities, usually energy. In this work, a method is
suggested which allows to choose the quantity that should be balanced to be
that energy, and to accurately balance it.
