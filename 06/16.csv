PT$-symmetric photonic dimer using a coupled-mode theory. Several surprising
understandings are obtained from this perspective: The longitudinal flux shows
that the $\cal PT$ transition in a dimer can be regarded as a classical effect,
despite its analogy to $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum mechanics. The longitudinal
flux also indicates that the so-called giant amplification in the $\cal
PT$-symmetric phase is a sub-exponential behavior and does not outperform a
single gain waveguide. The transverse flux, on the other hand, reveals that the
apparent power oscillations between the gain and loss waveguides in the $\cal
PT$-symmetric phase can be deceiving in certain cases, where the transverse
power transfer is in fact unidirectional. We also show that this power transfer
cannot be arbitrarily fast even when the exceptional point is approached.
Finally, we go beyond the coupled-mode theory by using the paraxial wave
equation and also extend our discussions to a $\cal PT$ diamond and a
one-dimensional periodic lattice.

For the first variation, we present a methodology to calculate an expected

probabilities of match outcome to evaluate an expected points plus-minus

we shed light on the debate regarding which is the strongest league. The model
suggests the English Premier League is the strongest, with the German

facts, events, procedures and more generally about any type of previous
experience. Memories are remembered as long as they influence our thoughts,
feelings, and behavior at the present time. Memory is also one of the
fundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of
knowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical
substrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical
process can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations
last only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot
influence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to
keep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves
several distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal
levels. One of the goals of theoretical neuroscience is to try to understand
how these processes are orchestrated to store memories rapidly and preserve
them over a lifetime. Theorists have mostly focused on synaptic plasticity, as
it is one of the most studied memory mechanisms in experimental neuroscience
and it is known to be highly effective in training artificial neural networks
to perform real world tasks. Some of the synaptic plasticity models are purely
phenomenological, some others have been designed to solve computational
problems. In this article I will review some of these models and I will try to
identify computational principles that underlie memory storage and

physics. Intriguingly, it has been suggested that dark matter may be explained
by another recently observed phenomenon: the detection of gravitational waves
by LIGO. LIGO's detection of gravitational waves from merging stellar mass
black holes renewed attention toward the possibility that dark matter consists
solely of black holes created in the very early universe and that these
primordial black holes are what LIGO is presently observing. Subsequent work on
this topic has ruled out the possibility that dark matter could consist solely
of black holes similar to those that LIGO has detected with masses above 10
solar masses. However, LIGO's connection to dark matter remains an open
question and in this work we consider a distribution of primordial black holes
that accounts for all of the dark matter, is consistent with LIGO's
observations arising from primordial black hole binaries, and resolves tension
in previous surveys of microlensing events in the Milky Way halo. The
primordial black hole mass distribution that we consider offers an important
prediction--LIGO may detect black holes smaller than have ever been observed
with ~1% of the black holes it detects having a mass less than the mass of our
Sun. Approximately one year of operating advanced LIGO at design sensitivity
should be adequate to begin to see a hint of a primordial black hole mass
distribution. Detecting primordial black hole binaries below a solar mass will
be readily distinguishable from other known compact binary systems, thereby
providing an unambiguous observational window for advanced LIGO to pin down the
nature of dark matter.

$w_{x}\leq -1~$ and $~\xi \leq 0$, where $w_{x}$ is the dark energy equation of

to the background energy transfer, the whole parameter space can be tested
against all the data and thus, the instabilities in such interaction models can
be removed. We test three classes of interaction model using the latest
astronomical data from different sources. Precise constraints are found. Our
analysis shows that a very small but non-zero deviation from pure
$\Lambda$-cosmology is suggested by the observational data while the
no-interaction scenario can be recovered at the 68.3% confidence-level. In
particular, for three IDE models, identified as IDE 1, IDE 2, and IDE 3, the

decreases, the behavior of the dark energy EoS shifts from phantom to
quintessence type with its EoS very close to that a simple cosmological

is placed at a given distance apart. For temperatures below the transition
temperature, the correlation length starts growing as the field strength
increases to then decrease for large magnetic fields. For temperatures above
the critical temperature, the correlation length continues increasing as the
field strength increases. We found that such behavior can be understood as a
competition between the tightening induced by the classical magnetic force
versus the random thermal motion. For large enough temperatures, the increase
of the occupation number contributes to the screening of the interaction
between the test particles. The growth of the correlation distance with the

the increase of the occupation number with temperature.

presented modelling approach allows for separating the multiple frequency
components appearing within the MMC as a first step of the model derivation, to
avoid variables containing multiple frequency components in steady-state. On
this basis, it is shown that Park transformations at three different
frequencies ($+\omega$, $-2\omega$ and $+3\omega$) can be applied for deriving
a model formulation where all state-variables will settle at constant values in
steady-state, corresponding to an equilibrium point of the model. The resulting
model is accurately capturing the internal current and voltage dynamics of a
three-phase MMC, independently from how the control system is implemented. The
main advantage of this model formulation is that it can be linearised, allowing
for eigenvalue-based analysis of the MMC dynamics. Furthermore, the model can
be utilized for control system design by multi-variable methods requiring any
stable equilibrium to be defined by a fixed operating point. Time-domain
simulations in comparison to an established average model of the MMC, as well
as results from a detailed simulation model of an MMC with 400 sub-modules per

develop a technique for constructing partially hyperbolic representatives in
many mapping classes of $M$. We apply this technique both in the setting of
geodesic flows on closed hyperbolic surfaces and for Anosov flows which admit
transverse tori. We emphasize the similarity of both constructions through the
concept of $h$-transversality, a tool which allows us to compose different
mapping classes while retaining partial hyperbolicity.
  In the case of the geodesic flow of a closed hyperbolic surface $S$ we build
stably ergodic, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms whose mapping classes form
a subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathcal{M}(T^1S)$ which is isomorphic
to $\mathcal{M}(S)$. At the same time we show that the totality of mapping
classes which can be realized by partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms does not
form a subgroup of $\mathcal{M}(T^1S)$.
  Finally, some of the examples on $T^1S$ are absolutely partially hyperbolic,
stably ergodic and robustly non-dynamically coherent, disproving a conjecture

use this observation to compute the density response and collective behaviour

  Compared to the Fermi liquid case, we find that the boundaries of the
particle-hole continuum are blurred by incoherent contributions. However, there
is a region inside this continuum, that we call inner core, within which
salient features of the Fermi liquid case are preserved. A particularly
striking prediction of our work is that these systems support a plasmonic
collective excitation which is well-defined at large momenta, has an
approximately linear dispersion relation and is located in the low-energy tail
of the particle-hole continuum.
  Furthermore, the dynamic screening potential shows deep attractive regions as
a function of the distance at higher frequencies which might lead to long-lived
pair formation depending on the behaviour of the pair susceptibility. We also
find that Friedel oscillations are present in these systems but are highly

picture of the structure of the phase space of the system. We divide the phase
space in different regions which correspond to qualitatively distinct motions
and we demonstrate its different temporal evolution in the ""real"" vortex-space.
Our main emphasis is on the leapfrogging periodic orbit, around which we
identify a region that we term the ""leapfrogging envelope"" which involves
mostly regular motions, such as higher order periodic and quasi-periodic
solutions. We also identify the chaotic region of the phase plane surrounding
the leapfrogging envelope as well as the so-called walkabout and braiding

symmetry-breaking instability of the leapfrogging solution (in line with
earlier works), and also obtain the corresponding asymmetric branches of
periodic solutions. We then characterize their own instabilities (including
period doubling ones) and bifurcations in an effort to provide a more

dark matter halos. We propose to use the correlation of the positions of
galaxies with the shapes of background galaxy pairs, known as the
halo-shear-shear correlation (HSSC), to measure the mean halo ellipticity and
the abundance of subhalos in a statistical manner. We run high-resolution
cosmological $N$-body simulations and use the outputs to measure the HSSC for
galaxy halos and cluster halos. Non-spherical halos cause a characteristic
azimuthal variation of the HSSC, and massive subhalos in the outer region near
the virial radius contribute to $\sim10\%$ of the HSSC amplitude. Using the
HSSC and its covariance estimated from our $N$-body simulations, we make
forecast for constraining the internal structure of dark matter halos with
future galaxy surveys. With 1000 galaxy groups with mass greater than
$10^{13.5}\, h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, the average halo ellipticity can be measured
with an accuracy of ten percent. A spherical, smooth mass distribution can be
ruled out at a $\sim5\sigma$ significance level. The existence of subhalos
whose masses are in 1-10 percent of the main halo mass can be detected with
$\sim10^4$ galaxies/clusters. We conclude that the HSSC provides valuable

superclassical score at G guarantee that one player has created randomness from
the perspective of the other player? We show that for complete-support games,
the answer is yes: even if the second player is given the first player's input
at the conclusion of the game, he cannot perfectly recover her output. Thus
some amount of local randomness (i.e., randomness possessed by only one player)
is always obtained when randomness is certified from nonlocal games with
quantum strategies. This is in contrast to non-signaling game strategies, which
may produce global randomness without any local randomness. We discuss
potential implications for cryptographic protocols between mistrustful parties.

exploiting the hierarchical structure of the generative model. The underlying
principle shows that variational inference can be used a basic tool for
learning, but with the in- tractable likelihood replaced by a synthetic
likelihood, and the unknown posterior distribution replaced by an implicit
distribution; both synthetic likelihoods and implicit posterior distributions
can be learned using discriminators. This allows us to develop a natural fusion
of variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks, combining the
best of both these methods. We describe a unified objective for optimization,
discuss the constraints needed to guide learning, connect to the wide range of

and duration variations (TTVs and TDVs). The companions have masses of
$22^{+7}_{-5}\,M_{\rm Jup}$ (Kepler-448c) and $150^{+60}_{-40}\,M_{\rm Jup}$
(Kepler-693c), and both are on eccentric orbits ($e=0.65^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$ for

inner orbits as well ($e=0.34^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ for Kepler-448b and
$e=0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ for Kepler-693b). In the Kepler-693 system, a large
mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits
($53^{+7}_{-9}\,\mathrm{deg}$ or $134^{+11}_{-10}\,\mathrm{deg}$) is also
revealed by the TDVs. This is likely to induce a secular oscillation of the
inner WJ's eccentricity that brings its periastron close enough to the host
star for tidal star-planet interactions to be significant. In the Kepler-448
system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained and such an eccentricity
oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be
undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration
via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and
massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in
situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the
snow line.

Nucleosynthesis to variations in isospin breaking with precise input from
lattice QCD calculations. The predicted light nuclear abundances are most
sensitive to the neutron-proton mass splitting as both the initial relative
abundance of neutrons to protons and the $n \rightleftharpoons p$ weak reaction
rates are very sensitive to this quantity. Lattice QCD has been used to
determine this mass splitting to greater than 5-sigma, including contributions
from both the down-quark up-quark mass splitting, $2\delta = m_d-m_u$ and from
electromagnetic coupling of the quarks to the photons with a strength governed
by the fine structure constant, $\alpha_{fs}$. At leading order in isospin
breaking, the contribution of $\delta$ and $\alpha_{fs}$ to $M_n-M_p$ and the
nuclear reaction rates can be varied independently. We use this knowledge and
input from lattice QCD to quantitatively study variations of the predicted
light nuclear abundances as $\delta$ and $\alpha_{fs}$ are varied. The change
in the D and ${}^4$He abundances individually allow for potentially large
simultaneous variations in $\delta$ and $\alpha_{fs}$ while maintaining
consistency with the observed abundances, however the combined comparison
restricts variations in these sources of isospin breaking to less than
$\lesssim1.25\%$ at the 3-sigma confidence level. This sensitivity can be used
to place tight constraints on prospective beyond the Standard Model theories
that would modify these isospin breaking effects in the primordial Universe.

low dynamic pressure in their cores, these phenomena can significantly disturb
the bow shock and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Recent observations have
also demonstrated that foreshock transients can accelerate particles which,
when transported earthward, can affect space weather. Understanding the
potential of foreshock transients to accelerate particles can help us
understand shock acceleration at Earth and at other planetary and astrophysical
systems. To further investigate foreshock transients' potential for
acceleration we conduct a statistical study of ion and electron energization in
the core of foreshock transients. We find that electron energies typically
increase there, evidently due to an internal acceleration process, whereas, as
expected, ion energies most often decrease to support transient formation and
expansion. Nevertheless, ion energy enhancements can be seen in some events
suggesting an internal ion acceleration process as well. Formation conditions
of foreshock transients are related to weak solar wind magnetic field strength
and fast solar wind speed. Ion and electron energization are also positively
correlated with solar wind speed.

methods based on the Cambridge $M_{T2}$ variable and MAOS-reconstruction of
invisible momenta, and show that their algorithm can be simplified without loss
of sensitivity, due to a perfect correlation between events with complex
solutions for the invisible momenta and events exhibiting a kinematic endpoint

inflation scenarios containing a quasi-inflection point along the inflationary
trajectory. The interplay of radiative corrections with this quasi-inflection
point may translate into a sizable modification of the inflationary

trend of personalization in Web search, where different users receive different
results for the same search query. The increasing level of personalization is
leading to concerns about Filter Bubble effects, where certain users are simply
unable to access information that the search engines' algorithm decides is
irrelevant. Despite these concerns, there has been little quantification of the
extent of personalization in Web search today, or the user attributes that
cause it.
  In light of this situation, we make three contributions. First, we develop a
methodology for measuring personalization in Web search results. While
conceptually simple, there are numerous details that our methodology must
handle in order to accurately attribute differences in search results to
personalization. Second, we apply our methodology to 200 users on Google Web
Search and 100 users on Bing. We find that, on average, 11.7% of results show
differences due to personalization on Google, while 15.8% of results are
personalized on Bing, but that this varies widely by search query and by result
ranking. Third, we investigate the user features used to personalize on Google
Web Search and Bing. Surprisingly, we only find measurable personalization as a
result of searching with a logged in account and the IP address of the
searching user. Our results are a first step towards understanding the extent
and effects of personalization on Web search engines today.

Remarkably, this multifractality is robust in that it does not require any

multifractality of $critical$ wavefunctions. The multifractality arises as the
periodic drive hybridises the localised and delocalised sectors of the undriven

injection at the base of the GRB jet and apply these to different prompt
emission models to make predictions for the GRB energetics, spectra and
lightcurves. We investigate both shock and magnetic reconnection models for the
particle acceleration, as well as the effects of energy dissipation across
optically thick and thin regions of the jet. The magnetization at the base of
the jet, $\sigma_0$, is the main parameter driving the GRB evolution in the
magnetar model and the emission is typically released for $100\lesssim \sigma_0
\lesssim 3000$. Given the rapid increase in $\sigma_0$ as the proto-magnetar
cools and its neutrino-driven mass loss subsides, the GRB duration is typically
limited to $\lesssim 100$ s. This low baryon loading at late times challenges
magnetar models for ultra-long GRBs, though black hole models likely run into
similar difficulties without substantial entrainment from the jet walls. The
maximum radiated gamma-ray energy is $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{51}$erg,
significantly less than the magnetar's total initial rotational energy and in
strong tension with the high end of the observed GRB energy distribution.

$f_Q=1.0^{+0.00}_{-0.37}$, consistent with a $\sim 2\times $ enhancement

stellar masses $M_* \leq 10^{10.85} M_{\odot}$. Both the $z\sim 1$ and $z\sim

already populated at high redshift, $z \ge 3$, placing constraints on the
mechanism(s) responsible for quenching in dense environments at $z\ge 1.5$

to investigate nuclear transport phenomena for a full range of equilibration
dynamics. These inquires provide us the ingredients to model such phenomena and
help answer important questions about the nuclear Equation of State (EOS) and
its evolution as a function of neutron-to-proton $(N/Z)$ ratio. Purpose: The
motivation is to examine the real-time dynamics of nuclear transport phenomena
and its dependence on $(N/Z)$ asymmetry from a microscopic point of view to
avoid any pre-conceived assumptions about the involved processes. Method:
Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method in full 3D is employed to calculate
deep-inelastic reactions of $^{78}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb and $^{92}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb
systems at 8.5~MeV$/A$. The impact parameter and energy-loss dependence of
relevant observables are calculated. In addition, density constrained TDHF
method is used to compute excitation energies of the primary fragments. The
statistical deexcitation code GEMINI is utilized to examine the final reaction
products. Results: The kinetic energy loss and sticking times as a function of
impact parameter are calculated. Final properties of the fragments (charge,
mass, scattering angle, kinetic energy) are computed. Conclusions: We find a
smooth dependence of the energy loss, $E_\mathrm{loss}$, on the impact
parameter for both systems. On the other hand the transfer properties for low
$E_\mathrm{loss}$ values are very different for the two systems but become
similar in the higher $E_\mathrm{loss}$ regime. The mean life time of the

center (GC), are among the most important findings of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. Because of the proximity, spatially resolved, multi-wavelength
observations offer excellent opportunities to learn about the physical origin
of the bubbles. One of the unique features of the observed bubbles is that
their gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ~110 GeV and the
overall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy
spectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin as it could be a signature
of synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons;
however, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should
be spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the formation of the Fermi
bubble in the leptonic jet scenario using a newly implemented CRSPEC module in
FLASH that allows us to track the evolution of CR spectrum on-the-fly during
the simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast
synchrotron and IC cooling near the GC when the jets were first launched. After
the jets propagate away from the GC, the dynamical timescale of the jets become
the shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is
essentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the
bubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of
the bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at early stage
of the bubble expansion. We find that the CR spatial and spectral distribution
predicted by the leptonic jet model can simultaneously match the normalization,
spectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and
their spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely
mechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles.

populations (MMPs, i.e., stars in narrow bins in [Fe/H] within wider
[$\alpha$/Fe] ranges) by the SDSS-III/APOGEE DR12 survey cast doubts on the
classical thin - thick disk dichotomy. The analysis of these observations lead
to the non-$[\alpha$/Fe] enhanced populations splitting into MMPs with
different surface densities according to their [Fe/H]. By contrast,
$[\alpha$/Fe] enhanced (i.e., old) populations show an homogeneous behaviour.
We analyze these results in the wider context of disk formation within
non-isolated halos embedded in the Cosmic Web, resulting in a two-phase mass
assembly. By performing hydrodynamical simulations in the context of the $\rm
\Lambda CDM$ model, we have found that the two phases of halo mass assembly (an
early, fast phase, followed by a slow one, with low mass assembly rates) are
very relevant to determine the radial structure of MMP distributions, while
radial mixing has only a secondary role, depending on the coeval dynamical
and/or destabilizing events. Indeed, while the frequent dynamical violent
events occuring at high redshift remove metallicity gradients, and imply
efficient stellar mixing, the relatively quiescent dynamics after the
transition keeps [Fe/H] gaseous gradients and prevents newly formed stars to
suffer from strong radial mixing. By linking the two-component disk concept
with the two-phase halo mass assembly scenario, our results set halo
virialization (the event marking the transition from the fast to the slow
phases) as the separating event marking periods characterized by different
physical conditions under which thick and thin disk stars were born.

[Ne III], and [O I] line detections. We model the spectral energy distribution

mass ratio of $\sim$0.1. We do not detect substantial accretion, but we do see
H$\alpha$ in emission in one epoch, suggestive that there may be intermittent
dumping of small amounts of matter onto the star. Considering the low dust
mass, the presence of gas, and young age of T~54, we conclude that this system
is on the bridge between the protoplanetary and debris disk stages.

extension can also revive the intermediate dark matter mass regime, between $W$
boson mass to a few hundred GeV's where pure IHDM can not give rise to correct
dark matter relic abundance. The late decay of the lightest right handed
neutrino to dark matter makes it possible for the usual thermally
under-abundant dark matter in this intermediate mass regime to satisfy the
correct relic abundance limit. The revival of this wide intermediate mass range
can not only have relevance for direct search experiments but also for neutrino
experiments as the long lifetime of the lightest right handed neutrino also
results in almost vanishing lightest neutrino mass.

evidence has been addressed recently with somewhat diverging conclusions. Aims:
The purpose of this paper is to assess the robustness of the conclusion that
the Universe is indeed accelerating if we rely only on low-redshift
(z$\lesssim$2) observations, that is to say with SNIa, baryonic acoustic
oscillations, measurements of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, and
measurements of the growth of matter perturbations. Methods: We used the
standard statistical procedure of minimizing the $\chi^2$ function for the
different probes to quantify the goodness of fit of a model for both
$\Lambda$CDM and a simple nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model. In this
analysis, we do not assume that supernovae intrinsic luminosity is independent
of the redshift, which has been a fundamental assumption in most previous
studies that cannot be tested. Results: We have found that, when SNIa intrinsic
luminosity is not assumed to be redshift independent, a nonaccelerated
low-redshift power law model is able to fit the low-redshift background data as
well as, or even slightly better, than $\Lambda$CDM. When measurements of the
growth of structures are added, a nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model
still provides an excellent fit to the data for all the luminosity evolution
models considered. Conclusions: Without the standard assumption that supernovae
intrinsic luminosity is independent of the redshift, low-redshift probes are
consistent with a nonaccelerated universe.

(presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical
perspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological
computers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational
systems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined
as free energy expended per amino acid operation, outperforms the best
supercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of
magnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends
strongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular,
we show that the {\it useful} efficiency of an amino acid operation, defined as
the bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing
bacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This
cost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through
the major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes.
However, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in
bacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological
architectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.

observed to accelerate electrons to many times their thermal energy. How such
acceleration occurs is unknown, however. Using THEMIS case studies, we examine
a subset of acceleration events (31 of 247 events) in foreshock transients with
cores that exhibit gradual electron energy increases accompanied by low
background magnetic field strength and large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations.
Using the evolution of electron distributions and the energy increase rates at
multiple spacecraft, we suggest that Fermi acceleration between a converging
foreshock transient's compressional boundary and the bow shock is responsible
for the observed electron acceleration. We then show that a one-dimensional
test particle simulation of an ideal Fermi acceleration model in fluctuating
fields prescribed by the observations can reproduce the observed evolution of
electron distributions, energy increase rate, and pitch-angle isotropy,
providing further support for our hypothesis. Thus, Fermi acceleration is
likely the principal electron acceleration mechanism in at least this subset of
foreshock transient cores.

clustering algorithms, here, we advocate for a unified treatment of the two
problems and suggest that hierarchical frameworks that progressively build
complex patterns on top of the simpler ones (e.g., convolutional neural

show that CNNs, trained end to end using back propagation with noisy labels,
are able to cluster data points belonging to several overlapping shapes, and do
so much better than the state of the art algorithms. The main takeaway lesson
from our study is that mechanisms of human vision, particularly the hierarchal
organization of the visual ventral stream should be taken into account in
clustering algorithms (e.g., for learning representations in an unsupervised
manner or with minimum supervision) to reach human level clustering
performance. This, by no means, suggests that other methods do not hold merits.
For example, methods relying on pairwise affinities (e.g., spectral clustering)

These data have a spatial resolution of 0.035""/pixel and spectral resolution of
R~3800 in the H and K broad bands. We focus our analysis on regions of
Neptune's atmosphere that are near-infrared dark- that is, free of discrete
bright cloud features. We use a forward model coupled to a Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm to retrieve properties of Neptune's aerosol structure and
methane profile above ~4 bar in these near-infrared dark regions.
  Using a set of high signal-to-noise spectra in a cloud-free band from 2-12N,
we find that Neptune's cloud opacity is dominated by a compact, optically thick
cloud layer with a base near 3 bar and composed of low albedo, forward
scattering particles, with an assumed characteristic size of ~1$\mu$m. Above
this cloud, we require a vertically extended haze of smaller (~0.1 $\mu$m)
particles, which reaches from the upper troposphere (~0.6 bar) into the
stratosphere. The particles in this haze are brighter and more isotropically
scattering than those in the deep cloud. When we extend our analysis to 18
cloud-free locations from 20N to 87S, we observe that the optical depth in
aerosols above 0.5 bar decreases by a factor of 2-3 or more at mid- and
high-southern latitudes relative to low latitudes.
  We also consider Neptune's methane (CH$_4$) profile, and find that our
retrievals indicate a strong preference for a low methane relative humidity at
pressures where methane is expected to condense. Our preferred solution at most
locations is for a methane relative humidity below 10% near the tropopause in
addition to methane depletion down to 2.0-2.5 bar. We tentatively identify a
trend of lower CH$_4$ columns above 2.5 bar at mid- and high-southern latitudes
over low latitudes.

the bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of reionisation. The recovery of
their properties, such as age, color excess E(B-V), specific star formation
rate (sSFR) and stellar mass, will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution
fitting, based on the data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the
Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work
we analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI
broad-band filters, from 0.6 {\mu}m to 7.7 {\mu}m, on the recovery of these
galaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated
galaxies, with known input properties, at z=7-10. We found that, with only 8
NIRCam broad-bands, we can recover the galaxy age within 0.1 Gyr and the color
excess within 0.06 mag for 70% of the galaxies. Besides, the stellar masses and
sSFR are recovered within 0.2 and 0.3 dex, respectively, at z=7-9. Instead, at
z=10, no NIRCam band traces purely the {\lambda}> 4000 {\AA} regime and the
percentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by > 20% (> 90%), in
comparison to z=9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are crucial to improve the
stellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z=10. When nebular emission lines are
present, deriving correct galaxy properties is challenging, at any redshift and
with any band combination. In particular, the stellar mass is systematically
overestimated in up to 0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including
MIRI observations improves only marginally the estimation.

representation and choice of similarity for grouping faces. We first propose a
representation based on ResNet, which has been shown to perform very well in
image classification problems. Given this representation, we design a

estimates the adjacency matrix only based on the similarity between face

pairwise similarity between faces. ConPaC formulates the clustering problem as
a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model and uses Loopy Belief Propagation to
find an approximate solution for maximizing the posterior probability of the

IJB-B) show that ConPaC outperforms well known clustering algorithms such as
k-means, spectral clustering and approximate rank-order. Additionally, our

channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we develop a general
downlink model with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, applied in realistic
heterogeneous cellular systems with multiple antenna base stations (BSs).
Specifically, we take into consideration imperfect CSIT due to pilot
contamination, channel aging due to users relative movement, and unavoidable
residual additive transceiver hardware impairments (RATHIs). Assuming that the
BSs are Poisson distributed, the main contributions focus on the derivations of
the upper bound of the coverage probability and the achievable user rate for
this general model. We show that both the coverage probability and the user
rate are dependent on the imperfect CSIT and RATHIs. More concretely, we
quantify the resultant performance loss of the network due to these effects. We
depict that the uplink RATHIs have equal impact, but the downlink transmit BS
distortion has a greater impact than the receive hardware impairment of the
user. Thus, the transmit BS hardware should be of better quality than user's
receive hardware. Furthermore, we characterise both the coverage probability
and user rate in terms of the time variation of the channel. It is shown that
both of them decrease with increasing user mobility, but after a specific value
of the normalised Doppler shift, they increase again. Actually, the time
variation, following the Jakes autocorrelation function, mirrors this effect on
coverage probability and user rate. Finally, we consider space division
multiple access (SDMA), single user beamforming (SU-BF), and baseline
single-input single-output (SISO) transmission. A comparison among these
schemes reveals that the coverage by means of SU-BF outperforms SDMA in terms

applied to explain paradoxical situations that cannot be easily explained
through classical theory. In quantum probability, events are characterised by a
superposition state, which is represented by a state vector in a
$N$-dimensional vector space. The probability of an event is given by the
squared magnitude of the projection of this superposition state into the
desired subspace. This geometric approach is very useful to explain paradoxical
findings that involve order effects, but do we really need quantum principles
for models that only involve projections?
  This work has two main goals. First, it is still not clear in the literature
if a quantum projection model has any advantage towards a classical projection.
We compared both models and concluded that the Quantum Projection model
achieves the same results as its classical counterpart, because the quantum
interference effects play no role in the computation of the probabilities.
Second, it intends to propose an alternative relativistic interpretation for
rotation parameters that are involved in both classical and quantum models. In
the end, instead of interpreting these parameters as a similarity measure
between questions, we propose that they emerge due to the lack of knowledge
concerned with a personal basis state and also due to uncertainties towards the

Dynamics for the family of interference games. Interference games represent the
fundamental resource allocation conflict between users of the radio spectrum.
In contrast to congestion games, interference games are generally not potential
games. Therefore, proving the convergence of the best-response dynamics to a
Nash equilibrium in these games requires new techniques. We suggest a model for
random interference games, based on the long term fading governed by the
players' geometry. Our goal is to prove convergence of the approximate
best-response dynamics with high probability with respect to the randomized
game. We embrace the asynchronous model in which the acting player is chosen at
each stage at random. In our approximate best-response dynamics, the action of
a deviating player is chosen at random among all the approximately best ones.
We show that with high probability, with respect to the players' geometry and
asymptotically with the number of players, each action increases the expected
social-welfare (sum of achievable rates). Hence, the induced sum-rate process
is a submartingale. Based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem, we prove
convergence of the strategy profile to an approximate Nash equilibrium with
good performance for asymptotically almost all interference games. We use the
Markovity of the induced sum-rate process to provide probabilistic bounds on
the convergence time. Finally, we demonstrate our results in simulated
examples.

assesses the quality of instruction of any first course in cybersecurity. In
fall 2014, we carried out a Delphi process that identified core concepts of
cybersecurity. In spring 2016, we interviewed twenty-six students to uncover
their understandings and misconceptions about these concepts. In fall 2016, we
generated our first assessment tool--a draft Cybersecurity Concept Inventory
(CCI), comprising approximately thirty multiple-choice questions. Each question
targets a concept; incorrect answers are based on observed misconceptions from
the interviews. This year we are validating the draft CCI using cognitive
interviews, expert reviews, and psychometric testing. In this paper, we
highlight our progress to date in developing the CCI.
  The CATS project provides infrastructure for a rigorous evidence-based
improvement of cybersecurity education. The CCI permits comparisons of
different instructional methods by assessing how well students learned the core
concepts of the field (especially adversarial thinking), where instructional
methods refer to how material is taught (e.g., lab-based, case-studies,
collaborative, competitions, gaming). Specifically, the CCI is a tool that will
enable researchers to scientifically quantify and measure the effect of their
approaches to, and interventions in, cybersecurity education.

However, in spite of the abundance of literature on the subject and the
existence of several variants of registration algorithms, their practical
utility remains problematic, as commonly acknowledged even by developers of
these methods because the complexity of the problem has resisted a general,
flexible, and robust theoretical and computational framework.
  To address this issue, we present a new registration method that is similar
in spirit to the current state-of-the-art technique of diffeomorphic mapping,
but is more general and flexible. The method utilizes a Hamiltonian formalism
and constructs registration as a sequence of symplectomorphic maps in
conjunction with a novel phase space regularization based on the powerful

  The method is demonstrated on the three different magnetic resonance imaging

between high resolution anatomical (HRA) volumes, medium resolution diffusion

magnesium-iron sulfide in common. Spherical corundum grains are supported by
the good match to a narrow 20.2 $\mu$m feature. Our preferred model contains
nitrides AlN and Si$_3$N$_4$ in low abundances. Dust masses range from 0.25 to
0.44 $M_\odot$ but $M_{\rm{tot}} \ge$ 45 $M_\odot$ in both cases due to an
expected high Fe gas-to-dust ratio. The bulk of dust is within a 5$""$ $\times$
7$""$ central region. An additional compact feature is detected at 390 $\mu$m.
We obtain $L_{\rm{IR}}$ = 2.96 $\times$ 10$^6$ $L_\odot$, a 25\% decline from
an average of mid-IR photometric levels observed in 1971-1977. This indicates a
reduction in circumstellar extinction in conjunction with an increase in visual
brightness, allowing 25-40\% of optical and UV radiation to escape from the
central source. We also present an analysis of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J =

number of qubits is an important metric in a quantum circuit design. Further,
scalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on Clifford + T gates. An
efficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the
number of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.
Recently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which
improves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of
qubits, and delay. However, the recent design is not based on fault-tolerant
Clifford + T gates. Also, it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs.
Therefore, this work presents a T-count optimized quantum circuit for integer
multiplication with only $4 \cdot n + 1$ qubits and no garbage outputs. The
proposed quantum multiplier design saves the T-count by using a novel quantum
conditional adder circuit. Also, where one operand to the controlled adder is
zero, the conditional adder is replaced with a Toffoli gate array to further
save the T gates. To have fair comparison with the recent design by Babu and
get an actual estimate of the T-count, it is made garbageless by using
Bennett's garbage removal scheme. The proposed design achieves an average
T-count savings of $47.55\%$ compared to the recent work by Babu. Further,
comparison is also performed with other recent works by Lin et. al. [2], and
Jayashree et. al.[3]. Average T-count savings of $62.71\%$ and $26.30\%$ are
achieved compared to the recent works by Lin et. al., and Jayashree et. al.,

control strategies for $T. cruzii$ spread in two real-world ecosystems. Our
investigation highlights two interesting results. Firstly, the ecomultiplex
topology can be as efficient as more data-demanding epidemiological measures in
identifying which species facilitate parasite spread. Secondly, the interplay
between predator-prey and host-parasite interactions leads to a phenomenon of
parasite amplification in which top predators facilitate $T. cruzii$ spread,
offering theoretical interpretation of previous empirical findings. Our

the Gaussian distributed estimator for peculiar velocities of
\cite{Watkins2015} is suitable for measuring the velocity power spectrum, but
sub-optimal for the 2MTF data compared to using magnitude fluctuations $\delta
m$, and that, whilst our fits are robust to a change in fiducial cosmology,
future peculiar velocity surveys with more constraining power may have to
marginalise over this. We obtain \textit{scale-dependent} constraints on the
growth rate of structure in two bins, finding $f\sigma_{8} =
[0.55^{+0.16}_{-0.13},0.40^{+0.16}_{-0.17}]$ in the ranges $k = [0.007-0.055,
0.55-0.150]\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also find consistent results using four
bins. Assuming scale-\textit{independence} we find a value $f\sigma_{8} =
0.51^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, a $\sim16\%$ measurement of the growth rate. Performing
a consistency check of General Relativity (GR) and combining our results with
CMB data only we find $\gamma = 0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$, a remarkable constraint
considering the small number of galaxies. All of our results are completely
independent of the effects of galaxy bias, and fully consistent with the
predictions of GR (scale-independent $f\sigma_{8}$ and $\gamma\approx0.55$).

We utilize ray-tracing dark-matter-only N-body simulations and validate our
technique by comparing our results for the convergence power spectrum with
analytic results from past studies. We then extend our analysis to non-Gaussian
observables which cannot be easily treated analytically. We study the
convergence (equilateral) bispectrum and two topological observables, lensing
peaks and Minkowski functionals, focusing on their sensitivity to the matter
density $\Omega_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. We find that a
cancelation between the geometry and growth effects is a common feature for all
observables, and exists at the map level. It weakens the overall sensitivity by
up to a factor of 3 and 1.5 for $w$ and $\Omega_m$, respectively, with the
bispectrum worst affected. However, combining geometry and growth information
alleviates the degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $w$ from either effect alone.
As a result, the magnitude of marginalized errors remain similar to those
obtained from growth-only effects, but with the correlation between the two
parameters switching sign. These results shed light on the origin of
cosmology-sensitivity of non-Gaussian statistics, and should be useful in
optimizing combinations of observables.

for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) currently is standardized by IETF which
is expected to meet the requirements of AMI networks as the standard routing

exploiting the broadcasting nature of wireless channels. Our objective in this

compatible with results from previous works showing that the scaling behaviors

holes are described by only two numbers: mass and spin. As a consequence, there
are strict relationships between the frequency and damping time of the
different modes of a perturbed Kerr black hole. Testing the no-hair theorem has
been a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection
of gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests
imminent. We investigate how constraints on black hole ringdown parameters
scale with the loudness of the ringdown signal---subject to the constraint that
the post-merger remnant must be allowed to settle into a perturbative,
Kerr-like state. In particular, we require that---for a given detector---the
gravitational waveform predicted by numerical relativity is indistinguishable
from an exponentially damped sine after time $t^\text{cut}$. By requiring the
post-merger remnant to settle into such a perturbative state, we find that
confidence intervals for ringdown parameters do not necessarily shrink with
louder signals. In at least some cases, more sensitive measurements probe later
times without necessarily providing tighter constraints on ringdown frequencies
and damping times. Preliminary investigations are unable to explain this result
in terms of a numerical relativity artifact.

that scientific memes do not spread differently from either male or female

to assist a novice user in designing real-world shapes with a simple interface.
The user edits a voxel grid with a painting interface (like Minecraft). Yet, at
any time, he/she can execute a SNAP command, which projects the current voxel
grid onto a latent shape manifold with a learned projection operator and then
generates a similar, but more realistic, shape using a learned generator
network. Then the user can edit the resulting shape and snap again until he/she
is satisfied with the result. The main advantage of this approach is that the
projection and generation operators assist novice users to create 3D models
characteristic of a background distribution of object shapes, but without
having to specify all the details. The core new research idea is to use a GAN
to support this application. 3D GANs have previously been used for shape
generation, interpolation, and completion, but never for interactive modeling.
The new challenge for this application is to learn a projection operator that
takes an arbitrary 3D voxel model and produces a latent vector on the shape
manifold from which a similar and realistic shape can be generated. We develop
algorithms for this and other steps of the SNAP processing pipeline and
integrate them into a simple modeling tool. Experiments with these algorithms
and tool suggest that GANs provide a promising approach to computer-assisted
interactive modeling.

solely two discrete spatial positions is analyzed with respect to the species'
capability to cooperate or compete for transport. In contrast to mean field
approaches, spatial correlations are explicitly conserved. A strong repulsive
interaction between particles of the same kind and a very attractive channel
imply a strong entanglement of transport of both species. This is reflected by
the magnitude of transition flows in state space which in the extreme case of
perfect coupling are restricted to a cyclic sub space. Entanglement of
transport implies that the species mutually exert entropic forces on each
other. For parallel directed concentration gradients this implies that the
species' ability to cooperate increases with the degree of entanglement. Thus,
the gradient of one species reciprocally induce a higher flow of the other
species when compared to that in its absence. The opposite holds for
antiparallel gradients where species mutually hamper their transport. For a
sufficient strong coupling, the species under the influence of the stronger
concentration gradient drives the other against its gradient, i.e. flow and
gradient of the driven species become antiparallel. Hence, besides the positive
entropy production generated by the driving species a negative component of
entropy production of the driven species emerges. The sources of both, positive
and negative entropy production, can be localized in state space. The stronger
the coupling of transport the higher is the degree of efficiency, i.e. the
amount of negative entropy production on cost of the positive one.

However, the preferential orbital occupation in ferromagnetic metallic
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin films studied by x-ray linear dichroism

distribution was found to be in-plane for the tensile strain and out-of-plane

The ubiquitous out-of-plane preferential orbital occupation seen by XLD is
attributed to the occupation of both spin-up and spin-down out-of-plane

was not possible to detect a density jump at the transition, despite using

explored for a growing variety of magnetic systems with long-range order and
well-understood spin excitation spectra. Here we show dramatic effects of spin
transport through an amorphous magnetic insulator, which is both magnetically
and structurally disordered. We generate and detect spin flow though amorphous
yttrium-iron-garnet ($a$-YIG) thin films in a non-local geometry by use of the
spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in platinum strips separated by 10 or
more microns. By comparing non-local spin transport in $a$-YIG on suspended
micromachined thermal isolation platforms to the same experiment performed on a
bulk substrate, we show strong effects of in-plane thermal gradients on spin
transport in the disordered magnetic insulator. The resulting non-local voltage
signals are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in crystalline magnetic
insulators, with easily measurable spin signals seen even at distances in
excess of $100$ microns. In analogy to heat transport, where disordered
materials support a range of vibrational excitations that can allow large
thermal conductivities, we suggest that efficient spin transport in disordered
magnetic systems can occur via a similar spectrum of excitations that relies on
strong local exchange interactions and does not require long-range order. This

variations in cluster galaxy properties between virialised and non-virialised

relatively gentle environmental effects, expressed mainly on galaxy gas
reservoirs. (1) Stacking the four subclusters in A901/2, we find galaxies in
the virialised region are more massive, redder, and have marginally higher
S\`ersic indices, but their half-light radii and Hubble types are not
significantly different. (2) After accounting for trends in stellar mass, there
is a remaining change in rest-frame colour across PPS. Primarily, the colour
difference is due to an absence in the virialised region of galaxies with
rest-frame $B-V<0.7$ and moderate-to-high ($M_\star>10^{9.85}M_\odot$) stellar
mass. (3) There is an infalling population of lower-mass
($M_\star\leq10^{9.85}M_\odot$), relatively blue ($B-V<0.7$) elliptical or
spheroidal galaxies that is strikingly absent in the virialised region. (4) The
number of bona-fide star-forming and AGN galaxies in the PPS regions is
strongly dictated by stellar mass. However, there remains a reduced fraction of
star-forming galaxies in the centres of the clusters at fixed stellar mass,
consistent with the star-formation-density relation in galaxy clusters. (5)
There is no change in specific H$\alpha$-derived star-formation rates of
star-forming galaxies at fixed mass across the cluster environment. This
suggests that preprocessing of galaxies during infall plays a prominent role in
quenching star formation.

up to several tens of GeV. The $s$-channel, $u$-channel, and $t $-channel Born

important to reproduce the behavior of the existent experimental total cross

very forward angles at high momentum. The interpolated Reggeized treatment of

negligible at low momentum, and it becomes dominant at backward angles at
momenta higher than 10 GeV. The differential cross sections are predicted with
the model fixed by the fitting existent experimental data. The results are
helpful to the possible experiments at J-PARC and COMPASS.

We compute numerically the spectral efficiency for several types of localized

the emitter and the cavity on the side-bands can yield a considerable extension
of the tuning range of the sources through phonon-assisted cavity feeding.

the large-scale flow. The impact of climate change on European wind resources
has been assessed using a single-model-ensemble of the latest regional climate
model from the Rossby Centre, RCA4. These simulations used data from five of
the global climate models in the contemporary Climate Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP5) as boundary conditions, and the results are publicly available
under the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) project.
Overall we find a consistent pattern of a decrease in the wind resources over
the European domain under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, although
there are some regions, principally North Africa and the Barents Sea, with
projected increases in wind resources. The pattern of change is both robust
across the choice of scenario, and persistent: there is a very similar pattern
of change found in the latter part of the 21st century as in the earlier. A
case study was chosen to assess the potential for offshore wind-farms in the
Black Sea region. We developed a realistic methodology for extrapolating
near-surface wind speeds up to hub-height using a time-varying roughness
length, and determined the extractable wind power at hub-height using a
realistic model of contemporary wind-turbine energy production. We demonstrate
that, unlike much of the Mediterranean basin, there is no robust pattern of a
negative climate change impact on wind resources in the studied regions of the
Black Sea. Furthermore, the seasonality of wind resources, with a strong peak
in the winter, matches well to the seasonality of energy-demand in the region,
making offshore wind-farms in the Black Sea region a viable source of energy
for neighbouring countries.

  myopic diffusion",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the system \[
  u_t=\big(d(x)u\big)_{xx} - \big(d(x)uw_x\big)_x,
  \quad
  w_t=-ug(w), \] which arises as a simple model for haptotactic migration in
heterogeneous environments, such as typically occurring in the invasive
dynamics of glioma. A particular focus is on situations when the diffusion
herein is degenerate in the sense that the zero set of $d$ is not empty.
  It is shown that if such possibly present degeneracies are sufficiently mild
in the sense that \[
  \int_\Omega \frac{1}{d}<\infty, \] then under appropriate assumptions on the
initial data a corresponding initial-boundary value problem, posed under
no-flux boundary conditions in a bounded open real interval $\Omega$, possesses
at least one globally defined generalized solution.
  Moreover, despite such degeneracies the considered myopic diffusion mechanism
is seen to asymptotically determine the solution behavior in the sense that for
some constant $\mu_\infty>0$, the obtained solution satisfies \[
  u(\cdot,t)\rightharpoonup \frac{\mu_\infty}{d}
  \ \mbox{in } L^1(\Omega)
  \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  w(\cdot,t) \to 0
  \ \mbox{in } L^\infty(\Omega)
  \quad \mbox{as } t\to\infty,
  \qquad (\star) \]
  and that hence in the degenerate case the solution component $u$ stabilizes
toward a state involving infinite densities, which is in good accordance with
experimentally observed phenomena of cell aggregation.
  Finally, under slightly stronger hypotheses inter alia requiring that
$\frac{1}{d}$ belong to $L\log L(\Omega)$, a substantial effect of diffusion is
shown to appear already immediately by proving that for a.e.~$t>0$, the
quantity $\ln (du(\cdot,t))$ is bounded in $\Omega$. In degenerate situations,
this particularly implies that the blow-up phenomena expressed in ($\star$) in
fact occur instantaneously.

is the nature and origin of the pseudogap state, which harbours anomalous
electronic states such as Fermi arc, charge density wave (CDW), and $d$-wave
superconductivity. A fundamentally important, but long-standing controversial
problem has been whether the pseudogap state is a distinct thermodynamic phase
characterized by broken symmetries below the onset temperature $T^*$.
Electronic nematicity, a fourfold ($C_4$) rotational symmetry breaking, has
emerged as a key feature inside the pseudogap regime, but the presence or
absence of a nematic phase transition and its relationship to the pseudogap
remain unresolved. Here we report thermodynamic measurements of magnetic torque
in the underdoped regime of orthorhombic YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ with a field
rotating in the CuO$_2$ plane, which allow us to quantify magnetic anisotropy
with exceptionally high precision. Upon entering the pseudogap regime, the
in-plane anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility increases after exhibiting a
distinct kink at $T^*$. Our doping dependence analysis reveals that this
anisotropy is preserved below $T^*$ even in the limit where the effect of
orthorhombicity is eliminated. In addition, the excess in-plane anisotropy data
show a remarkable scaling behaviour with respect to $T/T^*$ in a wide doping
range. These results provide thermodynamic evidence that the pseudogap onset is
associated with a second-order nematic phase transition, which is distinct from
the CDW transition that accompanies translational symmetry breaking. This
suggests that nematic fluctuations near the pseudogap phase boundary have a
potential link to the strange metallic behaviour in the normal state, out of
which high-$T_c$ superconductivity emerges.

they are in the so called quiescent, hard, or hard intermediate states. The
radio spectrum in these states is flat to slightly inverted. It is widely
accepted that the energy distribution of the electrons, in the rest frame of
the jet, is a power law with index p. A power-law energy distribution of the
electrons in the jet is sufficient to explain the flat to slightly inverted
spectrum emitted by the jet from radio to near infrared wavelengths, but is it
necessary? Contrary to what our thinking was decades ago, now we know that the
jets originate in the hot inner flow around black holes and neutron stars.
Thus, we have investigated the spectrum that is emitted by a thermal jet with
kT in the range 100-250 keV. We have computed the emitted spectrum from radio
to near infrared using either a thermal distribution of electrons or a
power-law one. We have found that parabolic jets with a thermal distribution of
electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the range 0-0.4, while jets with
a power-law distribution of electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the
range 0-0.2. The rest of the parameters are kept the same in the two cases. The
break frequency, which marks the transition from optically thick to optically
thin synchrotron emission, is comparable for the two electron energy
distributions. Our conclusion is that, contrary to common belief, it is not
necessary to invoke a power-law energy distribution of the electrons in a jet
to explain its flat to slightly inverted radio spectrum. A relativistic
Maxwellian produces similar spectra. Thus, the widely invoked corona around
black holes in X-ray binaries may actually be the jet.

that by combining the Markovian approximation with Floquet theory it is
possible to derive a stochastic Schr\""odinger equation in $\mathbb{C}^2$ for
the state of the qubit. We follow here a different approach. We use Floquet
theory to embed the time-non autonomous qubit dynamics into time-autonomous yet
infinite dimensional dynamics. We refer to the resulting infinite dimensional
system as the dressed-qubit. Using the Markovian approximation we derive the
stochastic Schr\""odinger equation for the dressed-qubit. The advantage of our
approach is that the jump operators are ladder operators of the Hamiltonian.
This simplifies the formulation of the thermodynamics. We use the
thermodynamics of the infinite dimensional system to recover the
thermodynamical description for the driven qubit. We compare our results with
the existing literature and recover the known results.

of thermally activated fluctuations of the charge in the island. The regimes of

Furusaki and K. A. Matveev, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 52}, 16676 (1995)]. In the
thermal regime the visibility of Coulomb blockade oscillations decays with the
temperature as $\sqrt{T/E_C}\exp(-\pi^2T/E_C)$, where the exponential
dependence originates from the thermal averaging over the instant charge
fluctuations, while the prefactor has a quantum origin. This dependence does
not depend on the strength of couplings to the leads. The differential
capacitance, calculated in the case of a single tunnel junction, shows the same

of $z$ $\geq$ 2.0 is placed for the remaining seven sources. Notably, our study

redshift estimates for IFRSs in the faintest 3.6 $\mu$m flux regime i.e.,

declarative modeling tool, that allows describing the parts that compose the
system and their relations of supplier/consumer of specific interfaces. The
tool arranges the steps to bring the deployment to convergence by transforming
the state of the system until it reaches a configuration that satisfies all
constraints. We chose a declarative service modeling approach for orchestrating
both the deployment of the platform by the administrators and the deployment of
applications by users. The cloud platform has been designed so that it can be
managed by this kind of automation, facilitating the deployment of federated
regions by anyone wishing to join and to contribute resources to the
federation. Federated resources are integrated into a single cloud platform
available to any user of the federation. The federation can also seamlessly
include public clouds. We describe the architectural choices, how we adapted
the OpenStack basic facilities to the needs of a federation of multiple
independent organizations, how we control resource allocation according to
committed plans and correspondingly how we handle accounting and billing of
resource usage. Besides providing traditional IaaS services, the cloud supports
self-service deployment of cloud applications. The cloud thus addresses the

resolution and noisy representation. Existing object detection pipelines
usually detect small objects through learning representations of all the
objects at multiple scales. However, the performance gain of such ad hoc
architectures is usually limited to pay off the computational cost. In this
work, we address the small object detection problem by developing a single
architecture that internally lifts representations of small objects to
""super-resolved"" ones, achieving similar characteristics as large objects and
thus more discriminative for detection. For this purpose, we propose a new
Perceptual Generative Adversarial Network (Perceptual GAN) model that improves
small object detection through narrowing representation difference of small
objects from the large ones. Specifically, its generator learns to transfer
perceived poor representations of the small objects to super-resolved ones that
are similar enough to real large objects to fool a competing discriminator.
Meanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the
generated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement -
generated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection
purpose - on the generator. Extensive evaluations on the challenging
Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Caltech benchmark well demonstrate the
superiority of Perceptual GAN in detecting small objects, including traffic
signs and pedestrians, over well-established state-of-the-arts.

While the sparsity order can be directly inferred from the effective rank of

impossible in the more challenging single snapshot case. We show that specially
designed measurement matrices allow to rearrange the measurement vector into a
matrix such that its effective rank coincides with the effective sparsity
order. In fact, we prove that matrices which are composed of a Khatri-Rao
product of smaller matrices generate measurements that allow to infer the
sparsity order. Moreover, if some samples are used more than once, one of the
matrices needs to be Vandermonde. These structural constraints reduce the
degrees of freedom in choosing the measurement matrix which may incur in a
degradation in the achievable coherence. We thus also address suitable choices
of the measurement matrices. In particular, we analyze Khatri-Rao and
Vandermonde matrices in terms of their coherence and provide a new design for
Vandermonde matrices that achieves a low coherence.

patients can enhance effectiveness of emergency ambulance care during transport
from rural areas to a regional center hospital. However, the communication
along the various routes in rural areas may have wide bandwidth ranges from 2G
to 4G; some regions may have only lower satellite bandwidth available.
Bandwidth fluctuation together with real-time communication of various clinical
multimedia pose a major challenge during rural patient ambulance transport.;
AB@The availability of a pre-transport route-dependent communication bandwidth
database is an important resource in remote monitoring and clinical multimedia
transmission in rural ambulance transport. Here, we present a geo-communication
dataset from extensive profiling of 4 major US mobile carriers in Illinois,
from the rural location of Hoopeston to the central referral hospital center at
Urbana. In collaboration with Carle Foundation Hospital, we developed a
profiler, and collected various geographical and communication traces for
realistic emergency rural ambulance transport scenarios. Our dataset is to
support our ongoing work of proposing ""physiology-aware DASH"", which is
particularly useful for adaptive remote monitoring of critically ill patients
in emergency rural ambulance transport. It provides insights on ensuring higher
Quality of Service (QoS) for most critical clinical multimedia in response to
changes in patients' physiological states and bandwidth conditions. Our dataset
is available online for research community.

dark fibrils visible within them, and in the quiescent umbra by using the
inversion code NICOLE on a set of full Stokes high-resolution Ca II 8542 A
observations of a sunspot at disk center. We find that the dark structures have
Stokes profiles that are distinct from those of the quiescent and flashed
regions. They are best reproduced by atmospheres that are more similar to the
flashed atmosphere in terms of velocities, even if with reduced amplitudes. We
also find two sets of solutions that finely fit the flashed profiles: a set
that is upflowing, featuring a transition region that is deeper than in the
quiescent case and preceded by a slight dip in temperature, and a second
solution with a hotter atmosphere in the chromosphere but featuring downflows
close to the speed of sound at such heights. Such downflows may be related, or
even dependent, on the presence of coronal loops, rooted in the umbra of
sunspots, as is the case in the region analyzed. Similar loops have been
recently observed to have supersonic downflows in the transition region and are
consistent with the earlier ""sunspot plumes"" which were invariably found to
display strong downflows in sunspots. Finally we find, on average, a magnetic
field reduction in the flashed areas, suggesting that the shock pressure is
moving field lines in the upper layers.

add to the inventory of known solution branches. The exact solutions are found
by projecting known equilibria onto the resolvent modes of McKeon & Sharma (J.
Fl. Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336-382) to generate approximate solutions that
are subsequently used as seeds in a Newton-Krylov-hookstep search. Searches
initialised with these projections have a convergence rate of 96%, leading to
the discovery of 16 new equilibria. The low-dimensional nature of the resulting
equilibria is attributed to the projection generated by the resolvent model;
resolvent modes for a given equilibrium solution span a low-dimensional space
which the solution approximately inhabits. This property is exploited to
generate new branches of equilibria in plane Couette flow, and to jump to known
branches. The new branches include bifurcations from previously known
bifurcation curves and a disconnected bifurcation curve which displays
interesting behaviour when continued in Reynolds number. The unstable manifolds
of the new exact coherent states are also computed to expand the known state
space structure of plane Couette flow.

CEMP-no stars are long-lived low-mass stars with a very low iron
content, overabundances of carbon and no or minor signs for the presence of s-
or r-elements. Although their origin is still a matter of debate, they are
often considered as being made of a material ejected by a previous stellar
generation (source stars). Aims. We place constraints on the source stars from
the observed abundance data of CEMP-no stars. Methods. We computed source star
models of 20, 32, and 60 M$_{\odot}$ at Z = 10$^{-5}$ with and without fast
rotation. For each model we also computed a case with a late mixing event
occurring between the hydrogen and helium-burning shell $\sim$ 200 yr before
the end of the evolution. This creates a partially CNO-processed zone in the
source star. We use the 12C/13C and C/N ratios observed on CEMP-no stars to put
constraints on the possible source stars (mass, late mixing or not). Then, we
inspect more closely the abundance data of six CEMP-no stars and select their
preferred source star(s). Results. Four out of the six CEMP-no stars studied
cannot be explained without the late mixing process in the source star. Two of
them show nucleosynthetic signatures of a progressive mixing (due e.g. to
rotation) in the source star. We also show that a 20 M$_{\odot}$ source star is
preferred compared to one of 60 M$_{\odot}$ and that likely only the outer
layers of the source stars were expelled to reproduce the observed 12C/13C.
Conclusions. The results suggest that (1) a late mixing process could operate
in some source stars, (2) a progressive mixing, possibly achieved by fast
rotation, is at work in several source stars, (3) $\sim$ 20 M$_{\odot}$ source
stars are preferred compared to $\sim$ 60 M$_{\odot}$ ones, and (4) the source
star might have preferentially experienced a low energetic supernova with large
fallback.

DAS has
advantages in capacity especially for the cell edge users, in both single-cell
and multi-cell environments. In this paper, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) is suggested in single-cell DAS to maximize user fairness and sumrate.
Two transmission strategies are considered: NOMA with single selection
transmission and NOMA with blanket transmission. In a two-user scenario, the
center base station (BS) uses NOMA to serve both users and the remote radio
units (RRUs) serve only the weak user based on the transmission scheme. The
signals sent from the RRUs are not considered as interference at both user
sides. At one side, the signals from the RRUs are used to detect the required
data and at the other side, the signals are used to perform successive
interference cancellation (SIC). The max-min performance is studied when
instantaneous channel gain information (CGI) or channel distribution
information (CDI) is known at the transmitter. A closed-form expression of the
upper bound is derived for the data rate of each user with only CDI. In
addition, the sum-rate is studied with a minimum rate constraint when
instantaneous CGI known at the transmitter. The results show that NOMA with
blanket transmission gives the best performance compared to other schemes;
conventional-NOMA, conventional single selection scheme and joint-transmission
(JT) NOMA. It is also shown that with less transmit power, NOMA with single
selection transmission gives better performance than conventional-NOMA.

a new dynamical theory based on the Polydisperse Lattice-Gas model. The model
gives a simplified description of polydisperse colloids, incorporating a
hard-core repulsion combined with polydispersity in the strength of the
attraction between neighbouring particles. Our mean-field equations describe
the local concentration evolution for each of an arbitrary number of species,
and for an arbitrary overall composition of the system. We focus on the
predictions for the dynamics of colloidal gas-liquid phase separation after a
quench into the coexistence region. The critical point and the relevant
spinodal curves are determined analytically, with the latter depending only on
three moments of the overall composition. The results for the early-time
spinodal dynamics show qualitative changes as one crosses a 'quenched' spinodal
that excludes fractionation and so allows only density fluctuations at fixed
composition. This effect occurs for dense systems, in agreement with a
conjecture by Warren that, at high density, fractionation should be generically
slow because it requires inter-diffusion of particles. We verify this
conclusion by showing that the observed qualitative changes disappear when
direct particle-particle swaps are allowed in the dynamics. Finally, the rich
behaviour beyond the spinodal regime is examined, where we find that the
evaporation of gas bubbles with strongly fractionated interfaces causes
long-lived composition heterogeneities in the liquid phase; we introduce a
two-dimensional density histogram method that allows such effects to be easily
visualized for an arbitrary number of particle species.

differ in the knowledge of how the price fluctuates. In the first model, there
are global minimum and maximum bounds $m$ and $M$. We first show an optimal
lower bound of $\varphi$ (where $\varphi=M/m$) on the competitive ratio for one
trade, which is the bound achieved by trivial algorithms. Perhaps surprisingly,
when we consider more than one trade, we can give a better algorithm that loses
only a factor of $\varphi^{2/3}$ (rather than $\varphi$) per additional trade.
Specifically, for $k$ trades the algorithm has competitive ratio
$\varphi^{(2k+1)/3}$. Furthermore we show that this ratio is the best possible

in their interior due to non-trivial topological order. The edge states on the
interface between topological (non-trivial) and conventional (trivial)
insulators are topologically protected from scattering due to structural
defects and disorders. Recently, it was shown that photonic crystals can serve
as a platform for realizing a scatter-free propagation of light waves. In
conventional photonic crystals, imperfections, structural disorders, and
surface roughness lead to significant losses. The breakthrough in overcoming
these problems is likely to come from the synergy of the topological photonic
crystals and silicon-based photonics technology that enables high integration
density, lossless propagation, and immunity to fabrication imperfections. For
many applications, reconfigurability and capability to control the propagation
of these non-trivial photonic edge states is essential. One way to facilitate
such dynamic control is to use liquid crystals, which allow to modify the
refractive index with external electric field. Here, we demonstrate dynamic
control of topological edge states by modifying the refractive index of a
liquid crystal background medium. Background index is changed depending on the
orientation of a liquid crystal, while preserving the topological order of the
system. This results in a change of the spectral position of the photonic
bandgap and the topologically protected edge states. The proposed concept might
be implemented using conventional semiconductor technology, and can be used for
robust energy transport in integrated photonic devices, all-optical circuity,

The width of the Gaussian along the directions orthogonal to the beam axis
varies with the centrality of the collision. The dependence of the magnetic
field on proper time ($\tau$) for the case of zero electrical conductivity of
the QGP is parametrized following [Deng 2012], and for finite electrical
conductivity following [Tuchin 2013]. We solve the equations of motion of ideal

localization and inhomogeneous broadening we use selective excitation with
spectrally narrow ps-pulses. We demonstrate that the transient profile of the
photon echo from the localized trion (X$^-$) and the donor-bound exciton
(D$^0$X) transitions strongly depends on the strength of the first pulse. It
acquires a non-Gaussian shape and experiences significant advancement for pulse
areas larger than $\pi$ due to non-negligible inhomogeneity-induced dephasing
of the oscillators during the optical excitation. Next, we observe that an
increase of the area of either the first (excitation) or the second (rephasing)
pulse leads to a significant damping of the photon echo signal, which is
strongest for the neutral excitons and less pronounced for the donor-bound
exciton complex (D$^0$X). The measurements are analyzed using a theoretical
model based on the optical Bloch equations which accounts for the inhomogeneity
of optical transitions in order to reproduce the complex shape of the photon
echo transients. In addition, the spreading of Rabi frequencies within the
ensemble due to the spatial variation of the intensity of the focused Gaussian
beams and excitation-induced dephasing are required to explain the fading and
damping of Rabi oscillations. By analyzing the results of the simulation for
the X$^-$ and the D$^0$X complexes we are able to establish a correlation

$1/N$ expansion dominated by melonic graphs. This result relies crucially on
identifying \emph{jackets} which are globally defined ribbon graphs embedded in
the tensor graph. In contrast, no result of this kind has so far been
established for symmetric tensors because global jackets do not exist.
  In this paper we introduce a new approach to the $1/N$ expansion in tensor
models adapted to symmetric tensors. In particular we do not use any global
structure like the jackets. We prove that, for any rank $D$, a tensor model
with two symmetric tensors and interactions the complete graph $K_{D+1}$ admits
a $1/N$ expansion dominated by melonic graphs.

stochastic and deterministic policy gradient theorems are special cases. We
also prove that EPG reduces the variance of the gradient estimates without
requiring deterministic policies and, for the Gaussian case, with no
computational overhead. Finally, we show that it is optimal in a certain sense
to explore with a Gaussian policy such that the covariance is proportional to
the exponential of the scaled Hessian of the critic with respect to the

exploration substantially outperforms DPG with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck heuristic
in four challenging MuJoCo domains.

the pseudo ground states. We have shown that the energy required to create a
domain of linear size L in d dimensions is proportional to $L^{d-1}$. Using
Imry-Ma arguments given for random field Ising model, one gets critical
dimension $d_{c}\geq 2$ for Coulomb glass. The investigations of domains in the
transition region shows a discontinuity in staggered magnetization which is an
indication of a first-order type transition from charge-ordered phase to
disordered phase. The structure and nature of Random field fluctuations of the
second largest domain in Coulomb glass are inconsistent with the assumptions of
Imry and Ma as was also reported for random field Ising model. The study of
domains showed that in the transition region there were mostly two large
domains and as disorder was increased, the two large domains remained but there
were a large number of small domains. We have also studied the properties of
the second largest domain as a function of disorder. We furthermore analysed
the effect of disorder on the density of states and showed a transition from
hard gap at low disorders to a soft gap at higher disorders. At $W=2$, we have
analysed the soft gap in detail and found that the density of states deviates
slightly ($\delta\approx 1.293 \pm 0.027$) from the linear behaviour in two

of Persons (ESCAPE), an open source software for the extraction of Amazon Echo
interaction data, and speaker recognition on that data. We show that ESCAPE is
able to extract data from a voice-controlled assistant and classify with
accuracy who is talking, based on a small number of labeled audio data. Using
ESCAPE to extract interactions recorded over 3 months in the first author's
home yields a rich dataset of transcribed audio recordings. Our results
demonstrate that using this software the Amazon Echo can be used to study
participants in a naturalistic setting with minimal intrusion. We also discuss
the potential for usage of voice-controlled devices together with ESCAPE to
understand how diseases affect individuals, and how these data can be used to
monitor disease processes in general.

measurements of the internal quality factors of superconducting microwave
resonators with and without contacts, we place an upper bound on the residual
resistance of an ion beam milled contact of 50$\,\mathrm{m}\Omega \cdot \mu
\mathrm{m}^2$ at a frequency of 4.5 GHz. Resonators for which only $6\%$ of the
total foot-print was exposed to the ion beam milling, in areas of low electric

these results will enable the development of increasingly complex

framework for cellular communication. Classifying cellular lattices by
'macrostate' variables - 'spatial order paramete' and average gene-expression
level - reveals a conceptual picture: cellular lattices act as particles
rolling down on 'pseudo-energy landscapes' shaped by a 'Hamiltonian' for
cellular communication. Particles rolling down represent cells' spatial order
increasing. Particles trapped on the landscapes represent metastable spatial
configurations. The gradient of the Hamiltonian and a 'trapping probability'
determine the particle's equation of motion. This framework is extendable to
more complex forms of cellular communication.

is shown that every DC-DC converter must trade-off size, heat and conducted
electromagnetic noise. It is therefore fundamentally impossible to
simultaneously reduce all three of these characteristics to their respective
theoretical minimum values. A figure of merit is introduced which holistically
captures the performance of an arbitrary DC-DC converter, this is called the
converter's non-ideality and it has a target value of zero. It is derived using
the first law of thermodynamics and is shown to be dependent on the efficiency
and the root-mean-squared total harmonic distortion of the output voltage.
Interestingly, it is also shown that: boost conversion is impossible without
energy storage; ideal rectifiers convert all of the input power spectral
density into DC (and introduces more noise in the process); the input current
of any DC-DC converter scales with the gain of the device squared. Using an
arbitrary DC-DC converter, the culprit of this inherent trade-off is shown to
be the act of switching itself. Switching creates harmonics which need to be
filtered or transformed into heat in order to get a pure DC voltage at the
output of the converter. Even with ideal sub-systems, whether or not resonant
conversion is employed, the result stands. The conclusion is that spreading of
the switching noise is a primary goal in attempting to reach the impossible.

learning architectures that have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various benchmarks. Significant effort has been devoted to developing custom
silicon devices to accelerate inference in ANNs. Accelerating the training
phase, however, has attracted relatively little attention. In this paper, we
describe a hardware-efficient on-line learning technique for feedforward
multi-layer ANNs that is based on pipelined backpropagation. Learning is
performed in parallel with inference in the forward pass, removing the need for
an explicit backward pass and requiring no extra weight lookup. By using binary
state variables in the feedforward network and ternary errors in
truncated-error backpropagation, the need for any multiplications in the
forward and backward passes is removed, and memory requirements for the
pipelining are drastically reduced. Further reduction in addition operations
owing to the sparsity in the forward neural and backpropagating error signal
paths contributes to highly efficient hardware implementation. For
proof-of-concept validation, we demonstrate on-line learning of MNIST
handwritten digit classification on a Spartan 6 FPGA interfacing with an
external 1Gb DDR2 DRAM, that shows small degradation in test error performance
compared to an equivalently sized binary ANN trained off-line using standard
back-propagation and exact errors. Our results highlight an attractive synergy
between pipelined backpropagation and binary-state networks in substantially
reducing computation and memory requirements, making pipelined on-line learning
practical in deep networks.

which is explicited in this article and preferably implemented through a
reweighted FISTA algorithm. The combined reconstruction approach is then
further improved by including physical constraints specific to the polarimetric
imaging context considered, which are implemented in an original constrained
GFB algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the 2-pixel
CS polarimetric imaging setup to retrieve polarimetric contrast data with
significant compression rate and good reconstruction quality. The influence of
experimental imperfections of the DMD are also analyzed through numerical
simulations, and 2D polarimetric imaging reconstruction results are finally
