combustion is reviewed. In this framework, a frozen electric field modeling
approach is applied to take advantage of the quasiperiodic behaviors of the
electrical characteristics to avoid the recalculation of electric field for
each pulse. The correlated dynamic adaptive chemistry (CoDAC) method is
employed to accelerate the calculation of large and stiff chemical mechanisms.
The timestep is updated dynamically during the simulation through a three-stage
multitimescale modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the large separation
of timescales in nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges. A general theory of
plasma assisted ignition and combustion is then proposed. Nanosecond pulsed
plasma discharges for ignition and combustion can be divided into four stages.
Stage I is the discharge pulse, with timescales of O(1 to 10 ns). In this
stage, most input energy is coupled into electron impact excitation and
dissociation reactions to generate charged or excited species and radicals.
Stage II is the afterglow during the gap between two adjacent pulses, with
timescales of O(100 ns). In this stage, quenching of excited species not only
further dissociates O2 and fuel molecules, but also provides fast gas heating.
Stage III is the remaining gap between pulses, with timescales of O(1 to 100
microsec). The radicals generated during Stages I and II significantly enhance
the exothermic reactions in this stage. Stage IV is the accumulative effects of
multiple pulses, with timescales of O(1 ms to 1 sec), which include preheated
gas temperatures and a large pool of radicals and fuel fragments to trigger
ignition. For plasma assisted flames, plasma significantly enhances the radical
generation and gas heating in the preheat zone, which could trigger upstream
autoignition.

labeling data: an unlabeled dataset (target) is annotated using a labeled
dataset (source) from a related domain. We cast domain adaptation as the
problem of finding stable labels for target examples. A new definition of label
stability is proposed, motivated by a generalization error bound for large
margin linear classifiers: a target labeling is stable when, with high
probability, a classifier trained on a random subsample of the target with that
labeling yields the same labeling. We find stable labelings using a random walk
on a directed graph with transition probabilities based on labeling stability.
The majority vote of those labelings visited by the walk yields a stable label
for each target example. The resulting domain adaptation algorithm is
strikingly easy to implement and apply: It does not rely on data
transformations, which are in general computational prohibitive in the presence
of many input features, and does not need to access the source data, which is
advantageous when data sharing is restricted. By acting on the original feature
space, our method is able to take full advantage of deep features from external
pre-trained neural networks, as demonstrated by the results of our experiments.

to fields ranging from materials science to biology. Here, we describe a novel
type of mechanical adaptation in cross-linked networks of F-actin, a
ubuiquitous protein found in eukaryotic cells. We show that shear stress
changes its nonlinear mechanical response even long after that stress is
removed. The duration, magnitude and direction of forcing history all impact
changes in mechanical response. The `memory' of the forcing history is
long-lived, but can be erased by force application in the opposite direction.
We further show that the observed mechanical adaptation is consistent with
stress-dependent changes in the nematic order of the constituent filaments.
Thus, this mechano-memory is a type of nonlinear hysteretic response in which
an applied, ""training"" strain modifies the nonlinear elasticity. This
demonstrates that F-actin networks can encode analog read-write
mechano-memories, which can be used for adaptation to mechanical stimuli.

bookkeeping of auxiliary bond-index shifts arising from the application of
operators changing the local quantum numbers and (ii) the appearance of phase
factors due to particular commutation rules. The automatization is achieved by
post-processing the operator strings generated by the FSM. Consequently, MPO
representations of various types of $U(1)$-invariant operators can be
constructed generically in MPS algorithms reducing the necessity of expensive
MPO arithmetics. This is demonstrated by generating arbitrary products of
operators in terms of FSM, from which we obtain exact MPO representations for

nearly-degenerate slepton. It is notoriously difficult to probe this scenario
at the Large Hadron Collider, because the slepton pair-production process
yields a final state with soft leptons and small missing transverse energy. We
study this scenario in the region of parameter space where the mass difference
between the lightest neutralino and the lightest slepton ($\Delta m$) is
$\lesssim 60~{\rm GeV}$, focusing on the process in which an additional
radiated jet provides a transverse boost to the slepton pair. We then utilize
the angular separation of the leptons from each other and from the missing
transverse energy, as well as the angular separation between the jet and the
missing transverse energy, to distinguish signal from background events. We
also use the reconstructed ditau mass, the $\cos \theta^*_{\ell^+ \ell^-}$
variable, and for larger $\Delta m$, a lower bound on the lepton $p_T$. These
cuts can dramatically improve both signal sensitivity and the
signal-to-background ratio, permitting discovery at the Large Hadron Collider

and causes this clustering. The Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) is a

really think about politics? Opinion and trend mining on micro blogs dealing
with politics has recently attracted researchers in several fields including
Information Retrieval and Machine Learning (ML). Since the performance of ML
and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are limited by the amount and
quality of data available, one promising alternative for some tasks is the
automatic propagation of expert annotations. This paper intends to develop a
so-called active learning process for automatically annotating French language
tweets that deal with the image (i.e., representation, web reputation) of
politicians. Our main focus is on the methodology followed to build an original
annotated dataset expressing opinion from two French politicians over time. We
therefore review state of the art NLP-based ML algorithms to automatically
annotate tweets using a manual initiation step as bootstrap. This paper focuses
on key issues about active learning while building a large annotated data set
from noise. This will be introduced by human annotators, abundance of data and
the label distribution across data and entities. In turn, we show that Twitter
characteristics such as the author's name or hashtags can be considered as the
bearing point to not only improve automatic systems for Opinion Mining (OM) and
Topic Classification but also to reduce noise in human annotations. However, a
later thorough analysis shows that reducing noise might induce the loss of
crucial information.

neural networks. These neural networks use L2 regularization, also called
weight decay, ostensibly to prevent overfitting. However, we show that L2
regularization has no regularizing effect when combined with normalization.
Instead, regularization has an influence on the scale of weights, and thereby
on the effective learning rate. We investigate this dependence, both in theory,

partially eliminate the influence of normalization on the learning rate. This
leads to a discussion on other ways to mitigate this issue.

of dust, stars, gas, and star-formation rate (SFR) in a sub-sample of 18
face-on spiral galaxies extracted from the DustPedia sample. This study is
performed by exploiting the multi-wavelength, from UV to sub-mm bands,
DustPedia database, in addition to molecular (12CO) and atomic (HI) gas maps
and metallicity abundance information available in the literature. We fitted
the surface brightness profiles of the tracers of dust and stars, the mass
surface density profiles of dust, stars, molecular gas, and total gas, and the
SFR surface density profiles with an exponential curve and derived their
scale-lengths. We also developed a method to solve for the CO-to-H2 conversion
factor (alpha_CO) per galaxy by using dust and gas mass profiles. Although each
galaxy has its own peculiar behaviour, we identified a common trend of the
exponential scale-lengths vs. wavelength. On average, the scale-lengths
normalized to the B-band 25 mag/arcsec^2 radius decrease from UV to 70 micron,
from 0.4 to 0.2, and then increase back up to 0.3 at 500 microns. The main
result is that, on average, the dust mass surface density scale-length is about
1.8 times the stellar one derived from IRAC data and the 3.6 micron surface
brightness, and close to that in the UV. We found a mild dependence of the
scale-lengths on the Hubble stage T: the scale-lengths of the Herschel bands
and the 3.6 micron scale-length tend to increase from earlier to later types,
the scale-length at 70 micron tends to be smaller than that at longer sub-mm
wavelength with ratios between longer sub-mm wavelengths and 70 micron that
decrease with increasing T. The scale-length ratio of SFR and stars shows a
weak increasing trend towards later types.

solar system. Such rovers will return images, autonomously navigate from
interest point to interest point, and autonomously deploy instruments. Analyses
include elemental APX and gamma ray spectroscopy for elemental and Raman and IR
spectroscopy for molecular and or mineralogical compositions. They can be built

binaries assuming that the spectrum of the X-ray hot flow can be produced by
two Comptonisation zones. Slow fluctuations generated at the largest
radii/softest spectral region of the flow propagate down to modulate the faster
fluctuations produced in the spectrally harder region close to the black hole.
The observed spectrum and variability are produced by summing over all regions
in the flow, including its emission reflected from the truncated disc. This
produces energy-dependent Fourier lags qualitatively similar to those in the
data. Given a viscous frequency prescription, the model predicts Fourier power
spectral densities and lags for any energy bands. We apply this model to
archival RXTE data from Cyg X-1, using the time-averaged energy spectrum
together with an assumed emissivity to set the radial bounds of the soft and
hard Comptonisation regions. We find that the power spectra cannot be described
by any smooth model of generating fluctuations, instead requiring that there
are specific radii in the flow where noise is preferentially produced. We also
find fluctuation damping between spectrally distinct regions is required to
prevent all the variability power generated at large radii being propagated
into the inner regions. Even with these additions, we can fit either the power
spectra at each energy, or the lags between energy bands, but not both. We
conclude that either the spectra are more complex than two zone models, or that
other processes are important in forming the variability.

or Dember potential effects, both of which result in the development of EMF
across the layer thickness, not between different contacts on the surface.
These layers are also found to show negative photoconductivity effect.
Interplay between surface photo-EMF and negative photoconductivity result in a
unique scenario, where the magnitude as well as the sign of the photo-induced
change in conductivity become bias dependent. A theoretical model is developed,
where both the effects are attributed to the 2D electron gas (2DEG) channel
formed just below the film surface as a result of the transfer of electrons
from certain donor-like-surfacestates, which are likely to be resulting due to
the adsorption of certain groups/adatoms on the film surface. In the model, the

manipulating quantum information. A major challenge to further scalability is
to find approaches for connecting these systems over long distances and at high
rates. One approach is to convert the quantum state of a microwave circuit to
optical photons that can be transmitted over kilometers at room temperature
with little loss. Many proposals for electro-optic conversion between microwave
and optics use optical driving of a weak three-wave mixing nonlinearity to
convert the frequency of an excitation. Residual absorption of this optical
pump leads to heating, which is problematic at cryogenic temperatures. Here we
propose an alternative approach where a nonlinear superconducting circuit is
driven to interconvert between microwave-frequency and
millimeter-wave-frequency (300 GHz) photons. To understand the potential for
quantum conversion between microwave and mm-wave photons, we consider the
driven four-wave mixing quantum dynamics of nonlinear circuits. In contrast to
the linear dynamics of the driven three-wave mixing converters, the proposed
four-wave mixing converter has nonlinear decoherence channels that lead to a
more complex parameter space of couplings and pump powers that we map out. We
consider physical realizations of such converter circuits by deriving
theoretically the upper bound on the maximum obtainable nonlinear coupling
between any two modes in a lossless circuit, and synthesizing an optimal
circuit based on realistic materials that saturates this bound. Our proposed
circuit dissipates less than $10^{-9}$ times the energy of current
electro-optic converters per qubit. Finally, we outline the quantum link budget
for optical, microwave, and mm-wave connections, showing that our approach is
viable for realizing interconnected quantum processors for intracity or quantum
datacenter environments.

This means that $Z(z_3^2)$ factor was canceled in the ratio. When plotted as a

We consider a number of different parameter sets, previously proposed to
describe the magnetic behavior of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$IrO$_3$ with
their antiferromagnetic zigzag ground states. By classifying these parameter
sets, we reveal the existence of three distinct mechanisms to stabilize zigzag
states, which differ in the sign of the nearest-neighbor Kitaev interaction,
the role of longer-range interactions, and the magnitude of the off-diagonal
$\Gamma_1$ interaction. While experimentally hardly distinguishable at zero
field, we find that the three different scenarios lead to significantly
different magnetization processes in applied magnetic fields. In particular, we
show that a sizable off-diagonal interaction $\Gamma_1 > 0$ naturally explains
the strongly anisotropic field responses observed in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ without
the need for a strong anisotropy in the effective $g$ tensor. Moreover, for a
generic field direction, it leads to a high-field state with a finite
transversal magnetization, which should be observable in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

provide useful analytic approximations for various quantities of interest in

motion in quasiperiodic potentials, with hopping amplitudes that fall off as a
power law with exponent $p$. These models are generalizations of the familiar
Aubry-Andre model. For large enough $p$, their static properties are similar to
those of the Aubry-Andre model, although the low-frequency conductivity in the
localized phase is sensitive to $p$. For $p \leq 2.1$ the Aubry-Andre
localization transition splits into three transitions; two distinct
intermediate regimes with both localized and delocalized states appear near the
self-dual point of the Aubry-Andre model. In the intermediate regimes, the
density of states is singular continuous in much of the spectrum, and is
approximately self-similar: states form narrow energy bands, which are divided
into yet narrower sub-bands; we find no clear sign of a mobility edge. When $p
< 1$, localized states are not stable in random potentials; in the present
model, however, tightly localized states are present for relatively large
systems. We discuss the frequency-dependence and strong sample-to-sample
fluctuations of the low-frequency optical conductivity, although a suitably
generalized version of Mott's law is recovered when the power-law is slowly
decaying. We present evidence that many of these features persist in models
that are away from self-duality.

$M_{Wolf}/M_{true} = 0.98^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$ and $M_{Walker}/M_{true}
=1.07^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, with errors reflecting the 68% range over all
simulations. The excellent performance of these estimators is remarkable given
that they each assume spherical symmetry, a supposition that is broken in our
simulated galaxies. Though our dwarfs have negligible rotation support, their
3D stellar distributions are flattened, with short-to-long axis ratios $ c/a
\simeq 0.4-0.7$. The accuracy of the estimators shows no trend with
asphericity. Our simulated galaxies have sphericalized stellar profiles in 3D
that follow a nearly universal form, one that transitions from a core at small
radius to a steep fall-off $\propto r^{-4.2}$ at large $r$, they are well fit
by S\'ersic profiles in projection. We find that the most important empirical
quantity affecting mass estimator accuracy is $Re$ . Determining $Re$ by an
analytic fit to the surface density profile produces a better estimated mass
than if the half-light radius is determined via direct summation.

the mapping of an accurate Born-Oppenheimer (BO) energy surface within the
region of interest. Here we present an improved method which reduces the
computational cost of the mapping. In this approach we use data from a set of
energy calculations for different vibrational distortions of the materials and
the corresponding forces on the atoms. Results using both energies and forces
are presented for the test cases of the hydrogen molecule, solid hydrogen under
high pressure including mapping of two-dimensional subspaces of the BO surface,
and the bcc phases of the metals Li and Zr. The use of forces data speeds up
the anharmonic calculations by up to 40%.

spectral type A and B. They are believed to result from mergers in double
degenerate systems. In this paper we present a detailed quantitative non-LTE
spectral analysis for BD+10$^\circ$2179, a prototype of this rare class of
stars, using UVES and FEROS spectra covering the range from $\sim$3100 to 10
000 {\AA}. Atmosphere model computations were improved in two ways. First,
since the UV metal line blanketing has a strong impact on the
temperature-density stratification, we used the Atlas12 code. Additionally, We
tested Atlas12 against the benchmark code Sterne3, and found only small
differences in the temperature and density stratifications, and good agreement
with the spectral energy distributions. Second, 12 chemical species were
treated in non-LTE. Pronounced non-LTE effects occur in individual spectral
lines but, for the majority, the effects are moderate to small. The
spectroscopic parameters give $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 17 300$\pm$300 K and $\log g$
= 2.80$\pm$0.10, and an evolutionary mass of 0.55$\pm$0.05 $M_\odot$. The star
is thus slightly hotter, more compact and less massive than found in previous
studies. The kinematic properties imply a thick-disk membership, which is
consistent with the metallicity $[$Fe/H$]\approx-1$ and $\alpha$-enhancement.
The refined light-element abundances are consistent with the white dwarf merger
scenario. We further discuss the observed helium spectrum in an appendix,
detecting dipole-allowed transitions from about 150 multiplets plus the most
comprehensive set of known/predicted isolated forbidden components to date.
Moreover, a so far unreported series of pronounced forbidden He I components is
detected in the optical-UV.

or 3 dimensions. The existence of such vacua depends on the value of neutrino
masses through the Casimir effect. Using the Weak Gravity Conjecture, it has
been recently argued by Ooguri and Vafa that such vacua are incompatible with
the SM embedding into a consistent theory of quantum gravity. We study the
limits obtained for both the cosmological constant $\Lambda_4$ and neutrino
masses from the absence of such dangerous 3D and 2D SM AdS vacua. One
interesting implication is that $\Lambda_4$ is bounded to be larger than a
scale of order $m_\nu^4$, as observed experimentally. Interestingly, this is
the first argument implying a non-vanishing $\Lambda_4$ only on the basis of
particle physics, with no cosmological input. Conversely, the observed
$\Lambda_4$ implies strong constraints on neutrino masses in the SM and also
for some BSM extensions including extra Weyl or Dirac spinors, gravitinos and
axions. The upper bounds obtained for neutrino masses imply (for fixed neutrino
Yukawa and $\Lambda_4$) the existence of upper bounds on the EW scale. In the
case of massive Majorana neutrinos with a see-saw mechanism associated to a
large scale $M\simeq 10^{10-14}$ GeV and $Y_{\nu_1}\simeq 10^{-3}$, one obtains
that the EW scale cannot exceed $M_{EW}\lesssim 10^2-10^4$ GeV. From this point
of view, the delicate fine-tuning required to get a small EW scale would be a
mirage, since parameters yielding higher EW scales would be in the swampland
and would not count as possible consistent theories. This would bring a new
perspective into the issue of the EW hierarchy.

an oblate Saturn and the five largest moons close to the region: Janus,
Epimetheus, Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. By using frequency analysis we
determined the stability of the small moons and characterize, through diffusion
maps, the dynamical behavior of a wide region of geometric phase space, $a$ vs
$e$, surrounding them. Those maps could shed light on the possible initial
number of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the
dynamical origin of the small satellites. We found that the four small moons
are long-term stable and no mark of chaos is found for them. Aegaeon, Methone,
and Anthe could remain unaltered for at least $\sim0.5$Myr, given the current
configuration of the system. They remain well-trapped in the corotation
eccentricity resonances with Mimas in which they currently librate. However,
perturbations from nearby resonances, such as Lindblad eccentricity resonances
with Mimas, seem responsible for largest variations observed for Methone and
Anthe. Pallene remains in a non-resonant orbit and it is the more stable, at
least for 64 Myr. Nonetheless, it is affected by a quasi-resonance with Mimas,
which induces long-term orbital oscillations of its eccentricity and

the hierarchical techniques from the renormalization group approach,
H/H2-matrix algebra and fast multipole method, the computational scaling
reduction in our formalism is achieved via coarsening of quantum many-body
interactions at larger interaction scales, thus imposing a hierarchical
structure on many-body tensors of coupled-cluster theory. In our approach, the
interaction scale can be defined on any appropriate Euclidean domain (spatial
domain, momentum-space domain, energy domain, etc.). We show that the
hierarchically resolved many-body tensors reduce the storage requirements to
O(N), where N is the number of simulated quantum particles. Subsequently, we
prove that any connected many-body diagram with arbitrary-order tensors, e.g.,
an arbitrary coupled-cluster diagram, can be evaluated in O(NlogN)
floating-point operations. On top of that, we elaborate an additional
approximation to further reduce the computational complexity of higher-order
coupled-cluster equations, i.e., equations involving higher than double

O(NlogN) scaling.

international implications. The phenomena lead to direct damage to local
assets, as well as broader economic and environmental losses. Satellite imagery
is still the main and often the only available source of information for
disaster management. In this article, we test the potential of social media to
assist disaster management. To this end, we compare insights from two datasets:
fire hotspots detected via NASA satellite imagery and almost all GPS-stamped
tweets from Sumatra Island, Indonesia, posted during 2014. Sumatra Island is
chosen as it regularly experiences a significant number of haze events, which
affect citizens in Indonesia as well as in nearby countries including Malaysia
and Singapore. We analyse temporal correlations between the datasets and their
geo-spatial interdependence. Furthermore, we show how Twitter data reveals
changes in users' behavior during severe haze events. Overall, we demonstrate
that social media is a valuable source of complementary and supplementary
information for haze disaster management. Based on our methodology and
findings, an analytics tool to improve peatland fire and haze disaster
management by the Indonesian authorities is under development.

  of Fundamental Research, April 2014",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this thesis is to investigate the absence of pulses in pulsar, a
phenomena also know as pulsar nulling. The motivation for the work done in
thesis is listed in Chapter 2. A detailed discussion on the previous work
carried out to investigate pulsar nulling phenomena is also included in Chapter
2. Chapter 3 discusses in details all the observations carried out for the
thesis. In Chapter 4, details regarding the nulling behaviour of various
pulsars are listed. Chapter 4 highlights the fact that nulling is
unpredictable. Chapter 5 presents a comparison between two pulsars with high
NFs. It is shown that both the pulsars exhibit similar bursting behaviour, but
strikingly different quasi-periodicities and emission properties. Chapter 6
discusses the details regarding the simultaneous observations of two nulling
pulsars at four different frequencies. These observations suggest that nulling
is a frequency independent phenomena simultaneous occuring over a decade of
frequency. Chapter 7 summaries the results obtained in three different studies
along with their implications. The future work to extend the work carried out
in the thesis is also listed in Chapter 7. The main conclusions of the thesis
are as follow, (1) NF is not an ideal parameter to quantify nulling behaviour,
confirmed firmly by comparing low NF pulsars as well as high NF pulsars, (2)
Nulling occurs randomly with unpredictable length durations.
Quasi-periodicities seen in the high NF pulsars can also be explained by the
Markov models with a forcing function, (3) Nulling is an extreme form of
mode-changing phenomena which occurs on a global magnetospheric scale, (4)
Geometric reasons are less favoured as a likely cause of nulling phenomena due
to the randomness and broadband behaviour reported in this thesis.

characterizing the gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences.
Waveforms from numerical relativity (NR), while highly accurate, are too
computationally expensive to produce to be directly used with Bayesian
parameter estimation tools like Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo and nested sampling.
We propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to generate accurate
reduced-order-model waveforms based only on existing accurate (e.g. NR)
simulations. Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach
produces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter
space. As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to
build a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio $q$ and
equal-and-aligned spin $\chi_1=\chi_2$. Using a regular, equally-spaced grid of
120 IMRPhenomD training waveforms in $q\in[1,3]$ and $\chi_1 \in [-0.5,0.5]$,
the GPR mean approximates IMRPhenomD in this space to mismatches below
$4.3\times 10^{-5}$. Our approach can alternatively use training waveforms
directly from numerical relativity. Beyond interpolation of waveforms, we also
present a greedy algorithm that utilizes the errors provided by our GPR model
to optimize the placement of future simulations. In a fiducial test case we
find that using the greedy algorithm to iteratively add simulations achieves
GPR errors that are $\sim 1$ order of magnitude lower than the errors from
using Latin-hypercube or square training grids.

frame-based and cannot be directly used with event-based cameras. Previous DVS
OF methods do not work well with dense textured input and are designed for
implementation in logic circuits. This paper proposes a new block-matching
based DVS OF algorithm which is inspired by motion estimation methods used for
MPEG video compression. The algorithm was implemented both in software and on
FPGA. For each event, it computes the motion direction as one of 9 directions.
The speed of the motion is set by the sample interval. Results show that the
Average Angular Error can be improved by 30\% compared with previous methods.
The OF can be calculated on FPGA with 50\,MHz clock in 0.2\,us per event (11
clock cycles), 20 times faster than a Java software implementation running on a
desktop PC. Sample data is shown that the method works on scenes dominated by
edges, sparse features, and dense texture.

using objective data in a large representative U.S. sample, and quantify the
association between these intervals and age, sex, and day of the week. Methods:
The study included 11,951 participants six years and older from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006, who wore
accelerometers to measure physical activity for seven consecutive days.
Participants were instructed to remove the device just before the nighttime
sleep period and put it back on immediately after. This nighttime period of
non-wear was defined in this paper as the objective bedtime (OBT), an
objectively estimated record of the in-bed-interval. For each night of the
week, we estimated two measures: the duration of the OBT (OBT-D) and, as a
measure of the chronotype, the midpoint of the OBT (OBT-M). We estimated
day-of-the-week-specific OBT-D and OBT-M using gender-specific population
percentile curves. Differences in OBT-M (chronotype) and OBT-D (the amount of
time spent in bed) by age and sex were estimated using regression models.
Results: The estimates of OBT-M and their differences among age groups were
consistent with the estimates of chronotype obtained via self-report in
European populations. The average OBT-M varied significantly by age, while
OBT-D was less variable with age. The most pronounced differences were observed
between OBT-M of weekday and weekend nights. Conclusions: The proposed
measures, OBT-D and OBT-M, provide useful information of time in bed and
chronotype in NHANES 2003-2006. They identify within-week patterns of bedtime
and can be used to study associations between the bedtime and the large number
of health outcomes collected in NHANES 2003-2006.

where side-groups are attached to the base. Two types of graphs are considered.
Graphs of the first type are uniform in the sense that anchor points are

dimension $D_a=D$. Graphs of the second type are decorated with side-groups in
a regular yet non-uniform way: the set of anchor points has fractal dimension
smaller than that of the base, $D_a<D$. For uniform graphs, a qualitative
method for evaluating the sub-diffusion exponent suggested by Forte et al. for
combs ($D=1$) is extended for brushes ($D>1$) and numerically tested for the
Sierpinski brush (with the base and anchor set built on the same Sierpinski
gasket). As an example of nonuniform graphs we consider the Cantor comb
composed of a one-dimensional base and side-groups, the latter attached to the
former at anchor points forming the Cantor set. A peculiar feature of this and
other nonuniform systems is a long-lived regime of super-diffusive transport

capability of being able to island from the main grid under certain conditions
and connect back when necessary. Once islanded, a microgrid must be
synchronized to the main grid before reconnection to prevent severe
consequences. In general, synchronization of a single machine with the grid can
be easily achieved using a synchronizer. The problem becomes more challenging
when it comes to a multi-bus microgrid with multiple distributed generators
(DGs) and dispersed loads. All distributed generators need to be properly
controlled in a coordinated way to achieve synchronization. This paper presents
a novel bi-level distributed cooperative control framework for a multi-bus
microgrid. In this framework, DGs work collaboratively in a distributed manner
using the minimum and sparse communication. The topology of the communication
network can be flexible which supports the plug-and-play feature of microgrids.
Fast and deterministic synchronization can be achieved with tolerance to
communication latency. Experimental results obtained from Hardware-in-the-Loop

scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with electron energy
loss spectroscopy (EELS). The plasmon energy changes as expected for an
electron gas subject to the thermal expansion of silicon. Reversing this
reasoning, we find that measurements of the plasmon energy provide an
independent measure of the nanoparticle temperature consistent with that of the
heater chip's macroscopic heater/thermometer to within the 5\% accuracy of the

filaments (GMFs), which are extremely elongated (> 100pc in length) giant
molecular clouds (GMCs). They are often seen as inter-arm features in external
spiral galaxies, but have been tentatively associated with spiral arms when
viewed in the Milky Way. In this paper, we study the time evolution of GMFs in
a high-resolution section of a spiral galaxy simulation, and their link with
spiral arm GMCs and star formation, over a period of 11Myrs. The GMFs generally
survive the inter-arm passage, although they are subject to a number of
processes (e.g. star formation, stellar feedback and differential rotation)
which can break the giant filamentary structure into smaller sections. The GMFs
are not gravitationally bound clouds as a whole, but are, to some extent,
confined by external pressure. Once they reach the spiral arms, the GMFs tend
to evolve into more substructured spiral arm GMCs, suggesting that GMFs may be
precursors to arm GMCs. Here, they become incorporated into the more complex
and almost continuum molecular medium that makes up the gaseous spiral arm.
Instead of retaining a clear filamentary shape, their shapes are distorted both
by their climb up the spiral potential and their interaction with the gas
within the spiral arm. The GMFs do tend to become aligned with the spiral arms
just before they enter them (when they reach the minimum of the spiral
potential), which could account for the observations of GMFs in the Milky Way.

detected in the Fe XIX line by SUMER, and interpreted as a fundamental standing
slow mode. The evolution of soft X-ray emission from GOES/SXI and hard X-ray
sources from RHESSI suggests that the oscillations of a large loop are
triggered by a small flare, which may be produced by interaction (local
reconnection) of this large loop with a small loop at its footpoint. This study
provides clear evidence supporting our early conjecture that the slow-mode
standing waves in hot coronal loops are excited by impulsive heating (small or
microflares) at the loop's footpoint.

critical and frequent task that is crucial for maintaining the system's
reliability and fault-tolerance. In this work, we focus on the problem of
repairing multiple failures in a centralized way, which can be desirable in
many data storage configurations, and we show that a significant repair traffic
reduction is possible. First, the fundamental tradeoff between the repair
bandwidth and the storage size for functional repair is established. Using a
graph-theoretic formulation, the optimal tradeoff is identified as the solution
to an integer optimization problem, for which a closed-form expression is
derived. Expressions of the extreme points, namely the minimum storage
multi-node repair (MSMR) and minimum bandwidth multi-node repair (MBMR) points,
are obtained. Second, we describe a general framework for converting single
erasure minimum storage regenerating codes to MSMR codes. The repair strategy
for $e$ failures is similar to that for single failure, however certain extra
requirements need to be satisfied by the repairing functions for single
failure. For illustration, the framework is applied to product-matrix codes and
interference alignment codes. Furthermore, we prove that the functional MBMR
point is not achievable for linear exact repair codes. We also show that
exact-repair minimum bandwidth cooperative repair (MBCR) codes achieve an
interior point, that lies near the MBMR point, when $k \equiv 1 \mod e$, $k$
being the minimum number of nodes needed to reconstruct the entire data.
Finally, for $k> 2e, e\mid k$ and $e \mid d$, where $d$ is the number of helper
nodes during repair, we show that the functional repair tradeoff is not

present a deterministic scheme that, for a prescribed per-machine computational

through a flux-limited diffusion scheme. The flame speed is proportional to
initial lepton fraction because of the release of electron chemical potential
as heat, and reaches a steady-state burning speed of (0.001-0.008)c. We find
that the burning speed is ultimately driven by the neutrino pressure gradient,
given that the pressure gradient induced by quarks is opposed by the pressure
gradients induced by electrons. This suggests, somewhat counter-intuitively,
that the pressure gradients that drive the interface are controlled primarily
by leptonic weak decays rather than by the quark Equation of State (EOS). In
other words, the effects of the leptonic weak interaction, including the
corresponding weak decay rates and the EOS of electrons and neutrinos, are at
least as important as the uncertainties related to the EOS of high density
matter. We find that for baryon number densities nB <= 0.35 fm-3, strong
pressure gradients induced by leptonic weak decays drastically slow down the
burning speed, which is thereafter controlled by the much slower burning
process driven by backflowing downstream matter. We discuss the implications of

stochastic gradient MCMC. These methods use a noisy estimate of the gradient of

stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), probably the most popular of

SGLD using this gradient estimate, and show that, under log-concavity
assumptions on the target distribution, the computational cost required for a
given level of accuracy is independent of the dataset size. Next we show that a
different control variate technique, known as zero variance control variates

improves the inference of the algorithm by reducing the variance of the MCMC

intended for tasks of lifting and lowering heavy weights with an industrial
exoskeleton to substantially reduce spinal loads during these manual handling
activities. Instead of extensively placing high-dense force sensors by covering
the whole plantar area, as most of commercial applications do, we integrate
only a few force sensors in specific plantar area, so that the sensory system
is not restricted to an individual foot size and shape, and on the other hand
has relatively lower material cost. Industrial exoskeletons are intended to
assist workers when handling heavy goods. With this in mind, wearers are not
able to use their hands to control the exoskeleton since they use them to
handle the goods. Therefore, the exoskeleton controller is required to
indirectly infer how much and when the wearer requires assistance for lifting
or lowering a heavy weight. Our approach of dynamically detect and characterize
the increment/decrement of weight, as well as the rising/falling edge, enables
the exoskeleton's controller to trigger the request of assistive force to the

varies in a wide range, primarily depending on the properties (e.g., location,
coverage) of SEP sources and on the longitudinal/latitudinal separations
between the sources and the magnetic footpoints of the observers. Particularly,
the situation that whether the magnetic footpoint of the observer is located
inside or outside of the SEP source is a crucial factor determining the values
of index \alpha. A two-phase phenomenon is found in the radial dependence of
peak intensities. The ""position"" of the breakpoint (transition point/critical
point) is determined by the magnetic connection status of the observers. This
finding suggests that a very careful examination of magnetic connection between
SEP source and each spacecraft should be taken in the observational studies. We

models is pricing the insurance policies, e.g. car insurance. However, the
intractable likelihood function, the unknown variance function, and the
hierarchical structure of mixed effects have presented considerable challenges
for drawing inferences on Tweedie. In this study, we tackle the Bayesian
Tweedie mixed-effects models via variational inference approaches. In
particular, we empower the posterior approximation by implicit models trained
in an adversarial setting. To reduce the variance of gradients, we
reparameterize random effects, and integrate out one local latent variable of
Tweedie. We also employ a flexible hyper prior to ensure the richness of the
approximation. Our method is evaluated on both simulated and real-world data.
Results show that the proposed method has smaller estimation bias on the random
effects compared to traditional inference methods including MCMC; it also

(R~50000) of XZ Tau and DR Tau, two actively accreting T Tauri stars classified
as EXors. The analysis of the observed features provides information on the
properties of the inner disk, the accretion columns, and the winds. Both
sources display composite HI line profiles, with contributions from both
accreting gas and high-velocity winds. These lines become more symmetric and
narrower with increasing upper energy, which may be interpreted in terms of two
components with different decrements or imputed to self-absorption effects. XZ
Tau shows a relatively high state of activity with respect to literature
observations. The variation of the HeI 1.08um line blue-shifted absorption
suggests that the inner wind has undergone a dramatic change in its velocity
structure, connected with a recent accretion event. DR Tau has a more stable
wind as its HeI 1.08um absorption is stable in time in spite of strong
variability of the emission component. The IR veiling can be interpreted as due
to blackbody emission at temperatures of 1600K for XZ Tau and 2300K DR Tau,
with emitting areas ~30 times larger than the star. For XZ Tau these conditions
are consistent with emission from the inner rim of the dusty disk, while for DR
Tau the fairly high temperature may suggest an origin from a thick gaseous disk
within the dust sublimation radius. Strong and broad metallic lines, mainly
from CI and FeI, are detected in XZ Tau, similar to those observed in other
EXor sources during burst phases. DR Tau shows weaker and narrower metallic
lines, despite its larger accretion luminosity. This suggests that accretion is
not the only driver of metallic line excitation. Our observations show the
potential of wide-band, high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy to simultaneously
probe the phenomena that occur in the star-disk interaction region.

hole background are naturally described in Regge-Wheeler gauge. The first-order
field equations reduce to a single master wave equation for each radiative
mode. The master function satisfying this wave equation is a linear combination
of the metric perturbation amplitudes with a source term arising from the
stress-energy tensor of the point particle. The original master functions were
found by Regge and Wheeler (odd parity) and Zerilli (even parity). Subsequent
work by Moncrief and then Cunningham, Price and Moncrief introduced new master
variables which allow time domain reconstruction of the metric perturbation
amplitudes. Here I explore the relationship between these different functions
and develop a general procedure for deriving new higher-order master functions
from ones already known. The benefit of higher-order functions is that their
source terms always converge faster at large distance than their lower-order

non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic --- spots move on the stellar surface and
have finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in
phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a
rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces
have many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate
or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate
effective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel
function. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior
probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalising over the
other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test
the effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated
stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces
periods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an
autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real
data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously
measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these 1132 Kepler
objects of interest and their posterior probability density function samples.
Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will
enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those
involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in
exoplanet systems, or characterising star-planet interactions. The code used to
implement this method is available online.

These systems are typically studied using either classical electrodynamics or
fully quantum theory. Each approach can handle some aspects of plasmonic
systems accurately and efficiently, while having its own limitation. The
self-consistent hydrodynamics model has the advantage that it can incorporate
the quantum effect of the electron gas into classical electrodynamics in a
consistent way. We use the method to study the plasmonic response of polygonal
particles under the influence of an external electromagnetic wave, and we pay
particular attention to the size and shape of the particle and the effect of
charging. We find that the particles support edge modes, face modes and hybrid
modes. The charges induced by the external field in the edge (face) modes
mainly localize at the edges (faces), while the induced charges in the hybrid
modes are distributed nearly evenly in both the edges and faces. The edge modes
are less sensitive to particle size than the face modes, but are sensitive to
the corner angles of the edges. When the number of sides of regular polygons
increases, the edge and face modes gradually change into the classical dipole
plasmonic mode of a cylinder. The hybrid modes are found to be the precursor of

hole, and in particular focus on the effects of the charge of the spinning
black hole on the motion of the particle. We first consider the innermost
stable circular orbits (ISCO) on the equatorial plane. It is found that the
presence of the charge of the black hole leads to the effective potential of
the particle with stronger repulsive effects as compared with the Kerr black
hole. As a result, the radius of ISCO decreases as charge $Q$ of the black hole
increases for a fixed value of black hole's angular momentum $a$. We then
consider a kick on the particle from its initial orbit out of the equatorial
motion. The perturbed motion of the particle will eventually be bounded, or
unbounded so that it escapes to spatial infinity. Even more, the particle will
likely be captured by the black hole. Thus we analytically and numerically
determine the parameter regions of the corresponding motions, in terms of the
initial radius of the orbital motion and the strength of the kick. The
comparison will be made with the motion of a neutral particle in the Kerr black

From a scaling analysis when $T\rightarrow 0$ at different annealing

relating the relaxation time $\tau$ to the system length $L$; $\tau\sim L^z$.
We find $z=13.6 \pm 0.4$ for both the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass order

different low-energy landscapes---for normal-distributed couplings the ground
state is unique (up to a spin reflection) while the system with bimodal
couplings is massively degenerate. Our results reinforce the conclusion of
anomalous entropy-driven relaxation behavior in the bimodal Ising glass. In the
case of a continuous coupling distribution, our results presented here indicate
that, although Kibble-Zurek scaling holds, the perturbative behavior normally
applying in the slow limit breaks down, likely due to quasi-degenerate states,

databases. One of the most popular graph similarity measures is the Graph Edit
Distance (GED) mainly because of its broad applicability and high
interpretability. Despite its prevalence, exact GED computation is proved to be
NP-hard, which could result in unsatisfactory computational efficiency on large
graphs. However, exactly accurate search results are usually unnecessary for
real-world applications especially when the responsiveness is far more
important than the accuracy. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel
probabilistic approach to efficiently estimate GED, which is further leveraged
for the graph similarity search. Specifically, we first take branches as
elementary structures in graphs, and introduce a novel graph similarity measure
by comparing branches between graphs, i.e., Graph Branch Distance (GBD), which
can be efficiently calculated in polynomial time. Then, we formulate the
relationship between GED and GBD by considering branch variations as the result
ascribed to graph edit operations, and model this process by probabilistic
approaches. By applying our model, the GED between any two graphs can be
efficiently estimated by their GBD, and these estimations are finally utilized
in the graph similarity search. Extensive experiments show that our approach
has better accuracy, efficiency and scalability than other comparable methods
in the graph similarity search over real and synthetic data sets.

representation of spin operators, the Bethe-Salpeter ladder approximation
scheme for the bimagnon interacting channel, and considering the lowest order
magnon-phonon-magnon scattering interaction we highlight distinct features in
the X-ray spectrum. Considering damping effects, arising due to the presence of
phonons, we find that in the AF phase the RIXS intensity spectrum attains a
maximum value primarily localized around the K $\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, \pm
\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ - point. For the CAF phase the intensity is broadly
distributed with a significant scattering intensity located around the Y
$\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right)$ - point. Furthermore, in the CAF phase for
suitable anisotropy, nearest-, and next-nearest neighbor interaction parameters
the phonon effects can manifest itself as a distinct peak both below and above
the bimagnon peak. Such a feature is in contrast to the antiferromagnetic
spectrum where the effect due to the phonon peak was located consistently
beyond the bimagnon peak in the high energy end of the spectrum. Additionally,
in the CAF phase we find the RIXS bimagnon-phonon spectrum to be more sensitive

the ultimate effect of magnon-phonon effects in the indirect K-edge RIXS

potentially give stringent constraints on the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV WIMP DM.
However, various non-negligible systematic uncertainties complicate the
estimation of the astrophysical factors relevant for the DM search in these
objects. Among them, the effects of foreground stars particularly attract
attention because the contamination is unavoidable even for the future
kinematical survey. In this article, we assess the effects of the foreground
contamination on the astrophysical $J$-factor estimation by generating mock
samples of stars in the four ultra-faint dSphs and using a model of future

distributions into account. We show that the foreground star contaminations in
the signal region (the region of interest) and their statistical uncertainty
can be estimated by interpolating the foreground star distribution in the
control region where the foreground stars dominate the member stars. Such
regions can be secured at future spectroscopic observations utilizing a
multiple object spectrograph with a large field of view; e.g. the Prime Focus
Spectrograph mounted on Subaru Telescope. The above estimation has several
advantages: The data-driven estimation of the contamination makes the analysis

different magnetic phases can be stabilized. Comparison between our

with an independent L\'{e}vy subordinator. This is a rich family of Markovian
jump processes which exhibit a variety of jump behavior and have found many
applications. This paper studies parametric inference of discretely observed
ergodic subordinate diffusions. We solve the identifiability problem for these
processes using spectral theory and propose a two-step estimation procedure
based on estimating functions. In the first step, we use an estimating function
that only involves diffusion parameters. In the second step, a martingale
estimating function based on eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the subordinate
diffusion is used to estimate the parameters of the L\'{e}vy subordinator and
the problem of how to choose the weighting matrix is solved. When the
eigenpairs do not have analytical expressions, we apply the constant
perturbation method with high order corrections to calculate them numerically
and the martingale estimating function can be computed efficiently. Consistency
and asymptotic normality of our estimator are established considering the
effect of numerical approximation. Through numerical examples, we show that our
method is both computationally and statistically efficient. A subordinate
diffusion model for VIX (CBOE volatility index) is developed which provides
good fit to the data.

optical fields in dispersive and inhomogeneous isotropic media, using the
Abraham- and Minkowski-type approaches, as well as the kinetic (Poynting-like)

While the kinetic Abraham-Poynting momentum describes the energy flux and the
group velocity of the wave, the Minkowski-type quantities, with proper
dispersion corrections, describe the actual momentum and angular momentum
carried by the wave. The kinetic Minkowski-type momentum and AM densities agree
with phenomenological results derived by Philbin. Using the canonical
spin-orbital decomposition, previously used for free-space fields, we find the
corresponding canonical momentum, spin and orbital AM of light in a dispersive
inhomogeneous medium. These acquire a very natural form analogous to the
Brillouin energy density and are valid for arbitrary structured fields. The
general theory is applied to a non-trivial example of a surface
plasmon-polariton (SPP) wave at a metal-vacuum interface. We show that the
integral momentum of the SPP per particle corresponds to the SPP wave vector,
and hence exceeds the momentum of a photon in the vacuum. We also provide the
first accurate calculation of the transverse spin and orbital AM of the SPP.
While the intrinsic orbital AM vanishes, the transverse spin can change its
sign depending on the SPP frequency. Importantly, we present both macroscopic
and microscopic calculations, thereby proving the validity of the general
phenomenological results. The microscopic theory also predicts a transverse
magnetization in the metal (i.e., a magnetic moment for the SPP) as well as the

have attracted wide-spread interest across multiple disciplines and diverse

variations, nodal lines can have numerous topological configurations in the
momentum space, forming nodal rings, nodal chains and potentially nodal links
and nodal knots. However, nodal lines have much less development for the lack
of ideal material platforms. In condensed matter for example, nodal lines are
often fragile to spin-orbit-coupling, locating off the Fermi level, coexisting
with energy-degenerate trivial bands and dispersing strongly in energy of the
line degeneracy. Here, overcoming all above difficulties, we theoretically
predict and experimentally observe nodal chains in a metallic-mesh photonic
crystal having frequency-isolated linear bandtouching rings chained across the
entire Brillouin zone (BZ). These nodal chains are protected by mirror
symmetries and have a frequency variation less than 1%. We used angle-resolved
transmission (ART) to probe the projected bulk dispersions and performed
Fourier-transformed field scan (FTFS) to map out the surface dispersions, which
is a quadratic touching between two drumhead surface bands. Our results
established an ideal nodal-line material for further studies of topological

particle-sidewall friction coefficients, the particles are disordered and the
Bagnold velocity profile is obtained. However, for high sidewall friction, an
ordered state is obtained, characterized by a layering of the particles and
hexagonal packing of the particles in each layer. The extent of ordering,
quantified by the local bond-orientational order parameter, varies in the
cross- section of the channel, with the highest ordering near the side walls.
The flow transition significantly affects the local rheology: the effective
friction coefficient is lower, and the packing fraction is higher, in the

interpreted as shocks induced by mergers of sub-clumps. We study the properties
of merger shocks in merging galaxy clusters, using a set of cosmological
simulations for the large-scale structure formation of the universe. As a
representative case, we here focus on the simulated clusters that undergo
almost head-on collisions with mass ratio $\sim2$. Due to the turbulent nature
of the intracluster medium, shock surfaces are not smooth, but composed of
shocks with different Mach numbers. As the merger shocks expand outward from
the core to the outskirts, the average Mach number, $\left<M_s\right>$,
increases in time. We suggest that the shocks propagating along the merger axis
could be manifested as X-ray shocks and/or radio relics. The kinetic energy
through the shocks, $F_\phi$, peaks at $\sim1$ Gyr after their initial
launching, or at $\sim1-2$ Mpc from the core. Because of the Mach number
dependent model adopted here for the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency,
their CR-energy-weighted Mach number is higher with $\left< M_s \right>_{\rm
CR}\sim3-4$, compared to the kinetic-energy-weighted Mach number,
$\left<M_s\right>_{\phi}\sim2-3$. Most energetic shocks are to be found ahead
of the lighter dark matter (DM) clump, while the heavier DM clump is located in
the opposite side of clusters. Although our study is limited to the merger case
considered, the results such as the means and variations of shock properties
and their time evolution could be compared with the observed characteristics of
merger shocks, constraining interpretations of relevant observations.

approach at the tree level only. We consider that $\Lambda^*$ consists of the
high-mass ($H$) and low-mass ($L$) poles as suggested by the chiral unitary
model (ChUM). We determine all the model parameters including coupling
constants and cutoff parameters for the phenomenological strong form factors by
using the theoretical information from ChUM and available experimental data.
The electromagnetic (EM) form factors for the two poles are parameterized
appropriately being similar to that for the neutron by employing the ChUM
estimates for the EM root-mean-squared (rms) radii for the two poles. We
observe from the numerical calculations that, for the photoproduction of
$\Lambda^*$, the interference between the two poles turns out to be
destructive, resulting in the single-peak line at
$M_{\pi^+\Sigma^-}\approx1405$ MeV in the invariant-mass distribution. On the
contrary, there appear two peaks in the distribution for the electroproduction
as observed in the CLAS/Jlab electroproduction data, due to the constructive
interference, which is mainly caused by the Dirac form factors for the two
poles. From this observation, we conclude that, in order to explain the photo-
and electroproduction data simultaneously, i.e., \textit{single} and
\textit{double} peaks, respectively, in the invariant-mass distribution, the
interference patterns for the two poles should follow those suggested by ChUM.
In turn, it is a strong theoretical and experimental supports for the two-pole
structure scenario for $\Lambda^*$.

velocity (v95\%) of $-1340$ km s$^{-1}$, with respect to the systemic peak
emission, and a luminosity of $L' = 9.9\times 10^9 ~\mu^{-1}$ K km s$^{-1}$
pc$^{-2}$ (where $\mu$ is the lensing magnification factor). We discuss various
scenarios for the nature of this emission, and conclude that this is the first
detection of fast molecular gas at redshift $>3$. We derive a mass flow rate of
molecular gas in the range $\rm \dot M=3-7.4\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$/yr, and
momentum boost $\dot P_{OF} / \dot P_{AGN} \sim 2-6$, therefore consistent with
a momentum conserving flow. For the largest $\dot P_{OF}$ the scaling is also
consistent with a energy conserving flow with an efficiency of $\sim$10-20\%.
The present data can hardly discriminate between the two expansion modes. The
mass loading factor of the molecular outflow $\eta=\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is $>>1$.
We also detect a molecular emission line at a frequency of 94.83 GHz,
corresponding to a rest frame frequency of 465.8 GHz, which we tentatively
identified with the cation molecule $\rm N_2H^+$(5-4), which would be the first
detection of this species at high redshift. We discuss the alternative
possibility that this emission is due to a CO emission line from the, so far
undetected, lens galaxy. Further observations of additional transitions of the
same species with NOEMA can discriminate between the two scenarios.

promising framework to manage the risk from variable renewable energy (VRE). In
presence of VRE uncertainties, this paper discusses a distributionally robust
chance constrained approximate AC-OPF. The power flow model employed in the
proposed OPF formulation combines an exact AC power flow model at the nominal
operation point and an approximate linear power flow model to reflect the
system response under uncertainties. The ambiguity set employed in the
distributionally robust formulation is the Wasserstein ball centered at the
empirical distribution. The proposed OPF model minimizes the expectation of the
quadratic cost function w.r.t. the worst-case probability distribution and
guarantees the chance constraints satisfied for any distribution in the
ambiguity set. The whole method is data-driven in the sense that the ambiguity
set is constructed from historical data without any presumption on the type of
the probability distribution, and more data leads to smaller ambiguity set and
less conservative strategy. Moreover, special problem structures of the
proposed problem formulation are exploited to develop an efficient and scalable
solution approach. Case studies are carried out on IEEE 14 and 118 bus systems
to show the accuracy and necessity of the approximate AC model and the
attractive features of the distributionally robust optimization approach

by superposing a 3D force-free field on a constant axial magnetic field. The
initial field supports 3D magnetic nulls having classical spine axis and
dome-shaped fan surface; and exerts non-zero Lorentz force on the magnetofluid.
Importantly, the simulation identifies the development of current sheets near
the 3D magnetic nulls. The morphology of the current sheets is similar to a
cylindrical surface where the surface encloses the spine axis. The development
is because of favorable deformation of magnetic field lines constituting the
dome-shaped fan surface. The deformation of field lines is found to be caused
from the flow generated by magnetic reconections at current sheets which are
located away from the cylindrically-shaped current sheets.

} x,y \in V(G)\}$. For any real number $k \in [1, \kappa(G)]$, a real-valued
function $g: V(G) \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a \emph{$k$-resolving function} of $G$
if $g(R\{x,y\}) \ge k$ for any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V(G)$. The
\emph{fractional $k$-metric dimension}, $\dim^k_f(G)$, of $G$ is
$\min\{g(V(G)): g \mbox{ is a $k$-resolving function of } G\}$. In this paper,
we initiate the study of the fractional $k$-metric dimension of graphs. For a
connected graph $G$ and $k \in [1, \kappa(G)]$, it's easy to see that $k \le
\dim_f^k(G) \le \frac{k|V(G)|}{\kappa(G)}$; we characterize graphs $G$
satisfying $\dim_f^k(G)=k$ and $\dim_f^k(G)=|V(G)|$, respectively. We show that
$\dim_f^k(G) \ge k \dim_f(G)$ for any $k \in [1, \kappa(G)]$, and we give an
example showing that $\dim_f^k(G)-k\dim_f(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for some
$k \in (1, \kappa(G)]$; we also describe a condition for which
$\dim_f^k(G)=k\dim_f(G)$ holds. We determine the fractional $k$-metric
dimension for some classes of graphs, and conclude with two open problems,
including whether $\phi(k)=\dim_f^k(G)$ is a continuous function of $k$ on
every connected graph $G$.

(GNSSs) for critical road or urban applications, one of the major challenges to
be solved is the provision of integrity to terrestrial environments, so that
GNSS may be safety used in these applications. To do so, the integrity of the
received GNSS signal must be analyzed in order to detect some local effect
disturbing the received signal. This is desirable because the presence of some
local effect may cause large position errors, and hence compromise the signal
integrity. Moreover, the detection of such disturbing effects must be done
before some pre-established delay. This kind of detection lies within the field
of transient change detection. In this work, a finite moving average stopping
time is proposed in order to approach the signal integrity problem with a
transient change detection framework. The statistical performance of this
stopping time is investigated and compared, in the context of multipath
detection, to other different methods available in the literature. Numerical
results are presented in order to assess their performance.

independence relations encoded by the nonedges of a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) $\mathcal{G}$. Such models are used to model complex cause-effect systems
across a variety of research fields. From observational data alone, a DAG model
$\mathcal{G}$ is only recoverable up to Markov equivalence. Combinatorially,
two DAGs are Markov equivalent if and only if they have the same underlying
undirected graph (i.e. skeleton) and the same set of the induced subDAGs $i\to
j \leftarrow k$, known as immoralities. Hence it is of interest to study the
number and size of Markov equivalence classes (MECs). In a recent paper, the
authors introduced a pair of generating functions that enumerate the number of
MECs on a fixed skeleton by number of immoralities and by class size, and they
studied the complexity of computing these functions. In this paper, we lay the
foundation for studying these generating functions by analyzing their structure
for trees and other closely related graphs. We describe these polynomials for
some important families of graphs including paths, stars, cycles, spider
graphs, caterpillars, and complete binary trees. In doing so, we recover
important connections to independence polynomials, and extend some classical
identities that hold for Fibonacci numbers. We also provide tight lower and
upper bounds for the number and size of MECs on any tree. Finally, we use
computational methods to show that the number and distribution of high degree
nodes in a triangle-free graph dictates the number and size of MECs.

recognition. The success of these models however relies on the use of
sophisticated recipes and complicated machinery that is not easily accessible
to non-practitioners. Recent innovations in Deep Learning have given rise to an
alternative - discriminative models called Sequence-to-Sequence models, that
can almost match the accuracy of state of the art generative models. While
these models are easy to train as they can be trained end-to-end in a single
step, they have a practical limitation that they can only be used for offline
recognition. This is because the models require that the entirety of the input
sequence be available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not
valid for instantaneous speech recognition. To address this problem, online
sequence-to-sequence models were recently introduced. These models are able to
start producing outputs as data arrives, and the model feels confident enough
to output partial transcripts. These models, like sequence-to-sequence are
causal - the output produced by the model until any time, $t$, affects the
features that are computed subsequently. This makes the model inherently more
powerful than generative models that are unable to change features that are
computed from the data. This paper highlights two main contributions - an
improvement to online sequence-to-sequence model training, and its application
to noisy settings with mixed speech from two speakers.

parameters such as fronthaul latency and capacity. This work focuses on uplink
communications and investigates the cloud-edge allocation of two important

under study consists of a time-varying uplink channel in which the RCC has

machine learning framework. The appearance space is composed of all possible
images, which can be captured by a robot's visual system under all robot
localizations. Using recent manifold learning and deep learning techniques, we
propose a new geometrically motivated solution based on training data
consisting of a finite set of images captured in known locations of the robot.
The solution includes estimation of the robot localization mapping from the
appearance space to the robot localization space, as well as estimation of the
inverse mapping for modeling visual image features. The latter allows solving
the robot localization problem as the Kalman filtering problem.

and robotics communities, where the task is to accurately and efficiently
recognize the location of a given query image. Despite years of wisdom
accumulated in this field, place recognition still remains an open problem due
to the various ways in which the appearance of real-world places may differ.
This paper presents an overview of the place recognition literature. Since
condition invariant and viewpoint invariant features are essential factors to
long-term robust visual place recognition system, We start with traditional
image description methodology developed in the past, which exploit techniques
from image retrieval field. Recently, the rapid advances of related fields such
as object detection and image classification have inspired a new technique to
improve visual place recognition system, i.e., convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Thus we then introduce recent progress of visual place recognition
system based on CNNs to automatically learn better image representations for
places. Eventually, we close with discussions and future work of place
recognition.

of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). With the proliferation of large-scale and
long-term WSNs, it is becoming more important to calibrate sensors when the
ground truth is unavailable. This problem is called ""blind calibration"". In
this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method named projection-recovery
network (PRNet) to blindly calibrate sensor measurements online. The PRNet
first projects the drifted data to a feature space, and uses a powerful deep
convolutional neural network to recover the estimated drift-free measurements.
We deploy a 24-sensor testbed and provide comprehensive empirical evidence
showing that the proposed method significantly improves the sensing accuracy
and drifted sensor detection. Compared with previous methods, PRNet can
calibrate 2x of drifted sensors at the recovery rate of 80% under the same
level of accuracy requirement. We also provide helpful insights for designing
deep neural networks for sensor calibration. We hope our proposed simple and
effective approach will serve as a solid baseline in blind drift calibration of
sensor networks.

a challenge for recommender systems. These issues can partly be dealt with by
making predictions not in isolation, but by leveraging information from related
events; such information could include signals from social relationships or
from the sequence of recent activities. Both types of additional information
can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art matrix
factorization-based techniques. In this paper, we propose new methods to
combine both social and sequential information simultaneously, in order to
further improve recommendation performance. We show these techniques to be
particularly effective when dealing with sparsity and cold-start issues in
several large, real-world datasets.

small and low-cost sensors with the capability of sensing various types of
physical and environmental conditions, data processing, and wireless
communication. Since WSN protocols are application specific, the focus has been
given to the routing protocols that might differ depending on the application
and network architecture. In this work, novel routing protocols have been
proposed which is a cluster-based security protocol is named as Efficient and
Secure Routing Protocol (ESRP) for WSN. The goal of ESRP is to provide an
energy efficient routing solution with dynamic security features for clustered
WSN. During the network formation, a node which is connected to a Personal
Computer (PC) has been selected as a sink node. Once the sensor nodes were
deployed, the sink node logically segregates the other nodes in a cluster
structure and subsequently creates a WSN. This centralized cluster formation
method is used to reduce the node level processing burden and avoid multiple
communications. In order to ensure reliable data delivery, various security
features have been incorporated in the proposed protocol such as Modified
Zero-Knowledge Protocol (MZKP), Promiscuous hearing method, Trapping of
adversaries and Mine detection. One of the unique features of this ESRP is that
it can dynamically decide about the selection of these security methods, based
on the residual energy of nodes.
