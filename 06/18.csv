access that regime, finding that runaway stimulated collisions in condensates

performance advantage over a comparable classical system survives its usage in
an entanglement-breaking scenario plagued by loss and noise. In particular,
QI's error-probability exponent for discriminating between equally-likely
hypotheses of target absence or presence is 6 dB higher than that of the
optimum classical system using the same transmitted power. This performance
advantage, however, presumes that the target return, when present, has known
amplitude and phase, a situation that seldom occurs in lidar applications. At
lidar wavelengths, most target surfaces are sufficiently rough that their
returns are speckled, i.e., they have Rayleigh-distributed amplitudes and
uniformly-distributed phases. QI's optical parametric amplifier receiver --
which affords a 3 dB better-than-classical error-probability exponent for a
return with known amplitude and phase -- fails to offer any performance gain
for Rayleigh-fading targets. We show that the sum-frequency generation receiver
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 040801 (2017)] -- whose error-probability exponent for a
nonfading target achieves QI's full 6 dB advantage over optimum classical
operation -- outperforms the classical system for Rayleigh-fading targets. In
this case, QI's advantage is subexponential: its error probability is lower
than the classical system's by a factor of $1/\ln(M\bar{\kappa}N_S/N_B)$, when
$M\bar{\kappa}N_S/N_B \gg 1$, with $M\gg 1$ being the QI transmitter's

occurrence rate of such radio flares or on the correlation with pre-main
sequence X-ray flares, although such correlations are known for the Sun and
nearby active stars. Here we report simultaneous deep VLA radio and Chandra
X-ray observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster, targeting hundreds of sources
to look for the occurrence rate of extreme radio variability and potential
correlation with the most extreme X-ray variability. We identify 13 radio
sources with extreme radio variability, with some showing an order of magnitude
change in flux density in less than 30 minutes. All of these sources show X-ray

correlations with extreme radio flaring. Strong X-ray variability does not

their protoplanetary disks. Finally, our results highlight implications for

strengths of SNNs are hindered by the sensitivity of spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP) rules to input spike rates, as fine temporal correlations may
be obstructed by coarser correlations between firing rates. In this article, we
propose a spike-timing-dependent learning rule that allows a neuron to learn
from the temporally-coded information despite the presence of rate codes. Our
long-term plasticity rule makes use of short-term synaptic fatigue dynamics. We
show analytically that, in contrast to conventional STDP rules, our fatiguing
STDP (FSTDP) helps learn the temporal code, and we derive the necessary
conditions to optimize the learning process. We showcase the effectiveness of
FSTDP in learning spike-timing correlations among processes of different rates

sequences of different species and to compare them in order to derive the
evolutionary relationships of these species. Maximum Parsimony is one such
criterion for tree reconstruction and, it is the one which we will use in this
paper. However, it is well-known that tree reconstruction methods can lead to
wrong relationship estimates. One typical problem of Maximum Parsimony is long
branch attraction, which can lead to statistical inconsistency. In this work,
we will consider a blockwise approach to alignment analysis, namely so-called
$k$-tuple analyses. For four taxa it has already been shown that
$k$-tuple-based analyses are statistically inconsistent if and only if the
standard character-based (site-based) analyses are statistically inconsistent.
So, in the four-taxon case, going from individual sites to $k$-tuples does not
lead to any improvement. However, real biological analyses often consider more
than only four taxa. Therefore, we analyze the case of five taxa for $2$- and
$3$-tuple-site data and consider alphabets with two and four elements. We show
that the equivalence of single-site data and $k$-tuple-site data then no longer
holds. Even so, we can show that Maximum Parsimony is statistically
inconsistent for $k$-tuple site data and five taxa.

communication to nearby (pc) stars is possible at data rates of bits per second
per Watt between a 1 m sized probe and a large receiving telescope (E-ELT, 39
m), when optimizing all parameters such as frequency at 300-400 nm. We now
apply our framework of interstellar extinction and quantum state calculations
for photon encoding to the solar gravitational lens (SGL), which enlarges the
aperture (and thus the photon flux) of the receiving telescope by a factor of
$>10^9$. For the first time, we show that the use of the SGL for communication
purposes is possible. This was previously unclear because the Einstein ring is
placed inside the solar coronal noise, and contributing factors are difficult
to determine. We calculate point-spread functions, aperture sizes, heliocentric
distance, and optimum communication frequency. The best wavelength for nearby
(<100 pc) interstellar communication is limited by current technology to the UV
and optical band. To suppress coronal noise, an advanced coronograph is
required, alternatively an occulter could be used which would require a second
spacecraft in formation flight 78 km from the receiver, and ~10 m in size. Data
rates scale approximately linear with the SGL telescope size and with
heliocentric distance. Achievable (receiving) data rates from Alpha Cen are
1-10 Mbits per second per Watt for a pair of meter-sized telescopes, an
improvement of $10^6$ compared to using the same receiving telescope without

defined. The motivation for the definitions is to provide realistic modeling of
multi-sensor environments in which a useful time-frequency analysis is
essential. The definition of the DFT requires associated uncertainty principle
inequalities. The definition of the ambiguity function requires a component
that leads to formulating a mathematical theory in which two essential
algebraic operations can be made compatible in a natural way. The theory is
referred to as frame multiplication theory. These definitions, inequalities,
and theory are interdependent, and they are the content of the paper with the
centerpiece being frame multiplication theory.
  The technology underlying frame multiplication theory is the theory of
frames, short time Fourier transforms (STFTs), and the representation theory of
finite groups. The main results have the following form: frame multiplication
exists if and only if the finite frames that arise in the theory are of a
certain type, e.g., harmonic frames, or, more generally, group frames.
  In light of the complexities and the importance of the modeling of
time-varying and dynamical systems in the context of effectively analyzing
vector-valued multi-sensor environments, the theory of vector-valued DFTs and
ambiguity functions must not only be mathematically meaningful, but it must
have constructive implementable algorithms, and be computationally viable. This
paper presents our vision for resolving these issues, in terms of a significant
mathematical theory, and based on the goal of formulating and developing a
useful vector-valued theory.

problem for which a Lyapunov framework is used to decompose it into two
disjoint subproblems of auxiliary variable selection and rate maximization. The
latter is further decoupled into a user association and mode selection (UAMS)
problem and a UL/DL power optimization (UDPO) problem that are solved
concurrently. The UAMS problem is modeled as a many-to-one matching problem to
associate users to small cell base stations (SBSs) and select transmission mode
(half/full-duplex and orthogonal/non-orthogonal multiple access), and an
algorithm is proposed to solve the problem converging to a pairwise stable
matching. Subsequently, the UDPO problem is formulated as a sequence of convex
problems and is solved using the concave-convex procedure. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to allocate UL and DL
power levels after dynamically selecting the operating mode and the served
users, under different traffic intensity conditions, network density, and
self-interference cancellation capability. The proposed scheme is shown to
achieve up to 63% and 73% of gains in UL and DL packet throughput, and 21% and

naked, shell-focussing singularity arising from the complete gravitational
collapse of a spherical dust cloud. In previous work, we have studied the
dynamics of spherical test scalar fields on such a background. In particular,
we proved that such fields cannot develop any divergences which propagate along
the Cauchy horizon. In the present work, we extend our analysis to the more
general case of test fields without symmetries and to linearized gravitational
perturbations with odd parity. To this purpose, we first consider test fields
possessing a divergence-free stress-energy tensor satisfying the dominant
energy condition, and we prove that a suitable energy norm is uniformly bounded
in the domain of dependence of the initial slice. In particular, this result
implies that free-falling observers co-moving with the dust particles measure a
finite energy of the field, even as they cross the Cauchy horizon at points
lying arbitrarily close to the central singularity. Next, for the case of
Klein-Gordon fields, we derive point-wise bounds from our energy estimates
which imply that the scalar field cannot diverge at the Cauchy horizon, except
possibly at the central singular point. Finally, we analyze the behaviour of
odd-parity, linear gravitational and dust perturbations of the collapsing
spacetime. Similarly to the scalar field case, we prove that the relevant
gauge-invariant combinations of the metric perturbations stay bounded away from
the central singularity, implying that no divergences can propagate in the
vacuum region. Our results are in accordance with previous numerical studies
and analytic work in the self-similar case.

leads to a tremendous computational cost, and this is by far the dominant cost
for these problems. Several authors have proposed randomization and stochastic
programming techniques to drastically reduce the number of system solves by
estimating the objective function using only a few appropriately chosen random
linear combinations of the sources. While some have reported good solution
quality at a greatly reduced cost, for our problem of interest, diffuse optical
tomography, the approach often does not lead to sufficiently accurate

  We propose two improvements. First, to efficiently exploit Newton-type

combinations of detectors, drastically reducing the number of adjoint solves.
Second, after solving to a modest tolerance, we compute a few simultaneous
sources and detectors that maximize the Frobenius norm of the sampled Jacobian
to improve the rate of convergence and obtain more accurate solutions. We
complement these optimized simultaneous sources and detectors by random
simultaneous sources and detectors constrained to a complementary subspace. Our
approach leads to solutions of the same quality as obtained using all sources

guard fingerprinting and from performance issues. To address these issues,
Hayes and Danezis proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system
groups all guards into sets, and each client picks one of these sets and uses
its guards. Unfortunately, guard sets frequently need nodes added or they are
broken up due to fluctuations in network bandwidth. In this paper, we first
show that these breakups create opportunities for malicious guards to join many
guard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they make available to Tor, and this
greatly increases the number of clients exposed to malicious guards. To address
this problem, we propose a new method for forming guard sets based on Internet
location. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients and guards together more
reliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary guard sets. This
approach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access to limited
locations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate this
guard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level
adversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is
good at confining the adversary into few guard sets and thus limiting the
impact of attacks.

  Machine Learning: Theory and Practice. In submission",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS math.OC math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-convex optimization with local search heuristics has been widely used in
machine learning, achieving many state-of-art results. It becomes increasingly
important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical
data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been
conjectured to have the geometric property that ""all local optima are
(approximately) global optima"", and thus they can be solved efficiently by
local search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very
difficult.
  In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random
over-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in
unsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In
practice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex
objective. We show that for any small constant $\epsilon > 0$, among the set of
points with function values $(1+\epsilon)$-factor larger than the expectation
of the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima.
Previously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small
neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an
initialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent
algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem.
  Our main technique uses Kac-Rice formula and random matrix theory. To our
best knowledge, this is the first time when Kac-Rice formula is successfully
applied to counting the number of local minima of a highly-structured random
polynomial with dependent coefficients.

massless. The DM in this model, which is a Dirac fermion and singlet under the
hidden SU(N), is also assumed to be charged under the U(1) gauge symmetry,
through which it can interact with the chiral fermions. Below the confinement
scale of SU(N), the hidden quark condensate spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge
symmetry such that there remains a discrete symmetry, which accounts for the
stability of DM. This condensate also breaks a flavor symmetry in this model
and Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this flavor symmetry appear below
the confinement scale. The hidden U(1) gauge boson and hidden
quarks/Nambu-Goldstone bosons are components of dark radiation (DR) above/below
the confinement scale. These light fields increase the effective number of
neutrinos by $\delta N_{\rm eff}\simeq 0.59$ above the confinement scale for
$N=2$, resolving the tension in the measurements of the Hubble constant by
Planck and Hubble Space Telescope if the confinement scale is $\lesssim 1$ eV.
DM and DR continuously scatter with each other via the hidden U(1) gauge
interaction, which suppresses the matter power spectrum and results in a
smaller structure growth rate. The DM sector couples to the Standard Model
sector through the exchange of a real singlet scalar mixing with the Higgs
boson, which makes it possible to probe our model in DM direct detection
experiments. Variants of this model are also discussed, which may offer

service or materials processing are studied using first-principles simulations,
with a focus on identifying changes to the energetics and mechanical strength
of a Cu $\Sigma$5 (310) grain boundary. Changes to the grain boundary energy
are found to be closely correlated with the covalent radii of the impurities
and the volumetric deformations of polyhedra at the interface. The
strengthening energies of each impurity are evaluated as a function of covalent
radius and electronegativity, followed by first-principles-based tensile tests
on selected impurities. The strengthening of a B-doped grain boundary comes
from an enhancement of the charge density among the adjacent Cu atoms, which
improves the connection between the two grains. Alternatively, the detrimental
effect of O results from the reduction of charge density between the Cu atoms.
This work deepens the understanding of the possible beneficial and harmful
effects of impurities on grain boundaries, providing a guide for materials

scenario of high dimensional data sets with small sample sizes. We show that
the two-sample hypothesis testing problem can be posed as a one-class set
classification problem. In the set classification problem the goal is to
classify a set of data points that are assumed to have a common class. We prove
that the average probability of error given a set is less than or equal to the
Bayes error and decreases as a power of $n$ number of sample data points in the
set. We use the positive definite Set Kernel for directly mapping sets of data
to an associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, without the need to learn a
probability distribution. We specifically solve the two-sample hypothesis
testing problem using a one-class SVM in conjunction with the proposed Set
Kernel. We compare the proposed method with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy,
F-Test and T-Test methods on a number of challenging simulated high dimensional
and small sample size data. We also perform two-sample hypothesis testing
experiments on six cancer gene expression data sets and achieve zero type-I and

predict the salt-concentration dependent swelling state of charged microgels
and the local concentration of monovalent ions inside and outside the microgel.
For this purpose, elastic, solvent-induced and electrostatic contributions to
the microgel free energy are considered together with the free energy of the
ions. In addition to the electrostatic interaction, the model explicitly
considers both the microgel-ion excluded-volume (steric) repulsion and the
ionic correlations, in such a way that the formalism is consistent with the
Hypernetted-Chain Closure approximation (HNC). We explore the role that the
solvent quality, chain elasticity, salt concentration and microgel bare charge
play on the swelling state, the effective charge and on the ionic density
profiles. Our results show that the microgel-ion steric exclusion foments the
increase of the particle size up to 10 %. The role that the steric effect plays
on the counterion distribution becomes more important when the microgel
approaches the shrunken configuration, developing an accumulation peak at the
microgel interface and a reduction in the inner core of the microgel that
induce a significant increase of the microgel effective charge. We further find
that deep inside the particle charge electroneutrality is achieved and a Donnan
potential corrected by the steric exclusion is established.

  Converters","11 pages",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The output impedance matrix of a grid-connected converter plays an important
role in analyzing system stability. Due to the dynamics of the DC-link control
and the phase locked loop (PLL), the output impedance matrices of the converter
and grid are difficult to be diagonally decoupled simultaneously, neither in
the dq domain nor in the phase domain. It weakens the effectiveness of
impedance-based stability criterion (ISC) in system oscillation analysis. To
this end, this paper innovatively proposes the generalized-impedance based
stability criterion (GISC) to reduce the dimension of the transfer function
matrix and simplify system small-signal stability analysis. Firstly, the
impedances of the converter and the grid in polar coordinates are formulated,
and the concept of generalized-impedance of the converter and the grid is put
forward. Secondly, through strict mathematical derivation, the equation that
implies the dynamic interaction between the converter and the grid is then
extracted from the characteristic equation of the grid-connected converter
system. Using the proposed method, the small-signal instability of system can
be interpreted as the resonance of the generalized-impedances of the converter
and the grid. Besides, the GISC is equivalent to ISC when the dynamics of the
outer-loop control and PLL are not considered. Finally, the effectiveness of
the proposed method is further verified using the MATLAB based digital
simulation and RT-LAB based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation.

buildings and power grids operators to simultaneously optimize their
performance. Simplified dynamics of building clusters and building-integrated
power networks with algebraic equations are presented---both operating at
different time-scales. A model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm that
formulates the BtG integration and accounts for the time-scale discrepancy is
developed. The formulation captures dynamic and algebraic power flow
constraints of power networks and is shown to be numerically advantageous. The
paper analytically establishes that the BtG integration yields a reduced total
system cost in comparison with decoupled designs where grid and building
operators determine their controls separately. The developed framework is
tested on standard power networks that include thousands of buildings modeled
using industrial data. Case studies demonstrate building energy savings and
significant frequency regulation, while these findings carry over in network
simulations with nonlinear power flows and mismatch in building model
parameters. Finally, simulations indicate that the performance does not
significantly worsen when there is uncertainty in the forecasted weather and
base load conditions.

is derived by employing the reductive perturbation method. It is found that the
NLS equation leads to the modulational instability (MI) of HIAWs, and to the
formation of HIA rogue waves (HIARWs), which are due to the effects of
nonlinearity and dispersion in the propagation of HIAWs. The conditions for MI
of HIAWs, and the basic properties of the generated HIARWs are identified. It
is observed that the striking features (viz. instability criteria, growth rate
of MI, amplitude and width of HIARWs, etc.) of the HIAWs are significantly
modified by effects of nonextensivity of electrons and positrons, ratio of
light positive ion mass to heavy negative ion mass, ratio of electron number
density to light positive ion number density, and ratio of electron temperature
to positron temperature, etc. The relevancy of our present investigation to the
observations in the space (viz. cometary comae and earth's ionosphere) and

episodes: 0-40s and 280-420s after the burst onset (t0). The relatively high
fluence of GRB 160509A allows us to establish an evolving spectrum above 100
MeV. During the first emission episode, the >100 MeV spectrum is soft with
\Gamma=>3.0, which can be smoothly connected to keV energies with a Band
function with a high-energy cutoff. The >100 MeV spectrum rapidly changes to a
hard spectrum with \Gamma<=1.5 after t0+40s. The existence of very energetic
photons, e.g., a 52 GeV that arrives t0+77 seconds, and a 29 GeV that arrives
t0+70 ks, is hard to reconcile by the synchrotron emission from forward-shock
electrons, but likely due to inverse Compton mechanism (e.g., synchrotron
self-Compton emission). A soft spectrum (\Gamma~2) between 300s and 1000s after
the burst onset is also found at a significance of about 2 standard deviations,
which suggests a different emission mechanism at work for this short period of
time. GRB 160509A represents the latest example where inverse Compton emission
has to be taken into account in explaining the afterglow GeV emission, which
had been suggested long before the launch of Fermi LAT.

state-independent bounds of additive variance-based uncertainty relations. In
this way, the degree of incompatibility becomes an intrinsic property among the
operators, but not on the quantum state. To justify our case, we focus on the
incompatibility of spin systems. For an arbitrary setting of two or three
linearly-independent Pauli-spin operators, the incompatibility is analytically
solved, the spins are maximally incompatible if and only if they are orthogonal
to each other. On the other hand, the measure of incompatibility represents a
versatile tool for applications such as testing entanglement of bipartite

main question treated in this paper is: under what conditions on a given pair
of convex bodies $K,L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ does
$\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(L)$ hold?
For a convex body $K$, we aim to find the optimal constant $\theta(K)$ such
that $\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq \theta(K) \cdot
\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(K)$; we achieve this goal for all the $\ell^p$ unit
balls, as well as for other sets. For example, if $\overline{\mathbb{B}}_{p,d}$
is the closed unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the $\ell^p$ norm, then \[
\theta(\overline{\mathbb{B}}_{p,d}) = d^{1-|1/p - 1/2|}. \] This constant is
sharp, and it is new for all $p \neq 2$. Moreover, for some sets $K$ we find a
minimal set $L$ for which $\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) \subseteq
\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(L)$. In particular, we obtain that a convex body $K$
satisfies $\mathcal{W}^{\textrm{max}}(K) = \mathcal{W}^{\textrm{min}}(K)$ if
and only if $K$ is a simplex.
  These problems relate to dilation theory, convex geometry, operator systems,
and completely positive maps. We discuss and exploit these connections as well.
For example, our results show that every $d$-tuple of self-adjoint operators of
norm less than or equal to $1$, can be dilated to a commuting family of
self-adjoints, each of norm at most $\sqrt{d}$. We also introduce new explicit
constructions of these (and other) dilations.

($s$, $\overline{Q}$, $S$); for these policies, we adopt simulation-genetic

a simulation-optimization heuristic is also employed to solve this problem.
Computational comparisons among these approaches show that policy $(s, S)$ and

is in the northeast associated with NGC 2071, whereas the red-shifted component
is in the southwest associated with NGC 2068. The total intensity distribution
of the two clouds shows a gap of ~1 pc, suggesting that they are detached at
present. A detailed spatial comparison indicates that the two show
complementary distributions. The blue-shifted component lies toward an
intensity depression to the northwest of the red-shifted component, where we
find that a displacement of 0.8 pc makes the two clouds fit well with each
other. Furthermore, a new simulation of non-frontal collisions shows that
observations from 60 degrees off the collisional axis agreed well with the
velocity structure in this region. On the basis of these results, we
hypothesize that the two components collided with each other at a projected
relative velocity 3.0 km/s estimated to be 0.3 Myr for an assumed axis of the
relative motion 60 degrees off the line of sight. We assume that the two most
massive early B-type stars in the cloud, illuminating stars of the two
reflection nebulae, were formed by collisional triggering at the interfaces
between the two clouds. Given the other young high-mass star forming regions,
namely, M42, M43, and NGC 2024 (Fukui et al. 2018b; Ohama et al. 2017a), it

observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all
test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain
embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity
problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute
the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge
provided at test time.The experimental results show the effectiveness of our
proposed model in the OOKB setting.Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in
which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the WordNet dataset. The code and dataset are available at

Rham-Witt complex in mixed characteristic, where p is an odd prime. They give
as an example an elementary algebraic description of the de Rham-Witt complex

of characteristic p > 2, a Witt complex over A = W(k) with an algebraic
description which is completely analogous to Hesselholt and Madsen's
description for Z_(p). Our Witt complex is not isomorphic to the de Rham-Witt
complex; instead we prove that, in each level, the de Rham-Witt complex over
W(k) surjects onto our Witt complex, and that the kernel consists of all
elements which are divisible by arbitrarily high powers of p. We deduce an
explicit description of the de Rham-Witt complex over W(k). We also deduce
results concerning the de Rham-Witt complex over certain perfectoid rings.

Space Telescope, is still under debate, for which both the external shock
origin and internal dissipation origin have been suggested. In the internal
dissipation scenario, the high energy emission is expected to exhibit
significant temporal variability, tracking the keV/MeV fast variable behavior.
Here, we report a detailed analysis on the Fermi data of GRB~170214A, which is
sufficiently bright in the high energy to enable a quantitative analysis of the
correlation between high-energy emission and keV/MeV emission with high
statistics. Our result shows a clear temporal correlation between high-energy
and keV/MeV emission in the whole prompt emission phase as well as in two
decomposed short time intervals. Such correlation behavior is also found in
some other bright LAT GRBs, i.e., GRB 080916C, 090902B and 090926A. For these
GRBs as well as GRB 090510, we also find the rapid temporal variability in the
high-energy emission. We thus conclude that the prompt high-energy emission in
these bright LAT GRBs should be due to internal origin.

called circuits, over paths of anonymizing relays. To enable users to connect
to their selected destination servers without waiting for the circuit to be
build, the Tor client maintains a few circuits at all times. Nevertheless, Tor
is slower to use than directly connecting to the destination server. In this
paper, we propose to have the Tor client measure the performance of the
pre-built circuits and select the fastest circuits for users to send their
traffic over. To this end, we define and evaluate nine metrics for selecting
which pre-built circuit to use based on different combinations of circuit
length, Round Trip Time (RTT), and congestion. We also explore the effect on
performance of the number of pre-built circuits at the time of the selection.
Through whole-network experiments in Shadow, we show that using circuit RTT
with at least three pre-built circuits allows the Tor client to identify fast
circuits and improves median time to first byte (TTFB) by 22% over Tor and 15%
over congestion-aware routing, the state-of-the-art in Tor circuit selection.
We evaluate the security of the proposed circuit selection mechanism against
both a relay-level and a network-level adversary and find no loss of security
compared with Tor.
