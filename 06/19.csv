and arrested than white drivers. These disparities may reflect differences in
driving behavior, and are not necessarily the result of bias. In the case of

technique of ""ergodic averaging"" offers no tangible benefits beyond convex
programming, we focus directly on the algorithm's last generated sample (its
""last iterate""), and we show that it converges with probabiility $1$ if the
underlying problem is coherent. We further consider a localized version of
variational coherence which ensures local convergence of stochastic mirror
descent (SMD) with high probability. These results contribute to the landscape
of non-convex stochastic optimization by showing that (quasi-)convexity is not
essential for convergence to a global minimum: rather, variational coherence, a
much weaker requirement, suffices. Finally, building on the above, we reveal an
interesting insight regarding the convergence speed of SMD: in problems with
sharp minima (such as generic linear programs or concave minimization
problems), SMD reaches a minimum point in a finite number of steps (a.s.), even
in the presence of persistent gradient noise. This result is to be contrasted
with existing black-box convergence rate estimates that are only asymptotic.

The dynamics of nonlinear systems may completely change due to perturbations
forcing the solution to jump from a safe state into another, possibly
dangerous, attractor. Such phenomena can not be traced by the widespread local
stability and resilience measures, based on linearizations, accounting only for
arbitrary small perturbations. Using numerical estimates of the size and shape
of the basin of attraction, as well as the systems returntime to the attractor
after given a perturbation, we construct simple nonlocal stability and
resilience measures that record a systems ability to tackle both large and

economic growth, an electro-mechanical system as well as on a stage-structured
population model, and conclude that the suggested measures detect dynamic
behaviour, crucial for a systems stability and resilience, which can be
completely missed by local measures. The presented measures are also easy to

to solve the following $l_p$-minimization ($0<p\leq1$), The purpose of this

  In order to study the equivalence relationship between $l_0$-minimization and

those work only solve the situation when the solution $\breve{x}$ of

to give an analytic expression $p^*$ such that $l_p$-minimization is equivalent

degradation. We introduce the notion of gradient diversity that measures the
dissimilarity between concurrent gradient updates, and show its key role in the
performance of mini-batch SGD. We prove that on problems with high gradient

generalization performance of serial (one sample) SGD. We further establish
lower bounds on convergence where mini-batch SGD slows down beyond a particular

drives the system to a new steady state which can be approximately but

schemes: the classical time-driven and event-driven schemes, and the more
recent hybrid scheme. All three schemes evolve the state of a neuron through a
series of checkpoints: equally spaced in the first scheme and determined
neuron-wise by spike events in the latter two. The time-driven and the hybrid
scheme determine whether the membrane potential of a neuron crosses a threshold
at the end of of the time interval between consecutive checkpoints. Threshold
crossing can, however, occur within the interval even if this test is negative.
Spikes can therefore be missed. The present work derives, implements, and
benchmarks a method for perfect retrospective spike detection. This method can
be applied to neuron models with affine or linear subthreshold dynamics. The
idea behind the method is to propagate the threshold with a time-inverted
dynamics, testing whether the threshold crosses the neuron state to be evolved,
rather than vice versa. Algebraically this translates into a set of
inequalities necessary and sufficient for threshold crossing. This test is
slower than the imperfect one, but faster than an alternative perfect tests
based on bisection or root-finding methods. Comparison confirms earlier results
that the imperfect test rarely misses spikes (less than a fraction $1/10^8$ of
missed spikes) in biologically relevant settings. This study offers an
alternative geometric point of view on neuronal dynamics.

  convolutional deep networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fully convolutional deep neural networks carry out excellent potential for
fast and accurate image segmentation. One of the main challenges in training
these networks is data imbalance, which is particularly problematic in medical
imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where the number of lesion
voxels is often much lower than the number of non-lesion voxels. Training with
unbalanced data can lead to predictions that are severely biased towards high
precision but low recall (sensitivity), which is undesired especially in
medical applications where false negatives are much less tolerable than false
positives. Several methods have been proposed to deal with this problem
including balanced sampling, two step training, sample re-weighting, and
similarity loss functions. In this paper, we propose a generalized loss
function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance and
achieve much better trade-off between precision and recall in training 3D fully
convolutional deep neural networks. Experimental results in multiple sclerosis
lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance images show improved F2 score, Dice
coefficient, and the area under the precision-recall curve in test data. Based
on these results we suggest Tversky loss function as a generalized framework to
effectively train deep neural networks.

processes in atmospheres of different astronomical objects, such as cool stars

molecules like methane must contain billions of transitions, which makes their
direct (line-by-line) application in radiative transfer calculations
impracticable. Here we suggest a new, hybrid line list format to mitigate this
problem, based on the idea of temperature-dependent absorption continuum.
  The line list is partitioned into a large set of relatively weak lines and a
small set of important, stronger lines. The weaker lines are then used either
to construct a temperature-dependent (but pressure-independent) set of
intensity cross sections or are blended into a greatly reduced set of
super-lines. The strong lines are kept in the form of temperature independent
Einstein A coefficients.
  A line list for methane is constructed as a combination of 17 million strong
absorption lines relative to the reference absorption spectra and a background
methane continuum in two temperature-dependent forms, of cross sections and
super-lines. This approach eases the use of large high temperature line lists
significantly as the computationally expensive calculation of pressure
dependent profiles only need to be performed for a relatively small number of
lines. Both the line list and cross sections were generated using a new 34
billion methane line list (34to10), which extends the 10to10 line list to
higher temperatures (up to 2000 K). The new hybrid scheme can be applied to any
large line lists containing billions of transitions. We recommend to use
super-lines generated on a high resolution grid based on resolving power (R =
1,000,000) to model the molecular continuum as a more flexible alternative to
the temperature dependent cross sections.

introducing the concept of an associated reference perturbation theory (APT).
In APT we treat the reference fluid as an associating hard sphere fluid which
transitions to tetrahedral symmetry in the fully hydrogen bonded limit. We
calculate this transition in a theoretically self-consistent manner without

corresponding to the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase of quantum magnets. We show
that the domain-wall carries a 't Hooft anomaly in this case. The anomaly can
be saturated by, e.g., charge-conjugation breaking on the wall or by the domain
wall theory becoming gapless (a gapless model that saturates the anomaly is
$SU(2)_1$ WZW). Either way the fundamental scalar particles (i.e. spinons)
which are confined in the bulk are deconfined on the domain-wall. This
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase can be realized either with spin-1/2 on a rectangular
lattice, or spin-1 on a square lattice. In both cases the domain wall contains
spin-1/2 particles (which are absent in the bulk). We discuss the possible
relation to recent lattice simulations of domain walls in VBS. We further
generalize the discussion to Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olsen (ANO) vortices in a dual
superconductor of the Abelian-Higgs model in 3+1 dimensions, and to the
easy-plane limit of anti-ferromagnets. In the latter case the wall can undergo
a variant of the BKT transition (consistent with the anomalies) while the bulk
is still gapped. The same is true for the easy-axis limit of anti-ferromagnets.

$\mathbf{P}$ is $\epsilon$-far, in total variation distance, from every

problem that has received significant attention in statistics and, more
recently, in theoretical computer science.
  The sample complexity of this general inference task depends on the
underlying family $\mathcal{P}$. The gold standard in distribution property
testing is to design sample-optimal and computationally efficient algorithms
for this task. The main contribution of this work is a simple and general

evaluate the correspondence of audio-visual streams using the learned

surpasses the performance of the existing similar methods for audio-visual
matching which use 3D CNNs for feature representation. We also demonstrate that
an effective pair selection method can significantly increase the performance.

semi-short representation, with dimension exactly $J+1$, a fact that cannot be
seen directly from the $XYZ$ Lagrangian. The third-lowest scalar primary lies
in a long multiplet with dimension $J+2 - c_{-3} \, J^{-3} + O(J^{-4})$, where
$c_{-3}$ is an unknown positive coefficient. The coefficient $c_{-3}$ is
proportional to the leading superconformal interaction term in the effective
theory on moduli space. The positivity of $c_{-3}$ does not follow from
supersymmetry, but rather from unitarity of moduli scattering and the absence
of superluminal signal propagation in the effective dynamics of the complex
modulus. We also prove a general lemma, that scalar semi-short representations
form a module over the chiral ring in a natural way, by ordinary multiplication
of local operators. Combined with the existence of scalar semi-short states at
large $J$, this proves the existence of scalar semi-short states at all values

find that a significant contribution from dark matter decay is always slightly
favored, either to explain the excess below 100 TeV, as in the case of decays
to quarks or, as in the case of neutrino channels, to explain the three

nuclear interior, has been attributed to many factors. E.g., bubble structures
in superheavy (SH) nuclei are believed to be due to the electrostatic
repulsion. In light nuclei, the mechanism has been discussed in terms of shell
effects associated with occupations of s-orbits. The objective of this work is
to reveal mechanisms behind the formation of central depression in nucleonic
densities in light and heavy nuclei. We introduce several measures of the
internal nucleonic density. Through the statistical analysis, we study the
information content of these measures with respect to nuclear matter
properties. We apply nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme functionals.
Using the statistical tools of linear least square regression, we inspect
correlations between various measures of central depression and model
parameters, including nuclear matter properties. We study bivariate
correlations with selected quantities as well as multiple correlations with
groups of parameters. Detailed correlation analysis is carried out for
$^{34}$Si for which a bubble structure has been reported recently, $^{48}$Ca,
and N=82, 126, and 184 isotonic chains. We show that the central depression in
medium-mass nuclei is very sensitive to shell effects, whereas for SH systems
it is firmly driven by the electrostatic repulsion. An appreciable semi-bubble
structure in proton density is predicted for $^{294}$Og, which is currently the
heaviest nucleus known experimentally. Our correlation analysis reveals that
the central density indicators in nuclei below $^{208}$Pb carry little
information on parameters of nuclear matter; they are predominantly driven by
shell structure. On the other hand, in the SH nuclei there exists a clear
relationship between the central nucleonic density and symmetry energy.

scale exist within the CND, which form a ring-like structure with an
unprojected diameter of 9 x 6 arcsec (162pc x 108pc) and a position angle PA =
155deg. Inside the nuclear ring, there are two leading and straight filamentary
structures with lengths of about 30-60pc at PA = 120deg on opposite sides of
the AGN, with a rotational symmetry of 180deg and steeper position-velocity
diagrams, which are interpreted as nuclear shocks due to non-circular motions.
Along the filaments, and unlike other nearby AGNs, several dense molecular
clumps present low HCN/HCO+(4-3) ratios (~0.5). The filaments abruptly end in
the probed transitions at r = 20pc from the AGN, but previous near-IR H2

the form of nuclear spirals, and forming an inner ring structure with another
set of symmetric filaments along the N-S direction and within r = 10pc. The
molecular gas is governed primarily by non-circular motions, being the
successive shock fronts at different scales where loss of angular momentum
occurs, a mechanism which may feed efficiently powerful radio galaxies down to
parsec scales.

high-mass star formation. The HII region RCW 36, located in the Vela molecular
ridge, contains a young star cluster with two O-type stars. We present new CO
observations of RCW 36 with NANTEN2, Mopra, and ASTE using $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0,
2-1, 3-2) and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) line emissions. We have discovered two
molecular clouds lying at the velocities $V_\mathrm{LSR} \sim$5.5 and 9 km
s$^{-1}$. Both clouds are likely to be physically associated with the star
cluster, as verified by the good spatial correspondence among the two clouds,
infrared filaments, and the star cluster. We also found a high intensity ratio
of $\sim$0.6-1.2 for CO $J$ = 3-2 / 1-0 toward both clouds, indicating that the
gas temperature has been increased due to heating by the O-type stars. We
propose that the O-type stars in RCW 36 were formed by a collision between the
two clouds, with a relative velocity separation of 5 km s$^{-1}$. The
complementary spatial distributions and the velocity separation of the two
clouds are in good agreement with observational signatures expected for O-type
star formation triggered by a cloud-cloud collision. We also found a
displacement between the complementary spatial distributions of the two clouds,
which we estimate to be 0.3 pc assuming the collision angle to be 45$^{\circ}$
relative to the line-of-sight. We estimate the collision timescale to be
$\sim$10$^5$ yr. It is probable that the cluster age by Ellerbroek et al.
(2013b) is dominated by the low-mass members which were not formed under the
triggering by cloud-cloud collision, and that the O-type stars in the center of
the cluster are explained by the collisional triggering independently from the
low-mass star formation.

Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a core research task in the development of
personalized healthcare. Patient EHR data consist of sequences of visits over
time, where each visit contains multiple medical codes, including diagnosis,
medication, and procedure codes. The most important challenges for this task
are to model the temporality and high dimensionality of sequential EHR data and
to interpret the prediction results. Existing work solves this problem by
employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and utilizing
simple attention mechanism to interpret the results. However, RNN-based
approaches suffer from the problem that the performance of RNNs drops when the
length of sequences is large, and the relationships between subsequent visits
are ignored by current RNN-based approaches. To address these issues, we
propose {\sf Dipole}, an end-to-end, simple and robust model for predicting
patients' future health information. Dipole employs bidirectional recurrent
neural networks to remember all the information of both the past visits and the
future visits, and it introduces three attention mechanisms to measure the
relationships of different visits for the prediction. With the attention
mechanisms, Dipole can interpret the prediction results effectively. Dipole
also allows us to interpret the learned medical code representations which are
confirmed positively by medical experts. Experimental results on two real world
EHR datasets show that the proposed Dipole can significantly improve the
prediction accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction
approaches and provide clinically meaningful interpretation.

for efficiency purposes. During the mini-batched training process, it is
necessary to pad shorter sentences in a mini-batch to be equal in length to the

that sorting the corpus based on the sentence length before making mini-batches
reduces the amount of padding and increases the processing speed. However,

widely used NMT toolkits implement disparate strategies for doing so, which

mini-batch creation strategies with experiments over two different datasets.

which attaches to a graph the spectrum of its connection Laplacian is
multiplicative. The reason is that the connection Laplacians do tensor under

The strong ring product of two graphs contains both the weak and direct product

the inversion of Stokes profiles. To analyze these vector magnetic fields, we
need first to remove the 180$^\circ$ ambiguity of the transverse components and
correct the projection effect. Then, the vector magnetic field can be served as
the boundary conditions for a force-free field modeling after a proper
preprocessing. The photospheric velocity field can also be derived from a time
sequence of vector magnetic fields. Three-dimensional magnetic field could be
derived and studied with theoretical force-free field models, numerical
nonlinear force-free field models, magnetohydrostatic models, and
magnetohydrodynamic models. Magnetic energy can be computed with
three-dimensional magnetic field models or a time series of vector magnetic
field. The magnetic topology is analyzed by pinpointing the positions of
magnetic null points, bald patches, and quasi-separatrix layers. As a well
conserved physical quantity, magnetic helicity can be computed with various

We detected two velocity molecular components of 12 km s$^{-1}$ velocity
separation, which is continuous over 3 degrees along the plane. In NGC 6334 the
two components show similar two-peaked intensity distributions toward the young
HII regions and are linked by a bridge feature. In NGC 6357 we found spatially
complementary distribution between the two velocity components as well as a
bridge feature in velocity. Based on these results we hypothesize that the two
clouds in the two regions collided with each other in the past few Myr and
triggered formation of the starbursts over $\sim$ 100 pc. We suggest that the
formation of the starbursts happened toward the collisional region of $\sim$
10-pc extents with initial high molecular column densities. For NGC 6334 we
present a scenario which includes spatial variation of the colliding epoch due
to non-uniform cloud separation. The scenario possibly explains the apparent
age difference among the young O stars in NGC 6334 raging from $10^4$ yrs to
$10^6$ yrs; the latest collision happened within $10^5$ yrs toward the youngest
stars in NGC 6334 I(N) and I which exhibit molecular outflows without HII
regions. For NGC 6357 the O stars were formed a few Myrs ago, and the cloud
dispersal by the O stars is significant. We conclude that cloud-cloud collision

continuously monitors a system and sends time-stamped status updates to a
destination. The destination keeps track of the system status through the
received updates. We use the metric Age of Information (AoI), the time that has
elapsed since the last received update was generated, to measure the
""freshness"" of the status information available at the destination. We assume
energy arrives randomly at the sensor according to a Poisson process, and each
status update consumes one unit of energy. Our objective is to design optimal
online status update policies to minimize the long-term average AoI, subject to
the energy causality constraint at the sensor. We consider three scenarios,
i.e., the battery size is infinite, finite, and one unit only, respectively.
  For the infinite battery scenario, we adopt a best-effort uniform status
update policy and show that it minimizes the long-term average AoI. For the
finite battery scenario, we adopt an energy-aware adaptive status update
policy, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the battery size goes
to infinity. For the last scenario where the battery size is one, we first show
that within a broadly defined class of online policies, the optimal policy
should have a renewal structure, i.e., the status update epochs form a renewal
process, and the length of each renewal interval depends on the first energy
arrival over that interval only. We then focus on a renewal interval, and prove
that if the AoI in the system is below a threshold when the first energy
arrives, the sensor should store the energy and hold status update until the
AoI reaches the threshold, otherwise, it updates the status immediately. We
analytically characterize the long-term average AoI under such a
threshold-based policy, and explicitly identify the optimal threshold.

The disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack last year has hit
major Internet companies, causing intermittent service for millions of Internet

becomes challenging to expel these vulnerable devices in the wild.
  Both industry and academia have made great efforts in amending the situation.
However, none of these efforts is simple to deploy, and at the same time
effective in solving the problem. In this work, we design a collaborative
defense strategy to tackle Mirai. Our key idea is to take advantage of human
involvement in the least aggressive way. In particular, at a negotiated time
slot, a customer is required to reboot the compromised device, then a ""white""
Mirai operated by the manufacturer breaks into the clean-state IoT devices
immediately. The ""white"" Mirai expels other malicious Mirai variants, blocks
vulnerable ports, and keeps a heart-beat connection with the server operated by
the manufacturer. Once the heart-beat is lost, the server re-implants the
""white"" Mirai instantly. We have implemented a full prototype of the designed
system, and the results show that our system can evade Mirai attacks
effectively.

to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. These SEI layers

repeated charge/discharge cycles. In this work, density functional theory
(DFT)-based ab-initio calculations are applied to study the initial steps of
the decomposition of the organic electrolyte component ethylene carbonate (EC)
on the (10-14) surface of a layered Li(Nix,Mny,Co1-x-y)O2 (NMC) cathode
crystal, which is commonly used in commercial Li-ion batteries. The effects on
the EC reaction pathway due to dissolved Li+ ions in the electrolyte solution
and different NMC cathode surface terminations containing absorbed hydroxyl -OH
or fluorine -F species are explicitly considered. We predict a very fast
chemical reaction consisting of an EC ring-opening process on the bare cathode
surface, the rate of which is independent of the battery operation voltage.
This EC ring-opening reaction is unavoidable once the cathode material contacts
with the electrolyte because this process is purely chemical rather than
electrochemical in nature. The -OH and -F adsorbed species display a
passivation effect on the surface against the reaction with EC, but the extent
is limited except for the case of -OH bonded to a surface transition metal
atom. Our work implies that the possible rate-limiting steps of the electrolyte
molecule decomposition are the reactions on the decomposed organic products on
the cathode surface rather than on the bare cathode surface.

for branch-and-bound algorithms for the discrete counterparts of these problems
due to the lack of effective warm starts necessary for the efficient solution

  In order to overcome this shortcoming, we reformulate the problem using the
perspective of the quadratic function. The perspective reformulation lends
itself to simple coordinate descent and bisection algorithms utilizing the
simplex method for quadratic programming, which makes the solution methods
amenable to warm starts and suitable for branch-and-bound algorithms. We test

made with the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Ooty Radio Telescope
(ORT) and Long Wavelength Array (LWA). The GMRT observations have been made in
the phased array mode at 148, 234, and 610 MHz and the ORT observations at 327
MHz. The LWA data sets have been obtained from the LWA pulsar data archive. The
broadening of each pulsar as a function of observing frequency provides the
frequency scaling index, $\alpha$. The estimations of $\alpha$ have been
obtained for 39 pulsars, which include entirely new estimates for 31 pulsars.
This study increases the total sample of pulsars available with $\alpha$
estimates by $\sim$50\%. The overall distribution of $\alpha$ with the
dispersion measure (DM) of pulsar shows interesting variations, which are
consistent with the earlier studies. However, for a given value of DM a range
of $\alpha$ values are observed, indicating the characteristic turbulence along
each line of sight. For each pulsar, the estimated level of turbulence,
$C^{2}_{n_e}$, has also been compared with $\alpha$ and DM. Additionally, we
compare the distribution of $\alpha$ with the theoretically predicated model to
infer the general characteristics of the ionized interstellar medium (ISM).
Nearly 65\% of the pulsars show a flatter index (i.e., $\alpha < 4.4$) than
that is expected from the Kolmogorov turbulence model. Moreover, the group of
pulsars having flatter index is typically associated with an enhanced value of
$C^{2}_{n_e}$ than those with steeper index.

However, our understanding of the main neutron source, the 13C(alpha,n)16O

beyond convective borders drives the formation of 13C pockets. However, there
is no agreement on the nature of such mixing and free parameters are present.
By means of a parametric model we investigate the impact of different mixing
functions on the final s-process abundances in low-mass AGB models. Typically,
changing the shape of the mixing function or the mass extent of the region
affected by the mixing produce the same results. Variations in the relative
abundance distribution of the three s-process peaks (Sr, Ba, and Pb) are
generally within +/-0.2 dex, similar to the observational error bars. We
conclude that other stellar uncertainties - the effect of rotation and of
overshoot into the C-O core - play a more important role than the details of
the mixing function. The exception is at low metallicity, where the Pb
abundance is significantly affected. In relation to the composition observed in
stardust SiC grains from AGB stars, the models are relatively close to the data
only when assuming the most extreme variation in the mixing profile.

that mutual gravitational interactions and resonant mechanisms are capable of

conditional lower bounds based on the well-known 3SUM conjecture. Our framework
creates a \emph{compact representation} of an instance of the 3SUM problem
using hashing and domain specific encoding. This compact representation admits
false solutions to the original 3SUM problem instance which we reveal and
eliminate until we find a true solution. In other words, from all
\emph{witnesses} (candidate solutions) we figure out if an \emph{honest} one (a
true solution) exists. This enumeration of witnesses is used to prove
conditional lower bound on \emph{reporting} problems that generate all
witnesses. In turn, these reporting problems are reduced to various decision
problems. These help to enumerate the witnesses by constructing appropriate
search data structures. Hence, 3SUM-hardness of the decision problems is
deduced.
  We utilize this framework to show conditional lower bounds for several
variants of convolutions, matrix multiplication and string problems. Our
framework uses a strong connection between all of these problems and the
ability to find \emph{witnesses}.
  While these specific applications are used to demonstrate the techniques of
our framework, we believe that this novel framework is useful for many other

conditions at energies below a few tens of keV. Radioactive isotopes are
produced via cosmogenic activation in detectors and other materials and those
isotopes constitute a background source which has to be under control. In
particular, tritium is specially relevant due to its decay properties (very low
endpoint energy and long half-life) when induced in the detector medium, and
because it can be generated in any material as a spallation product.
Quantification of cosmogenic production of tritium is not straightforward,
neither experimentally nor by calculations. In this work, a method for the
calculation of production rates at sea level has been developed and applied to
some of the materials typically used as targets in dark matter detectors
(germanium, sodium iodide, argon and neon); it is based on a selected
description of tritium production cross sections over the entire energy range
of cosmic nucleons. Results have been compared to available data in the
literature, either based on other calculations or from measurements. The
obtained tritium production rates, ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of
nuclei per kg and per day at sea level, point to a significant contribution to
the background in dark matter experiments, requiring the application of
specific protocols for target material purification, material storing
underground and limiting the time the detector is on surface during the
building process in order to minimize the exposure to the most dangerous cosmic

quantized scalar field is characterized by a series of modified dispersion
relations along with suitable changes to the standard measure of the density of

considerably, in the case of polymer quantization, due to the specific nature

estimate the corresponding global warming in the northern hemisphere. A simple
1-dimensional model is used that includes the simultaneous increase of the

0.7 +/- 0.2 K is found for the loss of Arctic sea ice in the same time. These
numbers comprise most of the reported mean temperature rise of 1.2 +/- 0.2 K of
the northern hemisphere. The origin of the sea-ice retreat is discussed, e.g.
internal variability or feedback by the CO2 concentration increase. Our data
also suggest a delayed response of the global surface temperature rise to the
loss of sea ice with a time constant of approximately 10 to 20 years.

in a common envelope evolution (CEE) of giant stars substantially reduces the
fraction of the recombination energy of hydrogen and helium that is available
for envelope removal. We base our estimate on the properties of an unperturbed
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) spherical model, and on some simple arguments.
Since during the CEE the envelope expands and energy removal by photon
diffusion becomes more efficient, our arguments underestimate the escape of
recombination energy. We hence strengthen earlier claims that recombination
energy does not contribute much to common envelope removal. A large fraction of
the energy that jets deposit to the envelope, on the other hand, might be in
the form of kinetic energy of the expanding and buoyantly rising hot bubbles.
These rapidly rising bubbles remove mass from the envelope. We demonstrate this
process by conducting a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation where we
deposit hot gas in the location of a secondary star that orbits inside the
envelope of a giant star. Despite the fact that we do not include the large
amount of gravitational energy that is released by the in-spiraling secondary
star, the hot bubbles alone remove mass at a rate of about 0.1 Mo/yr, which is
much above the regular mass loss rate.

sheet, has been recently synthesized. We investigate mechanical properties and
lattice thermal conductivity of borophene via reactive molecular dynamics
simulations. We performed uniaxial tensile strain simulations at room
temperature along in-plane directions, and found 2D elastic moduli of 188 N/m
and 403 N/m along zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. The anisotropy
is attributed to the buckling of the borophene structure along the zigzag
direction. We also performed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to calculate
the lattice thermal conductivity. We predict room-temperature lattice thermal
conductivities of $75.9 \pm 5.0$ W/m-K and $147 \pm 7.3$ W/m-K, respectively,
and estimate effective phonon mean free paths of $16.7 \pm 1.7$ nm and $21.4
\pm 1.0$ nm for the zigzag and armchair directions. The anisotropy is
attributed to differences in the density of states of low-frequency phonons,
with lower group velocities and possibly shorten phonon lifetimes along the
zigzag direction. We also observe that when borophene is strained along the
armchair direction there is a significant increase in thermal conductivity
along that direction. Meanwhile, when the sample is strained along the zigzag
direction there is a much smaller increase in thermal conductivity along that
direction. For a strain of 8\% along the armchair direction the thermal
conductivity increases by a factor of 3.5 (~250\%), whereas for the same amount
of strain along the zigzag direction the increase is only by a factor of 1.2
(~20\%). Our predictions are in agreement with recent first principles results,
at a fraction of the computational cost. The simulations shall serve as a guide

sea quark flavors are conventionally performed using the Rational Hybrid Monte
Carlo (RHMC) algorithm, which computes the square root of the determinant of
$\mathscr{D}^{\dagger} \mathscr{D}$, where $\mathscr{D}$ is the Dirac operator.
The special case of two degenerate quark flavors with the same mass is
described directly by the determinant of $\mathscr{D}^{\dagger} \mathscr{D}$
--- in particular, no square root is necessary --- enabling a variety of
algorithmic developments, which have driven down the cost of simulating the
light (up and down) quarks in the isospin-symmetric limit of equal masses. As a
result, the relative cost of single quark flavors --- such as the strange or
charm --- computed with RHMC has become more expensive. This problem is even
more severe in the context of our measurements of the $\Delta I = 1/2$ $K
\rightarrow \pi \pi$ matrix elements on lattice ensembles with $G$-parity
boundary conditions, since $G$-parity is associated with a doubling of the
number of quark flavors described by $\mathscr{D}$, and thus RHMC is needed for
the isospin-symmetric light quarks as well. In this paper we report on our
implementation of the exact one flavor algorithm (EOFA) introduced by the TWQCD
collaboration for simulations including single flavors of domain wall quarks.
We have developed a new preconditioner for the EOFA Dirac equation, which both
reduces the cost of solving the Dirac equation and allows us to re-use the bulk
of our existing high-performance code. Coupling these improvements with careful
tuning of our integrator, the time per accepted trajectory in the production of
our 2+1 flavor $G$-parity ensembles with physical pion and kaon masses has been
decreased by a factor of 4.2.

primarily on materials or heterostructures containing 5$d$ or 6$p$ heavy
elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here we show that a paramagnetic CoGa
compound possesses large enough spin Hall angle to allow robust SOT switching
of perpendicularly-magnetized ferrimagnetic MnGa films in CoGa/MnGa/Oxide
heterostructures. The spin Hall efficiency estimated via spin Hall
magnetoresistance and harmonic Hall measurements is +0.05$\pm$0.01, which is
surprisingly large for a system that does not contain any heavy metal element.
First-principles calculations corroborate our experimental observations and
suggest that the hybridized Co 3$d$ - Ga 4$p$ orbitals along R-X in the

efficient spin current generation can be realized in intermetallic by alloying
a transition metal with a $p$-orbital element and by Fermi level tuning.

polynomial time lower bounds on algorithms for solving various well-known
problems. A useful technique for showing such lower bounds is to prove them
conditionally based on well-studied hardness assumptions such as 3SUM, APSP,
SETH, etc. This line of research helps to obtain a better understanding of the
complexity inside P.
  A related question asks to prove conditional space lower bounds on data
structures that are constructed to solve certain algorithmic tasks after an
initial preprocessing stage. This question received little attention in
previous research even though it has potential strong impact.
  In this paper we address this question and show that surprisingly many of the
well-studied hard problems that are known to have conditional polynomial time
lower bounds are also hard when concerning space. This hardness is shown as a
tradeoff between the space consumed by the data structure and the time needed
to answer queries. The tradeoff may be either smooth or admit one or more
singularity points.
  We reveal interesting connections between different space hardness
conjectures and present matching upper bounds. We also apply these hardness
conjectures to both static and dynamic problems and prove their conditional
space hardness.
  We believe that this novel framework of polynomial space conjectures can play
an important role in expressing polynomial space lower bounds of many important
algorithmic problems. Moreover, it seems that it can also help in achieving a
better understanding of the hardness of their corresponding problems in terms
of time.

interest or memorability for visual search and information retrieval. This
paper argues that image interest is often domain and user specific, and that
efficient mechanisms for learning about this domain-specific image interest as
quickly as possible, while limiting the amount of data-labelling required, are
often more useful to end-users. This work uses pairwise image comparisons to
reduce the labelling burden on these users, and introduces an image interest
estimation approach that performs similarly to recent data hungry deep learning
approaches trained using pairwise ranking losses. Here, we use a Gaussian
process model to interpolate image interest inferred using a Bayesian ranking
approach over image features extracted using a pre-trained convolutional neural
network. Results show that fitting a Gaussian process in high-dimensional image
feature space is not only computationally feasible, but also effective across a
broad range of domains. The proposed probabilistic interest estimation approach
produces image interests paired with uncertainties that can be used to identify
images for which additional labelling is required and measure inference
convergence, allowing for sample efficient active model training. Importantly,
the probabilistic formulation allows for effective visual search and
information retrieval when limited labelling data is available.

period of extremely low solar activity from 2009 April to July. For all flares
we measured the temperature of the plasma in the isothermal and two-temperature
approximations and tried to fit its relationship with the X-ray class using
exponential and power-law functions. We found that the whole temperature
distribution in the range from A0.01 to X-class cannot be fit by one
exponential function. The fitting for weak flares below A1.0 is significantly
steeper than that for medium and large flares. The power-law approximation
seems to be more reliable: the corresponding functions were found to be in good
agreement with experimental data both for microflares and for normal flares.
Our study predicts that the evidence of plasma heating can be found in flares
starting from the A0.0002 X-ray class. Weaker events presumably cannot heat the
surrounding plasma. We also estimated emission measures for all flares studied

is seen as made of quarks and gluons, one cannot decompose its mass into more
than two contributions without running into trouble with the consistency of the

anomaly contributions appear to be purely conventional. Based on the current

The particular scenario is analyzed in which a common message has to be
broadcast to two legitimate receivers, while keeping an external eavesdropper
ignorant of it. The transmitter shares independent secret keys of sufficiently
high rates with both legitimate receivers, which can be used in different ways:
they can be used as one-time pads to encrypt the common message, as fictitious
messages for wiretap coding, or as a hybrid of these. In this paper, capacity
results are established when the broadcast channels involving the three
receivers are degraded. If both legitimate channels are degraded versions of
the eavesdropper's channel, it is shown that the one-time pad approach is
optimal for several cases, yielding corresponding capacity expressions.
Alternatively, the wiretap coding approach is shown to be optimal if the
eavesdropper's channel is degraded with respect to both legitimate channels,
establishing capacity in this case as well. If the eavesdropper's channel is
neither the strongest nor the weakest, an intricate scheme that carefully
combines both concepts of one-time pad and wiretap coding with fictitious
messages turns out to be capacity-achieving. Finally we also obtain some
results for the general non-degraded broadcast channel.

the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current

ASTE telescopes. We found two clouds with the velocity ranges of 0-10 km

10$^{4}$ Msun has a morphology similar to the ring-like structure observed in
the infrared wavelengths, the latter cloud with the mass of ~10$^{3}$ Msun,
which has not been recognized by previous observations, distributes just likely
to cover the bubble enclosed by the other cloud. The high-mass star with the
spectral types of O8.5V is located near the boundary of the two clouds. The

in the neighborhood of the high-mass star, suggesting that these clouds are

relative velocity between the two clouds (~5 km s$^{-1}$), the collisional time

in a continuous magnetic system, which have been proposed as a new kind of
information carrier for spin-based low power applications. For this purpose, a
major obstacle to overcome is the energy-efficient excitation of coherent short
wavelength spin waves and alternatives to excitation via the Oersted field of
an alternating current need to be explored. Here we show, by means of
micromagnetic simulations, how, in a perpendicularly magnetized thin strip, a
domain wall pinned at a geometrical constriction emits spin waves when forced
to rotate by the application of a low direct current flowing along the strip.
Spin waves propagate only in the direction of the electron's flow at the first
odd harmonic of the domain wall rotation frequency for which propagation is
allowed. Excitation is due to in-plane dipolar stray field of the rotating
domain wall and that the resulting unidirectionality is a consequence of the
domain wall displacement at the constriction. On the other hand, the
application of an external field opposing domain wall depinning breaks the
symmetry for spin wave propagation in the two domains, allowing emission in
both directions but at different frequencies. The results presented define a
new approach to produce tunable high frequency spin wave emitters of easy
fabrication and low power consumption.

Results of our first principles study suggest that the ground state of

$\mu_\text{B}$ on the Fe site. The FM ground state is lower than the
anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) state by 8.44 meV and non-magnetic(NM) state by 191

claim that $\zeta$-Fe$_2$N undergoes an AFM transition below 10K and others
which do not observe any magnetic transition up to 4.2K. We argue that the

propose the presence of competing FM and AFM superexchange interactions between
Fe sites mediated by nitrogen atoms, which are consistent with
Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. We find that the anti-ferromagnetically

$\tau$ and the Debye length $\delta$ are made explicit. In our analysis the
mean free path covers the full range of possible values: from the regime of
evanescent collisions $\tau\to\infty$ to the strongly collisional regime
$\tau\to0$. As a counterpart, the largeness of the Debye length, that enforces
a weakly nonlinear regime, is used to close our nonlinear estimates.
Accordingly we pay a special attention to relax as much as possible the
$\tau$-dependent constraint on $\delta$ ensuring exponential decay with
explicit $\tau$-dependent rates towards the stationary solution. In the
strongly collisional limit $\tau\to0$, we also examine all possible asymptotic
regimes selected by a choice of observation time scale. Here also, our emphasis
is on strong convergence, uniformity with respect to time and to initial data
in bounded sets of a $L^2$ space. Our proofs rely on a detailed study of the
nonlinear elliptic equation defining stationary solutions and a careful
tracking and optimization of parameter dependencies of
hypocoercive/hypoelliptic estimates.

degenerate spiral ground-states and topological paramagnetism. Compared to
other three-dimensional networks of magnetic ions, such as the geometrically
frustrated pyrochlore lattice, the investigation of diamond-lattice magnetism
in real materials is less mature. In this work, we characterize the magnetic
properties of model A-site spinels CoRh2O4 (cobalt rhodite) and CuRh2O4 (copper

perform group theory analysis, Rietveld refinement, mean-field theory, and spin
wave theory calculations to analyze the experimental results. Our investigation
reveals that cubic CoRh2O4 is a canonical S=3/2 diamond-lattice Heisenberg
antiferromagnet with a nearest neighbor exchange J = 0.63 meV and a Neel
ordered ground-state below a temperature of 25 K. In tetragonally distorted
CuRh2O4, competiting exchange interactions between up to third nearest-neighbor
spins lead to the development of an incommensurate spin helix at 24 K with a
magnetic propagation vector k = (0,0,0.79). Strong reduction of the ordered
moment is observed for the S=1/2 spins in CuRh2O4 and captured by our 1/S
corrections to the staggered magnetization. Our work identifies CoRh2O4 and
CuRh2O4 as reference materials to guide future work searching for exotic

Rayleigh-Benard convection by multiplicative noise -- called stochastic
advection by Lie transport (SALT) noise and fluctuation-dissipation (FD) noise
-- are found to produce qualitatively different effects, possibly because the
total phase-space volume contraction rates are different. In the process of
making this comparison between effects of SALT and FD noise on the Lorenz 63
system, a stochastic version of a robust deterministic numerical algorithm for
obtaining the individual numerical Lyapunov exponents was developed. With this
stochastic version of the algorithm, the value of the sum of the Lyapunov
exponents for the FD noise was found to differ significantly from the value of
the deterministic Lorenz 63 system, whereas the SALT noise preserves the Lorenz
63 value with high accuracy. The Lagrangian averaged version of the SALT
equations (LA SALT) is found to yield a closed deterministic subsystem for the
expected solutions which is found to be isomorphic to the original Lorenz 63
dynamical system. The solutions of the closed chaotic subsystem, in turn, drive
a linear stochastic system for the fluctuations of the LA SALT solutions around
their expected values.

interference (ISI) channels with a given metric decoding rule. Specifically, it
is assumed that the mismatched decoder has an incorrect assumption on the
impulse response function. The mismatch capacity is the highest achievable rate
for a given decoding rule. Existing lower bounds to the mismatch capacity for
channels and decoding metrics with memory (as in our model) are presented only
in the form of multi-letter expressions that have not been calculated in

this paper, we derive computable single-letter lower bounds to the mismatch

are based on two ensembles, the ensemble of codewords generated by an
autoregressive process, and the ensemble of codewords drawn uniformly over a
""type class"" of real-valued sequences. Computation of our achievable rates
demonstrates non-trivial behavior of the achievable rates as a function of the
mismatched parameters. As a simple application of our technique, we derive also
the random coding exponent associated with a mismatched decoder which assumes
that there is no ISI at all. Finally, we compare our results with universal

methods work fine for a large slip length coefficient but lead to conditioning
and stability issues when it approaches zero. We introduce a novel method for
the weak imposition of the generalized Navier condition which remains
well-posed and stable for arbitrary choice of slip length, including zero. The
method proposed here builds on the formulation done by [1]. They impose a Robin
condition for the Poisson problem by means of Nitsche's method for an arbitrary
combination of the Dirichlet and Neumann parts of the condition. The analysis
conducted for the proposed method is done in a similar fashion as in [2], but
is done here for a more general type of boundary condition. The analysis proves
stability for all flow regimes and all choices of slip lengths. Also an
L2-optimal estimate for the velocity error is shown, which was not conducted in
the previously mentioned work. A numerical example is carried out for varying
slip lengths to verify the robustness and stability of the method with respect

perform different motor tasks. Suitable configurations including up to 128
electrode sites allow the recording of task-related neuronal signals. Probes
with 32 and 64 electrode sites were implanted in the posterior parietal cortex.
Local field potentials and multi-unit activity were recorded as early as one
hour after implantation. Stable single-unit activity was achieved for up to 26
days after implantation of a 64-channel probe. All recorded signals showed
modulation during task execution. With the novel probes it is possible to
record stable biologically relevant data over a time span exceeding the usual
time needed for epileptic focus localization in human patients. This is the
first time that single units are recorded along cylindrical polyimide probes
chronically implanted 22 mm deep into the brain of a monkey, which suggests the
potential usefulness of this probe for human applications.

  from the theory of scale relativity",,"Phys. Dark Univ. 22, 80 (2018)",,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using Nottale's theory of scale relativity, we derive a generalized
Schr\""odinger equation applying to dark matter halos. This equation involves a
logarithmic nonlinearity associated with an effective temperature and a source
of dissipation. Fundamentally, this wave equation arises from the
nondifferentiability of the trajectories of the dark matter particles whose
origin may be due to ordinary quantum mechanics, classical ergodic (or almost
ergodic) chaos, or to the fractal nature of spacetime at the cosmic scale. The
generalized Schr\""odinger equation involves a coefficient ${\cal D}$, possibly
different from $\hbar/2m$, whose value for dark matter halos is ${\cal
D}=1.02\times 10^{23}\, {\rm m^2/s}$. We suggest that the cold dark matter
crisis may be solved by the fractal (nondifferentiable) structure of spacetime
at the cosmic scale, or by the chaotic motion of the particles on a very long
timescale, instead of ordinary quantum mechanics. The equilibrium states of the
generalized Schr\""odinger equation correspond to configurations with a
core-halo structure. The quantumlike potential generates a solitonic core that
solves the cusp problem of the classical cold dark matter model. The
logarithmic nonlinearity accounts for the presence of an isothermal halo that
leads to flat rotation curves. The damping term ensures that the system relaxes
towards an equilibrium state. This property is guaranteed by an $H$-theorem
satisfied by a Boltzmann-like free energy functional. In our approach, the
temperature and the friction arise from a single formalism. They correspond to
the real and imaginary parts of the complex friction coefficient present in the
scale covariant equation of dynamics that is at the basis of Nottale's theory
of scale relativity.

subexponential time, i.e. not solvable in O(c^n) time for arbitrary c > 1,
where n denotes the number of variables. Problems like k-SAT can be viewed as
special cases of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which is the
problem of determining whether a set of constraints is satisfiable. In this
paper we study thef worst-case time complexity of NP-complete CSPs. Our main
interest is in the CSP problem parameterized by a constraint language Gamma
(CSP(Gamma)), and how the choice of Gamma affects the time complexity. It is
believed that CSP(Gamma) is either tractable or NP-complete, and the algebraic
CSP dichotomy conjecture gives a sharp delineation of these two classes based
on algebraic properties of constraint languages. Under this conjecture and the
ETH, we first rule out the existence of subexponential algorithms for
finite-domain NP-complete CSP(Gamma) problems. This result also extends to
certain infinite-domain CSPs and structurally restricted CSP(Gamma) problems.
We then begin a study of the complexity of NP-complete CSPs where one is
allowed to arbitrarily restrict the values of individual variables, which is a
very well-studied subclass of CSPs. For such CSPs with finite domain D, we
identify a relation SD such that (1) CSP({SD}) is NP-complete and (2) if
CSP(Gamma) over D is NP-complete and solvable in O(c^n) time, then CSP({SD}) is
solvable in O(c^n) time, too. Hence, the time complexity of CSP({SD}) is a
lower bound for all CSPs of this particular kind. We also prove that the
complexity of CSP({SD}) is decreasing when |D| increases, unless the ETH is
false. This implies, for instance, that for every c>1 there exists a
finite-domain Gamma such that CSP(Gamma) is NP-complete and solvable in O(c^n)
time.

remnant FRII radio galaxies to confront models of remnant lobe evolution, and
provide guidance for further investigation of remnant radio galaxies. We find
that fewer than 2$\%$ of FRII radio galaxies with S$_{ \rm74~MHz} > 1.5$ Jy are
candidate ultra-steep spectrum remnants, where we define ultra-steep spectrum
as $\alpha_{\rm 74~MHz}^{\rm 1400~MHz} > 1.2$. Our Monte-Carlo simulations
demonstrate that models involving Sedov-like expansion in the remnant phase,
resulting in rapid adiabatic energy losses, are consistent with this upper
limit, and predict the existence of nearly twice as many remnants with normal
(not ultra-steep) spectra in the observed frequency range as there are
ultra-steep spectrum remnants. This model also predicts an ultra-steep remnant
fraction approaching 10$\%$ at redshifts $z < 0.5$. Importantly, this model
implies the lobes remain over-pressured with respect to the ambient medium well
after their active lifetime, in contrast with existing observational evidence
that many FRII radio galaxy lobes reach pressure equilibrium with the external
medium whilst still in the active phase. The predicted age distribution of
remnants is a steeply decreasing function of age. In other words young remnants
are expected to be much more common than old remnants in flux limited samples.
For this reason, incorporating higher frequency data $\gtrsim 5$ GHz will be of
great benefit to future studies of the remnant population.

Vector Machine (SVM), inspired on the re-weighted Lasso algorithm of Cand\`es
et al. and on the equivalence between Lasso and SVM shown recently by Jaggi. In
particular, the margin required for each training vector is set independently,
defining a new weighted SVM model. These weights are selected to be binary, and
they are automatically adapted during the training of the model, resulting in a
variation of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm with essentially the same
computational complexity as the original algorithm. As shown experimentally,
this algorithm is computationally cheaper to apply since it requires less
iterations to converge, and it produces models with a sparser representation in
terms of support vectors and which are more stable with respect to the
selection of the regularization hyper-parameter.

jump-diffusion model, Attari's formula is the only Fourier-based method that
does not blow up for any Variance Gamma parameter values. In terms of speed,
the use of strike vector computations significantly improves the computational

case when the variables can be grouped into K clusters with exchangeable
dependence; this assumption is often made in applications, e.g., in finance and

The corresponding block-structured estimator performs considerably better than
the sample Kendall rank correlation matrix when K < d. The new estimator can
also be much more efficient in finite samples even in the unstructured case K =

is elliptical, the results extend to linear correlation matrices and their
inverses. The procedure is illustrated on financial stock returns.

  Universal Algebra",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A kernelization algorithm for a computational problem is a procedure which
compresses an instance into an equivalent instance whose size is bounded with
respect to a complexity parameter. For the Boolean satisfiability problem
(SAT), and the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), there exist many results
concerning upper and lower bounds for kernelizability of specific problems, but
it is safe to say that we lack general methods to determine whether a given SAT
problem admits a kernel of a particular size. This could be contrasted to the
currently flourishing research program of determining the classical complexity
of finite-domain CSP problems, where almost all non-trivial tractable classes
have been identified with the help of algebraic properties. In this paper, we
take an algebraic approach to the problem of characterizing the kernelization
limits of NP-hard SAT and CSP problems, parameterized by the number of
variables. Our main focus is on problems admitting linear kernels, as has,
somewhat surprisingly, previously been shown to exist. We show that a CSP
problem has a kernel with O(n) constraints if it can be embedded (via a domain
extension) into a CSP problem which is preserved by a Maltsev operation. We
also study extensions of this towards SAT and CSP problems with kernels with
O(n^c) constraints, c>1, based on embeddings into CSP problems preserved by a
k-edge operation, k > c. These results follow via a variant of the celebrated
few subpowers algorithm. In the complementary direction, we give indication
that the Maltsev condition might be a complete characterization of SAT problems
with linear kernels, by showing that an algebraic condition that is shared by
all problems with a Maltsev embedding is also necessary for the existence of a
linear kernel unless NP is included in co-NP/poly.

significantly from the existing ones in that: (1) All foreground object classes
are modelled jointly in a single generative model that encodes multiple object
co-existence so that ""explaining away"" inference can resolve ambiguity and lead
to better learning and localisation. (2) Image backgrounds are shared across
classes to better learn varying surroundings and ""push out"" objects of
interest. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly labelled and
unlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on the Internet
to be exploited for learning. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation enables the
exploitation of various types of prior knowledge to compensate for the limited
supervision offered by weakly labelled data, as well as Bayesian domain
adaptation for transfer learning. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC,
ImageNet and YouTube-Object videos datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our Bayesian joint model for weakly supervised object localisation.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization studies. The SMB we use is
composed of fourteen yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) disks and a contiguous
neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) ring magnet. The motor is a hollow-shaft motor
because the HWP is ultimately installed in the rotor. The motor presented here
has a 100 mm diameter rotor aperture. However, the design can be scaled up to
rotor aperture diameters of approximately 500 mm. Our motor system is composed
of four primary subsystems: (i) the rotor assembly, which includes the NdFeB
ring magnet, (ii) the stator assembly, which includes the YBCO disks, (iii) an
incremental encoder, and (iv) the drive electronics. While the YBCO is cooling
through its superconducting transition, the rotor is held above the stator by a
novel hold and release mechanism (HRM). The encoder subsystem consists of a
custom-built encoder disk read out by two fiber optic readout sensors. For the
demonstration described in this paper, we ran the motor at 50 K and tested
rotation frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz. The feedback system was able to
stabilize the the rotation speed to approximately 0.4%, and the measured rotor
orientation angle uncertainty is less than 0.15 deg. Lower temperature

be expressed as the difference of two relative entropies that depend on an
auxiliary distribution, a relation sometimes referred to as the golden formula.
This paper is concerned with a finite-blocklength extension of this relation.
This extension consists of two elements: 1) a finite-blocklength channel-coding
converse bound by Polyanskiy and Verd\'{u} (2014), which involves the ratio of
two Neyman-Pearson $\beta$ functions (beta-beta converse bound); and 2) a novel
beta-beta channel-coding achievability bound, expressed again as the ratio of
two Neyman-Pearson $\beta$ functions.
  To demonstrate the usefulness of this finite-blocklength extension of the
golden formula, the beta-beta achievability and converse bounds are used to
obtain a finite-blocklength extension of Verd\'{u}'s (2002) wideband-slope
approximation. The proof parallels the derivation of the latter, with the
beta-beta bounds used in place of the golden formula.
  The beta-beta (achievability) bound is also shown to be useful in cases where
the capacity-achieving output distribution is not a product distribution due
to, e.g., a cost constraint or structural constraints on the codebook, such as
orthogonality or constant composition. As an example, the bound is used to
characterize the channel dispersion of the additive exponential-noise channel
and to obtain a finite-blocklength achievability bound (the tightest to date)
for multiple-input multiple-output Rayleigh-fading channels with perfect
channel state information at the receiver.

cryptographic computations, from general purpose computations, or from the
kernel. This leakage even persists across all common isolation boundaries, such
as processes, containers, and virtual machines. Microarchitectural fault
attacks exploit the physical imperfections of modern computer systems.
Shrinking process technology introduces effects between isolated hardware
elements that can be exploited by attackers to take control of the entire
system. These attacks are especially interesting in scenarios where the
attacker is unprivileged or even sandboxed.
  In this thesis, we focus on microarchitectural attacks and defenses on
commodity systems. We investigate known and new side channels and show that
microarchitectural attacks can be fully automated. Furthermore, we show that
these attacks can be mounted in highly restricted environments such as
sandboxed JavaScript code in websites. We show that microarchitectural attacks
exist on any modern computer system, including mobile devices (e.g.,
smartphones), personal computers, and commercial cloud systems. This thesis
consists of two parts. In the first part, we provide background on modern

that the memory faithfully reproduces the input state with average fidelity

non-collinear orientation of neighboring spins. It has been shown that material
systems with high DMI can lead to very efficient domain wall and skyrmion
motion by spin-orbit torques. To engineer such devices, it is important to
quantify the DMI for a given material system. Here we extract the DMI at the
Heavy Metal (HM) /Ferromagnet (FM) interface using two complementary
measurement schemes namely asymmetric domain wall motion and the magnetic
stripe annihilation. By using the two different measurement schemes, we find

0.73 +/- 0.5 mJ/m2, respectively. Furthermore, we show that this DMI stabilizes
skyrmions at room temperature and that there is a strong dependence of the DMI

higher deposition rate leads to a more uniform film with reduced pinning and

two magnonic and two electronic reservoirs, but we also present results for
some specific situations, where only two or three reservoirs are effectively
connected to the dot. The main objective is the analysis of the conversion of
magnon current to electronic spin and charge currents, and {\it vice versa}. We
consider the limiting case of large Coulomb energy in the dot (Coulomb
blockade), as well as the case when the Coulomb energy is finite and double
occupancy is allowed.

recently, to predict the object class and attributes of the search target. In
this work, we go one step further and investigate the feasibility of combining
recent advances in encoding human gaze information using deep convolutional
neural networks with the power of generative image models to visually decode,
i.e. create a visual representation of, the search target. Such visual decoding
is challenging for two reasons: 1) the search target only resides in the user's
mind as a subjective visual pattern, and can most often not even be described
verbally by the person, and 2) it is, as of yet, unclear if gaze fixations
contain sufficient information for this task at all. We show, for the first
time, that visual representations of search targets can indeed be decoded only
from human gaze fixations. We propose to first encode fixations into a semantic
representation and then decode this representation into an image. We evaluate
our method on a recent gaze dataset of 14 participants searching for clothing
in image collages and validate the model's predictions using two human studies.

supported by a gas flow passing through it from below. When fluidised materials
flow down an incline, the dynamics of the motion differ from their
non-fluidised counterparts because the granular agitation is no longer required
to support the weight of the flowing layer. Instead, the weight is borne by the
imposed gas flow and this leads to a greatly increased flow mobility. In this
paper, a framework is developed to model this two phase motion by incorporating
a kinetic theory description for the particulate stresses generated by the
flow. In addition to calculating numerical solutions for fully developed flows,
it is shown that for sufficiently thick flows there is often a local balance
between the production and dissipation of the granular temperature. This
phenomenon permits an asymptotic reduction of the full governing equations and
the identification of a simple state in which the volume fraction of the flow
is uniform. The results of the model are compared with new experimental
measurements of the internal velocity profiles of steady granular flows down
slopes. The distance covered with time by unsteady granular flows down slopes
and along horizontal surfaces and their shapes are also measured and compared
with theoretical predictions developed for flows that are thin relative to
their streamwise extent. For the horizontal flows, it was found that resistance
from the sidewalls was required in addition to basal resistance to capture
accurately the unsteady evolution of the front position and the depth of the
current and for situations in which side-wall drag dominates, similarity
solutions are found for the experimentally-measured motion.

experiment intends to investigate the neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe,
and therefore requires a severe suppression of potential backgrounds. An
extensive material screening and selection process was undertaken to quantify
the radioactivity of the materials used in the experiment. Separate energy and
tracking readout planes using different sensors allow us to combine the
measurement of the topological signature of the event for background
discrimination with the energy resolution optimization. The design of radiopure
readout planes, in direct contact with the gas detector medium, was especially
challenging since the required components typically have activities too large
for experiments demanding ultra-low background conditions. After studying the
tracking plane, here the radiopurity control of the energy plane is presented,
mainly based on gamma-ray spectroscopy using ultra-low background germanium
detectors at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (Spain). All the
available units of the selected model of photomultiplier have been screened
together with most of the components for the bases, enclosures and windows.
According to these results for the activity of the relevant radioisotopes, the
selected components of the energy plane would give a contribution to the
overall background level in the region of interest of at most 2.4 x 10-4 counts
keV-1 kg-1 y-1, satisfying the sensitivity requirements of the NEXT experiment.

observed by magnetization measurement. Since there is an unknown positive
background and the diamagnetic volume is too small, it is insufficient to

addition of so-called Cosmic Noise of 2.4 mas to find an acceptable 5-parameter
stochastic solution. We find that a measure of radio Cosmic Noise should also

uncertainty. Combining the 2007 HIAD with the proper motions based solely on
the radio positions leads to a parallax of $\pi = 5.27\pm 0.78$ mas
($190^{+33}_{-25}$ pc), smaller than the Hipparcos 2007 value of $6.56\pm 0.83$

observations of the free-free emission in the extended atmosphere of the M2
spectral-type supergiant Betelgeuse. The spatial resolution of 14 mas
exquisitely resolves the atmosphere, revealing it to have a mean temperature of
2760 K at $\sim$1.3 R$_{\star}$, which is below both the photospheric effective
temperature ($T_{\textrm{eff}} = 3690$ K) and the temperatures at $\sim$$2
$R$_{\star}$. This is unambiguous proof for the existence of an inversion of
the mean temperature in the atmosphere of a red supergiant. The emission is
clearly not spherically symmetric with two notable deviations from a uniform
disk detected in both the images and visibilities. The most prominent asymmetry
is located in the north-east quadrant of the disk and is spatially resolved
showing it to be highly elongated with an axis-ratio of 2.4 and occupying
$\sim$$5\%$ of the disk projected area. Its temperature is approximately 1000 K
above the measured mean temperature at 1.3 R$_{\star}$. The other main
asymmetry is located on the disk limb almost due east of the disk center and
occupies $\sim$$3\%$ of the disk projected area. Both emission asymmetries are
clear evidence for localized heating taking place in the atmosphere of
Betelgeuse. We suggest that the detected localized heating is related to
magnetic activity generated by large-scale photospheric convection.

coherence (rPDC) is a frequency-domain representation of the concept of Granger
causality while directed partial correlation (DPC) is an alternative approach
for quantifying Granger causality in the time domain. Both methodologies have
been successfully applied to neurophysiological signals for detecting directed
relationships. This paper introduces their application to climatological time
series. We first discuss the application to ENSO -- Monsoon interaction, and
then apply the methodologies to the more challenging air-sea interaction in the
South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). While in the first case the results
obtained are fully consistent with present knowledge in climate modeling, in
the second case the results are, as expected, less clear, and to fully
elucidate the SACZ air-sea interaction, further investigations on the
specificity and sensitivity of these methodologies are needed.

robot for small diameter pipes. The robot consists of a kinematic chain of 3
OmniCrawler modules with a link connected in between 2 adjacent modules via
compliant joints. While the tank-like crawler mechanism provides good traction
on low friction surfaces, its circular cross-section makes it holonomic. The
holonomic motion assists it to re-align in a direction to avoid obstacles
during motion as well as overcome turns with a minimal energy posture.
Additionally, the modularity enables it to negotiate T-junction without motion
singularity. The compliance is realized using 4 torsion springs incorporated in
joints joining 3 modules with 2 links. For a desirable pipe diameter (\text{\O}
75mm), the springs' stiffness values are obtained by formulating a constraint
optimization problem which has been simulated in ADAMS MSC and further
validated on a real robot prototype. In order to negotiate smooth vertical
bends and friction coefficient variations in pipes, the design was later
modified by replacing springs with series elastic actuators (SEA) at 2 of the 4
joints.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1706.04368",,,,"cs.DS cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Independent Cascade Model (ICM) is a widely studied model that aims to
capture the dynamics of the information diffusion in social networks and in
general complex networks. In this model, we can distinguish between active
nodes which spread the information and inactive ones. The process starts from a
set of initially active nodes called seeds. Recursively, currently active nodes
can activate their neighbours according to a probability distribution on the
set of edges. After a certain number of these recursive cycles, a large number
of nodes might become active. The process terminates when no further node gets
activated. Starting from the work of Domingos and Richardson, several studies
have been conducted with the aim of shaping a given diffusion process so as to
maximize the number of activated nodes at the end of the process. One of the
most studied problems has been formalized by Kempe et al. and consists in
finding a set of initial seeds that maximizes the expected number of active
nodes under a budget constraint. In this paper we study a generalization of the
problem of Kempe et al. in which we are allowed to spend part of the budget to
create new edges incident to the seeds. That is, the budget can be spent to buy
seeds or edges according to a cost function. The problem does not admin a PTAS,
unless $P=NP$. We propose two approximation algorithms: the former one gives an
approximation ratio that depends on the edge costs and increases when these
costs are high; the latter algorithm gives a constant approximation guarantee
which is greater than that of the first algorithm when the edge costs can be
small.

sensitivity for the mass ordering and octant of atmospheric mixing angle
$\theta_{23}$ within 3$\sigma$ range of oscillation parameters, in the context
of three long base line (LBL) accelerator experiments viz. UNO, DUNE and
NO$\nu$A.
  We notice that on the basis of quantitative sensitivity pertaining to the
event rate, it is possible to investigate the mass ordering within all
experiments. Conclusively, like NO$\nu$A and DUNE experiments, UNO experiment
stands as better alternative for investigating mass ordering, especially when
we need to cross check the results at higher beam energies and base line
lengths.
  We observe that discrete solutions viz. {\it wrong octant-right
$\delta_{CP}$, wrong octant-wrong $\delta_{CP}$} and {\it right octant-wrong
$\delta_{CP}$} and continuous solutions arising due to submergence of discrete
solutions with true solution are possible up to 3$\sigma$ level. It is UNO
experiment that alone have the potential to remove these discrete solutions,
while both NO$\nu$A and DUNE experiments have very poor tendency to remove
these discrete solutions especially near the maximal mixing. We find that these
discrete solutions can be resolved up to 3$\sigma$ level by the combined
NO$\nu$A+DUNE+UNO data set, at all multiple degenerate solutions in the true
parameter space considered under the study. Though replacing half the neutrino
run with antineutrino run introduces qualitative advantage because of their
different dependences on $\delta_{CP}$, but due to lower cross section and
reduction in the statistics, addition of antineutrino data make the precision
worse. Thus considering experimental data only in the neutrino mode, enhances
$\delta_{CP}$ and $\theta_{23}$ precision significantly.

the inductive bias of our algorithms. We measure performance not based on the
recovery of the hidden similarity function, but instead on how well we classify
each item. We give tight bounds on the number of misclassifications. We provide
two algorithms. The first algorithm SACA is a simple agglomerative clustering

been validated under the ultra-strong magnetic field. It is aggravating the
existing serious qualms about the Eotvos experiment. According to the
electromagnetic and gravitational theory described with the complex octonions,
the ultra-strong magnetic field must result in a tiny variation of the
gravitational mass. The magnetic field with the gradient distribution will
generate the energy gradient. These influencing factors will exert an influence
on the state of equilibrium in the Eotvos experiment. That is, the
gravitational mass will depart from the inertial mass to a certain extent, in
the ultra-strong magnetic fields. Only under exceptional circumstances,
especially in the case of the weak field strength, the gravitational mass may
be equal to the inertial mass approximately. The paper appeals intensely to
validate the Eotvos experiment in the ultra-strong electromagnetic strengths.
It is predicted that the physical property of gravitational mass will be
distinct from that of inertial mass.

proton density in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the
galactocentric distance while the density in the central region of the Galaxy

Fermi-LAT data suggest a gradual spectral softening while moving outward from
the center of the Galaxy to its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge
for standard calculations of CR propagation based on assuming a uniform
diffusion coefficient within the Galactic volume. Here we present a model of
non-linear CR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and
advection off self-generated turbulence. We will show that for a realistic
distribution of CR sources following the spatial distribution of supernova

that pedestrians will be standing upright with respect to the image coordinate
system. This assumption, however, is not always valid for many vision-equipped
mobile platforms such as mobile phones, UAVs or construction vehicles on rugged
terrain. In these situations, the motion of the camera can cause images of
pedestrians to be captured at extreme angles. This can lead to very poor
pedestrian detection performance when using standard pedestrian detectors. To
address this issue, we propose a Rotational Rectification Network (R2N) that
can be inserted into any CNN-based pedestrian (or object) detector to adapt it
to significant changes in camera rotation. The rotational rectification network
uses a 2D rotation estimation module that passes rotational information to a
spatial transformer network to undistort image features. To enable robust
rotation estimation, we propose a Global Polar Pooling (GP-Pooling) operator to
capture rotational shifts in convolutional features. Through our experiments,

  Chemical Etching Method",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Micro-cantilevers (MCs) are widely used in sensing, probing and a variety of
other purposes. Apart from Si, the most versatile material in the micro domain,
SiO2 MCs have attracted much attention lately. In this study, fabrication of
SiO2 MCs using wet anisotropic etching technique is reported. Thermally grown
SiO2 (300 nm) layer on single crystalline(c-) Si is utilized for the
micro-fabrication. Standard lithographic procedure was followed and the
exposure of the photo-resist was performed by mask-less direct laser writer.
Various orientations on the c-Si wafer, their properties and implications on
the structure and integrity of the released SiO2 MC are discussed. The 110
direction was found to be much time consuming and sticking of the released
structures was almost evident. On the other hand 100 and 410 directions showed
lesser release time and higher stability of the released structures due to
under-etching along the width of the MCs.

injected semiconductor laser is studied numerically, by using a well-known rate
equation model. We show that symbolic ordinal time-series analysis allows to
identify the patterns of intensity oscillations that are likely to occur before
an extreme pulse. The method also gives information about patterns which are
unlikely to occur before an extreme pulse. The specific patterns identified
capture the topology of the underlying chaotic attractor and depend on the
model parameters. The methodology proposed here can be useful for analyzing
data recorded from other complex systems that generate extreme fluctuations in
their output signals.

without medium effect by employing Coulomb Modified Glauber Model (CMGM) for
interactions of projectiles 56^Fe_26, 84^Kr_36, 132^Xe_54, 197^Au_79 and
238^U_92 with nuclear emulsion detector (NED) nuclei at around 1 GeV per
nucleon incident kinetic energy. These calculated reaction cross-sections are
correlated with the different target groups of the NED nuclei. The average
value of various parameters are also calculated and compared with the
corresponding experimental results. The number of shower particles emitted in
an interaction is also calculated and showed good agreement with the
experimental result. We observed that the total reaction cross-section
increases with increasing the target mass number in case of all the considered
projectiles. In addition, it shows that the average value of reaction
cross-section with nuclear medium effect is in good agreement with the
experimental results for projectiles 56^Fe, 84^Kr, 132^Xe, although results of
projectiles 197^Au and 238^U are not in agreement with the experimental
observations. This study sheds some light on the energy dependence of the
nuclear reaction cross-section.

function in order to get a new simple strictly finite range form for the
phenomenological nuclear potential. The smoothed square well form becomes
exactly zero smoothly at a finite distance, in contrast to the Woods-Saxon
form. If the smoothing range is four times the diffuseness of the Woods-Saxon
shape both the central and the spin-orbit terms of the Woods-Saxon shape are
reproduced reasonably well. The bound single particle energies in a Woods-Saxon
potential can be well reproduced with those in the smoothed square well
potential. The same is true for the complex energies of the narrow resonances.

world but is vulnerable to virus diseases, which threaten to destabilize food
security in sub-Saharan Africa. Novel methods of cassava disease detection are
needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image
recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease
detection. New transfer learning methods offer an avenue for this technology to
be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images
taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep
convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest
damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown
leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage
(GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic
disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not
used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning
approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and
easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.

  Advances in Sensors and Communications",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic signals are ubiquitous devices that first appeared in 1868. Recent
advances in information and communications technology (ICT) have led to
unprecedented improvements in such areas as mobile handheld devices (i.e.,
smartphones), the electric power industry (i.e., smart grids), transportation
infrastructure, and vehicle area networks. Given the trend towards
interconnectivity, it is only a matter of time before vehicles communicate with
one another and with infrastructure. In fact, several pilots of such
vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (e.g. traffic lights and
parking spaces) communication systems are already operational. This survey of
autonomous and self-organized traffic signaling control has been undertaken
with these potential developments in mind. Our research results indicate that,
while many sophisticated techniques have attempted to improve the scheduling of
traffic signal control, either real-time sensing of traffic patterns or a
priori knowledge of traffic flow is required to optimize traffic. Once this is
achieved, communication between traffic signals will serve to vastly improve
overall traffic efficiency.
