multiple computing and data components with strong communication correlations

storage resources, network resource demands are emerging as one of the key
areas of performance bottleneck. This paper addresses network-aware placement
of virtual components (computing and data) of multi-tier applications in data
centers and formally defines the placement as an optimization problem. The
simultaneous placement of Virtual Machines and data blocks aims at reducing the
network overhead of the data center network infrastructure. A greedy heuristic
is proposed for the on-demand application components placement that localizes
network traffic in the data center interconnect. Such optimization helps
reducing communication overhead in upper layer network switches that will
eventually reduce the overall traffic volume across the data center. This, in
turn, will help reducing packet transmission delay, increasing network
performance, and minimizing the energy consumption of network components.
Experimental results demonstrate performance superiority of the proposed
algorithm over other approaches where it outperforms the state-of-the-art
network-aware application placement algorithm across all performance metrics by
reducing the average network cost up to 67% and network usage at core switches
up to 84%, as well as increasing the average number of application deployments

of the seed field to the observed values in the quiet Sun. Here we report an
alternative model of seeding based on the action of the Bierman battery effect.
This effect generates a magnetic field due to the local imbalances in electron
pressure in the partially ionized solar plasma. We show that the battery effect
self-consistently creates from zero an initial seed field of a strength of the

Additionally, in exciton-polariton condensates there is a variety of dynamical
scenarios and instabilities, owing to the properties of the incoherent
excitonic reservoir. We investigate the dynamics of an exciton-polariton
condensate which emerges in semiconductor microcavity subject to disorder,
which determines its spatial and temporal behaviour. Our experimental data
revealed complex burst-like time evolution under non-resonant optical pulsed
excitation. The temporal patterns of the condensate emission result from the
intrinsic disorder and are driven by properties of the excitonic reservoir,
which decay in time much slower with respect to the polariton condensate
lifetime. This feature entails a relaxation oscillation in polariton condensate
formation, resulting in ultrafast emission pulses of coherent polariton field.
The experimental data can be well reproduced by numerical simulations, where
the condensate is coupled to the excitonic reservoir described by a set of rate
equations. Theory suggests the existence of slow reservoir temporarily emptied
by stimulated scattering to the condensate, generating ultrashort pulses of the
condensate emission.

completely understood despite being fundamentally necessary to generate
electrical current. One of the fundamental issues for ab initio calculations is
that hybrid interfaces combining materials with Wannier-Mott excitons and those
with Frenkel excitons can easily require thousands of atoms to encompass the
exciton-wave function. The problem is further exacerbated by a large
permittivity difference at the interface, which requires meso-scale boundary
conditions to accurately predict electrostatic potentials. For these reasons,
we have constructed a model of excited states at hybrid interfaces based on an
effective mass Schroedinger equation. In this continuum model, carrier wave
functions are represented by their envelope function rather than resolving the
atomic scale variations. Electrostatic interactions are accounted for using the
Poisson equation. For our model system, we use a pentacene/silicon interface.
Because carrier mobility is low in pentacene relative to silicon, the hole is
frozen such that it only interacts with the electron though an immobile
positive charge density. The inputs to this model are as follows: dielectric
permittivities, electron effective masses, interfacial width, band alignment,
and the hole wave function. We find that the energetic favorability of charge
transfer states relative to bulk excitons is most easily controlled by band
alignment. However, when both states have similar energies, interface proximity
and electrostatics become important secondary means of tuning the relative
stability of these states.

deployment of robotic assistants moves to scale, mapping these requests for
human aid to the teleoperators themselves will be a difficult online
optimization problem. In this paper, we design a system that allocates requests
to a limited number of teleoperators, each with different specialities, in an
online fashion. We generalize a recent model of online job scheduling with a
worst-case competitive-ratio bound to our setting. Next, we design a scalable
machine-learning-based teleoperator-aware task scheduling algorithm and show,
experimentally, that it performs well when compared to an omniscient optimal
scheduling algorithm.

systematically construct the analogue of the classical formula that provides
the whole hierarchy of the time components of Lax pairs at the quantum level

operator formula is particularly interesting and novel at the quantum level
when dealing with systems with open boundary conditions. In the same frame we
show that the reflection K-matrix can also be viewed as a particular type of
BT, fixed at the boundaries of the system. The q-oscillator (q-boson) model, a
variant of the Ablowitz-Ladik model, is then employed as a paradigm to
illustrate the method. Particular emphasis is given to the time part of the
quantum BT as possible connections and applications to the problem of quantum
quenches as well as the time evolution of local quantum impurities are evident.
A discussion on the use of Bethe states as well as coherent states and the path
integral formulation for the study of the time evolution is also presented.

  It is critical in many applications to understand what features are important
for a model, and why individual predictions were made. For tree ensemble
methods these questions are usually answered by attributing importance values
to input features, either globally or for a single prediction. Here we show
that current feature attribution methods are inconsistent, which means changing
the model to rely more on a given feature can actually decrease the importance
assigned to that feature. To address this problem we develop fast exact
solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which were recently
shown to be the unique additive feature attribution method based on conditional
expectations that is both consistent and locally accurate. We integrate these
improvements into the latest version of XGBoost, demonstrate the
inconsistencies of current methods, and show how using SHAP values results in
significantly improved supervised clustering performance. Feature importance
values are a key part of understanding widely used models such as gradient
boosting trees and random forests, so improvements to them have broad practical
implications.

introduce for this purpose the crystal affinity of a liquid, a simple measure
of its propensity to accumulate local crystalline structures on cooling. This
quantity is explicitly related to the high temperature structural covariance
between local fluctuations in crystal order and that of competing liquid
structures: favouring a structure that, due to poor overlap properties,
anticorrelates with crystalline order reduces the affinity of the liquid. Using
a lattice model of a liquid, we show that this quantity successfully predicts
the tendency of a liquid to either accumulate or suppress local crystalline
fluctuations with increasing supercooling. We demonstrate that the crystal
affinity correlates strongly with the crystal nucleation rate and the
crystal-liquid interfacial free energy of the low-temperature liquid, making
our theory a predictive tool to determine easily which amorphous structures
enhance glass-forming ability.

most active research areas in condensed matter physics, fueled by the prospect
of using its non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. A highly
sought-after platform for MBS is two-dimensional topological superconductors,
where MBS is predicted to exist as a zero-energy mode in the core of a vortex.
A clear observation of MBS, however, is often hindered by the presence of
additional low-lying bound states inside the vortex core. By using scanning
tunneling microscope on the newly discovered superconducting Dirac surface
state of iron-based superconductor FeTe1-xSex (x = 0.45, superconducting
transition temperature Tc = 14.5 K), we clearly observe a sharp and non-split
zero-bias peak inside a vortex core. Systematic studies of its evolution under
different magnetic fields, temperatures, and tunneling barriers strongly
suggest that this is the case of tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from
non-topological bound states which is moved away from the zero energy due to
the high ratio between the superconducting gap and the Fermi energy in this
material. This observation offers a new, robust platform for realizing and
manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.

the eruption of coronal flux ropes underlying coronal streamers and the
development of a prominence eruption. We initialize a quasi-steady solution of
a coronal helmet streamer, into which we impose at the lower boundary the slow
emergence of a part of a twisted magnetic torus. As a result a
quasi-equilibrium flux rope is built up under the streamer. With varying sizes
of the streamer and the different length and total twist of the emerged flux
rope, we found different scenarios for the evolution from quasi-equilibrium to
eruption. In the cases with a broad streamer, the flux rope remains well
confined until there is sufficient twist such that it first develops the kink
instability and evolves through a sequence of kinked, confined states with
increasing height until it eventually develops a ""hernia-like"" ejective
eruption. For the significantly twisted flux ropes, prominence condensations
form in the dips of the twisted field lines due to run-away radiative cooling.
Once formed, the prominence carrying field becomes significantly non-force-free
due to the prominence weight despite being low plasma $\beta$. As the flux rope
erupts, we obtain the eruption of the prominence, which shows substantial
draining along the legs of the erupting flux rope. The prominence may not show
a kinked morphology even though the flux rope becomes kinked. On the other
hand, in the case with a narrow streamer, the flux rope with less than 1 wind
of twist can erupt via the onset of the torus instability.

percolation has been restricted to undirected networks. Furthermore,
information on such rank ordered networks typically flows from higher ranked to
lower ranked individuals, such as follower relations, replies and retweets on
Twitter.
  Here we introduce a simple percolation process on an ordered, directed
network where edges are added monotonically with respect to the rank ordering.
We show with a numerical approach that the emergence of a dominant strongly
connected component appears to be discontinuous. Large scale connectivity
occurs at very high density compared with most percolation processes, and this
holds not just for the strongly connected component structure but for the
weakly connected component structure as well. We present analysis with
branching processes which explains this unusual behavior and gives basic
intuition for the underlying mechanisms. We also show that before the emergence
of a dominant strongly connected component, multiple giant strongly connected
components may exist simultaneously. By adding a competitive percolation rule
with a small bias to link uses of similar rank, we show this leads to formation
of two distinct components, one of high ranked users, and one of low ranked
users, with little flow between the two components.

weakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the
adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust
optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much
of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to
identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are
reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a
concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These
methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide
range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against
a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe
that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an
important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models. Code and

strong upper limits on the integrated strength of dense gas tracers (HCN(4--3)

provide valuable constraints on the molecular gas content and excitation
conditions in high-redshift galaxies. We therefore use this unique data set to
construct a CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of the source, which is
most consistent with that of a ULIRG/Seyfert or QSO host object in the taxonomy
of the \textit{Herschel} Comprehensive ULIRG Emission Survey. We employ RADEX
models to fit the peak of the CO SLED, inferring a temperature of T$\sim$117 K
and $n_{\text{H}_2}\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, most consistent with a ULIRG/QSO object
and the presence of high density tracers. We also find that the velocity width
of the \ci\ line is potentially larger than seen in all CO transitions for this
object, and that the $L'_{\rm C\,I(2-1)}/L'_{\rm CO(3-2)}$ ratio is also larger
than seen in other lensed and unlensed submillimeter galaxies and QSO hosts; if
confirmed, this anomaly could be an effect of differential lensing of a shocked

$18\%\pm3\%$ of the galaxies exhibit shells. This fraction increases with
increasing mass cut: higher mass galaxies are more likely to have stellar
shells. Furthermore, the fraction of massive galaxies that exhibit shells
decreases with increasing redshift. We find that shell galaxies observed at
redshift $z=0$ form preferentially through relatively major mergers
($\gtrsim$1:10 in stellar mass ratio). Progenitors are accreted on low angular
momentum orbits, in a preferred time-window between $\sim$4 and 8 Gyrs ago. Our
study indicates that, due to dynamical friction, more massive satellites are
allowed to probe a wider range of impact parameters at accretion time, while
small companions need almost purely radial infall trajectories in order to
produce shells. We also find a number of special cases, as a consequence of the
additional complexity introduced by the cosmological setting. These include
galaxies with multiple shell-forming progenitors, satellite-of-satellites also
forming shells, or satellites that fail to produce shells due to multiple major

cosmological origin, and their high occurrence, detection of strongly lensed
sources due to intervening galaxy lenses is possible with forthcoming radio
surveys. We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved
with VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could
reveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot.
This can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments,
constraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if
FRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions
for which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing
precision possible for FRBs ($\sim {\rm ms}$) compared to the typical time
delays between images in galaxy lensing ($\gtrsim 10\, {\rm days}$) enables the
measurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays ($\sim 10^{-9}$), and
hence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions
between the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic
peculiar velocities only cause the delay time to drift linearly, and that the
effect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus
enabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of $\sim
1\,$ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) $\sim 0.05$ per day of a
single FRB source, non-uniform displacement $\gtrsim 0.1 - 1\,$AU of the

foreground/background objects and smoothing pixels in consideration of the
observational seeing size, detailed pCMD features are compared between the two

early-type galaxies, the A2589-BCG tends to have redder mean pixel color and
smaller pixel color deviation at given surface brightness than the A1139-BCG.
(2) The mean pixel color distribution as a function of pixel surface brightness
(pCMD backbone) indicates that the A2589-BCG formed a larger central body (~
2.0 kpc in radius) by major dry mergers at an early epoch than the A1139-BCG (a
central body ~ 1.3 kpc in radius), while they have grown commonly by subsequent
minor mergers. (3) The spatial distributions of the pCMD outliers reveal that
the A1139-BCG experienced considerable tidal events more recently than the
A2589-BCG, whereas the A2589-BCG has an asymmetric compact core possibly
resulting from major dry merger at an early epoch. (4) The A2589-BCG shows a
very large faint-to-bright pixel number ratio compared to early-type non-BCGs,
whereas the ratio for the A1139-BCG is not distinctively large. These results
are consistent with the idea that the BCG in the dynamically older cluster

material to several million Kelvin, observed in Soft X-rays (SXRs) with
Hinode/XRT, and was faintly visible in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) with SDO/AIA.
For three of the four NuSTAR observations of this region (pre-, decay, and post

but the spectrum during the impulsive phase shows additional emission up to 10
MK, emission equivalent to A0.1 GOES class. We recover the differential
emission measure (DEM) using SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT, and NuSTAR, giving
unprecedented coverage in temperature. We find the pre-flare DEM peaks at ~3 MK
and falls off sharply by 5 MK; but during the microflare's impulsive phase the
emission above 3 MK is brighter and extends to 10 MK, giving a heating rate of
about $2.5 \times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$. As the NuSTAR spectrum is purely
thermal we determined upper-limits on the possible non-thermal bremsstrahlung
emission. We find that for the accelerated electrons to be the source of the
heating requires a power-law spectrum of $\delta \ge 7$ with a low energy
cut-off $E_{c} \lesssim 7$ keV. In summary, this first NuSTAR microflare
strongly resembles much more powerful flares.

hierarchical, and Bayesian framework to sample from a metamodel (union of
models with different dimensionality) consistent with observed photon count
maps. Probabilistic cataloging allows us to robustly characterize modeling
covariances within and across lens models with different numbers of subhalos.
Unlike traditional cataloging of subhalos, it does not require model subhalos
to improve the goodness of fit above the detection threshold. Instead, it
allows the exploitation of all information contained in the photon count maps,
for instance, when constraining the subhalo mass function. We further show
that, by not including these small subhalos in the lens model,
fixed-dimensional inference methods can significantly mismodel the data. Using
a simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) dataset, we show that the subhalo mass
function can be probed even when many subhalos in the sample catalogs are
individually below the detection threshold and would be absent in a traditional
catalog. With the planned Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST),
simultaneous probabilistic cataloging of dark subhalos in high-resolution, deep
strong lens images has the potential to constrain the subhalo mass function at
even lower masses.

understanding the causes of solar eruptions. Although various scenarios have
been suggested to date, the tether-cutting reconnection scenario proposed by
Moore et al.(2001) is one of the widely accepted models to explain the onset
process of solar eruptions. Although the tether-cutting reconnection scenario
proposed that sigmoidal field formed by the internal reconnection is the
magnetic field in pre-eruptive state, the stability of the sigmoidal field has
not yet been investigated quantitatively. In this paper, in order to elucidate
the stability problem of pre-eruptive state, we developed a simple numerical
analysis, in which the sigmoidal field is modeled by a double arc electric
current loop and its stability is analyzed. As a result, we found that the
double arc loop is more easily destabilized than the axisymmetric torus, and it
becomes unstable even if the external field does not decay with altitude, which
is in contrast to the axisymmetric torus instability. This suggests that the
tether-cutting reconnection may well work as the onset mechanism of solar
eruptions, and if so the critical condition for eruption under certain geometry
may be determined by a new type of instability rather than the torus
instability. Based on them, we propose a new type of instability called double
arc instability (DAI). We discuss the critical conditions for DAI and derive a
new parameter $\kappa$ defined as the product of the magnetic twist and the
normalized flux of tether-cutting reconnection.

Using Floquet theory and slave boson approach, we study a periodic Anderson
model and derive an effective model which describes the laser-irradiated Kondo
insulators. In this model, we find two generic effects induced by laser light.
One is the dynamical localization, which suppresses hopping and hybridization.
The other is the laser-induced hopping and hybridization, which can be
interpreted as a synthetic spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field. The first
effect drastically changes the behavior of the Kondo effect. Especially, the
Kondo effect under laser light qualitatively changes its character depending on
whether the hybridization is on-site or off-site. The second effect triggers
topological phase transitions. In topological Kondo insulators, linearly
polarized laser light realizes phase transitions between trivial, weak
topological, and strong topological Kondo insulators. Moreover, circularly
polarized laser light breaks time-reversal symmetry and induces Weyl
semimetallic phases. Our results pave the new way to dynamically control the
Kondo effect and topological phases in heavy fermion systems. We also discuss
experimental setups to detect the signatures.

nearby galaxies with the aim of furthering our understanding of the different
processes involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies. To this end, we
apply the fossil record method of stellar population synthesis to a rich and
diverse data set of 436 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy in
the CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, with stellar
masses ranging from $M_\star \sim 10^9$ to $7 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$. Spectral
synthesis techniques are applied to the datacubes to retrieve the spatially
resolved time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), its intensity
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), and other descriptors of the 2D-SFH in seven bins of
galaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Sd), and five bins of stellar
mass. Our main results are: a) Galaxies form very fast independently of their
current stellar mass, with the peak of star formation at high redshift ($z >
2$). Subsequent star formation is driven by $M_\star$ and morphology, with less
massive and later type spirals showing more prolonged periods of star
formation. b) At any epoch in the past the SFR is proportional to $M_\star$,
with most massive galaxies having the highest absolute (but lowest specific)
SFRs. c) While nowadays $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is similar for all spirals, and
significantly lower in early type galaxies (ETG), in the past $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ scales well with morphology. The central regions of today's ETGs are
where $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ reached the highest values ($> 10^3
\,M_\odot\,$Gyr$^{-1}\,$pc$^{-2}$), similar to those measured in high redshift
star forming galaxies. d) The evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in Sbc systems
matches that of models for Milky-Way-like galaxies, suggesting that the
formation of a thick disk may be a common phase in spirals at early epochs.

to aggregate these possibly noisy labels provided by a set of heterogeneous

annotator reliability without even knowing the ground truth, which can be used
to build incentive mechanisms in crowdsourcing platforms. When each instance is
associated with many possible labels simultaneously, the problem becomes even

that the proposed methods outperform other competitive alternatives, and the

radially aligned with the lens. We account for this bias by applying a
correction that depends on both lens size and magnitude. We also correct for
contamination of the source sample by cluster members. We use a
physically-motivated definition of subhalo mass, namely the mass bound to the
subhalo, $m_\mathrm{bg}$, similar to definitions used by common subhalo finders
in numerical simulations. Binning the satellites by stellar mass we provide a
direct measurement of the subhalo-to-stellar-mass relation, $\log
m_\mathrm{bg}/\mathrm{M}_\odot = (11.54\pm0.05) +
(0.95\pm0.10)\log[m_\star/(2\times10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot)]$. This best-fitting
relation implies that, at a stellar mass
$m_\star\sim3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, subhalo masses are roughly 50
per cent of those of central galaxies, and this fraction decreases at higher
stellar masses. We find some evidence for a sharp change in the
total-to-stellar mass ratio around the clusters' scale radius, which could be
interpreted as galaxies within the scale radius having suffered more strongly
from tidal stripping, but remain cautious regarding this interpretation.

over time. In contrast, in AI and robotics, a robot's body plan is usually
designed by hand, and control policies are then optimized for that fixed
design. The task of simultaneously co-optimizing the morphology and controller
of an embodied robot has remained a challenge. In psychology, the theory of
embodied cognition posits that behavior arises from a close coupling between
body plan and sensorimotor control, which suggests why co-optimizing these two
subsystems is so difficult: most evolutionary changes to morphology tend to
adversely impact sensorimotor control, leading to an overall decrease in
behavioral performance. Here, we further examine this hypothesis and
demonstrate a technique for ""morphological innovation protection"", which
temporarily reduces selection pressure on recently morphologically-changed
individuals, thus enabling evolution some time to ""readapt"" to the new
morphology with subsequent control policy mutations. We show the potential for
this method to avoid local optima and converge to similar highly fit
morphologies across widely varying initial conditions, while sustaining fitness
improvements further into optimization. While this technique is admittedly only
the first of many steps that must be taken to achieve scalable optimization of
embodied machines, we hope that theoretical insight into the cause of
evolutionary stagnation in current methods will help to enable the automation
of robot design and behavioral training -- while simultaneously providing a
testbed to investigate the theory of embodied cognition.

thoughts, feelings, and actions at a resolution previously unimaginable.
Because user behavior on SM is a reflection of events in the real world,
researchers have realized they can use SM in order to forecast, making
predictions about the future. The advantage of SM data is its relative ease of
acquisition, large quantity, and ability to capture socially relevant
information, which may be difficult to gather from other data sources.
Promising results exist across a wide variety of domains, but one will find
little consensus regarding best practices in either methodology or evaluation.
In this systematic review, we examine relevant literature over the past decade,
tabulate mixed results across a number of scientific disciplines, and identify
common pitfalls and best practices. We find that SM forecasting is limited by
data biases, noisy data, lack of generalizable results, a lack of
domain-specific theory, and underlying complexity in many prediction tasks. But
despite these shortcomings, recurring findings and promising results continue
to galvanize researchers and demand continued investigation. Based on the
existing literature, we identify research practices which lead to success,
citing specific examples in each case and making recommendations for best
practices. These recommendations will help researchers take advantage of the
exciting possibilities offered by SM platforms.

have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure

comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings
by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on
the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the
traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to
standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from
critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings
differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights
into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved
classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical
community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various
social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of

$L_1$-norm regularization with the RSVD methodology in which the large scale
linear system at each iteration is replaced with a much smaller linear system.
Although the optimal choice for the low rank approximation of the system matrix
with m rows is q=m, acceptable results are achievable with q<<m. In contrast to
the use of the LSQR algorithm for the solution of the linear systems at each
iteration, the singular values generated using the RSVD yield a good
approximation of the dominant singular values of the large scale system matrix.
The regularization parameter found for the small system at each iteration is
thus dependent on the dominant singular values of the large scale system matrix
and appropriately regularizes the dominant singular space of the large scale
problem. The results achieved are comparable with those obtained using the LSQR
algorithm for solving each linear system, but are obtained at reduced
computational cost. The method has been tested on synthetic models along with
the real gravity data from the Morro do Engenho complex from central Brazil.

simple example which shows that, contrary to a claim made in the influential

result of the Greedy Algorithm is not in general optimal. We go on to establish
sharp estimates on the degree to which the result of the Greedy Algorithm can
differ from the optimal result. Underlying all of these results is a
construction which shows that for any matrix whose entries satisfy certain
natural assumptions it is possible to construct a Hilbert space and a
collection of closed subspaces such that the pairwise Friedrichs numbers

Remarkably, the proximity spin-orbit splitting for holes is two orders of
magnitude---the spin-orbit splitting of the valence band at K is about 2
meV---more than for electrons. Effectively, holes experience spin-valley
locking due to the strong proximity of the lower graphene layer to WSe$_2$.
However, applying an external transverse electric field of some 1 V/nm,
countering the built-in field of the heterostructure, completely reverses this
effect and allows, instead for holes, electrons to be spin-valley locked with 2
meV spin-orbit splitting. Such a behavior constitutes a highly efficient
field-effect spin-orbit valve, making bilayer graphene on WSe$_2$ a potential

conditional inference (CI) trees and subsampling have been found to be not
prone to variable selection bias. Here, we conduct simulation experiments using
a novel approach to explore the applicability of the IJ to random forests using
variations on the resampling method and base learner. Test data points were
simulated and each trained using random forest on one hundred simulated
training data sets using different combinations of resampling and base
learners. Using CI trees instead of traditional CART trees as well as using
subsampling instead of bootstrap sampling resulted in a much more accurate
estimation of prediction variance when using the IJ. The random forest
variations here have been incorporated into an open source software package for
the R programming language.

We consider a sample of 24463 galaxies from the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey to
conduct a detailed analysis of the SFR-M* relation at redshifts 0.5$\leqslant
z<$3 over more than three dex in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we
utilise mid- and far-IR photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all
the other galaxies. We perform our analysis in different redshift bins, with
two different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming
galaxies, defined as those with specific star formation rates $\rm
log_{10}(sSFR/yr^{-1}) > -9.8$, similarly to what is typically done in the
literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy main
sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy cloud. We find
that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar mass cuts are adopted,
and that the apparent slope change observed at high masses depends on the SFR
estimation method. In addition, the multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the
presence of a starburst population which increases towards low stellar masses
and high redshifts. We find that starbursts make up ~5% of all galaxies at
z=0.5-1.0, while they account for ~16% of galaxies at 2$<z<$3 with
log$_{10}(M^{*})=$8.25-11.25. We conclude that the dissection of the SFR-M* in

understand the importance of the different modes of star formation through

the nature of black holes and search for exotic, compact alternatives. Recent
studies have shown that exotic compact objects (ECOs) can ring down in a manner
similar to black holes, but can also produce a sequence of distinct pulses
resembling the initial ringdown. These ""echoes"" would provide definite evidence
for the existence of ECOs. In this work we study the generation of these echoes
in a generic, parametrized model for the ECO, using Green's functions. We show
how to reprocess radiation in the near-horizon region of a Schwarzschild black
hole into the asymptotic radiation from the corresponding source in an ECO
spacetime. Our methods allow us to understand the connection between distinct
echoes and ringing at the resonant frequencies of the compact object. We find
that the quasinormal mode ringing in the black hole spacetime plays a central
role in determining the shape of the first few echoes. We use this observation
to develop a simple template for echo waveforms. This template preforms well
over a variety of ECO parameters, and with improvements may prove useful in the
analysis of gravitational waves.

a well-defined magnetic excitation at $\hbar \omega_1 = 2.48$meV, which is

  hidden variables under additive interventions",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal inference is known to be very challenging when only observational data
are available. Randomized experiments are often costly and impractical and in
instrumental variable regression the number of instruments has to exceed the
number of causal predictors. It was recently shown in Peters et al. [2016] that
causal inference for the full model is possible when data from distinct
observational environments are available, exploiting that the conditional
distribution of a response variable is invariant under the correct causal
model. Two shortcomings of such an approach are the high computational effort
for large-scale data and the assumed absence of hidden confounders. Here we
show that these two shortcomings can be addressed if one is willing to make a
more restrictive assumption on the type of interventions that generate
different environments. Thereby, we look at a different notion of invariance,
namely inner-product invariance. By avoiding a computationally cumbersome
reverse-engineering approach such as in Peters et al. [2016], it allows for
large-scale causal inference in linear structural equation models. We discuss
identifiability conditions for the causal parameter and derive asymptotic
confidence intervals in the low-dimensional setting. In the case of
non-identifiability we show that the solution set of causal Dantzig has
predictive guarantees under certain interventions. We derive finite-sample
bounds in the high-dimensional setting and investigate its performance on
simulated datasets.

tasks with very limited data, simple non-parametric methods perform comparably,
without needing the extra training data.

dictated by radiologists to explain their interpretations. We sought to
demonstrate machine learning classification of computed tomography (CT) imaging
reports into binary outcomes, i.e. positive and negative for fracture, using
regular text classification and classifiers based on topic modeling. Topic
modeling provides interpretable themes (topic distributions) in reports, a
representation that is more compact than the commonly used bag-of-words
representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent
automated processes. We demonstrate new classifiers based on this topic
modeling representation of the reports. Aggregate topic classifier (ATC) and
confidence-based topic classifier (CTC) use a single topic that is determined
from the training dataset based on different measures to classify the reports
on the test dataset. Alternatively, similarity-based topic classifier (STC)
measures the similarity between the reports' topic distributions to determine
the predicted class. Our proposed topic modeling-based classifier systems are
shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and
provides an efficient and interpretable representation.

evolution that is decoupled from non-linear structure formation. Prior to
gravitational collapse, kinematical backreaction ($Q_D$) justifies this
approach in a Newtonian context. However, the final stages of a gravitational
collapse event are sudden; a globally imposed expansion rate thus forces at
least one expanding region to suddenly decelerate. This is relativistically
unrealistic. Instead, we allow non-collapsed domains to evolve in volume
according to the $Q_D$ Zel'dovich Approximation (QZA). We study the inferred
average expansion under this ""silent"" virialisation hypothesis. We set standard
(mpgrafic) EdS cosmological $N$-body initial conditions. Using RAMSES, we call
DTFE to estimate the initial values of the three invariants of the extrinsic
curvature tensor in Lagrangian domains $D$. We integrate the Raychaudhuri
equation in each domain using inhomog, adopt the stable clustering hypothesis
(VQZA), and average spatially. We adopt an early-epoch--normalised EdS
reference-model Hubble constant $H_1^{bg} = 37.7$ km/s/Mpc and an effective
Hubble constant $H_0^{eff} = 67.7$ km/s/Mpc. From 2000 simulations at

above EdS) for an averaging scale of $L_{13.8}=2.5^{+0.1}_{-0.4}$
Mpc/$h^{eff}$. Relativistically interpreted, this corresponds to strong average
negative curvature evolution. The virialisation fraction and super-EdS
expansion correlate strongly at fixed cosmological time. Thus, starting from
EdS initial conditions and averaging on a typical non-linear structure

$\Lambda$CDM expansion to first order. The software packages used here are

Wiener chaoses partially given by Borel, and then by Ledoux in its full form.
We show that some heavy-tail phenomena observed in large deviations can be
explained by the same mechanism as for the Wiener chaoses, meaning that the
deviations are created, in a sense, by translations. More precisely, we prove a
general large deviations principle for a certain class of functionals $f_n :
\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is some metric space, under
the $n$-fold probability measure $\nu_{\alpha}^n$, where $\nu_{\alpha}
=Y_{\alpha}^{-1}e^{-|x|^{\alpha}}dx$, $\alpha \in (0,2]$, for which the large
deviations are due to translations. We retrieve, as an application, the large
deviations principles known for the Wigner matrices without Gaussian tails, of
the empirical spectral measure by Bordenave and Caputo, the largest eigenvalue
and traces of polynomials by the author. We also apply our large deviations
result to the last-passage time, which yields a large deviations principle when
the weights have the density $Z_{\alpha}^{-1} e^{-x^{\alpha}}$ with respect to
Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}_+$, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

approach for unsupervised learning with high-dimensional data. It can be
useful, inter alia, in situations where the data dimensionality far exceeds the

non-Gaussian mixtures to account for clusters with heavier tail weight and/or

such extension, which leads to a flexible modelling paradigm that accounts for
both heavier tail weight and cluster asymmetry. In many practical applications,
the occurrence of missing values often complicates data analyses. A
generalization of the MGHFA is presented to accommodate missing values. Under a
missing-at-random mechanism, we develop a computationally efficient alternating
expectation conditional maximization algorithm for parameter estimation of the
MGHFA model with different patterns of missing values. The imputation of
missing values under an incomplete-data structure of MGHFA is also
investigated. The performance of our proposed methodology is illustrated

in multiple spatial dimensions the discrete ordinates (DO) code of Nagakura,
Yamada, and Sumiyoshi and the Monte Carlo (MC) code Sedonu, under the
assumptions of a static fluid background, flat spacetime, elastic scattering,
and full special relativity. We find remarkably good agreement in all spectral,
angular, and fluid interaction quantities, lending confidence to both methods.
The DO method excels in determining the heating and cooling rates in the
optically thick region. The MC method predicts sharper angular features due to
the effectively infinite angular resolution, but struggles to drive down noise
in quantities where subtractive cancellation is prevalent, such as the net gain
in the protoneutron star and off-diagonal components of the Eddington tensor.
We also find that errors in the angular moments of the distribution functions
induced by neglecting velocity dependence are sub-dominant to those from
limited momentum-space resolution. We briefly compare directly computed second
angular moments to those predicted by popular algebraic two-moment closures,
and find that the errors from the approximate closures are comparable to the
difference between the DO and MC methods. Included in this work is an improved
Sedonu code, which now implements a fully special relativistic,
time-independent version of the grid-agnostic Monte Carlo random walk
approximation.

structural and dynamical properties. But, what features of human interaction
build a strong tie? Here we approach this question from an practical way by
finding what are the properties of social interactions that make ties more
persistent and thus stronger to maintain social interactions in the future.
Using a large longitudinal mobile phone database we build a predictive model of
tie persistence based on intensity, intimacy, structural and temporal patterns
of social interaction. While our results confirm that structural (embeddedness)
and intensity (number of calls) are correlated with tie persistence, we find
that temporal features of communication events are better and more efficient
predictors for tie persistence. Specifically, although communication within
ties is always bursty we find that ties that are more bursty than the average
are more likely to decay, signaling that tie strength is not only reflected in
the intensity or topology of the network, but also on how individuals
distribute time or attention across their relationships. We also found that
stable relationships have and require a constant rhythm and if communication is
halted for more than 8 times the previous communication frequency, most likely
the tie will decay. Our results not only are important to understand the
strength of social relationships but also to unveil the entanglement between
the different temporal scales in networks, from microscopic tie burstiness and
rhythm to macroscopic network evolution.

tracking problems in multiple non-overlapping cameras is proposed. Given a
video and a set of detections (obtained by any person detector), we first solve
within-camera tracking employing the first two layers of our framework and,
then, in the third layer, we solve across-camera tracking by merging tracks of
the same person in all cameras in a simultaneous fashion. To best serve our
purpose, a constrained dominant sets clustering (CDSC) technique, a
parametrized version of standard quadratic optimization, is employed to solve
both tracking tasks. The tracking problem is caste as finding constrained
dominant sets from a graph. In addition to having a unified framework that
simultaneously solves within- and across-camera tracking, the third layer helps
link broken tracks of the same person occurring during within-camera tracking.
In this work, we propose a fast algorithm, based on dynamics from evolutionary
game theory, which is efficient and salable to large-scale real-world
applications.

attractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more

therefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a
novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. We
demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a
grasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To
reduce the complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on
picking sweet peppers in a protected cropping environment where plants are
grown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in protected cropping
environments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.
The results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and
detach crop from the plant within a real protected cropping system. The novel
contributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging
improvements in sweet pepper picking success rates compared with the
state-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting sweet pepper peduncles and
improving the total harvesting cycle time for each sweet pepper. The methods
presented in this paper provide steps towards the goal of fully autonomous and

to have a regular spacing: the orbital period ratios of adjacent pairs of

systems with smaller planets, suggesting that the patterns in planet sizes and

we find that essentially no planets have orbital period ratios smaller than
$1.2$, regardless of planet size. Using empirical mass-radius relationships, we
estimate the mutual Hill separations of planet pairs. We find that $93\%$ of
the planet pairs are at least 10 mutual Hill radii apart, and that a spacing of

reevaluate the outage probability of the NCC-OFDMA under a more realistic

with the full frequency diversity provided by the subcarrier allocation
algorithm, showing that the diversity order is decreased from $L(M+1)$ to
$M+L$.

localized center-surround image features. Still others respond selectively to
certain image stimuli, but the specific features that excite them are unknown.
Moreover, even for the simple and complex cells-- the best-understood V1

predict the firing rates of V1 neurons in response to natural image stimuli,

molecules. The understanding of filtration mechanisms came mostly from studies
dedicated to water desalination, while very few works have been dedicated to
distilling alcohols. In this work, we have investigated the molecular level
mechanism underlying the alcohol/water separation inside GO membranes. A series
of molecular dynamics and Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were carried
out to probe the ethanol/water and methanol/water separation through GO
membranes composed of multiple layered graphene-based sheets with different
interlayer distance values and number of oxygen-containing functional groups.
Our results show that the size exclusion and membrane affinities are not
sufficient to explain the selectivity. Besides that, the favorable water
molecular arrangement inside GO 2D-channels forming a robust H-bond network and
the fast water diffusion are crucial for an effective separation mechanism. In
other words, the separation phenomenon is not only governed by affinities with
the membrane (enthalpic mechanisms) but mainly by the geometry and size factors
(entropic mechanisms). We verified that the 2D geometry channel with optimal
interlayer distance are key factors for designing more efficient alcohol-water
separation membranes. Our findings are consistent with the available
experimental data and contribute to clarify important aspects of the separation
behavior of confined alcohol/water in GO membranes.

of the limits of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model consider
processes which feature hadron resonances. From a theoretical standpoint, this
is a challenging field: the same dynamics that binds quarks and gluons into
hadron resonances also controls their decay into lighter hadrons, so a complete

Here, we use a colloidal glass under shear as the prototype to directly observe

particle rearrangements, we quantitatively determine two basic properties of
shear transformations: local shear strain and dilatation (or free volume). It
is revealed that the local free volume undergoes a significantly temporary
increase prior to shear transformations, eventually leading to a jump of local
shear strain. We clearly demonstrate that shear transformations have no memory
of the initial free volume of local regions. Instead, their emergence strongly
depends on the dilatancy ability of these regions, i.e., the dynamic creation
of free volume. More specifically, the particles processing the high dilatancy
ability directly participate in subsequent shear transformations. These results
experimentally support the Argon's statement about the dilatancy nature of
shear transformations, and also shed insight into the structural origin of
amorphous plasticity.

two-fold degenerate in the momentum space. The scattering in the two-fold
degenerate rings can relax the spin-momentum locking effect resulting from
spin-orbit coupling, thus we can realize the spin polarized plane wave phase
even when the inter-particle interaction dominates. When these two operators
anti-commute, the lowest two bands may have the same minimal energy, which have
totally different spin structures. As a result, the competition between
different condensates in these two energetically degenerate rings can give rise
to interesting stripe phases with atoms condensed at two or four colinear
momenta. We find that the crossover between these two cases is accompanied by
the excited band condensation when the interference energy can overcome the
increased single particle energy in the excited band. This effect is not based

strength.

of the accretion disc, but is emanated from the outer side of the disc.
Inspection of literature on similar systems indicates that this feature is
common for some other long-period nova-like variables. We propose that the

discover interesting locations, especially when people pay a visit to
unfamiliar regions. Some current researches are focusing on modelling
individual and collective geographical preferences for spatial item
recommendation based on users' check-in records, but they fail to explore the
phenomenon of user interest drift across geographical regions, i.e., users
would show different interests when they travel to different regions. Besides,
they ignore the influence of public comments for subsequent users' check-in
behaviors. Specifically, it is intuitive that users would refuse to check in to
a spatial item whose historical reviews seem negative overall, even though it
might fit their interests. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend the right
item to the right user at the right location. In this paper, we propose a
latent probabilistic generative model called LSARS to mimic the decision-making
process of users' check-in activities both in home-town and out-of-town
scenarios by adapting to user interest drift and crowd sentiments, which can
learn location-aware and sentiment-aware individual interests from the contents
of spatial items and user reviews. Due to the sparsity of user activities in
out-of-town regions, LSARS is further designed to incorporate the public
preferences learned from local users' check-in behaviors. Finally, we deploy
LSARS into two practical application scenes: spatial item recommendation and
target user discovery. Extensive experiments on two large-scale location-based
social networks (LBSNs) datasets show that LSARS achieves better performance
than existing state-of-the-art methods.

re-factorization scheme, the LCDAs are known at next-to-leading order in the

twist-2 LCDAs of S-wave $B_c$ mesons. These results are applicable to heavy

Correction (SDC) method originally proposed by Dutt et al. [BIT, 40 (2000), pp.
241--266]. The framework for this high-order ordinary differential equation
(ODE) solver is typically described wherein a low-order approximation (such as
forward or backward Euler) is lifted to higher order accuracy by applying the
same low-order method to an error equation and then adding in the resulting
defect to correct the solution. Our focus is not on solving the error equation
to increase the order of accuracy, but on rewriting the solver as an iterative
Picard integral equation solver. In doing so, our chief finding is that it is
not the low-order solver that picks up the order of accuracy with each
correction, but it is the underlying quadrature rule of the right hand side
function that is solely responsible for picking up additional orders of
accuracy. Our proofs point to a total of three sources of errors that SDC
methods carry: the error at the current time point, the error from the previous
iterate, and the numerical integration error that comes from the total number
of quadrature nodes used for integration. The second of these two sources of
errors is what separates SDC methods from Picard integral equation methods; our
findings indicate that as long as difference between the current and previous
iterate always gets multiplied by at least a constant multiple of the time step
size, then high-order accuracy can be found even if the underlying ""solver"" is
inconsistent the underlying ODE. From this vantage, we solidify the prospects
of extending spectral deferred correction methods to a larger class of solvers

resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a unique tool for noninvasively probing the
tissue microstructure and orientation in the human brain. The diffusion profile
can be described by the ensemble average propagator (EAP), which is inferred
from observed diffusion signals. However, accurate EAP estimation using the
number of diffusion gradients that is clinically practical can be challenging.
In this work, we propose a deep learning algorithm for EAP estimation, which is
named learning-based ensemble average propagator estimation (LEAPE). The EAP is
commonly represented by a basis and its associated coefficients, and here we
choose the SHORE basis and design a deep network to estimate the coefficients.
The network comprises two cascaded components. The first component is a
multiple layer perceptron (MLP) that simultaneously predicts the unknown
coefficients. However, typical training loss functions, such as mean squared
errors, may not properly represent the geometry of the possibly non-Euclidean
space of the coefficients, which in particular causes problems for the
extraction of directional information from the EAP. Therefore, to regularize
the training, in the second component we compute an auxiliary output of
approximated fiber orientation (FO) errors with the aid of a second MLP that is
trained separately. We performed experiments using dMRI data that resemble
clinically achievable $q$-space sampling, and observed promising results
compared with the conventional EAP estimation method.

a dense nuclear target was shown to qualitatively reproduce the systematics of
multiparticle azimuthal anisotropy cumulants measured in
proton/deuteron-nucleus ($pA$) collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The systematics
included i) the behavior of the four-particle cumulant $c_2\{4\}$, which
generates a real four-particle second Fourier harmonic $v_2\{4\}$, ii) the
ordering $v_2\{2\}>v_2\{4\}\approx v_2\{6\}\approx v_2\{8\}$ for two-, four-,
six-, and eight-particle Fourier harmonics, iii) the behavior of so-called
symmetric cumulants $\text{SC}(2,3)$ and $\text{SC}(2,4)$. These features of
azimuthal multiparticle cumulants were previously interpreted as a signature of
hydrodynamic flow; our results challenge this interpretation. We expand here
upon our previous study and present further details and novel results on the
saturation scale and transverse momentum ($p_\perp$) dependence of
multiparticle azimuthal correlations. We find that the dependence of $v_2\{2\}$
and $v_2\{4\}$ on the number of color domains in the target varies with the
$p_\perp$ window explored. We extend our prior discussion of symmetric
cumulants and compute as yet unmeasured symmetric cumulants. We investigate the
$N_c$ dependence of $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$. We contrast our results, which
include multiple scatterings of each quark off the target, to the Glasma graph
approximation, where each quark suffers at most two gluon exchanges with the
target. We find that coherent multiple scattering is essential to obtain a
positive definite $v_2\{4\}$. We provide an algorithm to compute expectation
values of arbitrary products of the ""dipole"" lightlike Wilson line correlators.

been a popular practice. However, routing large volumes of raw traffic, which
may carry sensitive information, to a remote site for processing raises severe
security concerns. Prior solutions often abstract away important factors
pertinent to real-world deployment. In particular, they overlook the
significance of metadata protection and stateful processing. Unprotected
traffic metadata like low-level headers, size and count, can be exploited to
learn supposedly encrypted application contents. Meanwhile, tracking the states
of 100,000s of flows concurrently is often indispensable in production-level
middleboxes deployed at real networks.
  We present LightBox, the first system that can drive off-site middleboxes at
near-native speed with stateful processing and the most comprehensive
protection to date. Built upon commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, LightBox
is the product of our systematic investigation of how to overcome the inherent
limitations of secure enclaves using domain knowledge and customization. First,
we introduce an elegant virtual network interface that allows convenient access
to fully protected packets at line rate without leaving the enclave, as if from
the trusted source network. Second, we provide complete flow state management
for efficient stateful processing, by tailoring a set of data structures and
algorithms optimized for the highly constrained enclave space. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that LightBox, with all security benefits, can achieve
10Gbps packet I/O, and that with case studies on three stateful middleboxes, it
can operate at near-native speed.

end-to-end fast upscaling technique to replace the interpolation operator,
design upscaling filters in LR space for periodic sub-locations respectively
and shuffle the filter results to derive the final reconstruction errors in HR

complexity of the upscaling operation by utilizing shuffling operation to avoid
complex operation in HR space, but also realize superior performance with fewer
blurring artifacts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique, whilst, combining the
proposed technique with bilateral total variation (BTV) regu-larization, the

giving the maximum upper bound on the size of a stable structure. In this work
we derive an analytical expression of $R_{\rm TA,max}$ for this model using
cosmological scalar perturbation theory. Using this we numerically constrain
the parameter space, including a bulk cosmological constant and the Weyl fluid,
from the mass versus observed size data for some nearby, non-virial cosmic

both larger and smaller than that of the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$, as the input in
our analysis. We show in particular, that a) with a vanishing bulk cosmological
constant the predicted upper bound is always greater than what is actually
observed; similar conclusion holds if the bulk cosmological constant is
negative b) if it is positive, the predicted maximum size can go considerably
below than what is actually observed and owing to the involved nature of the

the stress diffusion term can be interpreted either as a consequence of a
nonlocal energy storage mechanism or as a consequence of a nonlocal entropy
production mechanism, while different interpretations of the stress diffusion
mechanism lead to different evolution equations for the temperature. The
benefits of the knowledge of the thermodynamical background of the derived
models are documented in the study of nonlinear stability of equilibrium rest
states. The derived models open up the possibility to study fully coupled
thermomechanical problems involving viscoelastic rate-type fluids with stress
diffusion.

integrable systems was discovered. In the diffusionless limit, this is
equivalent to a certain ""Bethe-Boltzmann"" kinetic equation, which has the form
of an integro-differential conservation law in $(1+1)$D. The purpose of the
present work is to investigate the sense in which the Bethe-Boltzmann equation
defines an ""integrable kinetic equation"". To this end, we study a class of $N$
dimensional systems of evolution equations that arise naturally as
finite-dimensional approximations to the Bethe-Boltzmann equation. We obtain
non-local Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian densities for these equations and
derive an infinite family of first integrals, parameterized by $N$ functional
degrees of freedom. We find that the conserved charges arising from quantum
integrability map to Casimir invariants of the hydrodynamic bracket and their
group velocities map to Hamiltonian flows. Some results from the
finite-dimensional setting extend to the underlying integro-differential
equation, providing evidence for its integrability in the hydrodynamic sense.

on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from
over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal
dependences, and exogenous dependences need to be considered simultaneously,
however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We
propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional
long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences
within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by
multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM
layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and
the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the
spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A
tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance
of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection.
The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger
demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China.
Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing,
show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional
approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and neural
network based algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network and LSTM). This paper
is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of
an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal
correlations.

stochastic gradient descent method (SGD). Although the SGD iteration is
computationally cheap and the practical performance of this method may be
satisfactory under certain circumstances, there is recent evidence of its
convergence difficulties and instability for unappropriate parameters choice.
To avoid these drawbacks naturally introduced by the SGD scheme, the stochastic
proximal point algorithms have been recently considered in the literature. We
introduce a new variant of the stochastic proximal point method (SPP) for
solving stochastic convex optimization problems subject to (in)finite
intersection of constraints satisfying a linear regularity type condition. For
the newly introduced SPP scheme we prove new nonasymptotic convergence results.
In particular, for convex and Lipschitz continuous objective functions, we
prove nonasymptotic estimates for the rate of convergence in terms of the
expected value function gap of order $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{1/2})$, where $k$ is the
iteration counter. We also derive better nonasymptotic bounds for the rate of
convergence in terms of expected quadratic distance from the iterates to the
optimal solution for smooth strongly convex objective functions, which in the
best case is of order $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$. Since these convergence rates can be
attained by our SPP algorithm only under some natural restrictions on the
stepsize, we also introduce a restarting variant of SPP method that overcomes
these difficulties and derive the corresponding nonasymptotic convergence
rates. Numerical evidence supports the effectiveness of our methods in
real-world problems.

that systems with $S \geq 3/2$ reside in the classical regime where the
low-temperature physics is dominated by the formation of coplanar spirals and a
thermal (order-by-disorder) transition. For smaller local moments $S$=1 or
$S$=1/2 we find that the system evades a thermal ordering transition and forms
a quantum spiral spin liquid where the fluctuations are restricted to
characteristic momentum-space surfaces. For the tetragonal phase of
NiRh$_{\text 2}$O$_{\text 4}$, a modified $J_1$-$J_2^-$-$J_2^\perp$ exchange
model is found to favor a conventionally ordered N\'eel state (for arbitrary

it requires additional sources of frustration to explain the experimentally
observed absence of a thermal ordering transition.

presence of a peculiar strong two-fold magnetic anisotropy (MA) along the

This MA shows unknown behavior that the easy magnetization axis rotates by

this phenomenon to the transition between the eg and t2g bands at the LSMO

analysis is carried out for the shocked wind structure, to evaluate the
distances over which the jet-dragged wind, which forms a tail, can propagate

quick wind bubble expansion and fragmentation after about one bubble shock

local mixing in the case of strong perturbations and relatively small density
ratios between the jet and the jet dragged-wind, and to a possibly more stable
shocked wind structure at the phase of maximum tail mass flux. Analytical
estimates also indicate that very early stages of the star jet-penetration time

results from the literature suggest highly unstable interaction structures and
efficient wind-jet flow mixing on the scale of the jet interaction height,
possibly producing strong inhomogeneities within the jet. In addition, the

oscillators of distributed natural frequencies, which serves as a paradigm to
investigate spontaneous collective synchronization in many-body interacting

and an additional non-local interaction on a one-dimensional periodic lattice.
Remarkably, the phase diagram involves both equilibrium and non-equilibrium
phase transitions. In two contrasting limits of the dynamics, we obtain exact
analytical results for the phase transitions. These two limits correspond to
(i) the absence of thermal noise, when the dynamics reduces to that of a
non-linear dynamical system, and (ii) the oscillators having the same natural

with a heat bath and relaxing to a statistical equilibrium state. In the former
case, our exact analysis is based on the use of the so-called Ott-Antonsen
ansatz to derive a reduced set of nonlinear partial differential equations for
the macroscopic evolution of the system. Our results for the case of
statistical equilibrium are on the other hand obtained by extending the
well-known transfer matrix approach for nearest-neighbor Ising model to
consider non-local interactions. The work offers a case study of exact analysis

heat-flux profile, containing approximately 60% of the total heat flux to the
target, and also shows a tendency towards higher frequency shorter lived
fluctuations in the ion-saturation current. This is consistent with short-
lived divertor localised filamentary structures observed further down the outer
divertor leg in the camera images, and suggests a complex multi-region picture
of filamentary transport in the divertor.

rigorously estimate the solving degree of a system, focusing on systems arising
within public-key cryptography. In particular, we show that it is upper bounded
by, and often equal to, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the ideal
generated by the homogenization of the equations of the system, or by the
equations themselves in case they are homogeneous. We discuss the underlying
commutative algebra and clarify under which assumptions the commonly used
results hold. In particular, we discuss the assumption of being in generic
coordinates (often required for bounds obtained following this type of
approach) and prove that systems that contain the field equations or their fake
Weil descent are in generic coordinates. We also compare the notion of solving

they become giant planet cores. Simultaneously, these embryos mutually interact
and also migrate due to torques arising from the protoplanetary disk.
  Aims: Our aim is to investigate how pebble accretion alters the orbital
evolution of embryos undergoing the Type-I migration. In particular, we study
whether they establish resonant chains, whether these chains are prone to
instabilities and if giant planet cores form through embryo merging, thus
occurring more rapidly than by pebble accretion alone.
  Methods: For the first time, we perform self-consistent global-scale
radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a two-fluid protoplanetary disk
consisting of gas and pebbles, the latter being accreted by embedded embryos.
Accretion heating, along with other radiative processes, is accounted for to
correctly model the Type-I migration.
  Results: We track the evolution of four super-Earth-like embryos, initially
located in a region where the disk structure allows for a convergent migration.
Generally, embryo merging is facilitated by rapidly increasing embryo masses
and breaks the otherwise oligarchic growth. Moreover, we find that the orbital
eccentricity of each embryo is considerably excited ($\simeq0.03$) due to the
presence of an asymmetric underdense lobe of gas, a so-called `hot trail',
produced by accretion heating of the embryo's vicinity. Eccentric orbits lead
the embryos to frequent close encounters and make resonant locking more
difficult.
  Conclusions: Embryo merging typically produces one massive core ($\gtrsim
10\,\mathrm{M_{E}}$) in our simulations, orbiting near $10\,\mathrm{AU}$.
Pebble accretion is naturally accompanied by occurrence of eccentric orbits
which should be considered in future efforts to explain the structure of
exoplanetary systems.

forward the bearing of acknowledgements in the humanities to bring to the
foreground contributions and interactions that, otherwise, would remain
invisible through traditional indicators of research performance.
  Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to
understanding acknowledgements as part of the reward system with a special
focus on its value in the humanities as a reflection of intellectual
indebtedness. The distinctive features of research in the humanities are
outlined and the role of acknowledgements as a source of contributorship
information is reviewed to support these assumptions.
  Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing support thanked in
the acknowledgements of humanities, so the notion of acknowledgements as
super-citations can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored
papers still predominate as publishing pattern in this domain, the study of
acknowledgements might help to understand social interactions and intellectual
influences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through
authorship.
  Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing
acknowledgement types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show
the role of acknowledgements within the reward system and highlight publication
patterns and inherent research features which make acknowledgements
particularly interesting in the area as reflection of the socio-cognitive
structure of research.

flows to examine and control the transfer of kinetic energy. Spatial modes
extracted from the flow field with corresponding amplitudes form a set of
oscillators describing unsteady fluctuations. These oscillators are connected
through a network that captures the energy exchanges amongst them. To extract
the network of interactions among oscillators, amplitude and phase
perturbations are impulsively introduced to the oscillators and the ensuing
dynamics are analyzed. Using linear regression techniques, a networked
oscillator model is constructed that reveals energy transfers and phase
interactions among the modes. The model captures the nonlinear interactions
amongst the modal oscillators through a linear approximation. A large
collection of system responses are aggregated into a network model that
captures interactions for general perturbations. The networked oscillator model
describes the modal perturbation dynamics better than the empirical Galerkin
reduced-order models. A model-based feedback controller is then designed to
suppress modal amplitudes and the resulting wake unsteadiness leading to drag
reduction. The strength of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a
canonical example of two- dimensional unsteady flow over a circular cylinder.
The present formulation enables the characterization of modal interactions to
control fundamental energy transfers in unsteady vortical flows.

terrestrial and astrophysical processes. While energy dynamics, i.e. how energy
is transferred within and between kinetic and magnetic reservoirs, has been
previously studied in the context of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence, we extend shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis to the
compressible regime. We derive four new transfer functions specifically
capturing compressibility effects in the kinetic and magnetic cascade, and
capturing energy exchange via magnetic pressure. To illustrate their viability,
we perform and analyze four simulations of driven isothermal MHD turbulence in
the sub- and supersonic regime with two different codes. On the one hand, our
analysis reveals robust characteristics across regime and numerical method. For
example, energy transfer between individual scales is local and forward for
both cascades with the magnetic cascade being stronger than the kinetic one.
Magnetic tension and magnetic pressure related transfers are less local and
weaker than the cascades. We find no evidence for significant nonlocal
transfer. On the other hand, we show that certain functions, e.g., the
compressive component of the magnetic energy cascade, exhibit a more complex
behavior that varies both with regime and numerical method. Having established
a basis for the analysis in the compressible regime, the method can now be
applied to study a broader parameter space.

to be the ubiquitous (low-velocity and poorly-collimated) molecular outflows
and (high-velocity and highly-collimated) protostellar jets accompanying the
earliest phase of star formation that remove angular momentum at a range of
disk radii. Previous observations suggested that outflowing material carries
away the excess angular momentum via magneto-centrifugally driven winds from
the surfaces of circumstellar disks down to ~ 10 AU scales, allowing the
material in the outer disk to transport to the inner disk. Here we show that
highly collimated protostellar jets remove the residual angular momenta at the
~ 0.05 AU scale, enabling the material in the innermost region of the disk to
accrete toward the central protostar. This is supported by the rotation of the
jet measured down to ~ 10 AU from the protostar in the HH 212 protostellar
system. The measurement implies a jet launching radius of ~
0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.05} AU on the disk, based on the magneto-centrifugal theory of
jet production, which connects the properties of the jet measured at large

analysis and spatial statistics, especially those involving Gibbs random
fields. Posterior parameter es timation in these settings is termed a
doubly-intractable problem because both the likelihood function and the
posterior distribution are intractable. The comparison of Bayesian models is
often based on the statistical evidence, the integral of the un-normalised
posterior distribution over the model parameters which is rarely available in
closed form. For doubly-intractable models, estimating the evidence adds
another layer of difficulty. Consequently, the selection of the model that best
describes an observed network among a collection of exponential random graph
models for network analysis is a daunting task. Pseudolikelihoods offer a
tractable approximation to the likelihood but should be treated with caution
because they can lead to an unreasonable inference. This paper specifies a
method to adjust pseudolikelihoods in order to obtain a reasonable, yet
tractable, approximation to the likelihood. This allows implementation of
widely used computational methods for evidence estimation and pursuit of
Bayesian model selection of exponential random graph models for the analysis of
social networks. Empirical comparisons to existing methods show that our
procedure yields similar evidence estimates, but at a lower computational cost.

across a broad range pressures. The corresponding pressure coefficients are
significantly smaller than that of diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), whose
pressure coefficient is the smallest value ever measured by experiment. The
robustness originates from the synchronous change of valence band maximum (VBM)

partial differential equation based image compression. The data that yields the
most accurate reconstruction is real-valued. Thus, quantisation models are
mandatory to allow an efficient encoding. These can also be understood as
challenging data clustering problems. Although clustering approaches are well
suited for this kind of compression codecs, very few works actually consider
them. Each pixel has a global impact on the reconstruction and optimal data
locations are strongly correlated with their corresponding colour values. These
facts make it hard to predict which feature works best.
  In this paper we discuss quantisation strategies based on popular methods
such as k-means. We are lead to the central question which kind of feature
vectors are best suited for image compression. To this end we consider choices
such as the pixel values, the histogram or the colour map.
  Our findings show that the number of colours can be reduced significantly
without impacting the reconstruction quality. Surprisingly, these benefits do
not directly translate to a good image compression performance. The gains in
the compression ratio are lost due to increased storage costs. This suggests
that it is integral to evaluate the clustering on both, the reconstruction
error and the final file size.

find that the environmental conditions are such that the cyclotron maser
instability (CMI), the process responsible for the generation of radio waves at
magnetic planets in the solar system, most likely will not operate at Hot
Jupiters. Hydrodynamically expanding atmospheres possess extended ionospheres
whose plasma densities within the magnetosphere are so large that the plasma
frequency is much higher than the cyclotron frequency, which contradicts the
condition for the production of radio emission and prevents the escape of radio
waves from close-in exoplanets at distances <0.05 AU from a Sun-like host star.
The upper atmosphere structure of gas giants around stars similar to the Sun
changes between 0.2 and 0.5 AU from the hydrodynamic to a hydrostatic regime
and this results in conditions similar to solar system planets with a region of
depleted plasma between the exobase and the magnetopause where the plasma
frequency can be lower than the cyclotron frequency. In such an environment, a
beam of highly energetic electrons accelerated along the field lines towards
the planet can produce radio emission. However, even if the CMI could operate
the extended ionospheres of Hot Jupiters are too dense to let the radio
emission escape from the planets.

indispensable for code design for physical layer communications. While
lattice-related problems are interesting in their own right, the usefulness of
these discrete structures in wireless communications provides additional
motivation for their study and enables a multidisciplinary line of research.
  This thesis is devoted to the study of lattice code design for physical layer
communications. Modern wireless communication networks are required to
accommodate significantly varied types of mobile devices, differing in
available computational power or number of equipped antennas. Additionally, the
density of the networks increases rapidly, and many communication protocols
diverge from the classical direct point-to-point transmission in favor of
allowing for intermediate relays to process and forward data. An important
consequence of this shift towards more sophisticated transmission protocols is
that traditional well-performing codes become futile for modern communications,
thus the study and development of novel codes is called for.
  Yet, however involved a transmission protocol may be, the characteristics of
the physical medium, i.e., the wireless channel, stay unaffected. It is thus
natural that an underlying lattice structure for code design remains crucial.
This thesis consists of several articles considering lattice code design for
four different communication settings relevant in modern wireless
communications.

can be optionally polarized in x- or y-direction, depending on the ferrovalley

optimized to emit circularly polarized radiation with specific chirality and to
realize the tunability for operating wavelength. Therefore, we show that

behind this method is to introduce different average momenta for the two

innovation that they depend on the transferred energies and momenta. This
method treats exactly the two-body phase space kinematics, and reduces the
formulae of the response functions from seven-dimensional integrals over

is checked by comparing with the full results within a model of electroweak

report that the shear stress $\sigma$ scales with strain rate $\dot \gamma$ as
$\sigma \sim \dot \gamma^{1-\Delta}$, with values of the exponent ranging
between $2/3 <\Delta \le 1$. However it remains unclear what properties of the
system select the value of $\Delta$, and in particular under what conditions
the system displays a yield stress ($\Delta = 1$). To address these questions,
we perform simulations of a minimalistic model system in which particles
interact via long ranged magnetic dipole forces, finite ranged elastic
repulsion, and viscous damping. We find a surprising dependence of the apparent
exponent $\Delta$ on the form of the viscous force law. For experimentally
relevant values of the volume fraction $\phi$ and the dimensionless Mason
number (which quantifies the competition between viscous and magnetic
stresses), models using a Stokes-like drag force show $\Delta \approx 0.75$ and
no apparent yield stress. When dissipation occurs at the contact, however, a
clear yield stress plateau is evident in the steady state flow curves. In
either case, increasing $\phi$ towards the jamming transition suffices to
induce a yield stress. We relate these qualitatively distinct flow curves to
clustering mechanisms at the particle scale. For Stokes-like drag, the system
builds up anisotropic, chain-like clusters as the Mason number tends to zero
(vanishing strain rate and/or high field strength). For contact damping, by
contrast, there is a second clustering mechanism due to inelastic collisions.

kernel. All keystrokes, including fake keystrokes, are carefully propagated
through the shared library in order to hide any cache activity and thus to
prevent Flush+Reload attacks. Finally, we provide additional protection against
Prime+Probe for password input in user space programs. We show that attackers
cannot distinguish fake keystrokes from real keystrokes anymore and we evaluate
KeyDrown on a commodity notebook as well as on two Android smartphones. We show
that KeyDrown eliminates any advantage an attacker can gain from using

wavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources whose existence and
properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations: novelties or
even anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty
detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called
one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns
among sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the
whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set
of objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database,
present also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose
patterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with
the model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with
spurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of
genuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample
of heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky
and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also
allowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and
compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with
standard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by
accounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are
otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds
flexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the
reliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus
considered as an essential step in supervised classification schemes to ensure
completeness and purity of produced catalogues.

Water maser models predict that several THz water masers should be detectable
in these objects. We present SOFIA observations of the o-H2O 8(2,7)-7(3,4) line
at 1296.41106 GHz and a 6(1,6)-5(2,3) 22 GHz e-MERLIN map of the region
(first-ever 22 GHz images made after the e-MERLIN upgrade). In order to be able
to constrain the nature of the emission - thermal or maser - we use
near-simultaneous observations of the 22 GHz water maser performed with the
Effelsberg radiotelescope and e-MERLIN. A thermal water model using the RATRAN
radiative transfer code is presented based on HIFI pointed observations.
Molecular water abundances are derived for the hot core. The H2O 8(2,7)- 7(3,4)
line is detected toward NGC7538-IRS1 with one feature at the source velocity
(-57.7 km/s) and another one at -48.4 km/s. We propose that the emission at the
source velocity is consistent with thermal excitation and is excited in the
innermost part of the IRS1a massive protostellar object's closest circumstellar
environment. The other emission is very likely the first detection of a water
THz maser line, pumped by shocks due to IRS1b outflow, in a star-forming
region. Assuming thermal excitation of the THz line, the water abundance in
NGC7538-IRS1's hot core is estimated to be 5.2x10^{-5} with respect to H2.

solution of first-principle physical models, usually expressed as Partial

allow optimization, what-if or sensitivity analyses, and design centering.

Generalized Sanathanan-Koerner iteration, we construct a parameter-dependent
Skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian matrix pencil. The iterative extraction of purely
imaginary eigenvalues ot fhe pencil, combined with an adaptive sampling scheme
in the parameter space, is able to identify all regions in the
frequency-parameter plane where local passivity violations occur. Then, a
singular value perturbation scheme is setup to iteratively correct the model
coefficients, until all local passivity violations are eliminated. The final
result is a corrected model, which is uniformly passive throughout the
parameter range. Several numerical examples denomstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

The analysis is performed at the maximum known order in perturbation theory. We
unveil a very rich dynamics and associated phase structure. Intriguingly we
discover that the complete asymptotically free conditions guarantee that the
infrared dynamics displays long distance conformality, and in a regime when
perturbation theory is applicable. We conclude our analysis by determining the
quantum corrected potential of the theory and summarising the possible patterns
of radiative symmetry breaking. These theories are of potential

properties of close-packed frictionless granular assemblies as a function of
particle polydispersity and shape. Unlike some experimental results,
simulations show that disordered packings of pinacoids (eight-face convex
polyhedron) achieve higher solid fraction values than amorphous packings of
spherical or rounded particles, thus fulfilling the analogue of Ulam's
conjecture stated by Jiao and co-workers for random packings [Y. Jiao and S.
Torquato, Phys. Rev. E $\textbf{84}$, $041309$ ($2011$)]. This seeming
discrepancy between experimental and numerical results is believed to lie with
difficulties in overcoming interparticle friction through experimental
densification processes. Moreover, solid fraction is shown to increase further
with bidispersity and peak when the volume proportion of small particles
reaches $30\%$. Contrarywise, substituting up to $50\%$ of flat pinacoids for
isometric ones yields solid fraction decrease, especially when flat particles
are also elongated. Nevertheless, particle shape seems to play a minor role on
packing solid fraction compared to polydispersity. Additional investigations
focused on the packing microstructure confirm that pinacoid packings fulfill
the isostatic conjecture and that they are free of order except beyond $30$ to
$50\%$ of flat or flat \& elongated polyhedra in the packing. This order
increase progressively takes the form of a nematic phase caused by the
reorientation of flat or flat \& elongated particles to minimize the packing
potential energy. Simultaneously, this reorientation seems to increase the
solid fraction value slightly above the maximum achieved by monodisperse
isometric pinacoids, as well as the coordination number. Finally, partial
substitution of elongated pinacoids for isometric ones has limited effect on
packing solid fraction or order.

approach is to use L2,1 norm function as a robust error/loss function. However,
the robustness of L2,1 norm function is not well understood so far. In this
paper, we propose a new Vector Outlier Regularization (VOR) framework to
understand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Our VOR function
defines a data point to be outlier if it is outside a threshold with respect to
a theoretical prediction, and regularize it-pull it back to the threshold line.
We then prove that L2,1 function is the limiting case of this VOR with the
usual least square/L2 error function as the threshold shrinks to zero. One
interesting property of VOR is that how far an outlier lies away from its
theoretically predicted value does not affect the final regularization and
analysis results. This VOR property unmasks one of the most peculiar property
of L2,1 norm function: The effects of outliers seem to be independent of how
outlying they are-if an outlier is moved further away from the intrinsic
manifold/subspace, the final analysis results do not change. VOR provides a new
way to understand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Applying
VOR to matrix factorization leads to a new VORPCA model. We give a
comprehensive comparison with trace-norm based L21-norm PCA to demonstrate the
advantages of VORPCA.

using conventionally, however the QA schedule mathematically has no guarantee

is made for the comparison between the system with no transverse field and the
system with the smallest effective transverse field. As a case study, we study
QA of the Ising spin glass model on the square lattice at low but finite

show superiority of QA against CA when the annealing time is sufficiently

of the dwarf irregular galaxy IC\,10, observed using the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope, probing $\sim45$ pc spatial scales. We find the galaxy-averaged
radio continuum spectrum to be relatively flat, with a spectral index $\alpha =
-0.34\pm0.01$ ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), mainly due to a high contribution
from free--free emission. At 0.32 GHz, some of the H{\sc ii} regions show
evidence of free--free absorption as they become optically thick below
$\sim0.41$ GHz with corresponding free electron densities of $\sim11-22~\rm
cm^{-3}$. After removing the free--free emission, we studied the
radio--infrared relations on 55, 110 and 165 pc spatial scales. We find that on
all scales the non-thermal emission at 0.32 and 6.2 GHz correlates better with
far-infrared (FIR) emission at $70\,\mu$m than mid-infrared emission at
$24\,\mu$m. The dispersion of the radio--FIR relation arises due to variations
in both magnetic field and dust temperature, and decreases systematically with
increasing spatial scale. The effect of cosmic ray transport is negligible as
cosmic ray electrons were only injected $\lesssim5$ Myr ago. The average
magnetic field strength ($B$) of $12~\mu$G in the disc is comparable to that of
large star-forming galaxies. The local magnetic field is strongly correlated
with local star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR}$) as $B \propto
\mathrm{SFR}^{0.35\pm0.03}$, indicating a star-burst driven fluctuation dynamo
to be efficient ($\sim10$ per cent) in amplifying the field in IC\,10. The high
spatial resolution observations presented here suggest that the high efficiency

$\mathbb F_p^n$ to $\mathbb F_p$, $f$ can be affine on a subspace of dimension
at most $n/2$, $(n-1)/2$ or $n/2- 1$. We point out that many $p$-ary bent

one can show a different behaviour. This resembles the situation for Boolean
bent functions of which many are (weakly) $n/2$-normal, i.e. affine on a
$n/2$-dimensional subspace. However applying an algorithm by Canteaut et.al.,
some Boolean bent functions were shown to be not $n/2$- normal. We develop an
algorithm for testing normality for functions from $\mathbb F_p^n$ to $\mathbb

show that they do not take on the bound on normality. Applying direct sum of

to send signals non-orthogonally. Although different SCMA codebooks are
orthogonal and produce no interference over each other, the same codebook used
by multiple users produces interference over these users. We investigate the
signal model as well as the receiver and transmitter of the PSMA method. To
evaluate the performance of PSMA, we consider a heterogeneous cellular network

during deformation. Recently, researchers have been applying fractional
calculus in order for probing viscoelasticity of such materials with a high
precision. Fractional calculus is a powerful tool for modeling complex
phenomenon. In this tutorial based paper, we try present clear descriptions of
the fractional calculus, its techniques and its implementation. The intention
is to keep the details to a minimum while still conveying a good idea of what
and how can be done with this powerful tool. We try to expose the reader to the
basic techniques that are used to solve the fractional equations analytically
and/or numerically. More specifically, modeling the shape memory phenomena with
this powerful tool are studied from different perspectives, as well as
presented some physical interpretation in this case. Moreover, in order to show
the relationship between fractional models and standard linear equations, a
fractal system comprising spring and damper elements is considered, and the
constitutive equation is approximated with a fractional element. Finally, after
a brief literature review, two fractional models are utilized to investigate
the viscoelasticity of the cell, and the comparison is made among them,
experimental data, and previous models. Verification results indicate that not
only does the fractional model match the experimental data well, but it also
can be a good substitute for previously used models.

used approach is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo
stress correlation function into the correlation functions between the atomic
level stresses. Previously we used the approach to study an iron-like single
component system of particles. The role of vibrational motion has been
addressed through the demonstration of the relationship between viscosity and
the shear waves propagating over large distances. In our previous
considerations, however, we did not discuss the role of the structural
relaxation. Here we suggest that the contribution to viscosity from the
structural relaxation can be taken into account through the consideration of
the contribution from the atomic stress auto-correlation term only. This
conclusion, however, does not mean that only the auto-correlation term
represents the contribution to viscosity from the structural relaxation.
Previously the role of the structural relaxation for viscosity has been
addressed through the considerations of the transitions between inherent
structures and within the mode-coupling theory by other authors. In the present
work, we study the structural relaxation through the considerations of the
parent liquid and the atomic level stress correlations in it. The comparison
with the results obtained on the inherent structures also is made. Our results
suggest that in the supercooled liquid regime the vibrational contribution to
viscosity extends over the times which are much larger than the Einstein's
vibrational period and much larger than the times which it takes for the shear
waves to propagate over the model systems. Besides addressing the atomic level
shear stress correlations, we also studied correlations between the atomic
level pressure elements.

inefficient once an initial solution is found as then only states that can

  This paper formally defines these sets of states and demonstrates how they
can be used to analyze arbitrary planning problems. It uses the well-known
$L^2$ norm (i.e., Euclidean distance) to analyze minimum-path-length problems
and shows that existing approaches decrease in effectiveness factorially (i.e.,
faster than exponentially) with state dimension. It presents a method to
address this curse of dimensionality by directly sampling the prolate
hyperspheroids (i.e., symmetric $n$-dimensional ellipses) that define the $L^2$
informed set.
  The importance of this direct informed sampling technique is demonstrated
with Informed RRT*. This extension of RRT* has less theoretical dependence on
state dimension and problem size than existing techniques and allows for linear
convergence on some problems. It is shown experimentally to find better
solutions faster than existing techniques on both abstract planning problems
and HERB, a two-arm manipulation robot.

Mumford-Shah functional that has been widely used for image segmentation. The
approximation has the advantages of being easy to implement, maintaining the
segmentation ability, and $\Gamma$-converging to the Mumford-Shah functional.
However, it has been observed in actual computation that the segmentation
ability of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional varies significantly with
different values of the parameter and it even fails to $\Gamma$-converge to the
original functional for some cases. In this paper we present an asymptotic
analysis on the gradient flow equation of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional
and show that the functional can have different segmentation behavior for small
but finite values of the regularization parameter and eventually loses its
segmentation ability as the parameter goes to zero when the input image is
treated as a continuous function. This is consistent with the existing
observation as well as the numerical examples presented in this work. A
selection strategy for the regularization parameter and a scaling procedure for
the solution are devised based on the analysis. Numerical results show that
they lead to good segmentation of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional for real

experiments such as paired designs suffer from certain analytical limitations
not present in block-randomized experiments with multiple treated and control
individuals in each block. In short, when using an appropriately weighted
difference-in-means to estimated the sample average treatment effect, the
traditional variance estimator in a paired experiment is conservative unless
the pairwise average treatment effects are constant across pairs; however, in
more coarsely stratified experiments, the corresponding variance estimator is
unbiased if treatment effects are constant within blocks, even if they vary
across blocks. Using insights from classical least squares theory, we present
an improved variance estimator appropriate in finely stratified experiments.
The variance estimator is still conservative in expectation for the true
variance of the difference-in-means estimator, but is asymptotically no larger
than the classical variance estimator under mild conditions. The improvements
stem from the exploitation of effect modification, and thus the magnitude of
the improvement depends upon on the extent to which effect heterogeneity can be
explained by observed covariates. Aided by these estimators, a new test for the
null hypothesis of a constant treatment effect is proposed. These findings
extend to some, but not all, super-population models, depending on whether or
not the covariates are viewed as fixed across samples in the super-population
formulation under consideration.

associative algebra of linear growth is automaton, that is, whether the set of
normal words in the algebra form a regular language. If the algebra is graded,
then the rationality of the Hilbert series of the algebra follows from the
affirmative answer to Ufnarovski's question. Assuming that the ground field has
a positive characteristic, we show that the answer to Ufnarovskii's question is
positive if and only if the basic field is an algebraic extension of its prime
subfield. Moreover, in the ""only if"" part we show that there exists a finitely
presented graded algebra of linear growth with irrational Hilbert series. In
addition, over an arbitrary infinite basic field, the set of Hilbert series of
the quadratic algebras of linear growth with $5$ generators is infinite.
  Our approach is based on a connection with the dynamical Mordell--Lang
conjecture. This conjecture describes the intersection of an orbit of an
algebraic variety endomorphism with a subvariety. We show that the positive
answer to Ufnarovski's question implies some known cases of the dynamical
Mordell--Lang conjecture. In particular, the positive answer for a class of
algebras is equivalent to the Skolem--Mahler--Lech theorem which says that the
set of the zero elements of any linear recurrent sequence over a zero
characteristic field is the finite union of several arithmetic progressions. In
particular, the counter-examples to this theorem in the finite characteristic

luminosities and the outburst durations are one order of magnitude lower. We

binaries. The $L_\mathrm{hard-to-soft}$ of the mini-outbursts is still higher
than that of the persistent BH binary Cyg X-1, which supports that there is a
link between the maximum luminosity a source can reach in the hard state and
the corresponding non-stationary accretion represented by substantial
rate-of-change in the mass accretion rate during flares/outbursts. The detected
luminosity range of these two mini-outbursts is roughly in 3.5$\times

X-ray spectra of other BH transients at such low luminosities are usually
dominated by a power-law component, and an anti-correlation is observed between
the photon index and the X-ray luminosity below 1\% $L_\mathrm{Edd}$. So the
detection of X-ray spectral state transitions indicates that the accretion flow

While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the

gives rise to uncertainties due to subjectivity. Since the microstructure could
be a combination of different phases or constituents with complex substructures
its automatic classification is very challenging and only a few prior studies
exist. Prior works focused on designed and engineered features by experts and
classified microstructures separately from the feature extraction step.
Recently, Deep Learning methods have shown strong performance in vision
applications by learning the features from data together with the

Velocity criterion: radial velocity difference between the pair members $\Delta
V<500$ km.s$^{-1}$; 2) Interdistance criterion: projected distance between the
members $r_p<1$ Mpc; 3) Reciprocity criterion: each member is the closest
galaxy to the other one, which excludes multiplets; 4) Isolation criterion: we
define a pair as isolated if the ratio $\rho=r_3/r_p$ of the projected distance
of the pair to its closest galaxy (this one having a velocity difference lower
than 500 km.s$^{-1}$ with respect to the pair) and the members projected
interdistance $r_p$ is larger than 2.5. We have searched for these closest

faint dwarf galaxy companions. The galaxy pair catalog lists the value of
$\rho$ for each isolated pair. This method allows the user of the catalog to
select any isolation level (beyond the chosen limit $\rho>2.5$). Our final

solve even simple instances of the problem. The presented algorithm uses an
enhanced policy iteration on symbolic representations of the action space. The
soundness of the algorithm is established for parametric ACTMCs with
alarm-event distributions satisfying four mild assumptions that are shown to
hold for uniform, Dirac and Weibull distributions in particular, but are
satisfied for many other distributions as well. An experimental implementation
shows that the symbolic technique substantially improves the efficiency of the
synthesis algorithm and allows to solve instances of realistic size.

in recent times, especially with the advent of deep neural networks. However,
the majority of autonomous RL algorithms require a large number of interactions
with the environment. A large number of interactions may be impractical in many
real-world applications, such as robotics, and many practical systems have to
obey limitations in the form of state space or control constraints. To reduce
the number of system interactions while simultaneously handling constraints, we
propose a model-based RL framework based on probabilistic Model Predictive
Control (MPC). In particular, we propose to learn a probabilistic transition
model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to incorporate model uncertainty into
long-term predictions, thereby, reducing the impact of model errors. We then
use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost.
We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality in the GP-based

difficult to solve in general. Combinatorial search methods such as
branch-and-bound and exhaustive search find the global optimal solution but are
confined to small-sized problems, while coordinate descent methods such as
coordinate gradient descent are efficient but often suffer from poor local
minima. In this paper, we consider a hybrid method that combines the
effectiveness of combinatorial search and the efficiency of coordinate descent.
Specifically, we consider random strategy or/and greedy strategy to select a
subset of coordinates as the working set, and then perform global combinatorial
search over the working set based on the original objective function. In
addition, we provide some optimality analysis and convergence analysis for the
proposed method. Our method finds stronger stationary points than existing
methods. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on some sparse
optimization and binary optimization applications. As a result, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy. For example, our

nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment

WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a
genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic

an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are

pairs just can be handed over to another middlebox. It is hence particularly
attractive for incremental deployments.We prove that the achieved
polynomial-time approximation bound is optimal, unless P = NP. This paper also
initiates the study of a weighted problem variant, in which entire groups of

simulations, that removing very small grains (VSGs: ~10 \AA$~$to few 100 \AA)
can greatly enhance ambipolar diffusion and enable the formation of RSDs. Here
we extend the simulations of disk formation enabled by VSG removal to 3D. We
find that the key to this scenario of disk formation is that the drift velocity
of the magnetic field almost cancels out the infall velocity of the neutrals in
the $10^2$-$10^3$ AU-scale ""pseudo-disk"" where the field lines are most
severely pinched and most of protostellar envelope mass infall occurs. As a
result, the bulk neutral envelope matter can collapse without dragging much
magnetic flux into the disk-forming region, which lowers the magnetic braking
efficiency. We find that the initial disks enabled by VSG removal tend to be
Toomre-unstable, which leads to the formation of prominent spiral structures

particular genuine multipartite entanglement, a type of entanglement involving
all degrees of freedoms, is subsistent if the positronium was in a definite
spin eigenstate. Remarkably, when all spin eigenstates are mixed equally,
entanglement --and even stronger genuine multipartite entanglement-- survives.
Due to a ""\textit{symmetrization}"" process, however, $Dicke$-type of
entanglement remains whereas $GHZ$-type of entanglement vanishes. The survival
of particular entanglement properties in the mixing scenario may make it
possible to extract quantum information in form of distinct entanglement

$t$-distribution noise is assumed. A Maximum Likelihood Estimator using the
most recent N measurements is proposed for the Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average

estimator is robust to outliers because the `thick tail' of the t-distribution
reduces the effect of large errors in the likelihood function. Instead of
solving the resulting nonlinear estimator numerically, the Influence Function
is used to formulate a computationally efficient recursive solution, which
reduces to the traditional Moving Horizon Estimator when the noise is Gaussian.
The formula for the variance of the estimate is derived. This formula shows
explicitly how the variance of the estimate is affected by the number of
measurements and noise variance. The simulation results show that the proposed
estimator has smaller variance and is more robust to outliers than the Moving
Window Least-Squares Estimator. For the same accuracy, the proposed estimator
is an order of magnitude faster than the particle filter.

gathered to understand the use of software in research, and is intended to
spark wider interest in gathering more data. The initial data analyzes three
months of articles in the journal Nature for software mentions. The wider
activity that we seek is a community effort to analyze a wider set of articles,
including both a longer timespan of Nature articles as well as articles in
other journals. Such a collection of data could be used to understand how the
role of software has changed over time and how it varies across fields.

parabolic variational inequalities with time dependent convex constraints. As
possible approaches to such problems, there are for instance the
time-discretization method and the fixed point method of Schauder type with
appropriate compactness theorems. In this paper, our attention is paid to the
latter approach. However, there has not been prepared any appropriate
compactness theorem up to date that enables us the direct application of fixed

establish it we have to start on the set up of a new compactness theorem for a

the points and hyperplanes of the projective spaces $PG(r,q^2)$. In finite

a similar result for the quasi-Hermitian varieties in $PG(3,q^2)$, $q=p^{h}$,

turbulent magnetic fields is often described as spatial diffusion. Recently, it
has been suggested that initially the particles propagate systematically along
meandering field lines, and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive
cross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of
1--100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant
background magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the
non-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence
parameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the
particles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently meandering
field lines. This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already
at the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field
direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The
cross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens
of hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during
solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their
initial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean
field reaches time-asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to
understand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling
must include non-diffusive particle propagation along meandering field lines.

The Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, Kendalls rank correlation,
and conditional probability were adopted to analyze the air pollution index
(API), air quality index (AQI), sunspot number (SSN), radio flux at wavelength
of 10.7 cm (F10.7), and total solar irradiance (TSI). The analysis implies that
the correlation coefficient between API and SSN is weak ($-0.17<r<0.32$) with
complex variation. The main results are: (1) For cities with higher air
pollution, the probability of high API will be increased along with SSN, then
reach to a maximum, and then decreased; (2) For cities with lower air
pollution, the API has lower correlation with SSN; (3) The relationship between
API and F10.7, or API and TSI are also similar as API and SSN. The solar
activities take direct effect on TSI and the energetic particle flux, and
indirect and long-term effect on lower atmosphere and weather near the Earth.
All of these factors contribute to the air pollution on the Earth.

were compared with experimental results to validate the mathematical model and
to define the most suitable configuration for ultrasonic detection. The sensor

the photon. These constraints are realized because excessive bremsstrahlung
radiation of the dark photon can lead to rapid cooling of the SN1987A
progenitor core, in contradiction to the observed neutrinos from that event.
The models we consider are of interest as phenomenological models of strongly
self-interacting dark matter. We clarify several possible ambiguities in the
literature and identify errors in prior analyses. We find constraints on the
dark photon mixing parameter that are in rough agreement with the early
estimates of Dent et al., but only because significant errors in their analyses
fortuitously canceled. Our constraints are in good agreement with subsequent
analyses by Rrapaj & Reddy and Hardy & Lasenby. We estimate the dark photon
bremsstrahlung rate using one-pion exchange (OPE), while Rrapaj & Reddy use a
soft radiation approximation (SRA) to exploit measured nuclear scattering cross
sections. We find that the differences between mixing parameter constraints
obtained through the OPE approximation or the SRA approximation are roughly a
factor of $\sim 2-3$. Hardy & Laseby include plasma effects in their
calculations finding significantly weaker constraints on dark photon mixing for
dark photon masses below $\sim 10\, \mathrm{MeV}$. We do not consider plasma
effects. Lastly, we point out that the properties of the SN1987A progenitor
core remain somewhat uncertain and that this uncertainty alone causes
uncertainty of at least a factor of $\sim 2-3$ in the excluded values of the
dark photon mixing parameter. Further refinement of these estimates is
unwarranted until either the interior of the SN1987A progenitor is more well
understood or additional, large, and heretofore neglected effects, are
identified.

of a generalized/weighted Laplacian matrix that depends on the stationary phase
solutions of the system and is thereby inherently conditioned by the topology

study three networks: Small-world, Random, German grid. Furthermore, we tackle
the effect of machine clustering on small perturbations and the influence of
the network's average clustering coefficient on the intensity localization of

Atwood's machine taking into account the mass of the pulley. In the usual
treatment the tensions at the two ends of the string are offhandedly taken to
act on the pulley and be responsible for its rotation. However such a free-body
diagram of the forces on the pulley is not {\it a priori} justified, inducing
students to construct wrong hypotheses such as that the string transfers its
tension to the pulley or that some symmetry is in operation. We reexamine this
problem by integrating the contact forces between each element of the string
and the pulley and show that although the pulley does behave as if the tensions
were acting on it, this comes only as the end result of a detailed analysis. We
also address the question of how much friction is needed to prevent the string
from slipping over the pulley. Finally, we deal with the case in which the
string is on the verge of sliding and show that this will never happen unless
certain conditions are met by the coefficient of friction and the masses

clinical applications, such as 1) narrow band imaging for vascular

clinical decision making [1]; 3) tissue classification and identification of
pathology [2]. The current systems which provide pixel-level HSI/MSI signal can
be generally divided into two types: spatial scanning and spectral scanning.
However, the trade-off between spatial/spectral resolution, the acquisition
time, and the hardware complexity hampers implementation in real-world
applications, especially intra-operatively. Acquiring high resolution images in
real-time is important for HSI/MSI in intra-operative imaging, to alleviate the
side effect caused by breathing, heartbeat, and other sources of motion.
Therefore, we developed an algorithm to recover a pixel-level MSI stack using

technique as ""super-spectral-resolution"". The proposed method enables recovery
of pixel-level-dense MSI signals with 24 spectral bands at ~11 frames per

novel event detection method on Twitter, tailored to detect financial and
political events that influence a specific stock market. The proposed approach
applies a bursty topic detection method on a stream of tweets related to
finance or politics followed by a classification process which filters-out
events that do not influence the examined stock market. We train our classifier
to recognise real events by using solely information about stock market
volatility, without the need of manual labeling. We model Twitter events as
feature vectors that encompass a rich variety of information, such as the
geographical distribution of tweets, their polarity, information about their
authors as well as information about bursty words associated with the event. We
show that utilizing only information about tweets polarity, like most previous
studies, results in wasting important information. We apply the proposed method
on high-frequency intra-day data from the Greek and Spanish stock market and we
show that our financial event detector successfully predicts most of the stock
market jitters.
