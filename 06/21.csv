  Application to Langevin Dynamics and SGVI","International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2017",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two popular classes of methods for approximate inference are Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference. MCMC tends to be accurate if run
for a long enough time, while variational inference tends to give better
approximations at shorter time horizons. However, the amount of time needed for
MCMC to exceed the performance of variational methods can be quite high,
motivating more fine-grained tradeoffs. This paper derives a distribution over
variational parameters, designed to minimize a bound on the divergence between
the resulting marginal distribution and the target, and gives an example of how
to sample from this distribution in a way that interpolates between the
behavior of existing methods based on Langevin dynamics and stochastic gradient
variational inference (SGVI).

corollary, we show, using the results of Demonet and Liu in \cite{DL}, that the
category of finite presentation modules on the costable category
$\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ is a localization of $\mathcal{E}$. We also deduce
that $\mathcal{E} \to \mathrm{mod}\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ admits a calculus of

categories of results of Buan and Marsh in \cite{BM2}, \cite{BM1} (see also

  If $\mathcal{E}$ is a Frobenius exact category, we enhance its structure of
prefibration category to the structure of a model category (see the article of
Palu in \cite{Palu} for the case of triangulated categories). This last result
applies in particular when $\mathcal{E}$ is any of the Hom-finite Frobenius

(IoMT) is facing many challenges which range from the ingestion of data streams
coming from a vast number of fog nodes and IoMT devices to avoiding overflowing
the cloud with useless massive data streams that can trigger bottlenecks [1].
Managing data flow is becoming an important part of the IoMT because it will
dictate in which platform analytical tasks should run in the future. Data flows
are usually a sequence of out-of-order tuples with a high data input rate, and
mobility analytics requires a real-time flow of data in both directions, from
the edge to the cloud, and vice-versa. Before pulling the data streams to the
cloud, edge data stream processing is needed for detecting missing, broken, and
duplicated tuples in addition to recognize tuples whose arrival time is out of
order. Analytical tasks such as data filtering, data cleaning and low-level
data contextualization can be executed at the edge of a network. In contrast,
more complex analytical tasks such as graph processing can be deployed in the
cloud, and the results of ad-hoc queries and streaming graph analytics can be
pushed to the edge as needed by a user application. Graphs are efficient
representations used in mobility analytics because they unify knowledge about
connectivity, proximity and interaction among moving things. This poster
describes the preliminary results from our experimental prototype developed for
supporting transit systems, in which edge and cloud computing are combined to
process transit data streams forwarded from fog nodes into a cloud. The
motivation of this research is to understand how to perform meaningfulness
mobility analytics on transit feeds by combining cloud and fog computing

be transported. Alternatively, the gas may collapse into bound clumps, the
progenitors of planets or stars. In this paper, we numerically characterize the
properties of 3D gravitoturbulence, focussing especially on its dependence on
numerical parameters (resolution, domain size) and its excitation of
small-scale dynamics. Via a survey of vertically stratified shearing box
simulations with PLUTO and RODEO, we find (a) evidence that certain
gravitoturbulent properties are independent of horizontal box size only when
the box is larger than $\simeq 40 H_0$, where $H_0$ is the height scale, (b) at
high resolution, small-scale isotropic turbulence appears off the midplane
around $z\simeq 0.5 -1 H_0$, and (c) this small-scale dynamics results from a
parametric instability, involving the coupling of inertial waves with a
large-scale axisymmetric epicyclic mode. This mode oscillates at a frequency
close to $\Omega$ and is naturally excited by gravito-turbulence, via a
nonlinear process to be determined. The small-scale turbulence we uncover has
potential implications for a wide range of disc physics, e.g. turbulent
saturation levels, fragmentation, turbulent mixing, and dust settling.

a significant modification of their mass function, leading to a population of

a wide range of applications. In inverse problems that use these networks as
generative priors on data, one must often perform inference of the inputs of
the networks from the outputs. Inference is also required for sampling during
stochastic training on these generative models. This paper considers inference
in a deep stochastic neural network where the parameters (e.g., weights, biases
and activation functions) are known and the problem is to estimate the values
of the input and hidden units from the output. While several approximate
algorithms have been proposed for this task, there are few analytic tools that
can provide rigorous guarantees in the reconstruction error. This work presents
a novel and computationally tractable output-to-input inference method called
Multi-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (ML-VAMP). The proposed
algorithm, derived from expectation propagation, extends earlier AMP methods
that are known to achieve the replica predictions for optimality in simple
linear inverse problems. Our main contribution shows that the mean-squared
error (MSE) of ML-VAMP can be exactly predicted in a certain large system limit

orthogonally-invariant with dimensions that grow to infinity. ML-VAMP is thus a

octet baryons at the SU(3) flavor-symmetric point, with quark masses that are
heavier than those in nature (equal to that of the physical strange quark mass
and corresponding to a pion mass of $\approx 806~\tt{MeV}$). Specifically, the
S-wave scattering phase shifts of two-baryon systems at low energies are
obtained with the application of L\""uscher's formalism, mapping the energy
eigenvalues of two interacting baryons in a finite volume to the two-particle
scattering amplitudes below the relevant inelastic thresholds. The values of
the leading-order low-energy scattering parameters in the irreducible
representations of SU(3) are consistent with an approximate SU(6) spin-flavor
symmetry in the nuclear and hypernuclear forces that is predicted in the
large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. The two distinct SU(6)-invariant interactions between
two baryons are constrained at this value of the quark masses, and their values
indicate an approximate accidental SU(16) symmetry. The SU(3) irreducible
representations containing the $NN~({^1}S_0)$, $NN~({^3}S_1)$ and
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\Xi^0n+\Xi^-p)~({^3}S_1)$ channels unambiguously exhibit a
single bound state, while the irreducible representation containing the
$\Sigma^+ p~({^3}S_1)$ channel exhibits a state that is consistent with either
a bound state or a scattering state close to threshold. These results are in
agreement with the previous conclusions of the NPLQCD collaboration regarding
the existence of two-nucleon bound states at this value of the quark masses.

takes decisions and executes actions on our behalf. This creates a pressing
need for general means to communicate with, instruct and guide artificial

To achieve this in a scalable fashion, agents must be able to relate language
to the world and to actions; that is, their understanding of language must be
grounded and embodied. However, learning grounded language is a notoriously
challenging problem in artificial intelligence research. Here we present an
agent that learns to interpret language in a simulated 3D environment where it
is rewarded for the successful execution of written instructions. Trained via a
combination of reinforcement and unsupervised learning, and beginning with
minimal prior knowledge, the agent learns to relate linguistic symbols to
emergent perceptual representations of its physical surroundings and to
pertinent sequences of actions. The agent's comprehension of language extends
beyond its prior experience, enabling it to apply familiar language to
unfamiliar situations and to interpret entirely novel instructions. Moreover,
the speed with which this agent learns new words increases as its semantic
knowledge grows. This facility for generalising and bootstrapping semantic
knowledge indicates the potential of the present approach for reconciling
ambiguous natural language with the complexity of the physical world.

Pulsed-field gradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion is complicated, especially in
the anisotropic case where limited research has been reported. An general PFG
signal attenuation expression, including the finite gradient pulse (FGPW)
effect for free general anisotropic fractional diffusion based on the
fractional derivative, has not been obtained, where {\alpha} and \b{eta} are
time and space derivative orders. It is essential to derive a general PFG
signal attenuation expression including the FGPW effect for PFG anisotropic
anomalous diffusion research. In this paper, two recently developed
modified-Bloch equations, the fractal differential modified-Bloch equation and
the fractional integral modified-Bloch equation, were extended to obtain
general PFG signal attenuation expressions for anisotropic anomalous diffusion.
Various cases of PFG anisotropic anomalous diffusion were investigated,
including coupled and uncoupled anisotropic anomalous diffusion. The
continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulation was also carried out to support
the theoretical results. There is good agreement between the theory and the
CTRW simulation. The obtained signal attenuation expressions and the
three-dimensional fractional modified-Bloch equations are important for
analyzing PFG anisotropic anomalous diffusion in NMR and MRI.

observed, we confirm the long-term spin down at an average rate
$\dot{\nu}_{\text{SD}}=1.5(2)\times 10^{-15}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. We also discuss
possible corrections to the spin down rate accounting for mass accretion onto
the compact object when the system is X-ray active. Finally, combining the
updated ephemerides with those of the previous outbursts, we find a long-term
orbital evolution compatible with a binary expansion at a mean rate
$\dot{P}_{orb}=3.6(4)\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previously
reported values. This fast evolution is incompatible with an evolution driven
by angular momentum losses caused by gravitational radiation under the
hypothesis of conservative mass transfer. We discuss the observed orbital
expansion in terms of non-conservative mass transfer and gravitational
quadrupole coupling mechanism. We find that the latter can explain, under
certain conditions, small fluctuations (of the order of few seconds) of the
orbital period around a global parabolic trend. At the same time, a
non-conservative mass transfer is required to explain the observed fast orbital
evolution, which likely reflects ejection of a large fraction of mass from the
inner Lagrangian point caused by the irradiation of the donor by the
magneto-dipole rotator during quiescence (radio-ejection model). This strong
outflow may power tidal dissipation in the companion star and be responsible of
the gravitational quadrupole change oscillations.

viewed as the special case where $\pi_i=\infty$ for all $i$. It was widely
believed that the integrality gap of the natural (and well-studied)
linear-programming (LP) relaxation for PCSF is at most 2. We dispel this belief
by showing that the integrality gap of this LP is at least $9/4$. This holds
even for planar graphs. We also show that using this LP, one cannot devise a
Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving (LMP) algorithm with approximation guarantee
better than $4$. Our results thus show a separation between the integrality
gaps of the LP-relaxations for prize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (i.e.,

relative to the optimal LP solution by LMP- and non-LMP- approximation
algorithms for PCSF. For the special case of prize-collecting Steiner tree

with all coordinates of value at most $1/3$ and all edge variables positive.
Thus, we rule out the possibility of approximating PCST with guarantee better

multiplexing (OFDM) index modulation (IM) scheme for two-hop relay networks. In
contrast to the traditional OFDM IM scheme with a deterministic and fixed
mapping scheme, in this proposed adaptive OFDM IM scheme, the mapping schemes
between a bit stream and indices of active subcarriers for the first and second
hops are adaptively selected by a certain criterion. As a result, the active
subcarriers for the same bit stream in the first and second hops can be varied
in order to combat slow frequency-selective fading. In this way, the system
reliability can be enhanced. Additionally, considering the fact that a relay
device is normally a simple node, which may not always be able to perform
mapping scheme selection due to limited processing capability, we also propose
an alternative adaptive methodology in which the mapping scheme selection is
only performed at the source and the relay will simply utilize the selected
mapping scheme without changing it. The analyses of average outage probability,
network capacity and symbol error rate (SER) are given in closed form for
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying networks and are substantiated by numerical
results generated by Monte Carlo simulations.

three two-qubit gates via quantum process tomography. We establish the
suitability of these techniques for computation by preparing a four-qubit

the expected performance of the individual entangling gates. In addition, we
prepare an eight-qubit register in all possible bitstring permutations and
monitor the fidelity of a two-qubit gate across one pair of these qubits.
Across all such permutations, an average fidelity of $\mathcal{F}=91.6\pm2.6\%$

focus on nanotechnological applications and because they are convenient for
numerical treatment that can subsequently be extrapolated to infinite lattices.
Independently of the envisioned application, special attention must be given to
boundary condition, which may or may not preserve the symmetry of the infinite
lattice. Here we present a detailed study of the compatibility between boundary
conditions and conservation laws. The conflict between open boundary conditions
and momentum conservation is well understood, but we examine other symmetries,
as well: we discuss gauge invariance, inversion, spin, and particle-hole
symmetry and their compatibility with open, periodic, and twisted boundary
conditions. We develop the reasoning in the framework of the one-dimensional
half-filled Hubbard model, whose Hamiltonian displays a variety of symmetries.
Our discussion includes analytical and numerical results. Our analytical survey
shows that boundary conditions break one or more symmetries of the
infinite-lattice Hamiltonian. The exception is twisted boundary condition with
the special torsion $\Theta=\pi L/2$, where $L$ is the lattice size. Our
numerical results for the ground-state energy at half-filling and the energy
gap for $L=2$--$7$ show how the breaking of symmetry affects the convergence to
the $L\to\infty$ limit. We compare the computed energies and gaps with the
exact results for the infinite lattice drawn from the Bethe-Ansatz solution.
The deviations are boundary-condition dependent. The special torsion yields
more rapid convergence than open or periodic boundary conditions. For sizes as
small as $L=7$, the numerical results for twisted condition are very close to
the $L\to\infty$ limit. We also discuss the ground-state electronic density and
magnetization at half filling under the three boundary conditions.

of interest for followup and extracts the positionally and color weighted
optical richness $\lambda_{\mathrm{MCMF}}$ as a function of redshift for each
source. Peaks in the $\lambda_{\mathrm{MCMF}}$-redshift distribution are
identified and used to extract photometric redshifts, richness and
uncertainties. The significances of all optical counterparts are characterized
using the distribution of richnesses defined along random lines of sight. These
significances are used to extract cluster catalogs and to estimate the
contamination by random superpositions of unassociated optical systems. The
delivered photometric redshift accuracy is $\delta z / (1+z)=0.010$. We find a
well defined X-ray luminosity-$\lambda_{\mathrm{MCMF}}$ relation with an
intrinsic scatter of $\delta \ln(\lambda_\mathrm{MCMF}| L_\mathrm{x})=0.21$.
Matching our catalog with the DES-SV redMaPPer catalog yields good agreement in
redshift and richness estimates; comparing our catalog with the South Pole

open question. New clusters and galaxies of tidal origin are expected to have
high metallicities for their luminosities. Spectroscopy of such objects is,
however, at the limit of what can be done with existing 8-10m class telescopes,
which has prevented statistical studies of these objects. NGC2865 is an
UV-bright merging elliptical galaxy with shells and extended HI tails. The
regions observed in this work were previously detected using multi-slit imaging
spectroscopy. We obtain new multislit spectroscopy of six young star-forming
regions around NGC2865, to determine their redshifts and metallicities. The six
emission-line regions are located 16-40 kpc from NGC2865 and they have similar
redshifts. They have ages of ~10Myears and an average metallicity of
12+log(O/H) ~ 8.6, suggesting a tidal origin for the regions. It is noted that
they coincide with an extended HI tail, which has projected density of N$_{HI}$
< 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and displays a low surface brightness counterpart. These
regions may represent the youngest of the three populations of star clusters
already identified in NGC2865. The high, nearly-solar, oxygen abundances found
for the six regions in the vicinity of NGC2865 suggest that they were formed by
pre-enriched material from the parent galaxy, from gas removed during the last
major merger. Given the mass and the location of the HII regions, we can
speculate that these young star-forming regions are potential precursors of
globular clusters that will be part of the halo of NGC2865 in the future. Our
result supports the use of the multi-slit imaging spectroscopy as a useful tool

rate (SFR) is hampered by dust obscuration. The empirical relationship between
UV slope, $\beta$, and the ratio between far-infrared and UV luminosity, IRX,
is commonly employed to account for obscured UV emission. We present a simple
model that explores the physical origin of variations in the IRX - $\beta$ dust
attenuation relation. A relative increase in FUV attenuation compared to NUV
attenuation and an increasing stellar population age cause variations towards
red UV slopes for a fixed IRX. Dust geometry effects (turbulence, dust screen
with holes, mixing of stars within the dust screen, two-component dust model)
cause variations towards blue UV slopes. Poor photometric sampling of the UV
spectrum causes additional observational variations. We provide an analytic
approximation for the IRX - $\beta$ relation invoking a subset of the explored
physical processes (dust type, stellar population age, turbulence). We discuss
observed variations in the IRX - $\beta$ relation for local (sub-galactic
scales) and high-redshift (normal and dusty star-forming galaxies, galaxies
during the epoch of reionization) galaxies in the context of the physical
processes explored in our model. High spatial resolution imaging of the UV and
sub-mm emission of galaxies can constrain the IRX - $\beta$ dust attenuation
relation for different galaxy types at different epochs, where different
processes causing variations may dominate. These constraints will allow the use
of the IRX - $\beta$ relation to estimate intrinsic SFRs of galaxies, despite
the lack of a universal relation.

promising technological innovation investigated for this upgrade is wavelength
shifting optics. Augmenting sensors with such optics could increase the
photo-collection area of IceCube's digital optical modules, and shift the
incoming photons' wavelength to where these modules are the most sensitive.
Here we investigate the use of IceCube's drill holes themselves as wavelength
shifting optics. We calculate the sensitivity enhancement due to increasing the
ice's refractive index in the holes, and infusing wavelength-shifting substrate
into the ice. We find that, with adequate wavelength-shifter infusion, every
~0.05 increase in the ice's refractive index will increase IceCube's photon
sensitivity by 100%, opening the possibility for the substantial, cost
effective expansion of IceCube's reach.

from the Balmer decrement using Integral Field Spectroscopy and the dust mass
from Herschel far-IR observations. Our results show that M31's dust attenuation
closely follows a foreground screen model, contrary to what was previously
found in other nearby galaxies. By smoothing the M31 data we find that spatial
resolution is not the cause for this difference. Based on the emission line
ratios and two simple models, we conclude that previous models of dust/gas
geometry need to include a weakly or non-attenuated diffuse ionized gas (DIG)
component. Due to the variation of dust and DIG scale heights with galactic
radius, we conclude that different locations in galaxies will have different
vertical distributions of gas and dust and therefore different measured
attenuation. The difference between our result in M31 with that found in other
nearby galaxies can be explained by our fields in M31 lying at larger galactic
radii than the previous studies that focused on the centres of galaxies.

detection will occur. This effect can be observed in many experiments where
measurement outcomes are to be compared between remote stations because the
interpretation of an ostensible Bell violation strongly depends on the method
used to decide coincidence. The coincidence-time loophole has previously been

Here, we study the generalized ""chained"" inequality by Pearle-Braunstein-Caves

in, for instance, Quantum Key Distribution where it has been used to
re-establish security. In this paper we give the minimum coincidence

chemical enrichment of any stellar system. While these stars are known to exist
in copious amounts in the Milky Way halo, detailed chemical abundance data from
the faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites are still sparse, although the
relative fraction of these stars increases with decreasing metallicity. Here,
we report the abundance analysis of a metal-poor ([Fe/H]=$-2.5$ dex),
carbon-rich ([C/Fe]=1.4 dex) star, ALW-8, in the Carina dSph using
high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the ESO/UVES instrument. Its
spectrum does not indicate any over-enhancements of neutron capture elements.
Thus classified as a CEMP-no star, this is the first detection of this kind of
star in Carina. Another of our sample stars, ALW-1, is shown to be a CEMP-$s$
star, but its immediate binarity prompted us to discard it from a detailed
analysis. The majority of the 18 chemical elements we measured are typical of
Carina's field star population and also agree with CEMP stars in other dSph
galaxies. Similar to the only known CEMP-no star in the Sculptor dSph and the
weak-$r$-process star HD 122563, the lack of any strong barium-enhancement is
accompanied by a moderate overabundance in yttrium, indicating a weak
$r$-process activity. The overall abundance pattern confirms that, also in
Carina, the formation site for CEMP-no stars has been affected by both faint
supernovae and by standard core collapse supernovae. Whichever process was
responsible for the heavy element production in ALW-8 must be a ubiquitous
source to pollute the CEMP-no stars, acting independently of the environment

sensitivity to the flux of monochromatic neutrinos produced by dark matter (DM)
in our galaxy. This is illustrated by a new limit on the corresponding cross
section that we derive from public IceCube data. In this context, we study
which DM models could produce an observable flux of monochromatic neutrinos
from DM annihilations. To this end, we proceed in two steps. First, within a
set of simple and minimal assumptions concerning the properties of the DM
particle, we determine the models that could give rise to a significant
annihilation into monochromatic neutrinos at the freeze-out epoch. The list of
models turns out to be very limited as a result of various constraints, in
particular direct detection and neutrino masses at loop level. Given the fact
that, even if largely improved, the sensitivities will be far from reaching the
thermal annihilation cross section soon, a signal could only be observed if the
annihilation into neutrinos today is boosted with respect to the freeze-out
epoch. This is why, in a second step, we analyze the possibility of having such
a large enhancement from the Sommerfeld effect. For each scenario, we also
compute the cross sections into other annihilation products and confront our
results with experimental constraints. We find that, within our simple and
minimal assumptions, the expectation to observe monochromatic neutrinos is only
possible in very specific scenarios. Some will be confirmed or excluded in the
near future because they predict signals slightly below the current
experimental sensitivities. We also discuss how these prospects change by
relaxing our assumptions as well as by considering other types of sharp
spectral features. For the latter, we consider boxed-shaped and bremsstrahlung
spectra and provide the corresponding limits from IceCube data.

These experiments detect a spectral gap, accompanied by suppressed coherence
peaks that do not fit the BCS prediction. To explain these observations, we
consider the effect of finite-range superconducting fluctuations on the density
of states, focusing on the insulating side of the SIT. We perform a controlled
diagrammatic resummation and derive analytic expressions for the tunneling
differential conductance. We find that short-range superconducting fluctuations
suppress the coherence peaks, even in the presence of long-range correlations.

M_halo~10^8-10^12 M_sun at z=5. We predict the stellar mass-halo mass relation,
stellar mass function, and luminosity function in several bands from z=5-12.
The median stellar mass-halo mass relation does not evolve strongly at z=5-12.
The faint-end slope of the luminosity function steepens with increasing
redshift, as inherited from the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below
z~6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function
slightly flatten below M_star~10^4.5 M_sun (fainter than M_1500~-12), owing to
the fact that star formation in low-mass halos is suppressed by the ionizing
background by the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at
higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the
SFR-M_halo, SFR-M_star, and broad-band magnitude-stellar mass relations. We
derive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z=5-12 and
show that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at
z>8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z~6 UV luminosity function
brighter than M_1500~-20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37%
(54%) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M_1500=-13 (-17) is
obscured by dust at z~6. Our results broadly agree with current data and can be
tested by future observations.

investigate how turbulence and magnetic fields influence the morphology,

cover 3D magnetohydrodynamic systems of supersonic winds impacting clouds with
turbulent density, velocity, and magnetic fields. We find that log-normal
density distributions aid shock propagation through clouds, increasing their
velocity dispersion and producing filaments with expanded cross sections and
highly-magnetised knots and sub-filaments. In self-consistently turbulent
scenarios the ratio of filament to initial cloud magnetic energy densities is
~1. The effect of Gaussian velocity fields is bound to the turbulence Mach
number: Supersonic velocities trigger a rapid cloud expansion; subsonic
velocities only have a minor impact. The role of turbulent magnetic fields
depends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the
stronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the
greater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Overall, we show that including turbulence
and magnetic fields is crucial to understanding cold gas entrainment in
multi-phase winds. While cloud porosity and supersonic turbulence enhance the
acceleration of clouds, magnetic shielding protects them from ablation and
causes Rayleigh-Taylor-driven sub-filamentation. Wind-swept clouds in turbulent
models reach distances ~15-20 times their core radius and acquire bulk speeds
~0.3-0.4 of the wind speed in one cloud-crushing time, which are three times
larger than in non-turbulent models. In all simulations the ratio of turbulent
magnetic to kinetic energy densities asymptotes at ~0.1-0.4, and convergence of
all relevant dynamical properties requires at least 64 cells per cloud radius.

use a Monte Carlo suite of numerical N-body integrations to construct a variety
of orbital elements of the new planet and evaluate the dynamical stability of
eight Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the presence of Planet Nine. These
simulations show that some combinations of orbital elements ($a,e$) result in
Planet Nine acting as a stabilizing influence on the TNOs, which can otherwise
be destabilized by interactions with Neptune. These simulations also suggest
that some TNOs transition between several different mean-motion resonances
during their lifetimes while still retaining approximate apsidal anti-alignment
with Planet Nine. This behavior suggests that remaining in one particular orbit
is not a requirement for orbital stability. As one product of our simulations,
we present an {\it a posteriori} probability distribution for the semi-major
axis and eccentricity of the proposed Planet Nine based on TNO stability. This
result thus provides additional evidence that supports the existence of this
proposed planet. We also predict that TNOs can be grouped into multiple
populations of objects that interact with Planet Nine in different ways: one
population may contain objects like Sedna and 2012 VP$_{113}$, which do not
migrate significantly in semi-major axis in the presence of Planet Nine and
tend to stay in the same resonance; another population may contain objects like
2007 TG$_{422}$ and 2013 RF$_{98}$, which may both migrate and transition

matrix pencil) reveals important features of the underlying problem, whether a
Hamiltonian system in physics, or a social network in behavioral sciences.
However, computing all the eigenvalues explicitly is prohibitively expensive
for real-world applications. This paper presents two types of methods to
efficiently estimate the spectral density of a matrix pencil $(A, B)$ when both
$A$ and $B$ are Hermitian and, in addition, $B$ is positive definite. The first
one is based on the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) and the second on Gaussian

approximation techniques, we can avoid direct factorizations in both methods,
making the resulting algorithms suitable for large matrices. Under some
assumptions, we prove bounds that suggest that the Lanczos method converges
twice as fast as the KPM method. Numerical examples further indicate that the
Lanczos method can provide more accurate spectral densities when the eigenvalue
distribution is highly non-uniform. As an application, we show how to use the
computed spectral density to partition the spectrum into intervals that contain
roughly the same number of eigenvalues. This procedure, which makes it possible
to compute the spectrum by parts, is a key ingredient in the new breed of
eigensolvers that exploit ""spectrum slicing"".

Moreover, our method requires little user input in terms of tuning parameter

learning-to-rank layer that combines those features into the final ranking

feature patterns into soft-match targets at each similarity level and enforce
them on the translation matrix. The word embeddings are tuned accordingly so
that they can produce the desired soft matches. Experiments on a commercial

its actions on the environment and never explicitly modeled. Two key aspects
are borrowed from observational learning: i) the observer behaviour needs to
change as a result of viewing a 'teacher' (another agent) and ii) the observer
needs to be motivated somehow to engage in making use of the other agent's
behaviour. The later is naturally modeled by RL, by correlating the learning
agent's reward with the teacher agent's behaviour.

MOCCA Monte Carlo models for globular cluster evolution. Our results show that
the mass evaporation rate is a dynamical value; that is, far from a constant
single number found in earlier analytical work and commonly used in the
literature. Moreover, the evaporation rate derived with these simulations is
higher than values previously published. These models also show that the value
of the mass evaporation rate depends on the strength of the tidal field. We
give an analytical estimate of the mass evaporation rate as a function of time

smaller R_{GC} values, our results provide tentative evidence for a very high
xi value at small R_{GC}. Our results suggest that the corresponding mass loss

when star clusters pass within it. This has direct relevance to nuclear cluster

These events involve a stellar-mass black hole, or a similar compact object,
descending in the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole, eventually
merging with it. Properties of the in-spiralling trajectory away from resonance
are well known and have been studied extensively, however little is known about
the behaviour of these binary systems at resonance, when the radial and lateral
frequencies of the orbit become commensurate. We describe the two existing

optical fields of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) into sub-wavelength volumes
and thus achieve a large enhancement of linear and nonlinear optical
properties. This ability, however, is severely limited by the large ohmic loss
inherent to even the best of metals. However, in the mid and far infrared
ranges of the spectrum there exists a viable alternative to metals, polar
dielectrics and semiconductors in which dielectric permittivity (the real part)
turns negative in the Reststrahlen region. This feature engenders the so-called
surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) capable of confining the field in a way akin
to their plasmonic analogues, the SPPs. Since the damping rate of polar phonons
is substantially less than that of free electrons, it is not unreasonable to
expect that phononic devices may outperform their plasmonic counterparts. Yet a
more rigorous analysis of the comparative merits of phononics and plasmonics
reveals a more nuanced answer, namely that while phononic schemes do exhibit
narrower resonances and can achieve a very high degree of energy concentration,
most of the energy is contained in the form of lattice vibrations so that
enhancement of the electric field, and hence the Purcell factor, is rather
small compared to what can be achieved with metal nanoantennas. Still, the
sheer narrowness of phononic resonances is expected to make phononics viable in
applications where frequency selectivity is important.

extraction of information from nonlinear data. If the data are nonlinear the
usual approach is to employ a sequence of statistics (N-point statistics,
counting statistics of clusters, density peaks or voids etc.), along with the
corresponding covariance matrices. However, this approach is computationally
prohibitive and has not been shown to be exhaustive in terms of information
content. Here we instead develop a Bayesian approach, expanding the likelihood
around the maximum posterior of linear modes, which we solve for using
optimization methods. By integrating out the modes using perturbative expansion
of the likelihood we construct an initial power spectrum estimator, which for a
fixed forward model contains all the cosmological information if the initial
modes are gaussian distributed. We develop a method to construct the window and
covariance matrix such that the estimator is explicitly unbiased and nearly
optimal. We then generalize the method to include the forward model parameters,
including cosmological and nuisance parameters, and primordial non-gaussianity.
We apply the method in the simplified context of nonlinear structure formation,
using either simplified 2-LPT dynamics or N-body simulations as the nonlinear
mapping between linear and nonlinear density, and 2-LPT dynamics in the
optimization steps used to reconstruct the initial density modes. We
demonstrate that the method gives an unbiased estimator of the initial power
spectrum, providing among other a near optimal reconstruction of linear
baryonic acoustic oscillations.

  15",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Underutilization of computing resources and high power consumption are two
primary challenges in the domain of Cloud resource management. This paper deals
with these challenges through offline, migration impact-aware, multi-objective
dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation in the context of large-scale
virtualized data center environments. The problem is formulated as an NP-hard
discrete combinatorial optimization problem with simultaneous objectives of
minimizing resource wastage, power consumption, and the associated VM migration
overhead. Since dynamic VM consolidation through VM live migrations have
negative impacts on hosted applications performance and data center components,
a VM live migration overhead estimation technique is proposed, which takes into
account pragmatic migration parameters and overhead factors. In order to tackle
scalability issues, a hierarchical, decentralized dynamic VM consolidation
framework is presented that helps to localize migration-related network traffic
and reduce network cost. Moreover, a multi-objective, dynamic VM consolidation
algorithm is proposed by utilizing the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
metaheuristic, with integration of the proposed VM migration overhead
estimation technique. Comprehensive performance evaluation makes it evident
that the proposed dynamic VM consolidation approach outpaces the
state-of-the-art offline, migration-aware dynamic VM consolidation algorithm
across all performance metrics by reducing the overall power consumption by up
to 47%, resource wastage by up to 64%, and migration overhead by up to 83%.

the fact that its progenitor was a binary system with a rapidly decreasing

have selected a sample of 22 462 short-period (P_orb < 4d) eclipsing binary
stars observed toward the Galactic bulge by the OGLE-III survey in years
2001-2009. This dataset was extended with photometry from OGLE-II (1997-2000)
and the first six years of OGLE-IV (2010-2015). For some stars, the data were
supplemented with OGLE-I photometry (1992-1995). After close inspection of the
whole sample we have found 56 systems with realistic period decrease and 52
systems with realistic period increase. We have also recognized 35 systems with
cyclic period variations. The highest negative period change rate of -1.943
x10^-4 d/y has been detected in detached eclipsing binary OGLE-BLG-ECL-139622
with P_orb = 2.817 d, while all other found systems are contact binaries with
orbital periods mostly shorter than 1.0 d. For 22 our systems with decreasing
orbital period the absolute rate is higher than the value reported recently for
eclipsing binary KIC 9832227. Interestingly, there is an excess of systems with
high negative period change rate over systems with positive rate. We cannot
exclude the possibility that some of the contact binaries with relatively long
orbital period and high negative period change rate will merge in the future.
However, our results rather point to the presence of tertiary companions in the
observed systems and/or spot activity on the surface of the binary components.

But in the strongly correlated regime, it faces a symmetry dilemma, where it
either completely fails to describe the system, or has to artificially break
certain symmetries. On the other hand, projected Hartree-Fock theory captures
the essential physics of many kinds of strong correlations via symmetry
breaking and restoration. In this work, we combine and try to retain the merits
of these two methods by applying symmetry projection to broken symmetry coupled
cluster wavefunctions. The non-orthogonal nature of states resulting from the
application of symmetry projection operators furnishes particle-hole
excitations to all orders, thus creating an obstacle for the exact evaluation
of overlaps. Here we provide a solution via a disentanglement framework theory
that can be approximated rigorously and systematically. Results of projected
coupled cluster theory are presented for molecules and the Hubbard model,
showing that spin projection significantly improves unrestricted coupled
cluster theory while restoring good quantum numbers. The energy of projected
coupled cluster theory reduces to the unprojected one in the thermodynamic
limit, albeit at a much slower rate than projected Hartree-Fock.

advanced printing, scanning and image editing techniques are becoming

lot in reducing this menace. During printing procedure, printer hardware
introduces certain distortions in printed characters' locations and shapes
which are invisible to naked eyes. These distortions are referred as geometric
distortions, their profile (or signature) is generally unique for each printer
and can be used for printer classification purpose. This paper proposes a set
of features for characterizing text-line-level geometric distortions, referred
as geometric distortion signatures and presents a novel system to use them for
identification of the origin of a printed document. Detailed experiments
performed on a set of thirteen printers demonstrate that the proposed system
achieves state of the art performance and gives much higher accuracy under
small training size constraint. For four training and six test pages of three
different fonts, the proposed method gives 99\% classification accuracy.

finite Tor-dimension---we specialize even further, for this survey we give the
formulas only for flat maps. Recall that, for general maps of schemes $f:X\to
Y$, the duality functor $f^!$ has traditionally been defined and studied only
on the bounded-below derived category. Alonso, Jeremias and Lipman observed
that, as long as we restrict to morphisms $f$ of finite Tor-dimension, there is
an extension of $f^!$ to the unbounded derived category. But this extension was
so poorly understood that the paper [19], revisiting the formulas of Avramov

unbounded setting.

algorithm, there is a novel statistical estimator which is derived from the

silicates are incorporated into the model; new stellar parameters and
extinction laws are explored. A bright (42L$_{\odot}$) central-star with
A$_v$=12.5mag and R$_v$=6.5 requires less near-infrared excess: the inner-most
disk at $\approx$1AU is incompatible with the data. The revised stellar
parameters place this system on a 4 Myr evolutionary track, 4 times younger

region and disk-lifetimes observations. The disk-structure converges to a
classical-grains outer-disk from 55AU combined with a fully resolved
VSG\&PAH-ring, at 11-26 AU. We find two over-luminosities in the PAH-ring at

follows a Keplerian circular orbit at 14AU. We show a depletion of a factor

acquisition and robust reconstruction. Diffusion weighted signal is normally
acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically
distributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the
orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame.
The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for
single shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell
schemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the
Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal
of optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling
points. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical
Code (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in
single or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design
single or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to
uniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell
scheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms
to solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated
greedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt
greedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a
Constrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling
schemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that SC methods obtain larger
angular separation and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art
EEM and GEEM. The related codes and a tutorial have been released in DMRITool.

have been previously investigated as solutions to quantum-corrected field

learning in many applications, particularly in speech recognition and computer
vision. Inspired by Google's Inception-ResNet deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) for image classification, we have developed ""Chemception"", a deep CNN for
the prediction of chemical properties, using just the images of 2D drawings of
molecules. We develop Chemception without providing any additional explicit
chemistry knowledge, such as basic concepts like periodicity, or advanced
features like molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We then show how
Chemception can serve as a general-purpose neural network architecture for
predicting toxicity, activity, and solvation properties when trained on a
modest database of 600 to 40,000 compounds. When compared to multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) deep neural networks trained with ECFP fingerprints,
Chemception slightly outperforms in activity and solvation prediction and
slightly underperforms in toxicity prediction. Having matched the performance
of expert-developed QSAR/QSPR deep learning models, our work demonstrates the
plausibility of using deep neural networks to assist in computational chemistry
research, where the feature engineering process is performed primarily by a
deep learning algorithm.

the mechanism behind the emergence of new trends? By representing real-world
dynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be
symbolized by vertices that ""shine."" That is, at a specific time interval in a
network's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other
vertices. This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars.
Thus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and
determine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest
publicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000
real-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first
precise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales.
Three primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among
vertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices
join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the
emergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with
fast-growing networks. We applied our learnings to develop a flexible
network-generation model based on large-scale, real-world data. This model
gives a better understanding of how stars rise and fall within networks, and is
applicable to dynamic systems both in nature and society.

real-world applications however, models may have to sacrifice predictive power
in favour of human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature engineering
becomes a crucial task, which requires significant and time-consuming human
effort. Whilst some features are inherently static, representing properties
that cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual), others capture
characteristics that could be adjusted (e.g., the daily amount of carbohydrates
taken). Nonetheless, once a model is learned from the data, each prediction it
makes on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance to be a static
point located in the chosen feature space. There are many circumstances however
where it is important to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain
prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance
should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter such a prediction when the
mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a
technique that exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier to
offer recommendations for transforming true negative instances into positively
predicted ones. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using an online

effectively separates between two types of ads: low (negative) and high
(positive) quality ads (instances). Then, we introduce an algorithm that
provides recommendations that aim to transform a low quality ad (negative
instance) into a high quality one (positive instance). Finally, we evaluate our

represents settings where signal and interference sources are co-located, such
as in the broadcast channel. First, a variant of Costa's dirty paper coding
(DPC) is presented, whose achievable rates are within a constant gap to
capacity for all signal and dirt powers. Additionally, a lattice coding and
decoding scheme is proposed, whose decision regions are independent of the
channel realizations. Under Rayleigh fading, the gap to capacity of the lattice
coding scheme vanishes with the number of receive antennas, even at finite
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Thus, although the capacity of the fading dirty
paper channel remains unknown, this work shows it is not far from its dirt-free

transmission strategies for the two-user MIMO broadcast channel (BC), where the

set the many different parameters of these index structures, such as the node
size of CSB+ trees.
  These indices have been proposed because CPU speeds have been increasing at a
dramatically higher rate than memory speeds, giving rise to the Von Neumann
CPU--Memory bottleneck. To hide the long latencies caused by memory access, it
has become very important to well-utilize the features of modern CPUs. In order
to drive down the average number of CPU clock cycles required to execute CPU
instructions, and thus increase throughput, it has become important to achieve
a good utilization of CPU resources. Some of these are the data and instruction
caches, and the translation lookaside buffers. But it also has become important
to avoid branch misprediction penalties, and utilize vectorization provided by
CPUs in the form of SIMD instructions.
  While the layout of index structures has been heavily optimized for the data
cache of modern CPUs, the instruction cache has been neglected so far. In this
paper, we present NitroGen, a framework for utilizing code generation for
speeding up index traversal in main memory database systems. By bringing
together data and code, we make index structures use the dormant resource of
the instruction cache. We show how to combine index compilation with previous

a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based,

achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function
implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of
WTA-thresholded spiking neurons. Together, these mechanisms implement a form of
spike-based, competitive learning. Two sets of experiments are performed on the

When techniques such as fast Fourier transforms and Fourier series are applied
to price and hedge options with non-smooth probability density functions, they
cause the Gibbs phenomenon, accordingly, the techniques converge slowly for
density functions with jumps in value or derivatives. This seriously adversely
affects the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques. In this paper, we
derive pricing formulae and their option Greeks using the SFP method to resolve
the Gibbs phenomenon and restore the global spectral convergence rate.
Moreover, we show that our method requires a small number of terms to yield
fast error convergence, and it is able to accurately price any European-type
option deep in/out of the money and with very long/short maturities.
Furthermore, we conduct an error-bound analysis of the SFP method in option
pricing. This new method performs favourably in numerical experiments compared
with existing techniques.

the future International Linear Collider ILC, the future circular collider
CEPC, and is also the chosen technology for the upgraded CMS experiment of the
Large Hadron Collider. Active silicon sensing pads are used as MIP counters and
the standard calibration of the calorimeter uses weights based on the average
energy loss, $dEdx$. In this work, the limitations of the dEdx calibration
method in terms of energy linearity, scale and resolution are explored. In the
case of a calorimeter with varying passive layer thickness as the one planned
for CMS, the $dEdx$ method leads to a significant constant term in the
resolution function and a non-linearity of energy response. For these reasons,
a method based on the calorimeter sampling fraction that exploits the per-event
measured shower depth is presented and shown to deliver superior absolute
energy scale, linearity and resolution. Calorimetric designs in which the back
of the shower is sampled less, offer reduced cost without loss in performance.
Therefore, a proper calibration as proposed here is crucial in obtaining the
most cost- and performance-effective silicon-sampling calorimeter design.

formulating various model assumptions, each one assuming a different order of

maximizes the area under the curve for bipartite ranking. However, we argue
that using click records for bipartite ranking needs a meticulously designed

that of purchase records. Therefore, we ultimately propose a novel

proposed model is customized to be robust to relatively unreliable click
records by particularly focusing on the accuracy of top-ranked items.

depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star

type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme

compute differential cross sections for $D$ and $l$ production. The gluon
saturation scale inside the heavy nucleus is enhanced and dependent on $x$,
which we take into account by replacing the initial saturation scale in the BK

Process (CARP) to forecast interconnected global risks. However, assessments of
the model's prediction precision are limited by lack of sufficient ground truth

is an efficient method for predicting catastrophic cascading events with
potential applications to emerging local and global interconnected risks.

lattice points in moduli spaces of flat surfaces. We analyze the asymptotic

frequency-dependence of the empirical Drude size parameter is extracted from

the dielectric function can lead to inaccurate predictions for highly uniform

supplementary regularization technique that we named Box Subtraction Scheme

that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an

implement high-order polygonal finite element methods via the discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology. Ultraweak variational formulations are
nonstandard in that all the weight of the derivatives lies in the test space,
while most of the trial space can be chosen as copies of $L^2$-discretizations
that have no need to be continuous across adjacent elements. Additionally, the
test spaces are broken along the mesh interfaces. This allows one to construct
conforming polygonal finite element methods, termed here as PolyDPG methods, by
defining most spaces by restriction of a bounding triangle or box to the
polygonal element. The only variables that require nontrivial compatibility
across elements are the so-called interface or skeleton variables, which can be
defined directly on the element boundaries. Unlike other high-order polygonal
methods, PolyDPG methods do not require ad hoc stabilization terms thanks to
the crafted stability of the DPG methodology. A proof of convergence of the
form $h^p$ is provided and corroborated through several illustrative numerical
examples. These include polygonal meshes with $n$-sided convex elements and
with highly distorted concave elements, as well as the modeling of
discontinuous material properties along an arbitrary interface that cuts a
uniform grid. Since PolyDPG methods have a natural a posteriori error estimator
a polygonal adaptive strategy is developed and compared to standard adaptivity
schemes based on constrained hanging nodes. This work is also accompanied by an
open-source $\texttt{PolyDPG}$ software supporting polygonal and conventional

calibration has been limited to selecting models that produce outputs that fall

additional losses. Meanwhile, a saliency prediction sub-network is built in the

topological space $\Omega$ and established the connection between quasi-states
on $C (\Omega)$ and quasi-measures in $\Omega$. This work solved the linearity
problem of quasi-states on $C^*$-algebras formulated by R.V. Kadison in 1965.
The answer is that a quasi-state need not be linear, so a quasi-state need not
be a state. We introduce nonlinear measures in a space $\Omega$ which is a
generalization of a measurable space. In this more general setting we are still
able to define integration and establish a representation theorem for the
corresponding functionals. A probabilistic language is choosen since we feel
that the subject should be of some interest to probabilists. In particular we
point out that the theory allows for incompatible stochastic variables. The
need for incompatible variables is well known in quantum mechanics, but the
need seems natural also in other contexts as we try to explain by a questionary
example.

maximize the total scattering cross section for an incoming plane wave, on the
one hand, and to minimize the decay rate associated to a long-lived scattering
resonance, on the other hand. In both cases, the optimimum is achieved by
configurations where all scatterers are placed on a line parallel to the

section increases quadratically with the number of scatterers for large $N$,
whereas the minimal decay rate -- which is realized by configurations that are
not the same as those that maximize the scattering cross section -- decreases
exponentially as a function of $N$. Finally, we also analyze the stability of

decay-type and showed large-amplitude ($\sim$2 mag) and short-term ($\sim$10

We found correlated optical and X-ray variations in two $\sim$1 hour time

previous version, the observation times of X-ray light curves were measured at
the satellite and their system of times was Terrestrial Time (TT), while those

extend time-dependent perturbation theory into the non-Hermitian realm and
consider the transitions in a stationary Hermitian system, described by a
self-adjoint Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$, induced by a time-dependent non-Hermitian
interaction $f(t) \hat{P}$. In the weak interaction (perturbative) limit, the
transition probabilities generally turn out to be {\it asymmetric} for exchange
of initial and final states. In particular, for a temporal shape $f(t)$ of the
perturbation with one-sided Fourier spectrum, i.e. with only positive (or
negative) frequency components, transitions are fully unidirectional, a result
that holds even in the strong interaction regime. Interestingly, we show that
non-Hermitian perturbations can be tailored to be transitionless, i.e. the
perturbation leaves the system unchanged as if the interaction had not occurred
at all, regardless the form of $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{P}$. As an application of
the results, we discuss asymmetric (chiral) behavior of dynamical encircling of

(GCs) in the Galaxy have discrete distributions of stars along the Mg-Al
anti-correlation. In order to discuss this recent observation, we construct a
new one-zone GC formation model in which the maximum stellar mass (m_max) in
the initial mass function (IMF) of stars in a forming GC depends on the star
formation rate (SFR), as deduced from independent observations. We investigate
the star formation histories of forming GCs. The principal results are as
follows. About 30 Myr after the formation of the first generation (1G) of stars
within a particular GC, new stars can be formed from ejecta from asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars of 1G. However, the formation of this second
generation (2G) of stars can last only for [10-20] Myr, because the most
massive SNe of 2G expel all of the remaining gas. The third generation (3G) of
stars are then formed from AGB ejecta ~ 30$ Myr after the truncation of 2G star
formation. This cycle of star formation followed by its truncation by SNe can
continue until all AGB ejecta is removed from the GC by some physical process.
Thus, it is inevitable that GCs have discrete multiple stellar populations in
the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] diagram. Our model predicts that low-mass GCs are unlikely
to have discrete multiple stellar populations, and young massive clusters may
not have massive OB stars owing to low m_max ([20-30] M_sun) during the

set-based cyclic operads with symmetries. Our categorification is obtained by
relaxing defining axioms of cyclic operads to isomorphisms and by formulating
coherence conditions for these isomorphisms. The coherence theorem that we
prove has the form ""all diagrams of canonical isomorphisms commute"". Our
coherence results come in two flavours, corresponding to the ""entries-only"" and
""exchangeable-output"" definitions of cyclic operads. Our proof of coherence in
the entries-only style is of syntactic nature and relies on the coherence of
categorified non-symmetric operads established by Do\v{s}en and Petri\'c. We
obtain the coherence in the exchangeable-output style by ""lifting"" the
equivalence between entries-only and exchangeable-output cyclic operads, set up
by the second author. Finally, we show that a generalisation of the structure
of profunctors of B\' enabou provides an example of categorified cyclic operad,
and we exploit the coherence of categorified cyclic operads in proving that the
Feynman category for cyclic operads, due to Kaufmann and Ward, admits an odd
version.

Cosmology. In general, a medium expansion (contraction) brings about dramatic
changes in the behavior of diffusive transport properties. Here, we focus on
such effects when the diffusion process is described by the Continuous Time
Random Walk (CTRW) model. For the case where the jump length and the waiting
time probability density functions (pdfs) are long-tailed, we derive a general
bifractional diffusion equation which reduces to a normal diffusion equation in
the appropriate limit. We then study some particular cases of interest,
including L\'evy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs. In the former case, we find an
analytical exact solution for the Green's function (propagator). When the
expansion is sufficiently fast, the contribution of the diffusive transport
becomes irrelevant at long times and the propagator tends to a stationary
profile in the comoving reference frame. In contrast, for a contracting medium
a competition between the spreading effect of diffusion and the concentrating
effect of contraction arises. For a subdiffusive CTRW in an exponentially
contracting medium, the latter effect prevails for sufficiently long times, and
all the particles are eventually localized at a single point in physical space.
This ""Big Crunch"" effect stems from inefficient particle spreading due to
subdiffusion. We also derive a hierarchy of differential equations for the
moments of the transport process described by the subdiffusive CTRW model. In
the case of an exponential expansion, exact recurrence relations for the
Laplace-transformed moments are obtained. Our results confirm the intuitive
expectation that the medium expansion hinders the mixing of diffusive particles
occupying separate regions. In the case of L\'evy flights, we quantify this
effect by means of the so-called ""L\'evy horizon"".

across the torque equilibrium whereas the existing torque models predict a
concave-down (convex) relation with the fastness parameter. We show that the
dimensionless torque has a cubic dependence on the fastness parameter near the

away from the equilibrium, either in the positive or the negative side, but
saturates at limited values. The spin-down torque can attain a 2.5 times larger
magnitude at the saturation limit than the spin-up torque. From the evolution
of the frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations of 4U 1626$-$67 across the
torque reversal of 1990, we determine the critical fastness parameter
corresponding to torque equilibrium to be $\omega_{\rm c} \simeq 0.75$ within
the framework of the beat frequency model and boundary region model for
reasonable values of the model parameters. We find that the disc magnetosphere
interaction becomes unstable when the inner radius approaches the corotation
radius as predicted by some models, though with a longer timescale. We also
find that there is an unstable regime that is triggered when the fastness
parameter is 0.8 times the critical fastness parameter ($\omega=0.6$ for
$\omega_{\rm c} \simeq 0.75$) possibly associated with an instability observed

characteristic orbital periods $\sim 0.1$~days, is explained with very high
precision by the gravitational wave (GW) emission of an inspiraling binary in
vacuum. However, the binary gravitational binding energy is also affected by an
usually neglected phenomenon, namely the dark matter dynamical friction (DMDF)
produced by the interaction of the binary components with their respective DM
gravitational wakes. The entity of this effect depends on the orbital period
and on the local value of the DM density, hence on the position of the binary
in the Galaxy. We evaluate the DMDF produced by three different DM profiles:
the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), the non-singular-isothermal-sphere (NSIS) and
the Ruffini-Arg\""uelles-Rueda (RAR) profile based on self-gravitating keV
fermions. We first show that indeed, due to their Galactic position, the GW
emission dominates over the DMDF in the NS-NS, NS-WD and WD-WD binaries for
which measurements of the orbital decay exist. Then, we evaluate the conditions
under which the effect of DMDF on the binary evolution becomes comparable to,
or overcomes, the one of the GW emission. We find that, for instance for
$1.3$--$0.2$ $M_\odot$ NS-WD, $1.3$--$1.3$~$M_\odot$ NS-NS, and
$0.25$--$0.50$~$M_\odot$ WD-WD, located at 0.1~kpc, this occurs at orbital
periods around 20--30 days in a NFW profile while, in a RAR profile, it occurs
at about 100 days. For closer distances to the Galactic center, the DMDF effect
increases and the above critical orbital periods become interestingly shorter.
Finally, we also analyze the system parameters for which DMDF leads to an
orbital widening instead of orbital decay. All the above imply that a
direct/indirect observational verification of this effect in compact-star
binaries might put strong constraints on the nature of DM and its Galactic
distribution.

understand the relationship between the statistical properties of the precursor
film and those of the spreading drop. Assuming the precursor film is much
thinner than the drop and viscosity fluctuations are weak, we use asymptotic
methods to derive explicit predictions for the mean and variance of drop area
and the drop's lateral drift. For larger film variability, we use Gaussian
process emulation to estimate the variance of outcomes from a restricted set of
simulations. Stochastic drift of the droplet is predicted to be greatest when
the initial drop diameter is comparable to the correlation length of viscosity
fluctuations.

for any detailed understanding of its function. Significant effort has gone
into developing technologies for structural characterization. These
technologies do not directly provide 3D structures; instead they typically
yield noisy and erroneous distance information between specific entities such

  Here we present an approach for this translation process based on
maxent-stress optimization. Our new approach extends the original graph drawing
method for the new application's specifics by introducing additional
constraints and confidence values as well as algorithmic components. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach infers structural models (i. e.,
sensible 3D coordinates for the molecule's atoms) that correspond well to the
distance information, can handle noisy and error-prone data, and is
considerably faster than established tools. Our results promise to allow domain
scientists nearly-interactive structural modeling based on distance

x_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfy $\ell_2^2$ triangle inequalities into
$\ell_1$, when the points are approximately low-dimensional. Goemans
(unpublished, appears in a work of [Magen and Moharammi, 2008]) showed that
such points residing in \emph{exactly} $d$ dimensions can be embedded into
$\ell_1$ with distortion at most $\sqrt{d}$. We prove the following robust
analogue of this statement: if there exists a $r$-dimensional subspace $\Pi$
such that the projections onto this subspace satisfy $\sum_{i,j \in [n]}\Vert
\Pi x_i - \Pi x_j \Vert _2^2 \geq \Omega(1) \sum_{i,j \in [n]}\Vert x_i - x_j
\Vert _2^2$, then there is an embedding of the points into $\ell_1$ with
$O(\sqrt{r})$ average distortion. A consequence of this result is that the
integrality gap of the well-known Goemans-Linial SDP relaxation for the Uniform
Sparsest Cut problem is $O(\sqrt{r})$ on graphs $G$ whose $r$-th smallest
normalized eigenvalue of the Laplacian satisfies $\lambda_r(G)/n \geq
\Omega(1)\Phi_{SDP} (G)$. Our result improves upon the previously known bound
of $O(r)$ on the average distortion, and the integrality gap of the
Goemans-Linial SDP under the same preconditions, proven in the previous works
of [Deshpande and Venkat, 2014] and [Deshpande, Harsha and Venkat, 2016].

stretched sodium as a model system to explore the performance of the multitier

the scheme is not very accurate for electron-gas like systems, because nonlocal

results in the intermediate correlation regime, and a Mott transition around a
lattice spacing of $1.5a_0$. Remarkably, even though the Wannier functions in

fermionic dark matter, together with the charged component of the triplet being
a quasi-stable particle which decays only via a higher-dimensional operator
suppressed by a high scale. The second model consists of an inert scalar
doublet together with a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-odd right-handed Majorana neutrino
dark matter. A tiny Yukawa coupling delays the decay of the charged component
of the inert doublet into the dark matter candidate, making the former
long-lived on the scale of collider detectors. The parameter space of each
model has been constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis constraints, and also by
estimating the contribution to the relic density through freeze-out of the
long-lived charged particle as well the freeze-in production of the dark matter
candidate. We consider two kinds of signals at the Large Hadron Collider for
the first kind of models, namely two charged tracks and single track + MET. For
the second kind, the characteristic signals are opposite as well as same-sign

criteria consistent with the current experimental programmes. It is found that
the scenario with a lepton triplet can be probed upto 960(1190) GeV with an

briefly considered, where the propagation equation for the tensor modes differs
from the previous scenario, in that the scalar mode equation has an extra term,

diagram by varying coupling strength and small-world rewiring probability p of
nonlocal connections. The persistent region is a compact region bounded by two
critical lines where band-merging crisis occurs. On one critical line, the
persistent sites shows a nonexponential (stretched exponential) decay for all p
while for another one, it shows crossover from nonexponential to exponential
behavior as p tends to 1. With an effectively antiferromagnetic coupling,
coupling to two neighbors on either side leads to exchange frustration. Apart
from exchange frustration, non-bipartite topology and nonlocal couplings in a

absorbtion or/and reflection at boundaries have been widely applied in
mathematical finance, risk, queueing, and inventory/storage theory.
Historically, such problems were tackled by taking Laplace transform of the
associated Kolmogorov integro-differential equations involving the generator
operator. In the last years there appeared an alternative approach based on the
solution of two fundamental ""two-sided exit"" problems from an interval (TSE). A
spectrally one-sided process will exit smoothly on one side on an interval, and
the solution is simply expressed in terms of a ""scale function"" $W$ (Bertoin
1997). The non-smooth two-sided exit (or ruin) problem suggests introducing a
second scale function $Z$ (Avram, Kyprianou and Pistorius 2004).
  Since many other problems can be reduced to TSE, researchers produced in the
last years a kit of formulas expressed in terms of the ""$W,Z$ alphabet"" for a
great variety of first passage problems. We collect here our favorite recipes
from this kit, including a recent one (94) which generalizes the classic De
Finetti dividend problem. One interesting use of the kit is for recognizing
relationships between apparently unrelated problems -- see Lemma 3. Last but
not least, it turned out recently that once the classic $W,Z$ are replaced with
appropriate generalizations, the classic formulas for (absorbed/ reflected)
L\'evy processes continue to hold for:
  a) spectrally negative Markov additive processes (Ivanovs and Palmowski
2012),
  b) spectrally negative L\'evy processes with Poissonian Parisian absorbtion

the Archean with temperatures between 60{\deg}C (333 K) and 80{\deg}C (353 K).
Such climates are challenging for the early Earth warmed by the faint young
Sun. The interpretation of the data has therefore been controversial. 1D
climate modeling inferred that such hot climates would require very high levels
of CO2 (2-6 bars). Previous carbon cycle modeling concluded that such stable
hot climates were impossible and that the carbon cycle should lead to cold
climates during the Hadean and the Archean. Here, we revisit the climate and
carbon cycle of the early Earth at 3.8 Ga using a 3D climate-carbon model. We
find that CO2 partial pressures of around 1 bar could have produced hot
climates given a low land fraction and cloud feedback effects. However, such
high CO2 partial pressures should not have been stable because of the
weathering of terrestrial and oceanic basalts, producing an efficient
stabilizing feedback. Moreover, the weathering of impact ejecta during the Late
Heavy Bombardment (LHB) would have strongly reduced the CO2 partial pressure
leading to cold climates and potentially snowball Earth events after large
impacts. Our results therefore favor cold or temperate climates with global
mean temperatures between around 8{\deg}C (281 K) and 30{\deg}C (303 K) and
with 0.1-0.36 bar of CO2 for the late Hadean and early Archean. Finally, our
model suggests that the carbon cycle was efficient for preserving clement
conditions on the early Earth without necessarily requiring any other
greenhouse gas or warming process.

order finite difference scheme obtained as combination of the Crank-Nicolson
scheme and the so-called weighted and shifted Gr\""unwald formula.
  By fully exploiting the Toeplitz-like structure of the resulting linear
system, we provide a detailed spectral analysis of the coefficient matrix at
each time step, both in the case of constant and variable diffusion
coefficients. Such a spectral analysis has a very crucial role, since it can be
used for designing fast and robust iterative solvers. In particular, we employ
the obtained spectral information to define a Galerkin multigrid method based
on the classical linear interpolation as grid transfer operator and
damped-Jacobi as smoother, and to prove the linear convergence rate of the
corresponding two-grid method. The theoretical analysis suggests that the
proposed grid transfer operator is strong enough for working also with the
V-cycle method and the geometric multigrid. On this basis, we introduce two
computationally favourable variants of the proposed multigrid method and we use
them as preconditioners for Krylov methods. Several numerical results confirm
that the resulting preconditioning strategies still keep a linear convergence
rate.

  Box-counting dimension is defined in terms of $N(t,\delta)$, but for
subordinators we prove that it can also be defined using a new process obtained
by shortening the original subordinator's jumps of size greater than $\delta$.
This new process can be manipulated with remarkable ease in comparison to
$N(t,\delta)$, and allows better understanding of the box-counting dimension of
a subordinator's range in terms of its L\'evy measure, improving upon
[Corollary 1, Savov, 2014]. Further, we shall prove corresponding CLT and

PS16dtm, which reach near or super-Eddington luminosities of the central black
holes, are powered by the interaction between accretion disk winds and clouds
in broad-line regions (BLRs) surrounding them. If the disk luminosity temporary
increases by, e.g., limit-cycle oscillations, leading to a powerful radiatively
driven wind, strong shock waves propagate in the BLR. Because the dense clouds
in the AGN BLRs typically have similar densities to those found in Type IIn
supernovae, strong radiative shocks emerge and efficiently convert the ejecta
kinetic energy to radiation. As a result, transients similar to Type IIn
supernovae can be observed at AGN central regions. Since a typical black-hole
disk wind velocity is ~ 0.1c where c is the speed of light, the ejecta kinetic
energy is expected to be ~ 1e52 erg when ~ 1 Msun is ejected. This kinetic
energy is transformed to radiation energy in a timescale for the wind to sweep
up a similar mass to itself in the BLR, which is a few hundred days. Therefore,
both luminosities (~ 1e44 erg/s) and timescales (~ 100 days) of the
superluminous transients from AGN central regions match to those expected in
our interaction model. If CSS100217 and PS16dtm are related to the AGN
activities triggered by limit-cycle oscillations, they become bright again in
coming years or decades.

nitrogen abundances at their surface have raised questions about the rotational
mixing paradigm. We revisit this question thanks to a spectroscopic analysis of
a sample of bright fast-rotating OB stars, with the goal of quantifying the
efficiency of rotational mixing at high rotation rates. Method: Our sample
consists of 40 fast rotators on the main sequence, with spectral types
comprised between B0.5 and O4. We compare the abundances of some key element
indicators of mixing (He, CNO) with the predictions of evolutionary models for
single objects and for stars in interacting binary systems. Results: The
properties of half of the sample stars can be reproduced by single evolutionary
models, even in the case of probable or confirmed binaries that can therefore
be true single stars in a pre-interaction configuration. The main problem for
the rest of the sample is a mismatch for the [N/O] abundance ratio (we confirm
the existence of fast rotators with a lack of nitrogen enrichment) and/or a
high helium abundance that cannot be accounted for by models. Modifying the
diffusion coefficient implemented in single- star models does not solve the
problem as it cannot simultaneously reproduce the helium abundances and [N/O]
abundance ratios of our targets. Since part of them actually are binaries, we
also compared their chemical properties with predictions for post-mass transfer
systems. We found that these models can explain the abundances measured for a
majority of our targets, including some of the most helium-enriched, but fail
to reproduce them in other cases. Our study thus reveals that some physical
ingredients are still missing in current models.

for left-sided breast radiotherapy (RT), in order to reduce the dose to the
heart and the risk of cardiotoxicity. The volumetric arc therapy (VMAT)
technique increases the dose conformity to the planning target volume (PTV). We
hereby describe the procedure of combining VMAT and DIBH without a dedicated
equipment, and report a dosimetric study related on our implemented technique.
Methods: The DIBH technique is based on voluntary breath hold of the patient
which is controlled by a laser on tattoo marks. Patients were selected
depending their ability to breath hold for 25s, and VMAT plans were optimized
with an arrangement of 4 arcs with a maximum delivery time of 20s each. A
retrospective dosimetric study was undertaken on 30 patients treated with this
technique: 10 received local (whole breast) RT (L-RT) with a simultaneous
integrated boost (SIB), 10 a locoregional (LR)RT of the chestwall, 10 a LR RT
of the whole breast with SIB. For these patients, their DIBH-VMAT treatment
plans were compared to free breathing (FB) VMAT plans, and dose characteristics
of PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were evaluated. Results: The PTV coverage was
identical among plans under DIBH or FB. The mean heart dose was reduced from
2.8+/-0.9Gy in FB to 1.8+/-0.6Gy in DIBH for local RT, and reduced from
3.4+/-1.3Gy in FB to 2.2+/-0.5Gy in DIBH for LR-RT. The ipsilateral mean lung
dose was reduced by a factor of 12% for LR-RT, but remained unchanged for L-RT
with DIBH-VMAT compared to FB treatment. No significant differences were
observed in the mean dose of contra-lateral organs with either DIBH or FB VMAT
techniques. Conclusion: The VMAT-DIBH technique performed without a dedicated
breath hold equipment, provided important dose reductions at the heart, while
preserving the ipsilateral lung and contralateral normal tissues.

several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is
simple but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect
methods have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based
convolution, or Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods
have high memory-overhead, which creates performance degradation and offers a
poor trade-off between performance and memory consumption. In this work, we
propose a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which
reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process. MEC
lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact way (i.e., much less
memory-overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications in
parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory
footprint improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our
experimental results show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly

indirect convolution algorithms.

in an evaporating sessile Ouzo drop, leading to an amazingly rich drying
process with multiple phase transitions [H. Tan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

line, the nucleation of oil droplets starts at the rim which results in an oil
ring encircling the drop. Furthermore, the oil droplets are advected through
the Ouzo drop by a fast solutal Marangoni flow. In this article, we investigate
the evaporation of mixture droplets in more detail, by successively increasing
the mixture complexity from pure water over a binary water-ethanol mixture to
the ternary Ouzo mixture (water, ethanol and anise oil). In particular,
axisymmetric and full three-dimensional finite element method simulations have
been performed on these droplets to discuss thermal effects and the complicated
flow in the droplet driven by an interplay of preferential evaporation,
evaporative cooling and solutal and thermal Marangoni flow. By using image

and on how it may assist us in approaching quantum gravity. We begin by
arguing, using a reconstruction of its formalism, that quantum theory can be
regarded as a universal framework governing an observer's acquisition of
information from physical systems taken as information carriers. We continue by
observing that the structure of spacetime is encoded in the communication
relations among observers and more generally the information flow in spacetime.
Combining these insights with an information-theoretic Machian view, we argue
that the quantum architecture of spacetime can operationally be viewed as a
locally finite network of degrees of freedom exchanging information. An
advantage -- and simultaneous limitation -- of an informational perspective is
its quasi-universality, i.e. quasi-independence of the precise physical
incarnation of the underlying degrees of freedom. This suggests to exploit
these informational insights to develop a largely microphysics independent
top-down approach to quantum gravity to complement extant bottom-up approaches
by closing the scale gap between the unknown Planck scale physics and the
familiar physics of quantum (field) theory and general relativity
systematically from two sides. While some ideas have been pronounced before in
similar guise and others are speculative, the way they are strung together and
justified is new and supports approaches attempting to derive emergent
spacetime structures from correlations of quantum degrees of freedom.

requirement, and many prior distributions have been designed for this purpose.
A combination of the sparsity requirement with smoothness of the solution is
also common in application, however, with considerably fewer existing prior
models. In this paper, we compare two prior structures, the Bayesian fused
lasso (BFL) and least-squares with adaptive prior covariance matrix (LS-APC).
Since only variational solution was published for the latter, we derive a Gibbs
sampling algorithm for its inference and Bayesian model selection. The method
is designed for high dimensional problems, therefore, we discuss numerical
issues associated with evaluation of the posterior. In simulation, we show that
the LS-APC prior achieves results comparable to that of the Bayesian Fused
Lasso for piecewise constant parameter and outperforms the BFL for parameters
of more general shapes. Another advantage of the LS-APC priors is revealed in
real application to estimation of the release profile of the European Tracer

consisting of a highly relativistic inner jet and a slower - but still
relativistic - outer jet surrounded by an unmagnetized environment. These jets
are believed to be susceptible to a relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor-type
instability, depending on the effective inertia ratio of the two components. We
extend previous studies by taking into account the presence of a non-zero
toroidal magnetic field. Different values of magnetization are examined, to
detect possible differences in the evolution and stability of the jet. We find
that the toroidal field, above a certain level of magnetization $\sigma$,
roughly equal to 0.01, can stabilize the jet against the previously mentioned
instabilities and that there is a clear trend in the behaviour of the average
Lorentz factor and the effective radius of the jet when we continuously
increase the magnetization. The simulations are performed using the

only upper limits on both $m_{\nu,{\rm{sterile}}}^{\rm{eff}}$ and $N_{\rm eff}$

neutrino species with eV-scale mass is found in this analysis. Moreover,
compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, in the $w$CDM model the limit on

leading researchers to seek new hybrid communication approaches. One promising
strategy that has been the subject of considerable interest is the augmentation
of RF technology by Free Space Optics (FSO), using the strength of each
communication technology to overcome the limitations of the other. In this
article, we introduce a new scheme for controlling the topology in hybrid
Radio-Frequency/Free Space Optics (RF/FSO) wireless mesh networks. Our scheme
is based on adaptive adjustments to both transmission power (of RF and FSO
transmitters) and the optical beam-width (of FSO transmitters) at individual
nodes, with the objective of meeting specified Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements, specifically end-to-end delay and throughput. We show how one can
effectively encode the instantaneous objectives and constraints of the system
as an instance of Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We demonstrate that the
technique of Lagrangian Relaxation (LR), augmented with iterative repair
heuristics, can be used to determine good (albeit sub-optimal) solutions for
the ILP problem, making the approach feasible for mid-sized networks. We make
the proposed scheme viable for large-scale networks in terms of number of
nodes, number of transceivers, and number of source-destination pairs by
solving the ILP problem using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
implementation.

dimensional knapsack and items $u$ with weight vectors $\mathbf{w}_u \in

item, the algorithm must decide immediately whether to discard or accept the
item into the knapsack. When item $u$ is accepted, $\mathbf{w}_u(i)$ units of
capacity on dimension $i$ will be taken up, for each $i\in[d]$. To satisfy the
knapsack constraint, an accepted item can be later disposed of with no cost,
but discarded or disposed of items cannot be recovered. The objective is to
maximize the utility of the accepted items $S$ at the end of the algorithm,
which is given by $f(S)$ for some non-negative monotone submodular function
$f$.
  For any small constant $\epsilon > 0$, we consider the special case that the
weight of an item on every dimension is at most a $(1-\epsilon)$ fraction of
the total capacity, and give a polynomial-time deterministic
$O(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$-competitive algorithm for the problem, where $k$ is
the (column) sparsity of the weight vectors. We also show several (almost)
tight hardness results even when the algorithm is computationally unbounded. We
show that under the $\epsilon$-slack assumption, no deterministic algorithm can
obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio, and no randomized algorithm can obtain any
$o(\frac{k}{\log k})$ competitive ratio. For the general case (when $\epsilon =
0$), no randomized algorithm can obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio.
  In contrast to the $(1+\delta)$ competitive ratio achieved in Kesselheim et
al. (STOC 2014) for the problem with random arrival order of items and under
large capacity assumption, we show that in the arbitrary arrival order case,
even when $\| \mathbf{w}_u \|_\infty$ is arbitrarily small for all items $u$,
it is impossible to achieve any $o(\frac{\log k}{\log\log k})$ competitive

The
high-level, symbolic task planner decides what needs to be done, while the
motion planner checks feasibility and fills up geometric detail. It is known
however that such a decomposition is not effective in general as the symbolic
and geometrical components are not independent. In this work, we show that it
is possible to compile task and motion planning problems into classical AI
planning problems; i.e., planning problems over finite and discrete state
spaces with a known initial state, deterministic actions, and goal states to be
reached. The compilation is sound, meaning that classical plans are valid robot
plans, and probabilistically complete, meaning that valid robot plans are
classical plans when a sufficient number of configurations is sampled. In this
approach, motion planners and collision checkers are used for the compilation,
but not at planning time. The key elements that make the approach effective are
1) expressive classical AI planning languages for representing the compiled
problems in compact form, that unlike PDDL make use of functions and state
constraints, and 2) general width-based search algorithms capable of finding
plans over huge combinatorial spaces using weak heuristics only. Empirical
results are presented for a PR2 robot manipulating tens of objects, for which
long plans are required.

wireless LANs and 5G cellular networks to benefit from their multiple GHz of

require highly directional antennas. Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the
transmitter and receiver need to align their antenna beams before they can
communicate. Existing solutions scan the entire space to find the best
alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay,
and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly
switch between users and accommodate mobile clients.
  This paper presents Rapid-Link, a new protocol that can find the best mmWave
beam alignment without scanning the space. Given all possible directions for
setting the antenna beam, Rapid-Link provably finds the optimal direction in
logarithmic number of measurements. Further, Rapid-Link works within the
existing 802.11ad standard for mmWave LAN, and can support both clients and
access points. We have implemented Rapid-Link in a mmWave radio and evaluated
it empirically. Our results show that it reduces beam alignment delay by orders
of magnitude. In particular, for highly directional mmWave devices operating
under 802.11ad, the delay drops from over a second to 2.5 ms.

paper, we consider the problem of matching two correlated graphs when an
attacker has access to side information, either in the form of community labels
or an imperfect initial matching. In the former case, we propose a naive graph
matching algorithm by introducing the community degree vectors which harness
the information from community labels in an efficient manner. Furthermore, we
analyze a variant of the basic percolation algorithm proposed in literature for
graphs with community structure. In the latter case, we propose a novel
percolation algorithm with two thresholds which uses an imperfect matching as
input to match correlated graphs.
  We evaluate the proposed algorithms on synthetic as well as real world

importance of communities as side information especially when the number of

have, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities a
football player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profile
matching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested
profile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory
that uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the
interval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such
lattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics to
represent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, how
human expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most
accurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with
matching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild
plausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the
computed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A second
question concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For
matching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a
given one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on
grounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenance
of the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profile
instances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be
exploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be
extended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matching
will be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory that
exploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. It
will be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending the
underlying lattice.

supergravity, both through the Freund-Rubin solution and the Englert solution

that $S^{3,4}$ enjoys a similar role in $M'$-theory and construct the exotic

games. An Ensemble agent is a compound agent composed of multiple agents, each
with its own tasks or goals to achieve. Usually when dealing with real-time
decision making, reactive agents are used; that is agents that return a
decision based on the current state. While reactive agents are very fast, most
games require more than just a rule-based agent to achieve good results.
Deliberative agents---agents that use a forward model to search future
states---are very useful in games with no hard time limit, such as Go or
Backgammon, but generally take too long for real-time games. The Ensemble
framework addresses this issue by allowing the agent to be both deliberative
and reactive at the same time. This is achieved by breaking up the game-play
into logical roles and having highly focused components for each role, with
each component disregarding anything outwith its own role. Reactive agents can
be used where a reactive agent is suited to the role, and where a deliberative
approach is required, branching is kept to a minimum by the removal of all
extraneous factors, enabling an informed decision to be made within a much
smaller time-frame. An Arbiter is used to combine the component results,
allowing high performing agents to be created from simple, efficient
components.

difficult because of the astrophysical noise, that may produce radial velocity
(RV) variations similar to those induced by a companion. On the other hand any
stellar signal is wavelength dependent, while signals due to a companion are
achromatic. Aims. Our goal is to determine the origin of the Doppler periodic
variations observed in the thick disk K giant star TYC 4282-605-1 by HARPS-N at
the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and verify if they can be due to the
presence of a substellar companion. Methods. Several methods have been used to
exclude the stellar origin of the observed signal including detailed analysis
of activity indicators and bisector and the analysis of the photometric light
curve. Finally we have conducted an observational campaign to monitor the near
infrared (NIR) RV with GIANO at the TNG in order to verify whether the NIR
amplitude variations are comparable with those observed in the visible.
Results. Both optical and NIR RVs show consistent variations with a period at
101 days and similar amplitude, pointing to the presence of a companion
orbiting the target. The main orbital properties obtained for our giant star
with a derived mass of M=0.97+-0.03M_sun are
M_Psini=10.78+-0.12MJ;P=101.54+-0.05days;e=0.28+-0.01 and a=0.422+-0.009AU. The
chemical analysis shows a significant enrichment in the abundance of Nai, Mgi,
Ali and S i while the rest of analyzed elements are consistent with the solar
value demonstrating that the chemical composition corresponds with an old K
giant (age = 10.1 Gyr) belonging to local thick disk. Conclusions. We conclude
that the substellar companion hypothesis for this K giant is the best
explanation for the observed periodic RV variation. This study also shows the
high potential of multi-wavelength RV observations for the validation of planet
candidates.

2.0 kpc. We find that the region consists of four different velocity
components: very low velocity (VLV) clump, low velocity component (LVC), main
velocity component (MVC), and high velocity component (HVC). The LVC and the
HVC have cavities. UV photons radiated from NGC 6618 cluster penetrate into the
N cloud up to $\sim$ 5 pc through the cavities and interact with molecular gas.
This interaction is correlated with the distribution of YSOs in the N cloud.
The LVC and the HVC are distributed complementary after that the HVC is
displaced by 0.8 pc toward the east-southeast direction, suggesting that
collision of the LVC and the HVC create the cavities in both clouds. The
collision velocity and timescale are estimated to be 9.9 km s$^{-1}$ and $1.1
\times 10^{5}$ yr, respectively. The high collision velocity can provide the
mass accretion rate up to 10$^{-3}$ $M_{\solar}$ yr$^{-1}$, and the high column
density ($4 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) might result in massive cluster
formation. The scenario of cloud-cloud collision likely well explains the
stellar population and its formation history of NGC 6618 cluster proposed by
Hoffmeister et al. (2008).

i.e., these CFTs can be almost fixed by few lowest operators in certain

equation involves several conserved or shorted operators and by imposing gaps
in these sectors it is possible to isolate different CFTs. Specifically, we

processes on networks, including epidemic and information spreading. While
devising stochastic models of such processes is relatively easy, analyzing them
is very challenging from a computational point of view, particularly for large
networks appearing in real applications. One strategy to reduce the complexity
of their analysis is to rely on approximations, often in terms of a set of
differential equations capturing the evolution of a random node, distinguishing
nodes with different topological contexts (i.e., different degrees of different
neighborhoods), like degree-based mean field (DBMF), approximate master
equation (AME), or pair approximation (PA). The number of differential
equations so obtained is typically proportional to the maximum degree kmax of
the network, which is much smaller than the size of the master equation of the
underlying stochastic model, yet numerically solving these equations can still
be problematic for large kmax. In this paper, we extend AME and PA, which has
been proposed only for the binary state case, to a multi-state setting and
provide an aggregation procedure that clusters together nodes having similar
degrees, treating those in the same cluster as indistinguishable, thus reducing
the number of equations while preserving an accurate description of global
observables of interest. We also provide an automatic way to build such
equations and to identify a small number of degree clusters that give accurate
results. The method is tested on several case studies, where it shows a high
level of compression and a reduction of computational time of several orders of
magnitude for large networks, with minimal loss in accuracy.

ephemeris information to update the orbit propagation model and maintain
pointing. At 400 km, these uploads were required once every other week. At
$\sim$270 km, they were required every day. We also characterized the power
performance of our electric power system, which includes a novel pseudo-peak
power tracker -- a resistor that limited the current draw from the battery on
the solar panels. With 19 30\% efficient solar cells and an 8 W system load,
the power balance had 65\% of margin on orbit. We present several

vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level

number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual
system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of
human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important
architectural and processing differences between state-of-the-art DNNs and the
primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these
differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing
human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the
human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast
reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find
progressively diverging classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs
when the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked
differences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object
recognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured

the computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a
motivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could
facilitate this robustness.

rare in a single candidate set, giving a highly unbalanced two-class problem.
The goal is to rank proteins in a candidate set according to the probability of

all the homologous proteins at the head of such a list. Our approach uses an
ensemble of models in a classifier and an ensemble of assessment metrics. For a

the predictions of the theory match what we see in the data? But we also care
about completeness: how much of the predictable variation in the data is
captured by the theory? This question is difficult to answer, because in
general we do not know how much ""predictable variation"" there is in the
problem. In this paper, we consider approaches motivated by machine learning
algorithms as a means of constructing a benchmark for the best attainable level
of prediction.
  We illustrate our methods on the task of predicting human-generated random
sequences. Relative to an atheoretical machine learning algorithm benchmark, we
find that existing behavioral models explain roughly 15 percent of the
predictable variation in this problem. This fraction is robust across several
variations on the problem. We also consider a version of this approach for
analyzing field data from domains in which human perception and generation of
randomness has been used as a conceptual framework; these include sequential
decision-making and repeated zero-sum games. In these domains, our framework
for testing the completeness of theories provides a way of assessing their
effectiveness over different contexts; we find that despite some differences,
the existing theories are fairly stable across our field domains in their
performance relative to the benchmark. Overall, our results indicate that (i)
there is a significant amount of structure in this problem that existing models
have yet to capture and (ii) there are rich domains in which machine learning
may provide a viable approach to testing completeness.

formed into accurate, highly curved optical surfaces with undiminished
functionality. Our key development is a pneumatic forming process that avoids
rigid mechanical constraints and suppresses wrinkling instabilities. A
combination of forming-mold design, pressure membrane elastic properties, and
controlled friction forces enables us to gradually contact the die at the
corners and smoothly press the sensor into a spherical shape. Allowing the die
to slide into the concave target shape enables a threefold increase in the
spherical curvature over prior approaches having mechanical constraints that
resist deformation, and create a high-stress, stretch-dominated state. Our
process creates a bridge between the high precision and low-cost but planar
CMOS process, and ideal non-planar component shapes such as spherical imagers
for improved optical systems. We demonstrate these curved sensors in prototype
cameras with custom lenses, measuring exceptional resolution of 3220
line-widths per picture height at an aperture of f/1.2 and nearly 100% relative
illumination across the field. Though we use a 1/2.3"" format image sensor in

of the art imaging sensor formats. By example, we report photogrammetry test
data for an APS-C sized silicon die formed to a 30$^\circ$ subtended spherical

generation of ultra-high performance, manufacturable, digital imaging systems

$\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ means that the density matrix of the molecule is not
fully renewed after time $\tau_1$ and the probability of observing waiting time
$\tau_2$ for the second electron transfer depends on the previous electron
waiting time $\tau_1$. The strong electron-vibration coupling is required for
the emergence of the non-renewal statistics. We show that in Franck-Condon
blockade regime the extremely rare tunnelling events become positively
correlated.

A thorough
numerical investigation takes place in several types of two-dimensional planes
and also in a three-dimensional subspace of the entire four-dimensional phase
space in order to distinguish between bounded (ordered and chaotic) and
escaping orbits. The determination of the location of the basins of escape
toward the different escape channels and their correlations with the
corresponding escape time of the orbits is undoubtedly an issue of paramount
importance. It was found that in all examined cases all initial conditions
correspond to escaping orbits, while there is no numerical indication of stable
bounded motion, apart from some isolated unstable periodic orbits. Furthermore,
we monitor how the fractality evolves when the total orbital energy varies. The
larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial conditions in
the fractal basin boundaries, while the lowest escape rates belong to orbits
with initial conditions inside the basins of escape. We hope that our numerical
analysis will be useful for a further understanding of the escape dynamics of
orbits in open Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.

setup, which has implications for Raman scattering, enhancement of spontaneous
emission of a molecule by an antenna, sensing, and modeling a metallic tip in

a point charge in an $\epsilon_{2}$ host medium in the presence of an
$\epsilon_{1}$ sphere using the sphere eigenstates, where $\epsilon_1$ and
$\epsilon_2$ can take any values. Only the $m=0$ spherical harmonics are
employed in the expansion and the calculation of the potential and the electric
field is very simple. The electric field is strongly enhanced when
$\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_2$ is close to an $(\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_2)_l$
eigenvalue of a dominant mode, which is determined by the point charge location
and the measurement point. An electric field exists inside the sphere when
$\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_2$ is close to a $(\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_2)_l$ resonance
even when $\epsilon_1$ is a conductor. Low order modes generate an electric
field far away from the interface, where the $l=1$ mode with a resonance at
$\epsilon_1=-2\epsilon_2$ generates a field at the sphere center. The high
order modes which are associated with high spatial frequencies become more
dominant when the point charge approaches the sphere surface or when the
physical parameters are close the high order modes resonances. When
$\epsilon_{1}/\epsilon_2$ is smaller or larger than the eigenvalues of the
dominant modes, the modes interfere constructively and generate a strong signal
at an angular direction equal to that of the source. The spectral information
at the sphere surface may be utilized to calculate the point charge location
without knowing its magnitude.

but observers only see a point response. The extent of the wavefront becomes
evident only in statistical accumulation of many independent detections, with
probability given by the Born rule. Drawing on concepts from quantum optics, we
analyze a simple model to reverse-engineer how this behavior can come about in
terms of wave mechanics alone without a measurement axiom. The model detector
consists of many molecules, each of which can be resonantly excited by the
incoming particle and then emit a detection signature (e.g., localized flash of
light). Different molecules have different resonant energies because local
conditions (proximity of other molecules, Doppler shifts, etc.) vary. The
detector is thus a quasi-continuum, and the incoming particle preferentially
excites the molecule that it matches most closely in energy. (In actuality,
molecules can be so numerous that many could closely match the incoming
particle in energy; but in that case only one will be the first, and there will
be nothing left for the others by the time the first match resonates and then
emits. The model does not explicitly take into account the temporal advance of
the particle wave packet through the detector medium.) The excited molecule can
emit a detection signature, but that process competes with fluctuation-driven
dephasing. We estimate the probability that a given molecule is resonantly
excited, and we also estimate the probability that a detection signature is
produced before being overwhelmed by fluctuations in the detector medium. The
product of these two probabilities is proportional to the absolute-square of
the incoming wavefunction at the molecule in question, i.e. the Born rule. We
discuss ways to probe these mechanisms experimentally, and check the model with
numbers from a neutron interference experiment.

indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators
result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including
both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class
attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics.
