applications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models
have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\&MLP paradigm. In these
methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional
embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a
group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way,
user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in
regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a
bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\&MLP methods to capture
user's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this
paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this
challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the
representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a
certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the
expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques:
mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can
help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters.
Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production
dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed
approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art
methods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display
advertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.

Given an input dynamic texture, statistics of filter responses from the object

while statistics of filter responses from the optical flow ConvNet model its
dynamics. To generate a novel texture, a randomly initialized input sequence is
optimized to match the feature statistics from each stream of an example

two-stream model, we also apply the synthesis approach to combine the texture
appearance from one texture with the dynamics of another to generate entirely
novel dynamic textures. We show that our approach generates novel, high quality

the development of magma oceans. During their solidification, large amounts of

dominated steam atmospheres may be lost efficiently via hydrodynamic escape due
to the low gravity and the high stellar EUV luminosities. Protoplanets forming
later from such degassed building blocks could therefore be drier than
previously expected. We model the outgassing and subsequent hydrodynamic escape
of steam atmospheres from such embryos. The efficient outflow of H drags along
heavier species (O, CO$_2$, noble gases). The full range of possible EUV
evolution tracks of a solar-mass star is taken into account to investigate the
escape from Mars-sized embryos at different orbital distances. The envelopes
are typically lost within a few to a few tens of Myr. Furthermore, we study the
influence on protoplanetary evolution, exemplified by Venus. We investigate
different early evolution scenarios and constrain realistic cases by comparing
modeled noble gas isotope ratios with observations. Starting from solar values,
consistent isotope ratios (Ne, Ar) can be found for different solar EUV
histories, as well as assumptions about the initial atmosphere (either pure
steam or a mixture with accreted H). Our results generally favor an early
accretion scenario with a small amount of accreted H and a low-activity Sun,
because in other cases too much CO$_2$ is lost during evolution, which is
inconsistent with Venus' present atmosphere. Important issues are likely the
time at which the initial steam atmosphere is outgassed and/or the amount of
CO$_2$ which may still be delivered at later evolutionary stages. A late
accretion scenario can only reproduce present isotope ratios for a highly
active young Sun, but then very massive steam atmospheres would be required.

To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Huber regression for robust

tradeoff between bias and robustness. Our theoretical framework deals with
heavy-tailed distributions with bounded $(1+\delta)$-th moment for any $\delta

parameters in both low and high dimensions: when $\delta \geq 1$, the estimator
admits a sub-Gaussian-type deviation bound without sub-Gaussian assumptions on
the data, while only a slower rate is available in the regime $0<\delta< 1$.
Furthermore, this transition is smooth and optimal. In addition, we extend the
methodology to allow both heavy-tailed predictors and observation noise.
Simulation studies lend further support to the theory. In a genetic study of
cancer cell lines that exhibit heavy-tailedness, the proposed methods are shown
to be more robust and predictive.

The approach utilizes LASSO regularization as a statistical tool to extract
decisive words from textual content and draw statistical inferences based on
the correspondence between the occurrences of words and an exogenous response
variable. Accordingly, the method immediately suggests significant implications
for social sciences and Information Systems research: everyone can now identify
text segments and word choices that are statistically relevant to authors or
readers and, based on this knowledge, test hypotheses from behavioral research.
We demonstrate the contribution of our method by examining how authors
communicate subjective information through narrative materials. This allows us
to answer the question of which words to choose when communicating negative
information. On the other hand, we show that investors trade not only upon
facts in financial disclosures but are distracted by filler words and
non-informative language. Practitioners - for example those in the fields of
investor communications or marketing - can exploit our insights to enhance
their writings based on the true perception of word choice.

distribute information about a secret over a set of participants in such a way
that only specific authorized combinations of participants together can
reconstruct the secret. Thus, secret sharing schemes are systems of variables
in which it is very clearly specified which subsets have information about the
secret. As such, they provide perfect model systems for information
decompositions. However, following this intuition too far leads to an
information decomposition with negative partial information terms, which are
difficult to interpret. One possible explanation is that the partial
information lattice proposed by Williams and Beer is incomplete and has to be
extended to incorporate terms corresponding to higher order redundancy. These
results put bounds on information decompositions that follow the partial
information framework, and they hint at where the partial information lattice
needs to be improved.

However, the subtle inter-relation of these phases remains poorly understood,

experiments can provide new insights, by tracking the relaxation kinetics
following excitation at frequencies related to the broken symmetry state. Here,
we investigate the transient terahertz conductivity of BaPb1-xBixO3 - a
material for which superconductivity is adjacent to a competing CDW phase -
after optical excitation tuned to the CDW absorption band. In insulating BaBiO3
we observed an increase in conductivity and a subsequent relaxation, which are
consistent with quasiparticles injection across a rigid semiconducting gap. In
the doped compound BaPb0.72Bi0.28O3 (superconducting below Tc=7K), a similar
response was also found immediately above Tc. This observation evidences the
presence of a robust gap up to T=40 K, which is presumably associated with
short-range CDW correlations. A qualitatively different behaviour was observed
in the same material fo T>40 K. Here, the photo-conductivity was dominated by
an enhancement in carrier mobility at constant density, suggestive of melting
of the CDW correlations rather than excitation across an optical gap. The
relaxation displayed a temperature dependent, Arrhenius-like kinetics,
suggestive of the crossing of a free-energy barrier between two phases. These
results support the existence of short-range CDW correlations above Tc in

anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an
intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high
reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI)
data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification
strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification
confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities.
Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in
vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean
accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB)
and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the
confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy,
and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data.
Significance: This work significantly enhances the state of art in automatic
labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric,
and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue
classification. The data of our experiments will be released as the first in

these QWs were varied in order to keep the emission peak fixed at 1.55 $\mu$m.
The well thickness has an effect on the spectral width of the gain curves. On

theories by adopting a differential geometric approach which treats the scalar
fields as coordinates living on a field-space manifold. This ensures that our
description of inflation is both conformally and reparameterization covariant.
Our formulation gives rise to extensions of the usual Hubble and potential
slow-roll parameters to generalized fully frame-covariant forms, which allow us
to provide manifestly frame-invariant predictions for cosmological observables,
such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, the spectral indices $n_{\cal R}$ and
$n_T$, their runnings $\alpha_{\cal R}$ and $\alpha_T$, the non-Gaussianity
parameter $f_{NL}$, and the isocurvature fraction $\beta_{\rm iso}$. We examine
the role of the field space curvature in the generation and transfer of
isocurvature modes, and we investigate the effect of boundary conditions for
the scalar fields at the end of inflation on the observable inflationary
quantities. We explore the stability of the trajectories with respect to the
boundary conditions by using a suitable sensitivity parameter. To illustrate
our approach, we first analyze a simple minimal two-field scenario before
studying a more realistic nonminimal model inspired by Higgs inflation. We find
that isocurvature effects are greatly enhanced in the latter scenario and must
be taken into account for certain values in the parameter space such that the
model is properly normalized to the observed scalar power spectrum $P_{\cal
R}$. Finally, we outline how our frame-covariant approach may be extended
beyond the tree-level approximation through the Vilkovisky-De Witt formalism,
which we generalize to take into account conformal transformations, thereby
leading to a fully frame-invariant effective action at the one-loop level.

position of the K2V star and the purported planet. The quasi-steady radio
emission at frequencies $\ge \!8$ GHz is consistent with a stellar origin. The
quality of the 4-8 GHz astrometry provides no meaningful constraint on the
origin of the emission. The location of the 2-4 GHz radio pulse is $>2.5\sigma$

states in $b$-hadron decays is studied with $pp$ collision data corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of $3.0fb^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment
at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. Denoting by $B_C\equiv B(b\to
CX)\times B(C\to\phi\phi)$ the inclusive branching fraction of a $b$ hadron to
a charmonium state $C$ that decays into a pair of $\phi$ mesons, ratios
$R^{C1}_{C2}\equiv B_{C1}/B_{C2}$ are determined as
$R^{\chi_{c0}}_{\eta_c(1S)}=0.147\pm0.023\pm0.011$, $R^{\chi_{c1}}_{\eta_c
(1S)}=0.073\pm0.016\pm0.006$, $R^{\chi_{c2}}_{\eta_c
(1S)}=0.081\pm0.013\pm0.005$, $R^{\chi_{c1}}_{\chi_{c0}}=0.50\pm0.11\pm0.01$,
$R^{\chi_{c2}}_{\chi_{c0}}=0.56\pm0.10\pm0.01$ and $R^{\eta_c
(2S)}_{\eta_c(1S)}=0.040\pm0.011\pm0.004$. Here and below the first
uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Upper limits at $90\%$
confidence level for the inclusive production of $X(3872)$, $X(3915)$ and
$\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states are obtained as $R^{X(3872)}_{\chi_{c1}}<0.34$,
$R^{X(3915)}_{\chi_{c0}}<0.12$ and $R^{\chi_{c2}(2P)}_{\chi_{c2}}<0.16$.
Differential cross-sections as a function of transverse momentum are measured
for the $\eta_c(1S)$ and $\chi_c$ states. The branching fraction of the decay
$B_s^0\rightarrow\phi\phi\phi$ is measured for the first time,
$B(B_s^0\to\phi\phi\phi)=(2.15\pm0.54\pm0.28\pm0.21_{B})\times 10^{-6}$. Here
the third uncertainty is due to the branching fraction of the decay
$B_s^0\to\phi\phi$, which is used for normalization. No evidence for
intermediate resonances is seen. A preferentially transverse $\phi$
polarization is observed. The measurements allow the determination of the ratio
of the branching fractions for the $\eta_c(1S)$ decays to $\phi\phi$ and
$p\bar{p}$ as $B(\eta_c(1S)\to\phi\phi)/B(\eta_c(1S)\to
p\bar{p})=1.79\pm0.14\pm0.32$.

application in high performance, low power electro-optical systems. p-n
junctions based on vertically stacked heterostructures have shown very
promising performance as tunneling transistors, light emitting devices and
photodetectors, and as photovoltaic cells . Although complex vertical
heterostructures were fabricated via van der Waals stacking of different 2D
materials, atomically sharp multi-junctions in lateral heterostructures is a
quite challenging task, but a viable route towards the development of
commercial applications. Previously reported approaches to obtain
single-junction lateral heterostructures of the type MoX2-WX2 (X= S and/or Se),
involve either a single-step or a two-step growth process. However, these
methods lack the flexibility to control the lateral width of the TMD domain as
well as its composition. Here, we report a simple and yet scalable synthesis
approach for the fabrication of lateral multi-junction heterostructures based
on the combination of different TMD monolayers [MoX2-WX2 (X2 = S2, Se2 or
SSe)]. Atomically sharp lateral junctions are sequentially synthesized from
solid precursors by changing only the reactive gas environment in the presence
of water vapor. This allows to selectively control the water-induced oxidation,
volatilization and hence the relative amount of a specific metal oxide vapor,
leading to the selective edge-epitaxial growth of either MoX2 or WX2. Spatially
dependent photoluminescence and atomic-resolution images confirm the high
crystallinity of the monolayers and the seamless lateral connectivity between
the different TMD domains. These findings could be extended to other families
of 2D materials, and creates the foundation towards the development of complex
and atomically thin in-plane super-lattices, devices and integrated circuits.

cSYK, that is $SL(2,R)$ invariant for all values of the coupling. The
modification consists of replacing the UV part of the SYK action with a
quadratic bilocal term. The corresponding bulk dual is a non-gravitational
theory in a rigid AdS$_2$ background. At weak coupling cSYK is a generalized
free field theory; at strong coupling, it approaches the infrared of SYK. The
existence of this line of fixed points explains the previously found connection

evolution and the internal gas dynamics of galaxies it is important to
understand the selection effects behind the quasar samples and in particular if
the selection criteria exclude foreground galaxies with certain properties
(most importantly a high dust content). Here we present spectroscopic follow-up
from the 10.4-m GTC telescope of a dust-reddened quasar, eHAQ0111+0641, from
the extended High A_V Quasar (HAQ) survey. We find that the z=3.21 quasar has a
foreground Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber (DLA) at z=2.027 along the line of
sight. The DLA has very strong metal lines due to a moderately high metallicity
(with an inferred lower limit of 25% of the solar metallicity), but a very
large gas column density along the line-of-sight in its host galaxy. This
discovery is further evidence that there is a dust bias affecting the census of
metals, caused by the combined effect of dust obscuration and reddening, in
existing samples of z>2 DLAs. The case of eHAQ0111+0641 illustrates that dust
bias is not only caused by dust obscuration, but also dust reddening.

condition for sampling weights and on sampling the expansion in cluster
operators of different excitation levels. We term these modifications even and
truncated selection respectively. Utilising both approaches demonstrates
dramatically improved calculation stability as well as reduced computational
and memory costs. These modifications are particularly effective at higher
truncation levels owing to the large number of terms within the cluster
expansion that can be neglected, as demonstrated by the reduction of the number
of terms to be sampled at the level of CCSDT by 77% and at CCSDTQ56 by 98%.

key elements in hi-frequency trading: stop-loss and leverage. We consider, as
in Bertram (2009), a mean-reverting process for the security price with
proportional transaction costs; we show how to introduce stop-loss and leverage
in an optimal trading strategy.
  We focus on repeated strategies using a self-financing portfolio. For every
given stop-loss level we derive analytically the optimal investment strategy
consisting of optimal leverage and market entry/exit levels.
  First we show that the optimal strategy a' la Bertram depends on the
probabilities to reach entry/exit levels, on expected First-Passage-Times and
on expected First-Exit-Times from an interval. Then, when the underlying
log-price follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we deduce analytical
expressions for expected First-Exit-Times and we derive the long-run return of
the strategy as an elementary function of the stop-loss.
  Following industry practice of pairs trading we consider an example of pair
in the energy futures' market, reporting in detail the analysis for a spread on
Heating-Oil and Gas-Oil futures in one year sample of half-an-hour market

radius and the density structure of the outer disc, while the inner disc

with respect to the equator of the central star, is found to be offset compared
to the orbital line of nodes, and to vary periodically in time, with a period

of the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted
their fuel for star formation(1-4). It is believed that they were formed in
intense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive
local elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor
companions(5,6), but validating this picture requires higher-resolution
observations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from
gravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of

kinematics of a lensed z = 2.1478 compact galaxy, which surprisingly turns out
to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have
formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst(8). The
galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate
the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter
halo(9). This result confirms previous indirect indications(10-13) that the

considered in which a user wishes to privately retrieve one out of $K$

local cache of storage $SL$ bits which can be used to store any function of the
$K$ messages. The main contribution of this work is the exact characterization
of the capacity of cache aided PIR as a function of the storage parameter $S$.
In particular, for a given cache storage parameter $S$, the
information-theoretically optimal download cost $D^{*}(S)/L$ (or the inverse of
capacity) is shown to be equal to $(1- \frac{S}{K})\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \ldots

settings when $S=0$, for which the optimal download cost was shown by Sun and

case when $S=K$, i.e., cache size is large enough to store all messages
locally, for which the optimal download cost is $0$. The intermediate points
$S\in (0, K)$ can be readily achieved through a simple memory-sharing based PIR
scheme. The key technical contribution of this work is the converse, i.e., a
lower bound on the download cost as a function of storage $S$ which shows that

planetary magnetic fields produces radio auroral emission. We examine the
detectability of radio auroral emission from Proxima b, the closest known
exosolar planet orbiting our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. Using
the Radiometric Bode's Law, we estimate the radio flux produced by the
interaction of Proxima Centauri's stellar wind and Proxima b's magnetosphere
for different planetary magnetic field strengths. For plausible planetary
masses, Proxima b produces 6-83 mJy of auroral radio flux at frequencies of
0.3-0.8 MHz for planetary magnetic field strengths of 1-3 B$_{\oplus}$.
According to recent MHD models that vary the orbital parameters of the system,
this emission is expected to be highly variable. This variability is due to
large fluctuations in the size of Proxima b's magnetosphere as it crosses the
equatorial streamer regions of the dense stellar wind and high dynamic
pressure. Using the MHD model of Garraffo et al. 2016 for the variation of the
magnetosphere radius during the orbit, we estimate that the observed radio flux
can vary nearly by an order of magnitude over the 11.2 day period of Proxima b.
The detailed amplitude variation depends on the stellar wind, orbital, and
planetary magnetic field parameters. We discuss observing strategies for
proposed future space-based observatories to reach frequencies below the
ionospheric cut off ($\sim 10$ MHz) as would be required to detect the signal
we investigate.

the radius-luminosity locus of Local Group and M81 satellites and among the
faintest confirmed satellites outside the Local Group. Assuming an age of 12
Gyr, d1005+68's red giant branch is best fit by an isochrone of [Fe/H] $= -1.90

5 kpc. As this is well within BK5N's virial radius, we speculate that d1005+68

first detected satellites-of-a-satellite.

clusters occurs on time scales of about 5 Myr. Several processes are thought to
be responsible for this disc dispersal. Here we compare two of these processes:
dynamical encounters and interaction with the interstellar medium, which
includes face-on accretion and ram pressure stripping. We perform simulations
of embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to
determine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant. We
find that face-on accretion, including ram pressure stripping, is the dominant
disc truncation process if the fraction of the total cluster mass in stars is
$\lesssim 30\,\%$ regardless of the cluster mass and radius. Dynamical
encounters require stellar densities $\gtrsim 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$ combined with a
mass fraction in stars of $\approx 90\,\%$ to become the dominant process. Our
results show that during the embedded phase of the cluster, the truncation of
the discs is dominated by face-on accretion and dynamical encounters become
dominant when the intra-cluster gas has been expelled. As a result of face-on
accretion the protoplanetary discs become compact and their surface density
increases. In contrast, dynamical encounters lead to discs that are less
massive and remain larger.

artificial wavefront reference sources to help correct (in part) the impact of

characterize the spectral signature of the uplink beams from the 22W lasers to
assess the impact of laser scattering from the 4LGSF on science observations.
We use the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a
resolution of R~3000 of the uplink laser beams over the wavelength range of
4750\AA\ to 9350\AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman
scattering by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the
atmosphere above the astronomical observatory of Cerro Paranal. In particular,
our observations reveal the characteristic spectral signature of laser photons

5889.959\AA\ -- landing on the 8.2m primary mirror of UT4 after being
Raman-scattered on their way up to the sodium layer. Laser-induced Raman
scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common to any
astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus
essential for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle
thoroughly the possibility of a Raman spectral contamination via a proper
baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures. These
considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph
on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple
telescopes, laser collision prediction tools also ought to account for the
presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid the
unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the

the radiative efficiency of the super-Eddington accretion process on the
clustering of quasars using a new semi-analytic model of galaxy and quasar
formation based on large-volume cosmological $N$-body simulations. Our model
includes a simple model for the radiative efficiency of a quasar, which
imitates the effect of photon trapping for a high mass accretion rate. We find
that the model of radiative efficiency affects the relation between the quasar
luminosity and the quasar host halo mass. The quasar host halo mass has only
weak dependence on quasar luminosity when there is no upper limit for quasar
luminosity. On the other hand, it has significant dependence on quasar
luminosity when the quasar luminosity is limited by its Eddington luminosity.
In the latter case, the quasar bias also depends on the quasar luminosity, and
the quasar bias of bright quasars is in agreement with observations. Our
results suggest that the quasar clustering studies can provide a constraint on
the accretion disc model.

explanations of this fact. If the BH spin magnitudes are large then (i) either
both BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin
angular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in
magnitude. Or, (iii) the BH spin magnitudes are small. We test the third
hypothesis within the framework of the classical isolated binary evolution
scenario of the BH-BH merger formation. We test three models of angular
momentum transport in massive stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional
currents (as employed in the Geneva code), an efficient transport by the
Tayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (as implemented in the MESA code), and a
very-efficient transport (as proposed by Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH
spins. We allow for binary evolution to increase the BH spins through accretion
and account for the potential spin-up of stars through tidal interactions.
Additionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin BH masses,
include revisions to the history of star formation and to the chemical
evolution across cosmic time. We find that we can match simultaneously the
observed BH-BH merger rate density, BH masses, and effective spins. Models with
efficient angular momentum transport are favored. The updated stellar-mass
weighted gas-phase metallicity evolution now used in our models appears to be a
key in better reproducing the LIGO/Virgo merger rate estimate. Mass losses
during the pair-instability pulsation supernova phase are likely overestimated
if the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive than 50 Msun. We also estimate
rate of BH-NS mergers from recent LIGO/Virgo observations. Our updated models
of BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS mergers are now publicly available at

feedback are taken into account self-consistently, based on the spatial
distribution of the haloes. Our results are consistent with the non-detection
of Pop III survivors in the Milky Way today. We find that possible surviving
Population III stars are more common in Milky Way satellites than in the main
Galaxy. In particular, low mass Milky Way satellites contain a much larger
fraction of Pop~III stars than the Milky Way. Such nearby, low mass Milky Way
satellites are promising targets for future attempts to find Pop~III survivors,

dispersion profile which is nearly flat at $\sigma$ $\approx$ 285 km/s in the
inner $\sim$5 kpc, and then rises steadily to $\sigma$ $\approx$ 360 km/s at
$\sim$30 kpc. We analyse the kinematics using axisymmetric Jeans models,
finding that the data require both a significant dark matter halo (to fit the
rising outer profile) and a compact central component, with mass $M_{\rm cen}$
$\approx$ 2.5$\times$10$^{10}$ $M_\odot$ (to fit the flat {\sigma} in the inner
regions). The latter component could represent a super-massive black hole, in
which case it would be among the largest known to date. Alternatively $M_{\rm
cen}$ could describe excess mass associated with a gradient in the stellar
mass-to-light ratio. Imposing a standard NFW dark matter density profile, we
recover a stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon$ which is consistent with a
Milky-Way-like initial mass function (IMF). By anchoring the models using the
lensing mass constraint, we break the degeneracy between $\Upsilon$ and the
inner slope $\gamma$ of the dark matter profile, finding $\gamma$=1.0$\pm$0.1,
consistent with the NFW form. We show that our results are quite sensitive to
the treatment of the central mass in the models. Neglecting $M_{\rm cen}$
biases the results towards both a heavier-than-Salpeter IMF and a
shallower-than-NFW dark matter slope ($\gamma$ $\approx$ 0.5).

for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in
particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit
an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses
the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and
by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of
the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter
decreases with increasing stellar masses, suggesting a larger variety of star
formation histories in low mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical
predictions, and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of
progenitors of low mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the
efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low mass halos.
Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift
milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete
understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.

orbital characteristics of the binary suggest that the system is observed at a
very low inclination angle (~8 deg -14 deg) and that the star is filling or
even overflowing its Roche Lobe. This, together with the equivalent width of
the Halpha emission (~20 Ang), suggest possible on-going mass transfer. The
possibile presence of such a on-going mass transfer during a quiescence state
also suggests that the radio pulsar is not active yet and thus this system,

nonlinear sigma model, the statistics of one-body wave functions are encoded by
the constrained matrix field, while physical correlations follow from the
hydrodynamic density or spin response field, which decouples the interactions.
Integrating out the matrix field first, we obtain weak (anti)localization and
Altshuler-Aronov quantum conductance corrections from the hydrodynamic response
function. This procedure automatically incorporates the correct infrared
physics, and in particular gives the Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitsky (AAK)
equations for dephasing of weak (anti)localization due to electron-electron
collisions. We explicate the method by deriving known quantum corrections in
two dimensions for the symplectic metal class AII, as well as the spin-SU(2)
invariant superconductor classes C and CI. We show that conductance corrections
due to the special modes at zero energy in nonstandard classes are
automatically cut off by temperature, as previously expected, while the
Wigner-Dyson class Cooperon modes that persist to all energies are cut by
dephasing. We also show that for short-ranged interactions, the standard
self-consistent solution for the dephasing rate is equivalent to a diagrammatic
summation via the self-consistent Born approximation. This should be compared
to the AAK solution for long-ranged Coulomb interactions, which exploits the
Markovian noise correlations induced by thermal fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field. We discuss prospects for exploring the many-body
localization transition from the ergodic side as a dephasing catastrophe in
short-range interacting models.

configurations are favored for which the Higgs vacuum expectation value drops
near the string core and the gauge field is suppressed. This work found that
the strongest binding was obtained from strings that differ significantly from
Nielsen-Olesen configurations, deforming essentially only the Higgs field in
order to generate a strong attraction without inducing large gradients.
Extending this analysis, we consider the leading quantum correction to the
energy per unit length of a hedgehog type string, which, in contrast to the
Nielsen-Olesen configuration, contains a pseudoscalar field. To employ the
spectral method we develop the scattering and bound state problems for fermions

accretion theory in a well-constrained setting. To examine TWA 3A's
time-variable accretion behavior, we have conducted a two-year, optical
photometric monitoring campaign, obtaining dense orbital phase coverage (~20
observations per orbit) for ~15 orbital periods. From U-band measurements we
derive the time-dependent binary mass accretion rate, finding bursts of
accretion near each periastron passage. On average, these enhanced accretion
events evolve over orbital phases 0.85 to 1.05, reaching their peak at
periastron. The specific accretion rate increases above the quiescent value by
a factor of ~4 on average but the peak can be as high as an order of magnitude
in a given orbit. The phase dependence and amplitude of TWA 3A accretion is in
good agreement with numerical simulations of binary accretion with similar
orbital parameters. In these simulations, periastron accretion bursts are
fueled by periodic streams of material from the circumbinary disk that are
driven by the binary orbit. We find that TWA 3A's average accretion behavior is
remarkably similar to DQ Tau, another T Tauri binary with similar orbital
parameters, but with significantly less variability from orbit to orbit. This

The probability distribution of the detected configuration on $\Sigma$ has
density $|\psi_\Sigma|^2$, where $\psi_\Sigma$ is a suitable wave function on
$\Sigma$, and the operation $|\cdot|^2$ is suitably interpreted. We call this

there is no propagation faster than light. The wave function $\psi_\Sigma$ can

chamber detectors (RPC-PET) has been proposed for human studies, as a
complementary resource to scintillator-based PET scanners. The purpose of this
work is mainly about providing a reconstruction solution to such whole-body
single-bed data collection on an event-by-event basis. We demonstrate a fully
three-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF)-based reconstruction algorithm that is
capable of processing the highly inclined lines of response acquired from a
system with a very large axial field of view, such as those used in RPC-PET.
Such algorithm must be sufficiently fast that it will not compromise the
clinical workflow of an RPC-PET system. We present simulation results from a
voxelized version of the anthropomorphic NCAT phantom, with oncological lesions
introduced into critical regions within the human body. The list-mode data was
reconstructed with a TOF-weighted maximum-likelihood expectation maximization
(MLEM). To accelerate the reconstruction time of the algorithm, a
multi-threaded approach supported by graphical processing units (GPUs) was
developed. Additionally, a TOF-assisted data division method is suggested that
allows the data from nine body regions to be reconstructed independently and
much more rapidly. The application of a TOF-based scatter rejection method
reduces the overall body scatter from 57.1% to 32.9%. The results also show
that a 300-ps FWHM RPC-PET scanner allows for the production of a reconstructed
image in 3.5 minutes following a 7-minute acquisition upon the injection of 2
mCi of activity (146 M coincidence events). We present for the first time a
full realistic reconstruction of a whole body, long axial coverage, RPC-PET

spin-imbalanced superfluidity, in particular the elusive
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in the context of ultracold
quantum gases. The comprehensive presentation of the theoretical basis for the
FFLO state that we provide is useful also for research on the interplay between
magnetism and superconductivity in other physical systems. We focus on settings
that have been predicted to be favourable for the FFLO state, such as optical
lattices in various dimensions and spin-orbit coupled systems. These are also
the most likely systems for near-future experimental observation of the FFLO
state. Theoretical bounds, such as Bloch's and Luttinger's theorems, and
experimentally important limitations, such as finite-size effects and trapping
potentials, are considered. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of
the various ideas presented for the observation of the FFLO state. We conclude
our review with an analysis of the open questions related to the FFLO state,
such as its stability, superfluid density, collective modes and extending the
FFLO superfluid concept to new types of lattice systems.

  effect",,"Phys. Rev. E 96, 013207 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevE.96.013207",,"physics.plasm-ph astro-ph.HE physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study shows that a relativistic Hall effect significantly changes the
properties of wave propagation by deriving a linear dispersion relation for
relativistic Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD). Whereas, in non- relativistic
HMHD, the phase and group velocities of fast magnetosonic wave become
anisotropic with an increasing Hall effect, the relativistic Hall effect brings
upper bounds to the anisotropies. The Alfve\'en wave group velocity with strong
Hall effect also becomes less anisotropic than non-relativistic case. Moreover,
the group velocity surfaces of Alfv\'en and fast waves coalesce into a single
surface in the direction other than near perpendicular to the ambient magnetic
field. It is also remarkable that a characteristic scale length of the
relativistic HMHD depends on ion temperature, magnetic field strength, and
density while the non-relativistic HMHD scale length, i.e., ion skin depth,
depends only on density. The modified characteristic scale length increases as
the ion temperature increases and decreases as the magnetic field strength
increases.

  chemostat",,,,,"math.DS q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper formulates two 3D stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of two
microbial populations in a chemostat competing over a single substrate. The two
models have two distinct noise sources. One is general noise whereas the other
is dilution rate induced noise. Nonlinear Monod growth rates are assumed and
the paper is mainly focused on the parameter values where coexistence is
present deterministically. Nondimensionalising the equations around the point
of intersection of the two growth rates leads to a large parameter which is the
nondimensional substrate feed. This in turn is used to perform an asymptotic
analysis leading to a reduced 2D system of equations describing the dynamics of
the populations on and close to a line of steady states retrieved from the
deterministic stability analysis. That reduced system allows the formulation of
a spatially 2D Fokker-Planck equation which when solved numerically admits
results similar to those from simulation of the SDEs. Contrary to previous
suggestions, one particular population becomes dominant at large times.
Finally, we brie y explore the case where death rates are added.

the behaviour of the vector and pseudovector torsion fields in the weak-gravity

intensive attention due to their enhanced life times with quantum error
correction. We here propose a method to implement a universal controlled-phase
gate of two cat-state qubits, via two microwave resonators coupled to a
superconducting transmon qutrit. During the gate operation, the qutrit remains
in the ground state; thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed.
This proposal requires only two basic operations and neither classical pulse
nor measurement is needed; therefore the gate realization is simple. Numerical
simulations show that high-fidelity implementation of this gate is feasible
with current circuit QED technology. The proposal is quite general and can be
applied to implement the proposed gate with two microwave resonators or two
optical cavities coupled to a single three-level natural or artificial atom.

a finite graph $G$ by taking the convex hull of the columns of the Laplacian
matrix for $G$. Basic properties of these simplices are established, and then a
systematic investigation of $T_G$ for trees, cycles, and complete graphs is
provided. Motivated by a conjecture of Hibi and Ohsugi, our investigation
focuses on reflexivity, the integer decomposition property, and unimodality of
Ehrhart $h^*$-vectors. We prove that if $G$ is a tree, odd cycle, complete
graph, or a whiskering of an even cycle, then $T_G$ is reflexive. We show that
while $T_{K_n}$ has the integer decomposition property, $T_{C_n}$ for odd
cycles does not. The Ehrhart $h^*$-vectors of $T_G$ for trees, odd cycles, and
complete graphs are shown to be unimodal. As a special case it is shown that
when $n$ is an odd prime, the Ehrhart $h^*$-vector of $T_{C_n}$ is given by
$(h_0^*,\ldots,h_{n-1}^*)=(1,\ldots,1,n^2-n+1,1,\ldots, 1)$. We also provide a
combinatorial interpretation of the Ehrhart $h^*$-vector for $T_{K_n}$.

allowing a triple-point-free model satisfy the monodromy property. This
property is a quantitative relation between the geometry of the degeneration of
a Calabi-Yau variety $X$ and the monodromy action on the cohomology of $X$: a
Calabi-Yau variety $X$ satisfies the monodromy property if poles of the motivic
zeta function $Z_{X,\omega}(T)$ induce monodromy eigenvalues on the cohomology
of $X$.
  In this thesis, we focus on $K3$ surfaces allowing a triple-point-free model,
i.e., $K3$ surfaces allowing a strict normal crossings model such that three
irreducible components of the special fiber never meet simultaneously. Crauder
and Morrison classified these models into two main classes: so-called flowerpot
degenerations and chain degenerations. This classification is very precise,
which allows to use a combination of geometrical and combinatorial techniques
to check the monodromy property in practice.
  The first main result is an explicit computation of the poles of
$Z_{X,\omega}(T)$ for a $K3$ surface $X$ allowing a triple-point-free model and
a volume form $\omega$ on $X$. We show that the motivic zeta function can have
more than one pole. This is in contrast with previous results: so far, all
Calabi-Yau varieties known to satisfy the monodromy property have a unique
pole. We prove that $K3$ surfaces allowing a flowerpot degeneration satisfy the
monodromy property. We also show that the monodromy property holds for $K3$
surfaces with a certain chain degeneration. We don't know whether all $K3$
surfaces with a chain degeneration satisfy the monodromy property, and we
investigate what characteristics a $K3$ surface $X$ not satisfying the
monodromy property should have.

the online stage with a specific input parameter to solve the global problem at
a reduced computational cost. Recently, online approaches have been introduced,
where multiscale basis functions are adaptively constructed in some regions to
reduce the error significantly. In multiscale methods, it is desired to have
only 1-2 iterations to reduce the error to a desired threshold. Using
Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Framework, it was shown that by choosing
sufficient number of offline basis functions, the error reduction can be made
independent of physical parameters, such as scales and contrast. In this paper,
our goal is to improve this. Using our recently proposed approach and special
online basis construction in oversampled regions, we show that the error
reduction can be made sufficiently large by appropriately selecting
oversampling regions. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a three
order of magnitude error reduction, which is better than our previous methods.

least-squares solution they need to gather all these measurement at a
centralized location and then compute the solution. These data collection and
computation are inefficient because of bandwidth and time constraints and
sometimes are infeasible because of data privacy concerns. Thus distributed

slight influence on dwarf galaxy chemical evolution. Our mass-N/O relationship
shows that the secondary production of nitrogen commences at a lower stellar

delayed star formation and a dependence of cosmic downsizing on the large-scale

and its spontaneous breakdown. Minimally doubled fermions (MDF) are a category
of strictly local chiral lattice fermions, whose continuum limit reproduces two
degenerate quark flavours. The two poles of their Dirac operator are aligned
such that symmetries under charge conjugation or reflection of one particular
direction are explictly broken at finite lattice spacing. Properties of MDF are
scrutinised with regard to broken symmetry and meson spectrum to discern their
suitability for numerical studies of QCD. Interactions induce anisotropic
operator mixing for MDF. Hence, restoration of broken symmetries in the
continuum limit requires three counterterms, one of which is power-law
divergent. Counterterms and operator mixing are studied perturbatively for two
variants of MDF. Two independent non-perturbative procedures for removal of the
power-law divergence are developed by means of a numerical study of hadronic
observables for one variant of MDF in quenched approximation. Though three out
of four pseudoscalar mesons are affected by lattice artefacts, the spectrum's
continuum limit is consistent with two-flavour QCD. Thus, suitability of MDF
for numerical studies of QCD in the quenched approximation is demonstrated.

galaxies in a cosmological context. N-body simulations based on a Planck
cosmology are used to construct halo merger trees, track subhaloes, compute
spins and measure concentrations. The accretion of gas onto galaxies and the
morphological evolution of galaxies are modelled with prescriptions derived
from hydrodynamic simulations. Star formation and stellar feedback are
described with phenomenological models (as in other semianalytic codes). GalICS
2.0 computes rotation speeds from the gravitational potential of the dark
matter, the disc and the central bulge. As the rotation speed depends not only
on the virial velocity but also on the ratio of baryons to dark matter within a
galaxy, our calculation predicts a different Tully-Fisher relation from models
in which the rotation speed is proportional to the virial velocity. This is why
GalICS 2.0 is able to reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function and the
Tully-Fisher relation simultaneously. Our results are also in agreement with
halo masses from weak lensing and satellite kinematics, gas fractions, the
relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, the evolution of
the cosmic SFR density, bulge-to-disc ratios, disc sizes and the Faber-Jackson
relation.

training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the
other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of
yielding more accu- rate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this

presence of noise; ii) computational cost; and, iii) convergence. A unifying
mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each
training method provides better validation results, being parallel training
better in what is believed to be more realistic scenarios. An example using
measured data seems to reinforce such claim. We also show, with a novel

extensively by many authors, including us. It has surprisingly many features in
common with those observed in the ionization of real atoms and emission by
solids, subjected to microwave or laser radiation. Here we use new mathematical
methods to go beyond previous investigations and to provide a complete and

wave function, ionization probability, and energy distribution of the emitted

large $t$ and small $\alpha$ the energy distribution has sharp peaks at
energies which are multiples of $\omega$, corresponding to photon capture. We
obtain small $\alpha$ expansions that converge for all $t$, unlike those of
standard perturbation theory.

in either nature or engineering when a light fluid pushes against a heavy
fluid, accompanying with the formation and evolution of chaotic bubbles. Its
general evolution involves two mechanisms: bubble-merge and bubble-competition.
The former obeys a universa1 evolution law and has been well-studied, while the
latter depends on many factors and has not been well-recognized. In this paper,
we establish a theory for the latter to clarify and quantify the longstanding
open question: the dependence of bubbles evolution on the dominant factors of
arbitrary density ratio, broadband initial perturbations and various material
properties (e.g., viscosity, miscibility, surface tensor). Evolution of the
most important characteristic quantities, i.e., the diameter of dominant bubble
$D$ and the height of bubble zone $h$, is derived: (i) the $D$ expands
self-similarly with steady aspect ratio $\beta \equiv D/h \thickapprox (1{\rm{
+ }}A)/4$, depending only on dimensionless density ratio $A$, and (ii) the $h$
grows quadratically with constant growth coefficient $\alpha \equiv h/(Ag{t^2})
\thickapprox [2\phi/{\ln}(2{\eta _{\rm{0}}})]^2$, depending on both
dimensionless initial perturbation amplitude ${\eta _{\rm{0}}}$ and
material-property-associated linear growth rate ratio
$\phi\equiv\Gamma_{actual}/\Gamma_{ideal}\leqslant1$. The theory successfully
explains the continued puzzle about the widely varying $\alpha\in (0.02,0.12)$
in experiments and simulations, conducted at all value of $A \in (0,1)$ and
widely varying value of ${\eta _{\rm{0}}} \in [{10^{ - 7}},{10^{ - 2}}]$ with
different materials. The good agreement between theory and experiments implies
that majority of actual mixing depends on initial perturbations and material
properties, to which more attention should be paid in either natural or
engineering problems.

for long periods of time. Hence, they can significantly change the global disk
evolution and particularly the distribution of the solid particles embedded in
the gas, possibly explaining asymmetries and dust concentrations recently
observed at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We investigate the
spatial distribution of dust grains using a simple model of protoplanetary disk
hosted by a giant gaseous vortex. We explore the dependence of the results on
grain size and deduce possible consequences and predictions for observations of
the dust thermal emission at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths. Global
2D simulations with a bi-fluid code are used to follow the evolution of a
single population of solid particles aerodynamically coupled to the gas.
Possible observational signatures of the dust thermal emission are obtained
using simulators of ALMA and ngVLA observations. We find that a giant vortex
not only captures dust grains with Stokes number St < 1 but can also affect the
distribution of larger grains (with St '~' 1) carving a gap associated to a
ring composed of incompletely trapped particles. The results are presented for
different particle size and associated to their possible signatures in disk
observations. Gap clearing in the dust spatial distribution could be due to the
interaction with a giant gaseous vortex and their associated spiral waves,
without the gravitational assistance of a planet. Hence, strong dust
concentrations at short sub-mm wavelengths associated with a gap and an
irregular ring at longer mm and cm wavelengths could indicate the presence of
an unseen gaseous vortex.

sufficient for detecting NMR signals from nano- to micron-scale samples with a
spectral resolution that is limited only by the nuclear spin coherence, i.e.
comparable to conventional NMR. Our protocol detects the nuclear polarization
induced along the direction of an external magnetic field with near surface NV
centers using lock-in detection techniques to enable phase coherent signal
averaging. Using NV centers in a dual role of NMR detector and optical
hyperpolarization source to increase signal to noise, and in combination with
Bayesian interference models for signal processing, nano/microscale NMR
spectroscopy can be performed on sub-millimolar sample concentrations, several
orders of magnitude better than the current state of the art.

that the tearing instability changes the effective alignment of the magnetic
field lines in such a way as to balance the eddy turnover rate at all scales
smaller than $\lambda_c$. As a result, turbulent fluctuations become
progressively less anisotropic at smaller scales, with the alignment angle
increasing as $\theta \sim (\lambda/\lambda_*)^{-4/5+\beta}$, where
$\lambda_*\sim L_0 S_0^{-3/4}$ is the resistive dissipation scale. Here $L_0$
is the outer scale of the turbulence, $S_0$ is the corresponding Lundquist
number, and {$0\leq \beta <4/5$} is a parameter. The resulting Fourier energy
spectrum is $E(k_\perp)\propto k_\perp^{-11/5+2\beta/3}$, where $k_\perp$ is
the wavenumber normal to the local mean magnetic field, and the critical scale
is $\lambda_c\sim S_L^{-(4-5\beta)/(7-{20\beta/3})}$. The simplest model
corresponds to $\beta=0$, in which case the predicted scaling formally agrees
with one of the solutions obtained in (Mallet et al 2017) from a discrete
hierarchical model of abruptly collapsing current sheets, an approach different
and complementary to ours. We also show that the reconnection-mediated interval
is non-universal with respect to the dissipation mechanism. Hyper-resistivity
of the form ${\tilde \eta}k^{2+2s}$ leads (in the simplest case of $\beta=0$)
to the different transition scale $\lambda_c\sim L_0{\tilde S}_0^{-4/(7+9s)}$

this new semantically informed approach adds robustness to significant local
changes within the environment, such as transitioning between indoor and

the capabilities of current condition-invariant techniques that are robust to
globally consistent change (such as day to night cycles). We perform

reduce the computation complexity, storage size and memory usage. In QNNs,
parameters and activations are uniformly quantized, such that the
multiplications and additions can be accelerated by bitwise operations.
However, distributions of parameters in Neural Networks are often imbalanced,
such that the uniform quantization determined from extremal values may under
utilize available bitwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method that can ensure the balance of distributions of quantized values. Our
method first recursively partitions the parameters by percentiles into balanced
bins, and then applies uniform quantization. We also introduce computationally
cheaper approximations of percentiles to reduce the computation overhead
introduced. Overall, our method improves the prediction accuracies of QNNs
without introducing extra computation during inference, has negligible impact
on training speed, and is applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks and
Recurrent Neural Networks. Experiments on standard datasets including ImageNet

as those implemented by internet companies. To maximize the value provided to
auction participants, spending is smoothed across auctions so budgets are used
for the best opportunities. Motivated by a mechanism used in practice by
several companies, this paper considers a smoothing procedure that relies on
{\em pacing multipliers}: on behalf of each buyer, the auction market applies a
factor between 0 and 1 that uniformly scales the bids across all auctions.
Reinterpreting this process as a game between buyers, we introduce the notion
of {\em pacing equilibrium}, and prove that they are always guaranteed to
exist. We demonstrate through examples that a market can have multiple pacing
equilibria with large variations in several natural objectives. We show that
pacing equilibria refine another popular solution concept, competitive
equilibria, and show further connections between the two solution concepts.
Although we show that computing either a social-welfare-maximizing or a
revenue-maximizing pacing equilibrium is NP-hard, we present a mixed-integer
program (MIP) that can be used to find equilibria optimizing several relevant
objectives. We use the MIP to provide evidence that: (1) equilibrium
multiplicity occurs very rarely across several families of random instances,
(2) static MIP solutions can be used to improve the outcomes achieved by a
dynamic pacing algorithm with instances based on a real-world auction market,
and (3) for the instances we study, buyers do not have an incentive to
misreport bids or budgets provided there are enough participants in the
auction.

suggested by Kusano et al. (2012). We also investigated the structure of the
footpoints of reconnected field lines. By comparing the distribution of
reconstructed field lines and the observed flare ribbons, the trigger structure
of the flare can be inferred. Our simulation suggests that the data-constrained
simulation taking into account both the large-scale magnetic structure and the
small-scale magnetic disturbance such as emerging fluxes is a good way to find
out a flare productive active region for space weather prediction.

automatic pain detection systems can reduce pain score acquisition efforts in
large-scale studies by estimating it directly from the participants' facial
expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach for
VAS estimation: first, our algorithm employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
to automatically estimate Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity (PSPI) levels
from face images. The estimated scores are then fed into the personalized
Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs), used to estimate the VAS, provided by
each person. Personalization of the model is performed using a newly introduced
facial expressiveness score, unique for each person. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to automatically estimate VAS from face

non-personalized approach on a benchmark dataset for pain analysis from face
images.

Spectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations, here we study the
evolution of two oscillating light walls each within its own active region
(AR). The emission of each light wall decays greatly after the appearance of
adjacent brightenings. For the first light wall, rooted within AR 12565, the
average height, amplitude, and oscillation period significantly decrease from
3.5 Mm, 1.7 Mm, and 8.5 min to 1.6 Mm, 0.4 Mm, and 3.0 min, respectively. For
the second light wall, rooted within AR 12597, the mean height, amplitude, and

second light wall becomes even invisible after the influence of nearby
brightening. These results reveal that the light walls are suppressed by nearby
brightenings. Considering the complex magnetic topology in light bridges, we
conjecture that the fading of light walls may be caused by a drop in the
magnetic pressure, where flux is cancelled by magnetic reconnection at the site
of the nearby brightening. Another hypothesis is that the wall fading is due to
the suppression of driver source (p-mode oscillation), resulting from the
nearby avalanche of downward particles along reconnected brightening loops.

model of T6/Z3 orientifold compactification with fractional D3-branes and
anti-D3-branes at orbifold fixed points. The resulting attractive forces
between anti-D3-branes and D3-branes, together with the repulsive forces
between anti-D3-branes and O3-planes, can affect the stability of the compact
space. There are no complex structure moduli in T6/Z3 orientifold, which should
thus capture some generic features of more general settings where all complex
structure moduli are stabilized by three-form fluxes. The simultaneous presence
of branes and anti-branes brings along the breaking of supersymmetry. Non-BPS
combinations of this type are typical of ""brane supersymmetry breaking"", and
are a necessary ingredient in the KKLT scenario for stabilizing the remaining
Kahler moduli. The conclusion of our analysis is that, while mutual D-brane
interactions sometimes help Kahler moduli stabilization, this is not always the

minimizing a regression loss. These modifications make the model highly

identified at its center. As a part of the FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane
Imaging survey using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN) project, we obtained
the CO J=1-0 dataset for a large area of Sh2-48 at a spatial resolution of
21""(~0.4 pc), which we used to find a molecular cloud with a total molecular
mass of ~3.8x10^4 Mo associated with Sh2-48. The molecular cloud has a
systematic velocity shift within a velocity range ~42-47 km/s . On the lower
velocity side the CO emission spatially corresponds with the bright 8 {\mu}m
filament at the western rim of Sh2-48, while the CO emission at higher
velocities is separated at the eastern and western sides of the 8{\mu}m
filament. This velocity change forms V-shaped, east-west-oriented feature on
the position-velocity diagram. We found that these lower and higher-velocity
components are, unlike the infrared and radio continuum data, physically
associated with Sh2-48. To interpret the observed V-shaped velocity
distribution, we assessed a cloud-cloud collision scenario and found from a
comparison between the observations and simulations that the velocity
distribution is an expected outcome of a collision between a cylindrical cloud
and a spherical cloud, with the cylindrical cloud corresponding to the
lower-velocity component, and the two separated components in the
higher-velocity part interpretable as the collision-broken remnants of the
spherical cloud. Based on the consistency of the ~1.3Myr estimated formation
timescale of the HII region with that of the collision, we concluded that the
high-mass star formation in Sh2-48 was triggered by the collision.

dynamics simulations. We find that the polymer center of mass exhibits a
superdiffusive motion at short to intermediate times and the motion turns
normal at long times, but with a greatly enhanced diffusivity. Interestingly,
the long time diffusivity shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the
chain length and stiffness. We analyze how the polymer conformation and the
accumulation of the self-propelled particles, and therefore the directed motion
of the polymer, are correlated. At the point of maximal polymer diffusivity,
the polymer has preferentially bent conformations maintained by the balance
between the chain elasticity and the propelling force generated by the active
particles. We also consider the barrier crossing dynamics of actively-driven
polymers in a double-well potential. The barrier crossing times are
demonstrated to have a peculiar non-monotonic dependence, related to that of
the diffusivity. This effect can be potentially utilized for sorting of
polymers from solutions in \textit{in vitro} experiments.

society arises as a complex system and, at the same time, are the starting
point of any physical description of it. In the last few years, much
theoretical research has addressed this issue by combining the physics of
complex networks with a description of interactions in terms of evolutionary
game theory. We here take this research a step further by introducing a most
salient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic
that is key to understand much of the social phenomenology these days. We
consider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact
strategically with their neighbors but their preferences and payoffs for the
possible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves
under evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely
coordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence
of the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response
dynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional
imitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted
equilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete Information, and we
demonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function
parameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with available
experimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees
better with the experiment that standard economic theories, and draw hints as
to how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.

a non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function theory to compute the generating
function for FCS of energy transport. Specifically, we express the generating
function using the path integral along Keldysh contour and obtain exact
solution of the generating function using the Grassmann algebra. With this
formalism, we calculate the transient energy current and higher order cumulants
for both single and double quantum dot (QD) systems in the transient regime. To
examine finite bandwidth effect of leads to FCS of energy transport, we have
used an exact solvable model with a Lorentizian linewidth where all
non-equilibrium Green's functions can be solved exactly in the time domain. It
is found that the transient energy current exhibits damped oscillatory
behavior. For the single quantum dot system the frequency of oscillation is
independent of bandwidth of the leads while the decay rate of the oscillation
amplitude is determined by the lifetime of resonant state which increases as
the bandwidth decreases. At short times, a universal scaling of maximum
amplitude of normalized cumulants is identified for the single QD system. For
the double QD system, the damped oscillation of energy current is dominated by
Rabi oscillation with frequency approximately proportional to the coupling
constant between two quantum dots. In general, the transient energy current
increases when the coupling between two QDs is stronger. However, when the
interdot coupling is larger than half of the external bias the transient energy
current is suppressed significantly. All these results can be understood

clusters. A useful concept introduced for Gaussian mixtures by Malsiner Walli
et al (2016) are sparse finite mixtures, where the prior distribution on the
weight distribution of a mixture with $K$ components is chosen in such a way
that a priori the number of clusters in the data is random and is allowed to be
smaller than $K$ with high probability. The number of cluster is then inferred
a posteriori from the data.
  The present paper makes the following contributions in the context of sparse
finite mixture modelling. First, it is illustrated that the concept of sparse
finite mixture is very generic and easily extended to cluster various types of
non-Gaussian data, in particular discrete data and continuous multivariate data
arising from non-Gaussian clusters. Second, sparse finite mixtures are compared
to Dirichlet process mixtures with respect to their ability to identify the
number of clusters. For both model classes, a random hyper prior is considered
for the parameters determining the weight distribution. By suitable matching of
these priors, it is shown that the choice of this hyper prior is far more
influential on the cluster solution than whether a sparse finite mixture or a
Dirichlet process mixture is taken into consideration.

only one third of all reviews to be good, yet one third as useless or
misleading; they propose double-blind or zero-blind reviewing regimes for
improvement; they would like to see showable proofs of (good) reviewing work be
introduced; attitude change trends are weak.
  Conclusion: The perception of the current state of software engineering peer
review is fairly negative. Also, we found hardly any trend that suggests
reviewing will improve by itself over time; the community will have to make
explicit efforts. Fortunately, our (mostly senior) respondents appear more open
for trying different peer reviewing regimes than we had expected.

statistics for non-overlapping windows of size same as periodic pattern size
and a representative periodic pattern is extracted from the image and used for
texture synthesis, while preserving the global regularity and visual

absorption column density among all known X-ray binary systems in our galaxy.
In order to investigate the reason behind such a large absorption column, we
looked at the variations in the X-ray intensity and spectral parameters as a
function of the tentatively discovered $\sim$ 80 day orbit of this source. The
orbital period is firmly confirmed in the long term ($\sim$ 12 year) Swift BAT
lightcurve. Two peaks about half an orbit apart, one narrow and small, and the
other broad and large are seen in the orbital intensity profile. We find that
while most orbits show enhanced emissions at these two peaks, the larger peak
in the folded longterm lightcurve is more a result of randomly occurring large
flares spread over $\sim$ 0.2 orbital phase. As opposed to this, the smaller
peak is seen in every orbit as a regular increase in intensity. Using archival
data spread over different phases of the orbit and the geometry of the system
as known from previously published infrared observations, we present a possible
scenario which explains the orbital intensity profile, bursting characteristics
and large column density of this X-ray binary.

the researches changed the way users' personal timeline was compiled to test
the influence on the users' moods and feelings. The reactions to these

up, mainly the study's lack of informed consent procedures, as well as a more
general critique of the flaws in the experimental design.
  In this chapter, we describe additional use cases: The so-called living labs
that focus on experimentation with information systems such as search engines
and wikis and especially on their real-world usage. The living labs paradigm
allows researchers to conduct research in real-world environments or systems.
In the field of information science and especially information retrieval -
which is the scientific discipline that is concerned with the research of
search engines, information systems, and search related algorithms and
techniques - it is still common practice to perform in vitro or offline
evaluations using static test collections. Living labs are widely unknown or
unavailable to academic researchers in these fields. A main benefit of living
labs is their potential to offer new ways and possibilities to experiment with
information systems and especially their users, but on the other hand they
introduce a whole set of ethical issues that we would like to address in this

responsibility or supervision of human users. Workflow management systems and
workflow-driven applications need to enforce security policies in the form of
access control, specifying which users can execute which tasks, and
authorization constraints, such as Separation of Duty, further restricting the
execution of tasks at run-time. Enforcing these policies is crucial to avoid
frauds and malicious use, but it may lead to situations where a workflow
instance cannot be completed without the violation of the policy. The Workflow
Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an assignment of users
to tasks in a workflow such that every task is executed and the policy is not
violated. The WSP is inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a
practical application in reconciling business compliance and business
continuity. Solutions to related problems, such as workflow resiliency (i.e.,
whether a workflow instance is still satisfiable even in the absence of users),
are important to help in policy design. Several variations of the WSP and
similar problems have been defined in the literature and there are many
solution methods available. In this paper, we survey the work done on these

As the non-adiabatic regime is approached, the waiting time distribution
becomes dominated by cycle-missing events in which the turnstile fails to emit

ring inside the merged droplet. By tracking the evolution of the main vortex
ring together with its circulation, we identified two mechanisms that are
essential to the internal-jet formation: the vortex-ring growth and the
vortex-ring detachment. Recognizing that the manifestation of the
vortex-ring-induced jet physically relies on the competition between the
convection and viscous dissipation of the vortex ring, we further developed and
substantiated a vortex-ring-based Reynolds number criterion to interpret the
occurrence of the internal jet at various Ohnesorge numbers and size ratios.
For the merged droplet with apparent jet formation, the average mixing rate
after jet formation increases monotonically with the vortex-ring Reynolds
number, which therefore serves as an approximate measure of the jet strength.
In this respect, stronger internal jet is responsible for enhanced mixing of

the dynamical response to arbitrary interactions open to interpretation. Here,
we demonstrate that even for the case of a strongly driven, time-dependent

single spectrum if a sufficiently short signal is used to trigger the
absorption process. This finding is directly applied to a time-domain
observation of Rabi cycling between doubly-excited atomic states in the
few-femtosecond regime. This general approach unlocks single-shot
real-time-resolved signal reconstruction across time scales down to attoseconds
for non-equilibrium states of matter. In contrast to available pump-probe
schemes, there is no need for scanning time delays in order to access real-time
information. The scientific applications of this technique range from testing
fundamental quantum dynamics, to measuring and controlling ultrafast, chemical
and biological reaction processes.

of clouds in evaporating exoplanets like CoRoT-7b and 55 Cnc e in comparison to
a generic set of solar abundances and the metal-rich gas giant HD149026b. We
assess the impact of metal-rich, non-solar element abundances on the gas-phase

study cloud structures and their details. We provide an overview of global
cloud properties in terms of material compositions, maximum particle formation
rates, and average cloud particle sizes for various sets of rocky element

temperatures on some hot-rocky super-Earths (e.g. the day-side of Corot-7b)
result in an ionised atmospheric gas and they prevent gas condensation, making
cloud formation unlikely on its day-side.

dominant distributed framework to build large-scale iterative graph processing
systems. While its implementations(e.g., Pregel, Giraph, and Hama) achieve high
scalability, frequent synchronization and communication among the workers can
cause substantial parallel inefficiency. To help address this critical concern,
this paper introduces the GraphHP(Graph Hybrid Processing) platform which
inherits the friendly vertex-centric BSP programming interface and optimizes
its synchronization and communication overhead.
  To achieve the goal, we first propose a hybrid execution model which
differentiates between the computations within a graph partition and across the
partitions, and decouples the computations within a partition from distributed
synchronization and communication. By implementing the computations within a
partition by pseudo-superstep iteration in memory, the hybrid execution model
can effectively reduce synchronization and communication overhead while not
requiring heavy scheduling overhead or graph-centric sequential algorithms. We
then demonstrate how the hybrid execution model can be easily implemented
within the BSP abstraction to preserve its simple programming interface.
Finally, we evaluate our implementation of the GraphHP platform on classical
BSP applications and show that it performs significantly better than the
state-of-the-art BSP implementations. Our GraphHP implementation is based on
Hama, but can easily generalize to other BSP platforms.

truncated the AGB before s-process enrichment could occur. However there are

the progenitor is a low-mass single star that did not undergo third dredge-up;

cosmology lead to models with non-rigidly evolving average spatial curvature,
and different parametrizations of apparent cosmic acceleration. The timescape
cosmology is a viable example of such a model without dark energy. Using the
largest available supernova data set, the JLA catalogue, we find that the
timescape model fits the luminosity distance-redshift data with a likelihood
that is statistically indistinguishable from the standard spatially flat
$\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology by Bayesian comparison. In the timescape
case cosmic acceleration is non-zero but has a marginal amplitude, with
best-fitting apparent deceleration parameter, $q_0=-0.043^{+0.004}_{-0.000}$.
Systematic issues regarding standardization of supernova light curves are
analysed. Cuts of data at the statistical homogeneity scale affect light curve
parameter fits independent of cosmology. A cosmological model dependence of
empirical changes to the mean colour parameter is also found. Irrespective of
which model ultimately fits better, we argue that as a competitive model with a
non-FLRW expansion history, the timescape model may prove a useful diagnostic
tool for disentangling selection effects and astrophysical systematics from the

by resampling data blocks. A fundamental problem is establishing its
consistency for the distribution of a sample mean, as a prototypical statistic.
We use a structural relationship with subsampling to characterize the bootstrap
in a new and general manner. While subsampling and block bootstrap differ, the
block bootstrap distribution of a sample mean equals that of a $k$-fold
self-convolution of a subsampling distribution. Motivated by this, we provide
simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a convolved subsampling
estimator to produce a normal limit that matches the target of bootstrap
estimation. These conditions may be linked to consistency properties of an
original subsampling distribution, which are often obtainable under minimal
assumptions. Through several examples, the results are shown to validate the
block bootstrap for means under significantly weakened assumptions in many
existing (and some new) dependence settings, which also addresses a standing
conjecture of Politis, Romano and Wolf(1999). Beyond sample means, the
convolved subsampling estimator may not match the block bootstrap, but instead
provides a hybrid-resampling estimator of interest in its own right. For
general statistics with normal limits, results also establish the consistency

system combination in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In order to select
the most appropriate words to insert at each position in the output
transcriptions, some ROVER extensions rely on critical information such as
confidence scores and other ASR decoder features. This information, which is
not always available, highly depends on the decoding process and sometimes
tends to over estimate the real quality of the recognized words. In this paper
we propose a novel variant of ROVER that takes advantage of ASR quality
estimation (QE) for ranking the transcriptions at ""segment level"" instead of:
i) relying on confidence scores, or ii) feeding ROVER with randomly ordered
hypotheses. We first introduce an effective set of features to compensate for
the absence of ASR decoder information. Then, we apply QE techniques to perform
accurate hypothesis ranking at segment-level before starting the fusion
process. The evaluation is carried out on two different tasks, in which we
respectively combine hypotheses coming from independent ASR systems and
multi-microphone recordings. In both tasks, it is assumed that the ASR decoder
information is not available. The proposed approach significantly outperforms
standard ROVER and it is competitive with two strong oracles that e xploit
prior knowledge about the real quality of the hypotheses to be combined.
Compared to standard ROVER, the abs olute WER improvements in the two
evaluation scenarios range from 0.5% to 7.3%.

that spin torque exerted on the free magnet is not caused due to the spin

investigate the shear viscosity of homogeneous, population-imbalanced Fermi
gases with tunable attractive interactions at finite temperatures by using a
pairing fluctuation theory for thermodynamical quantities and a gauge-invariant
linear response theory for transport coefficients. In the unitary and BEC
regimes, the shear viscosity increases with the polarization because the excess
majority fermions cause gapless excitations acting like a normal fluid. In the
weak BEC regime the excess fermions also suppress the noncondensed pairs at low
polarization, and we found a minimum in the ratio of shear viscosity and
relaxation time. To help constrain the relaxation time from linear response
theory, we derive an exact relation connecting some thermodynamic quantities

superfluids with population imbalance. An approximate relation beyond

contracted to a point along a degeneration of $C$ to a nodal curve in $\vert

the two simplest types of obstruction. Geometrically, these obstructions
manifest on $C$ respectively as an hyperelliptic involution and as a Spin

  Propagation",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes an expectation propagation (EP) method for multi-class
classification with Gaussian processes that scales well to very large datasets.
In such a method the estimate of the log-marginal-likelihood involves a sum
across the data instances. This enables efficient training using stochastic
gradients and mini-batches. When this type of training is used, the
computational cost does not depend on the number of data instances $N$.
Furthermore, extra assumptions in the approximate inference process make the
memory cost independent of $N$. The consequence is that the proposed EP method
can be used on datasets with millions of instances. We compare empirically this
method with alternative approaches that approximate the required computations
using variational inference. The results show that it performs similar or even
better than these techniques, which sometimes give significantly worse
predictive distributions in terms of the test log-likelihood. Besides this, the
training process of the proposed approach also seems to converge in a smaller
number of iterations.

hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and we demonstrate that this medium is a
promising alternative to plasmonic and all-dielectric materials for realizing
efficient subwavelength scatterers and metasurfaces based on them. We
theoretically show that particles out of hyperbolic medium possess different
resonances enabled by the support of high-k waves and their reflection from the
particle boundaries. Among those resonances, there are electric quadrupole
excitations, which cause magnetic resonance of the particle similar to what
occurs in high-refractive-index particles. Excitations of the particle
resonances are accompanied by the drop in the reflection from nanoparticle
array to near-zero value, which can be ascribed to resonant Kerker effect. If
particles are arranged in the spacer array with period d, narrow lattice
resonances are possible at wavelength d, d/2, d/3 etc. This provides an
additional degree of control and possibility to excite resonances at the
wavelength defined by the array spacing. For the hBN particle with hyperbolic
dispersion, we show that the full range of the resonances, including magnetic
resonance and a decrease of reflection, is possible.

observe that when thickness of Cr layer is critically low (<6nm) spin orbit

like torque is opposite to the Oersted field generated torque. To verify
interracial nature of this torque, 2 nm thin Cu is inserted between Cr and Ni
and field like torque behaves same as Oersted field induced torque. Hence
possible origin of such unconventional sign change of field like torque could
be inter-facial Rashba like spin orbit interaction which is present between Cr

estimate that approximately 35 Oe of effective Rashba like magnetic field is
created on 8 nm thicker Ni layer, when 1E12 A/m^2 current flows through Cr

expected to behave like paramagnet (Neel temperature of bulk Cr is 311K). Hence

$p$-like subbands and slightly varies with temperature. The change of the
direction of the linearly polarized light wave incident on the chains from
perpendicular to parallel leads to a sharp narrowing of the absorption band. It
is obtained that the absorption bandwidth increases with the reduction of the
quantum dot radius. We also analyzed the dependence of the absorption
coefficient of GaAs/Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As superlattice on concentration of
aluminium in the matrix.

at least $s+t+1$ can be partitioned into two parts which induce two subgraphs

conjecture of Thomassen. In this paper, we prove that for $s,t\geq 2$, if a
graph $G$ contains no cycle of length four and has minimum degree at least
$s+t-1$, then $G$ can be partitioned into two parts which induce two subgraphs

result of Diwan, who proved the same statement for graphs of girth at least
five. Our proof also works for the case of variable functions, in which the

that any graph containing no cycle of length four with minimum degree at least

changes in the nervous system (learning), slower morphological and neurological
change over the lifetime of the organism (postnatal development), and change
over many generations (evolution). Much work has focused on instantiating
learning or evolution in robots, but relatively little on development. Although
many theories have been forwarded as to how development can aid evolution, it
is difficult to isolate each such proposed mechanism. Thus, here we introduce a
minimal yet embodied model of development: the body of the robot changes over
its lifetime, yet growth is not influenced by the environment. We show that
even this simple developmental model confers evolvability because it allows
evolution to sweep over a larger range of body plans than an equivalent
non-developmental system, and subsequent heterochronic mutations 'lock in' this
body plan in more morphologically-static descendants. Future work will involve
gradually complexifying the developmental model to determine when and how such
added complexity increases evolvability.

observed experimentally. The phenomenon provides the possibility for
manipulation of particles which are immersed in the fluid. The analysis shows
that the amplitude of the established eddy currents produced by stationary
surface waves does not depend on the fluid viscosity in the free surface case.
The currents become parametrically larger being inversely proportional to the
square root of the fluid viscosity in the case when the fluid surface is
covered by an almost incompressible thin liquid (i.e. shear elasticity is zero)
film formed by an insoluble agent with negligible internal viscous losses as
compared to the dissipation in the fluid bulk. Here we extend the theory for a
thin insoluble film with zero shear elasticity and small shear and dilational
viscosities on the case of an arbitrary elastic compression modulus. We find
both contributions into the Lagrangian motion of passive tracers, which are the
advection by the Eulerian vertical vorticity and the Stokes drift. Whereas the
Stokes drift contribution preserves its value for the free surface case outside
a thin viscous sublayer, the Eulerian vertical vorticity strongly depends on
the fluid viscosity at high values of the film compression modulus. The Stokes
drift acquires a strong dependence on the fluid viscosity inside the viscous
sublayer, however, the change is compensated by an opposite change in the
Eulerian vertical vorticity. As a result, the vertical dependence of the
intensity of eddy currents is given by a sum of two decaying exponents with
both decrements being of the order of the wave number. The decrements are
numerically different, so the Eulerian contribution becomes dominant at some
depth for the surface film with any compression modulus.

experimentally coherent control of flexural vibrations simultaneously along the

between the components of a two-frequency pump signal,the beat frequency being
chosen to match a flexural resonance. Furthermore, sequential switching of the
relative phase at time intervals shorter than the lifetime of the vibrations
reduces their amplitude to a constant value that is fully adjustable by tuning
the phase-modulation depth and switching rate. The results may trigger new
developments in silicon photonics, since such coherent control uniquely
decouples the amplitude of optomechanical oscillations from power-dependent
thermal effects and nonlinear optical loss.

galaxy clusters can be used as an independent cosmological tool to probe the
expansion history of the Universe. Its use, however, depends upon a crucial
quantity, i.e., the depletion factor $\gamma$, which corresponds to the ratio
by which $f_{gas}$ is depleted with respect to the universal baryonic mean.
This quantity is not directly observed and hydrodynamical simulations performed
in a specific cosmological model (e.g., a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology) have
been used to calibrate it. In this work, we obtain for the first time
self-consistent observational constraints on the gas depletion factor combining
40 X-ray emitting gas mass fraction measurements and luminosity distance
measurements from type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Processes to reconstruct a
possible redshift evolution of $\gamma$, we find no evidence for such
evolution, which confirms the current results from hydrodynamical simulations.
Moreover, our constraints on $\gamma$ can be seen as a data prior for
cosmological analyses on different cosmological models. The current
measurements are systematic limited, so future improvements will depend heavily
on a better mass calibration of galaxy clusters and their measured density
profiles.

states are generated passively from small entangled resource states using
so-called fusion operations. Results from percolation theory have previously
been used to argue that universal cluster states can be generated in the
ballistic approach using schemes which exceed the critical threshold for
percolation, but these results consider cluster states with unbounded size.
Here we consider how successful percolation can be maintained using a physical

continuously generated and measured, and therefore that only a finite portion
of it is visible at any one point in time. We show that universal LOQC can be

Specifically, as long as the signal to be predicted is band-limited with a
known cutoff frequency, the filter order, the only parameter of the filter,
follows and the filter predicts the signal in real time up to a prediction
horizon that depends on the cutoff frequency, too. It is worked out in detail
how signal prediction arises from the negative group delay of the filter. Its

ventricular diastolic volume index, 2918 studies). We computed automated
ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts),
which agreed with commercial software-derived values [for ejection fraction,
MAD=5.3%, N=3101 studies; for strain, MAD=1.5% (n=197) and 1.6% (n=110)], and
demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of breast cancer patients for
trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found that, compared to manual
measurements, automated measurements had superior performance across seven
internal consistency metrics with an average increase in the Spearman
correlation coefficient of 0.05 (p=0.02). Finally, we developed disease
detection algorithms for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis,
with C-statistics of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively. Our pipeline lays the

the production of electron-positron pairs and gamma-photons via quantum
electrodynamics processes in the relativistic transparent and opaque regimes,
and find that the target transparency can significantly enhance the
electron-positron pair production due to the formation of stable standing wave
(SW). An optimum foil density of 200 - 280 n_c (n_c is the laser critical
density) is found for enhancing electron-positron pair production when laser
intensity reaches a few 10e23 W/cm2. At such foil density, laser energy
conversion to electron-positron pairs is approximately four times higher than
at foil density of 710n_c, whereas laser energy conversion to gamma-photons
keeps almost the same. Consequently, high dense electron-positron plasma with a
maximum intensity above 10e20 W/cm2 is produced. Modulation dynamics of created
pair plasmas is further observed when target foil becomes transparent. It is
shown that stable SWs formed directly by two counter-propagating lasers, not
only trap the created electron-positron pairs to their nodes, but also modulate
periodically average energy and phase-space and angular distributions of
trapped particles. However, similar trapping and modulation effects become
obscure in the opaque regime due to the absence of stable SW field.

and wall thickness, but advanced cardiac image analysis presents an opportunity
for high-throughput mapping of genotype-phenotype associations in three
dimensions (3D). RESULTS: High-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance images
were automatically segmented in 1,124 healthy volunteers to create a 3D shape
model of the heart. Mass univariate regression was used to plot a 3D
effect-size map for the association between wall thickness and a set of
predictors at each vertex in the mesh. The vertices where a significant effect
exists were determined by applying threshold-free cluster enhancement to boost
areas of signal with spatial contiguity. Experiments on simulated phenotypic
signals and SNP replication show that this approach offers a substantial gain
in statistical power for cardiac genotype-phenotype associations while
providing good control of the false discovery rate. This framework models the
effects of genetic variation throughout the heart and can be automatically
applied to large population cohorts. AVAILABILITY: The proposed approach has

However, to analyze successfully complex cell movies, imaging multiple
interacting bacterial clones as they grow and merge to generate overcrowded
bacterial communities with thousands of cells in the field of view,
segmentation results should be near perfect to warrant good tracking results.
We introduce here a fully automated closed-loop bio-inspired computational
strategy that exploits prior knowledge about the expected structure of a
colony's lineage tree to locate and correct segmentation errors in analyzed
movie frames. We show that this correction strategy is effective, resulting in
improved cell tracking and consequently trustworthy deep colony lineage trees.
Our image analysis approach has the unique capability to keep tracking cells
even after clonal subpopulations merge in the movie. This enables the
reconstruction of the complete Forest of Lineage Trees (FLT) representation of
evolving multi-clonal bacterial communities. Moreover, the percentage of valid
cell trajectories extracted from the image analysis almost doubles after
segmentation correction. This plethora of trustworthy data extracted from a
complex cell movie analysis enables single-cell analytics as a tool for
addressing compelling questions for human health, such as understanding the
role of single-cell stochasticity in antibiotics resistance without losing site

We examine the case of a single bent dark soliton comparing the mean-field

Hartree method for Bosons. Dynamical snaking of this bent structure is
observed, signaling the onset of fragmentation which becomes significant during
the vortex nucleation. In contrast to the mean-field approximation ""filling"" of
the vortex core is observed, leading in turn to the formation of filled-core
vortices, instead of the mean-field vortex-antivortex pairs. The resulting
smearing effect in the density is a rather generic feature, occurring when
solitonic structures are exposed to quantum fluctuations. Here, we show that
this filling owes its existence to the dynamical building of an antidark
structure developed in the next-to-leading order orbital. We further
demonstrate that the aforementioned beyond mean-field dynamics can be
experimentally detected using the variance of single shot measurements.
Additionally, a variety of excitations including vortices, oblique dark
solitons, and open ring dark soliton-like structures building upon higher-lying
orbitals is observed. We demonstrate that signatures of the higher-lying
orbital excitations emerge in the total density, and can be clearly captured by
inspecting the one-body coherence. In the latter context, the localization of
one-body correlations exposes the existence of the multi-orbital

We present scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)

along the STO crystal axes and only change their configuration upon thermal

be measured with the use of high-precision atomic clocks is proposed and
substantiated. The consideration is made with the use of a quasi-classical
description of the gravitational shift that lies in the frame of nonmetric
theories of gravity. It is assumed that the cosmological potential is formed by
all matter of the Universe (including dark matter and dark energy) and that it
is spatially uniform on planet scales. It is obvious that the cosmological
potential, $\Phi_\text{CP}$, is several orders of magnitude greater than
Earth's gravitational potential $\varphi_\text{E}$ (where
$|\varphi_\text{E}/c^2|\sim 10^{-9}$ on Earth's surface). In our method, the
tick rates of identical atomic clocks are compared at two points with different
gravitational potentials, i.e. at different heights. In this case, the
information on $\Phi_\text{CP}$ is contained in the cosmological correction
$\alpha\neq 0$ in the relationship $\Delta\omega/\omega=(1+\alpha)\Delta
\varphi/c^2$ between the relative change of the frequencies $\Delta
\omega/\omega$ (in atomic clocks) and the difference of the gravitational
potential $\Delta \varphi$ at the measurement points. We have estimated the low
limit of cosmological correction, $\alpha >10^{-6}$. It is shown that using a
modern atomic clock of the optical range it is possible to measure the value of
$\alpha$ in earth-based experiments if $|\alpha|>10^{-5}$. The obtained
results, in the case of their experimental confirmation, will open up new
unique opportunities for the study of the Universe and the testing of various
cosmological models. These results will also increase the measurement accuracy
in relativistic geodesy, chronometric gravimetry, global navigation systems,

learning, which firstly trains a feature learning model, and then constructs a

achieved significant performance gains on SV, mainly attributed to the smart
utilization of deep neural networks. However, the two approaches have not been
carefully compared, and their respective advantages have not been well
discussed. In this paper, we compare the end-to-end and feature learning

events, such as cough and laugh. These trivial events are ubiquitous in

valuable particularities to discover the genuine speaker from disguised speech.
However, trivial events are often short and idiocratic in spectral patterns,
making SRE extremely difficult. Fortunately, we found a very powerful deep
feature learning structure that can extract highly speaker-sensitive features.
By employing this tool, we studied the SRE performance on three types of
trivial events: cough, laugh and ""Wei"" (a short Chinese ""Hello""). The results
show that there is rich speaker information within these trivial events, even
for cough that is intuitively less speaker distinguishable. With the deep
feature approach, the EER can reach 10%-14% with the three trivial events,

inference. Recently, we proposed a deep learning model that can learn how to
extract the speaker factor by a deep neural network (DNN). By this feature
learning, an SV system can be constructed with a very simple back-end model. In
this paper, we investigate the robustness of the feature-based SV system in
situations with language mismatch. Our experiments were conducted on a complex

different functions at different income ranges, the Tsallis distribution has
recently been found capable of fitting the whole distribution by means of only
two parameters. This procedure showed clearly such oscillatory feature in the
entire income range feature, but made it particularly visible at the tail of
the distribution. Although log-periodic functions fitted to the data are
capable of describing this behavior, a different approach to naturally disclose
such oscillatory characteristics is to allow the Tsallis $q$-parameter to
become complex. In this paper we use this idea in order to describe the
behavior of the CCDF of the Brazilian personal income recently studied
empirically by Soares et al.\ (2016). Typical elements of periodic motion, such
as amplitude and angular frequency coupled to this income analysis, were
obtained by means of this approach. A highly non-linear function for the CCDF

ballistic to diffusive motion, decaying with a power law in time. Applying
linear response theory, we show that tree grids have a spectral gap leading to
exponential relaxation as protected by topology and independent on grid size.
Meshed grids are found to have a spectral gap which decreases with increasing
grid size, leading to slow power law relaxation and collective diffusive
propagation of disturbances. We conclude by discussing consequences if no
measures are undertaken to preserve the grid inertia in the energy transition.

through nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) in combination with density
functional theory (DFT). The electronic transport properties of NiFe$_2$O$_4$
nanowire are studied in terms of density of states, transmission spectrum and
$I{-}V$ characteristics. The density of states gets modified with the applied
bias voltage across NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device, the density of charge is
observed both in the valence band and in the conduction band on increasing the
bias voltage. The transmission spectrum of NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device gives
the insights on the transition of electrons at different energy intervals. The
findings of the present work suggest that NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device can be
used as negative differential resistance (NDR) device and its NDR property can
be tuned with the bias voltage, which may be used in microwave device, memory
devices and in fast switching devices.

are used to analyse the TS networks obtained in different dynamical regimes of
the logisitic map. It is seen that the simplicial characterisers are able to
distinguish between distinct dynamical regimes. We also apply the simplicial

constants, a first order isostructural phase transition between 29 and 30 GPa
is found for TiN. The absorption spectra exhibit high values ranging from the
far infrared region to the ultra-violet one. The anisotropy value of Young's
modulus of TiN is smaller than that of c-BN at 0 GPa and the anisotropy of TiN
clearly increases with an increase of pressure. The effects of pressure and
temperature on the bulk modulus, Gr\""uneisen parameter, Gibbs free energy, and
Debye temperature are significant. The Gr\""uneisen parameter of TiN is much
larger than that of c-BN. At temperatures below 1000 K, TiN's heat capacity is
much larger than that of c-BN.
