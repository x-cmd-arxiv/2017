of exoplanets. For both space and ground observations, wavefront control
performance is ultimately limited by the finite amount of starlight available
for sensing, so wavefront measurements must be as efficient as possible. To
meet this challenge, we propose to sense residual errors using bright
focal-plane speckles at wavelengths outside the high contrast spectral
bandwidth. We show that a linear relationship exists between the intensity of
the bright out-of-band speckles and residual wavefront aberrations. An
efficient linear control loop can exploit this relationship. The proposed
scheme, referred to as Spectral Linear Dark Field Control (spectral LDFC), is
more sensitive than conventional approaches for ultra-high contrast imaging.
Spectral LDFC is closely related to, and can be combined with, the recently
proposed spatial LDFC which uses light at the observation wavelength but
located outside of the high contrast area in the focal plane image. Both LDFC
techniques do not require starlight to be mixed with the high contrast speckle
field, so full-sensitivity uninterrupted high contrast observations can be
conducted simultaneously with wavefront correction iterations. We also show
that LDFC is robust against deformable mirror calibration errors and drifts, as
it relies on detector response stability instead of deformable mirror
stability. LDFC is particularly advantageous when science acquisition is
performed at a non-optimal wavefront sensing wavelength, such as nearIR
observations of planets around solar-type stars, for which visible-light
speckle sensing is ideal. We describe the approach at a fundamental level and
provide an algorithm for its implementation. We demonstrate, through numerical
simulation, that spectral LDFC is well-suited for picometer-level cophasing of
a large segmented space telescope.

Let",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.034502",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The combination of elliptical deformation of streamlines and vorticity can
lead to the destabilisation of any rotating flow via the elliptical
instability. Such a mechanism has been invoked as a possible source of
turbulence in planetary cores subject to tidal deformations. The saturation of
the elliptical instability has been shown to generate turbulence composed of
non-linearly interacting waves and strong columnar vortices with varying
respective amplitudes, depending on the control parameters and geometry. In
this paper, we present a suite of numerical simulations to investigate the
saturation and the transition from vortex-dominated to wave-dominated regimes.
This is achieved by simulating the growth and saturation of the elliptical
instability in an idealised triply periodic domain, adding a frictional damping
to the geostrophic component only, to mimic its interaction with boundaries. We
reproduce several experimental observations within one idealised local model
and complement them by reaching more extreme flow parameters. In particular, a
wave-dominated regime that exhibits many signatures of inertial wave turbulence
is characterised for the first time. This regime is expected in planetary
interiors.

The brightening was followed by a jet-like ejection below filament, which
triggered the eruption. Before the eruption of F2, the filament seems to be
trapped within the overlying arcade loops almost for $\sim$1.5~hr before its
successful eruption. Interestingly, we observed simultaneously contraction

a scarcely studied topic within the field of functional analysis in the last 20

holographic computation of entanglement entropy and mutual information in the
boundary theory and analyze their evolution with time. We show that
equilibration of the entanglement in the regions which contained one of the
initial excitations is generally similar to that in other holographic quench

propagates along a sharp effective light cone from the points of initial

the global quench models such as entanglement velocity and the light cone
velocity also have a meaning in the bilocal quench scenario. We also observe
the loss of memory about the initial state during the equilibration process. We
find that the memory loss reflects on the time behavior of the entanglement
similarly to the global quench case, and it is related to the universal linear
growth of entanglement, which comes from the interior of the forming black
hole. We also analyze general two-point correlation functions in the framework
of the geodesic approximation, focusing on the study of the late time behavior.

progressed. As a result, earlier work focused on topological singularities in
the orientation field which we find to play a negligible role at long times. We
use the standard map as a simple time-periodic two-dimensional (2D) flow that
produces Lagrangian chaos. This class of flows produce persistent patterns in
passive scalar advection, and we find that a different kind of persistent
pattern develops in the passive director orientation field. We identify the
mechanism by which emergent scar lines grow to dominate these patterns at long
times in complex flows. Emergent scar lines form where the recent stretching of
the fluid element is perpendicular to earlier stretching. Thus these scar lines
can be labeled by their age, defined as the time since their stretching reached
a maximum.

requires an understanding of previously uncharacterized sources of systematic
error in CCD sensors, many of which manifest themselves as static effective
variations in pixel area. Such variation renders a critical assumption behind
the traditional procedure of flat fielding--that a sensor's pixels comprise a
uniform grid--invalid. In this work, we present a method to infer a curl-free
model of a sensor's underlying pixel grid from flat field images, incorporating
the superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects--both known and
unknown--present in flat field data. We use these pixel grid models to estimate
the overall impact of sensor systematics on photometry, astrometry, and PSF
shape measurements in a representative sensor from the Dark Energy Camera
(DECam) and a prototype LSST sensor. Applying the method to DECam data recovers
known significant sensor effects for which corrections are currently being
developed within DES. For an LSST prototype CCD with pixel-response
non-uniformity (PRNU) of 0.4%, we find the impact of ""improper"" flat-fielding
on these observables is negligible in nominal .7"" seeing conditions. These
errors scale linearly with the PRNU, so for future LSST production sensors,
which may have larger PRNU, our method provides a way to assess whether
pixel-level calibration beyond flat fielding will be required.

(B-) field is a longstanding challenge. Here we describe how measurements of
the Sun's oscillation eigenfunctions might be used to measure the Sun's
interior B-field. The B-field induces mode-mode couplings, causing the angular
patterns of the eigenfunctions to differ from simple Y_{lm}'s We concentrate on
the magnetic coupling between modes with the same (n,l) values and different
but nearby $m$-values, since these non-axisymmetric couplings clearly cannot be
due to the Sun's axisymmetric rotation and since for these cases, mode mixing
is enhanced by the near-degeneracy of the mode frequencies. We analyze
magnetically-induced mode mixing in two stages of increasing complexity: first
neglecting mode damping, and then incorporating realistic damping rates. We
introduce a novel detection statistic that tests for the presence of
non-axisymmetric mode-mixing in Solar Doppler data. We show that our detection
statistic is naturally robust against spatial aliasing. We estimate our
statistic's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the mode-mixing
amplitude. While B-induced mode-mixing is probably not detectable in a single
mode pair, we argue that the phase of the B-induced mixing should be
approximately the same across a wide range of modes. The total SNR then grows
roughly as Np^{1/2}, where Np is the number of mode pairs. We conclude that
B-induced mode-mixing should be detectable for a fairly wide range of B-field
magnitudes and geometries.

are collimated along the original direction of the parent, those from a slow
moving particle are distributed over a wide region. In the context of searches
for heavy long-lived particles (LLP) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we
quantitatively demonstrate, using a few benchmark models, that objects which
emerge from a secondary vertex due to the decay of an LLP at the TeV scale can
be at large angular separations with respect to the direction of the parent
LLP. A fraction of the decay products, the backward moving objects
(\textit{BMO}s), can even go in the backward direction. These will give rise to
striking signatures in the detectors at the LHC as these particles will
traverse different layers of the detector {\it outside-in} towards the
direction of the beam-pipe. Based on a simple geometrical modelling of the
detector, we give examples of how this effect translates into the fraction of
energy deposited in the tracker, from particles coming as far as from the
hadron calorimeter, as well as those that could be entering from outside the
detector into the muon chamber. The largest effect is from LLP candidates that
come to rest inside the detector, such as the stopped $R$-hadrons. But the
results are promising even in the case of not so heavy LLPs and/or when some of
the available energy is carried by a massive invisible daughter. This urges us
to look more in details at these unusual signatures, taking into account the
particularities of each layer that constitutes the detector. From the
\textit{BMO} perspective, we review how each layer of the detector could be
exploited and what improvements can be made to enhance the shower shapes and
the timing information, for instance. We also argue that the cosmic ray events,
the most important background, can be easily dealt with.

examples of such parameters that are always non pathwise differentiable target
parameters include probability density functions at a point, or regression
functions at a point. In causal inference, under appropriate causal
assumptions, mean counterfactual outcomes can be pathwise differentiable or
not, depending on the degree at which the positivity assumption holds.
  In this paper, given a potentially non-pathwise differentiable target
parameter, we introduce a family of approximating parameters, that are pathwise
differentiable. This family is indexed by a scalar. In kernel regression or
density estimation for instance, a natural choice for such a family is obtained
by kernel smoothing and is indexed by the smoothing level. For the
counterfactual mean outcome, a possible approximating family is obtained
through truncation of the propensity score, and the truncation level then plays
the role of the index.
  We propose a method to data-adaptively select the index in the family, so as
to optimize mean squared error. We prove an asymptotic normality result, which
allows us to derive confidence intervals. Under some conditions, our estimator
achieves an optimal mean squared error convergence rate. Confidence intervals
are data-adaptive and have almost optimal width.

for the inference of a causal dose-response curve at a given treatment dose.

magnetic flux to be closed in the corona, it is an outstanding question why
type III bursts are more frequently observed than U-bursts or J-bursts. We use
LOFAR imaging spectroscopy between 30-80 MHz of low-frequency U-bursts and
J-bursts, for the first time, to understand why electron beams travelling along
coronal loops produce radio emission less often. The different radio source
positions were used to model the spatial structure of the guiding magnetic flux
tube and then deduce the energy range of the exciting electron beams without
the assumption of a standard density model. The radio sources infer a magnetic
loop 1 solar radius in altitude, with the highest frequency sources starting
around 0.6 solar radii. Electron velocities were found between 0.13 c and 0.24
c, with the front of the electron beam travelling faster than the back of the
electron beam. The velocities correspond to energy ranges within the beam from
0.7-11 keV to 0.7-43 keV. The density along the loop is higher than typical
coronal density models and the density gradient is smaller. We found that a
more restrictive range of accelerated beam and background plasma parameters can
result in U-bursts or J-bursts, causing type III bursts to be more frequently
observed. The large instability distances required before Langmuir waves are
produced by some electron beams, and the small magnitude of the background
density gradients make closed loops less facilitating for radio emission than
loops that extend into interplanetary space.

such that $d_F(v) \in B(v)$ for each vertex $v$. The general matching problem
asks the existence of a $B$-matching in a given graph. A set $B(v)$ is said to
have a {\em gap of length} $p$ if there exists a number $k \in B(v)$ such that
$k+1, \ldots, k+p \notin B(v)$ and $k+p+1 \in B(v)$. Without any restrictions
the general matching problem is NP-complete. However, if no set $B(v)$ contains
a gap of length greater than $1$, then the problem can be solved in polynomial
time and Cornuejols \cite{Cor} presented an algorithm for finding a
$B$-matching, if it exists. In this paper we consider a version of the general
matching problem, in which we are interested in finding a $B$-matching having a
maximum (or minimum) number of edges.
  We present the first polynomial time algorithm for the maximum weight
$B$-matching for the case when no set $B(v)$ contains a gap of length greater
than $1$.

cosmological, solar system and pulsar observations typically restricted to
linearized regimes. Gravitational waves from compact binaries provide new
opportunities to probe these theories in the strongly gravitating/highly

the late 70's. We illustrate how to implement this approach to control
undesirable effects of higher order derivatives in gravity theories and argue
how the modified system still captures the true dynamics of the putative

using connected component analysis followed by morphological filtering without
the need of using an OCR. Each letter is sub-divided into a flat region and an
edge region, and local tetra patterns are estimated separately for these two
regions. A strategically constructed pooling technique is used to extract the
final feature vectors. The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly
available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a
resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts. The
results indicate shape independence property in the proposed method as using a
single classifier it outperforms existing handcrafted feature-based methods and

emergence of locality in quantum gravity is contingent on considering
observables with a small number of insertions. Correlation functions where the
number of insertions scales with a power of the central charge of the CFT are
sensitive to nonlocal effects in the bulk theory, which arise from a
combination of the effects of the bulk Gauss law and a breakdown of
perturbation theory. To examine whether a similar effect occurs in flat space,
we consider the scattering of massless particles in the bosonic string and the
superstring in the limit where the number of external particles, n, becomes
very large. We use estimates of the volume of the Weil-Petersson moduli space
of punctured Riemann surfaces to argue that string amplitudes grow factorially
in this limit. We verify this factorial behaviour through an extensive
numerical analysis of string amplitudes at large n. Our numerical calculations
rely on the observation that, in the large n limit, the string scattering
amplitude localizes on the Gross-Mende saddle points, even though individual
particle energies are small. This factorial growth implies the breakdown of
string perturbation theory for $n \sim (M_{pl}/E)^{d-2}$ in d dimensions where
E is the typical individual particle energy. We explore the implications of
this breakdown for the black hole information paradox. We show that the loss of
locality suggested by this breakdown is precisely sufficient to resolve the

sub-arcsecond resolution ground-based MIR spectroscopy of 52 nearby Seyfert

not reproduce the Seyfert galaxies with deep silicate absorption
($S_{Sil}<-1$). Excluding those, we conclude that the new CAT3D models are in
better agreement with the observed $\alpha_{MIR}$ and $S_{Sil}$ of Seyfert
galaxies and quasars. We find that Seyfert 2 are reproduced with models with
low photon escape probabilities, while the quasars and the Seyfert 1-1.5
require generally models with higher photon escape probabilities. Quasars and
Seyfert 1-1.5 tend to show steeper radial cloud distributions and fewer clouds
along an equatorial line-of-sight than Seyfert 2. Introducing AGN anisotropic
emission besides the more physical dust sublimation models alleviates the
problem of requiring inverted radial cloud distributions (i.e., more clouds
towards the outer parts of the torus) to explain the MIR spectral indices of
type 2 Seyferts.

rotating instead of an oscillating one. The latter case is very well studied
and there is an increasing interest in the literature to investigate the former
although it is still unclear under which circumstances the rotating applied

to incorporate the presence of a static field and to perform a systematic study
of the non-linear dynamics of the magnetisation in the framework of the
deterministic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in order to calculate energy
losses. Two cases are considered: the static field is either assumed to be
perpendicular to the plane of rotation or situated in the plane of rotation. In
the latter case a significant increase in the energy loss/cycle is observed if
the magnitudes of the static and the rotating fields have a certain ratio (e.g.
it should be one for isotropic nanoparticles). It can be used to
""super-localise"" the heat transfer: in case of an inhomogeneous applied static
field, tissues are heated up only where the magnitudes of the static and
rotating fields reach the required ratio.

early that it interferes with the chemical decoupling process: i) an
approximate treatment in terms of a coupled system of differential equations

full numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation in phase-space. For
illustration, we apply these methods to the case of Scalar Singlet dark matter.

fraction of all galaxies as a function of stellar mass. Without consideration
of stellar feedback, disc instabilities, and active galactic nuclei, we show
how the slope and normalisation of this relation would change significantly. We
find Dark Sage can reproduce the relative impact that halo mass is observed to
have on satellites' HI fractions and quiescent fraction. However, the model
satellites are systematically gas-poor. We discuss how this could be affected
by satellite--central cross-contamination from the group-finding algorithm
applied to the observed galaxies, but that it is not the full story. From our
results, we suggest the anti-correlation between satellites' HI fractions and
host halo mass, seen at fixed stellar mass and fixed specific star formation
rate, can be attributed almost entirely to ram-pressure stripping of cold gas.
Meanwhile, stripping of hot gas from around the satellites drives the
correlation of quiescent fraction with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. Further
detail in the modelling of galaxy discs' centres is required to solidify this
result, however. We contextualise our results with those from other

signatures using a novel machine-learning random forest decision tree technique
allowing us to select statistically significant samples of major-mergers,
minor-mergers/irregular-systems, and non-interacting galaxies. We use these
samples to show that galaxies undergoing mergers are a factor ~2-7 more likely
to contain luminous obscured AGN than non-interacting galaxies, and this is
independent of both stellar mass and redshift to z < 0.9. Furthermore, based on
our comparison of AGN fractions in mass-matched samples, we determine that the
most luminous AGN population (L_AGN > 10^45 erg/s) systematically reside in
merging systems over non-interacting galaxies. Our findings show that
galaxy-galaxy interactions do, on average, trigger luminous AGN activity

candidates in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) based on
photometry from the NGVS and GUViCS, and proper motions derived from the NGVS
and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Photometric distances for these
candidates are calculated using theoretical color-absolute magnitude relations
while effective temperatures are measured by fitting their spectral energy
distributions. Disk and halo WD candidates are separated using a tangential
velocity cut of 200 km~s$^{-1}$ in a reduced proper motion diagram, which leads
to a sample of six halo WD candidates. Cooling ages, calculated for an assumed
WD mass of 0.6$M_{\odot}$, range between 60 Myr and 6 Gyr, although these
estimates depend sensitively on the adopted mass. Luminosity functions for the
disk and halo subsamples are constructed and compared to previous results from
the SDSS and SuperCOSMOS survey. We compute a number density of (2.81 $\pm$
0.52) $\times 10^{-3}$~pc$^{-3}$ for the disk WD population--- consistent with
previous measurements. We find (7.85 $\pm$ 4.55) $\times 10^{-6}$~pc$^{-3}$ for
the halo, or 0.3\% of the disk. Observed stellar counts are also compared to
predictions made by the TRILEGAL and Besan\c{c}on stellar population synthesis
models. The comparison suggests that the TRILEGAL model overpredicts the total
number of WDs. The WD counts predicted by the Besan\c{c}on model agree with the
observations, although a discrepancy arises when comparing the predicted and
observed halo WD populations; the difference is likely due to the WD masses in
the adopted model halo.

photoionized region and its observational signatures during massive star
formation. Here we focus on the early break out of the photoionized region into
the outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow
simulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing
radiative-transfer. The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar
mass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the
dense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII
regions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases
dramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized
region breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the
radio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial
model, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to
100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a
factor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase
from the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of
0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free
flux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in
the accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker
free-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude
during such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since
internal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH
contraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short
10-100 yr, if accretion bursts are driven by disk instabilities.

non-Gaussian noise transients with complex morphologies. Given their high rate
of occurrence, glitches can lead to false coincident detections, obscure and
even mimic gravitational wave signals. Therefore, successfully characterizing
and removing glitches from advanced LIGO data is of utmost importance. Here, we
present the first application of Deep Transfer Learning for glitch
classification, showing that knowledge from deep learning algorithms trained
for real-world object recognition can be transferred for classifying glitches
in time-series based on their spectrogram images. Using the Gravity Spy
dataset, containing hand-labeled, multi-duration spectrograms obtained from
real LIGO data, we demonstrate that this method enables optimal use of very
deep convolutional neural networks for classification given small training
datasets, significantly reduces the time for training the networks, and
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8%, with perfect precision-recall
on 8 out of 22 classes. Furthermore, new types of glitches can be classified
accurately given few labeled examples with this technique. Once trained via
transfer learning, we show that the convolutional neural networks can be
truncated and used as excellent feature extractors for unsupervised clustering
methods to identify new classes based on their morphology, without any labeled
examples. Therefore, this provides a new framework for dynamic glitch
classification for gravitational wave detectors, which are expected to
encounter new types of noise as they undergo gradual improvements to attain

Planet 9 (P9), hypothesized to circle the Sun on a wide orbit, are included in
some of our simulations. Different models are considered for comets to be
active, including a simple assumption that comets remain active for Np(q)
perihelion passages with perihelion distance q<2.5 au. The orbital distribution
and number of active comets produced in our model is compared to observations.
The orbital distribution of ecliptic comets (ECs) is well reproduced in models
with Np(2.5)=500 and without P9. With P9, the inclination distribution of model
ECs is wider than the observed one. We find that the known Halley-type comets
(HTCs) have a nearly isotropic inclination distribution (with only a slight
preference for prograde orbits). In our model, the HTCs appear to be an
extension of the population of returning Oort-cloud comets (OCCs) to shorter
orbital periods. The inclination distribution of model HTCs becomes broader
with increasing Np, but the existing observational data are not good enough to
constrain Np from orbital fits. Np(2.5)>1000 is required to obtain a
steady-state population of large active HTCs that is consistent with
observations. To fit the ratio of the returning-to-new OCCs, by contrast, our
model implies that Np(2.5)<10, possibly because the detected long-period comets
are smaller and much easier to disrupt than observed HTCs.

operations. A pair of entangled qubits can be shared between two agents by
first preparing a maximally entangled qubit pair at one agent, and then sending
one of the qubits to the other agent through a quantum channel. In this
process, the deterioration of entanglement is inevitable since the noise
inherent in the channel contaminates the qubit. To address this challenge,
various quantum entanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been developed.
Among them, recurrence algorithms have advantages in terms of implementability
and robustness. However, the efficiency of recurrence QED algorithms has not
been investigated thoroughly in the literature. This paper put forth two
recurrence QED algorithms that adapt to the quantum channel to tackle the
efficiency issue. The proposed algorithms have guaranteed convergence for
quantum channels with two Kraus operators, which include phase-damping and
amplitude-damping channels. Analytical results show that the convergence speed
of these algorithms is improved from linear to quadratic and one of the
algorithms achieves the optimal speed. Numerical results confirm that the
proposed algorithms significantly improve the efficiency of QED.

resource for promising applications in distributed computing, cryptography, and
sensing. However, distributing entanglement with high-quality via fiber optic
routes could be challenging due to the various decoherence mechanisms in
fibers. In particular, one of the primary polarization decoherence mechanisms
in optical fibers is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which is the
distortion of optical pulses by randomly varying birefringences in the system.
To mitigate the effect of decoherence in entangled particles, quantum
entanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been proposed. One particular
class, the recurrence QED algorithms, stands out because it has relatively
relaxed requirements on both the size of the quantum circuits involved and on
the initial quality of entanglement in particles. However, because the number
of particles required grows exponentially with the number of rounds of
distillation, an efficient recurrence algorithm needs to converge quickly. We
present a recurrence QED algorithm designed for photonic qubit pairs affected
by PMD-degraded channels. Our proposed algorithm achieves the optimal fidelity
as well as the optimal success probability (conditional on the optimal fidelity
being achieved) in every round of distillation. The attainment of optimal
fidelity improves the convergence speed of fidelity with respect to the rounds
of distillation from linear to quadratic, and hence significantly reduces the
number of distillation rounds. Combined with the fact that the optimal success
probability is achieved, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient method to
distribute entangled states with high fidelity via optic fibers.

discontinuous) transitions. They manifest in distinct systems, such as
synchronization in coupled oscillators, percolation regime, absorbing phase
transitions and more recently, in the majority-vote (MV) model with inertia. In
the latter, the model rules are slightly modified by the inclusion of a term
depending on the local spin (an inertial term). In such case, Chen et al. (Phys
Rev. E {5}, 042304 (2017)) have found that relevant inertia changes the nature
of the phase transition in complex networks, from continuous to discontinuous.
Here we give a further step by embedding inertia only in vertices with degree
larger than a threshold value $\langle k \rangle k^*$, $\langle k \rangle$
being the mean system degree and $k^*$ the fraction restriction. Our results,
from mean-field analysis and extensive numerical simulations, reveal that an
explosive transition is presented in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
structures for small and intermediate $k^*$'s. Otherwise, large restriction can
sustain a discontinuous transition only in the heterogeneous case. This shares
some similarity with recent results for the Kuramoto model (Phys Rev. E {91},
022818 (2015)). Surprisingly, intermediate restriction and large inertia are
responsible for the emergence of an extra phase, in which the system is
partially synchronized and the classification of phase transition depends on
the inertia and the lattice topology. In this case, the system exhibits two
phase transitions.

modelling procedure to estimate circular velocity curves of dwarf galaxy discs
from the APOSTLE suite of {\Lambda}CDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
The modelling yields a large diversity of rotation curves for an individual
galaxy at fixed inclination, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The
diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in particular, by
strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that the
tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for and that are difficult to detect
in model residuals. Large misestimates of the circular velocity arise when the
kinematic major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation pattern, in
some cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale density 'cores', when
none are actually present. The thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this
effect: more slowly-rotating extra-planar gas systematically reduces the
average line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to
underestimate the true circular velocity of APOSTLE galaxies in the inner
regions. Non-circular motions provide an appealing explanation for the large
apparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO 47 and DDO 87, where the model
residuals suggest that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner
circular velocities. Although residuals from tilted ring models in the
simulations appear larger than in observed galaxies, our results suggest that
non-circular motions should be carefully taken into account when considering
the evidence for dark matter cores in individual galaxies.

$(2+1)$-dimensional conformal fluid turbulence from direct numerical
simulations, in the weakly compressible regime. These relations were
analytically derived previously in Westernacher-Schneider, Lehner, Oz (2015)
for a relativistic fluid; this work is a continuation of that study, providing
further analytical insights together with numerical experiments to test the
scaling relations and extract other important features characterizing the
turbulent behavior. We first explicitly demonstrate that the non-relativistic
limit of these scaling relations reduce to known results from the statistical
theory of incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence. In simulations of the
inverse-cascade range, we find the relevant relativistic scaling relation is
satisfied to a high degree of accuracy. We observe that the non-relativistic
versions of this scaling relation underperform the relativistic one in both an
absolute and relative sense, with a progressive degradation as the rms Mach
number increases from $0.14$ to $0.19$. In the direct-cascade range, the two
relevant relativistic scaling relations are satisfied with a lower degree of
accuracy in a simulation with rms Mach number $0.11$. We elucidate the poorer
agreement with further simulations of an incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid.
Finally, as has been observed in the incompressible Navier-Stokes case, we show
that the energy spectrum in the inverse-cascade of the conformal fluid exhibits
$k^{-2}$ scaling rather than the Kolmogorov/Kraichnan expectation of
$k^{-5/3}$, and that it is not necessarily associated with compressive effects.
We comment on the implications for a recent calculation of the fractal
dimension of a turbulent $(3+1)$-dimensional AdS black brane.

an ensemble of IoT-controlled loads can be hacked with malicious intentions of
compromising operations of the electrical grid. Under this scenario, the
attacker would use geographically distributed IoT-controlled loads to alternate
their net power injections into the electrical grid in such a way that may
disrupt normal grid operations.
  This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze grid impacts of
distributed cyber-attacks on IoT-controlled loads. This framework is used to
demonstrate how a hypothetical distributed cyber-attack propagates from the
distribution electrical grid, where IoT-controlled loads are expected to be
installed, to the transmission electrical grid. The techno-economic
interactions between the distribution and transmission electrical grids are
accounted for by means of bilevel optimization. The case study is carried out
on the modified versions of the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and
the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
severity of such attacks depends on the penetration level of IoT-controlled
loads and the strategy of the attacker.

their connection with two orders: a timelike and a (non-causal) spacelike one.
For the (non-causal) spacelike order, we introduce a partition of the null cone
which gives the desired topology invariantly from the choice of the hyperplane
of partition. In particular, we observe that these two orders induce topologies
within the class of Zeeman topologies, while the two suggested topologies by
Zeeman himself are intersection topologies of these two order topologies

questions and a discussion, comparing the topologies with bounded against those

from bouncing to sticking collisions happened at 12.7 cm/s for the smaller
aggregates composed of monodisperse particles and at 11.5 and 11.7 cm/s for the
larger aggregates composed of mono- and polydisperse dust particles,
respectively. Using the pull-off force of sub-mm-sized dust aggregates from the
clusters, the surface energy of the aggregates composed of monodisperse dust

the micrometre-sized monomer particles and is in good agreement with previous
measurements for silica particles. The tensile strengths of these aggregates

large dust aggregates, respectively. These values are in good agreement with
recent tensile strength measurements for mm-sized silica aggregates. Using our

applications in socio-economic and life sciences, where processes characterized
by large groups of agents exhibit spontaneous emergence of social structures.
Well-known examples are the formation of clusters in opinion dynamics, the
appearance of inequalities in wealth distributions, flocking and milling
behaviors in swarming models, synchronization phenomena in biological systems
and lane formation in pedestrian traffic. The construction of kinetic models
describing the above processes, however, has to face the difficulty of the lack
of fundamental principles since physical forces are replaced by empirical
social forces. These empirical forces are typically constructed with the aim to
reproduce qualitatively the observed system behaviors, like the emergence of
social structures, and are at best known in terms of statistical information of
the modeling parameters. For this reason the presence of random inputs
characterizing the parameters uncertainty should be considered as an essential
feature in the modeling process. In this survey we introduce several examples
of such kinetic models, that are mathematically described by nonlinear Vlasov
and Fokker--Planck equations, and present different numerical approaches for
uncertainty quantification which preserve the main features of the kinetic

noisy queries (or a faulty oracle). Given a set of $n$ elements, our goal is to
recover the true clustering by asking minimum number of pairwise queries to an
oracle. Oracle can answer queries of the form : ""do elements $u$ and $v$ belong
to the same cluster?"" -- the queries can be asked interactively (adaptive
queries), or non-adaptively up-front, but its answer can be erroneous with
probability $p$. In this paper, we provide the first information theoretic
lower bound on the number of queries for clustering with noisy oracle in both
situations. We design novel algorithms that closely match this query complexity
lower bound, even when the number of clusters is unknown. Moreover, we design
computationally efficient algorithms both for the adaptive and non-adaptive
settings. The problem captures/generalizes multiple application scenarios. It
is directly motivated by the growing body of work that use crowdsourcing for
{\em entity resolution}, a fundamental and challenging data mining task aimed
to identify all records in a database referring to the same entity. Here crowd
represents the noisy oracle, and the number of queries directly relates to the
cost of crowdsourcing. Another application comes from the problem of {\em sign
edge prediction} in social network, where social interactions can be both
positive and negative, and one must identify the sign of all pair-wise
interactions by querying a few pairs. Furthermore, clustering with noisy oracle
is intimately connected to correlation clustering, leading to improvement
therein. Finally, it introduces a new direction of study in the popular {\em
stochastic block model} where one has an incomplete stochastic block model
matrix to recover the clusters.

it remained also as the de facto method for computing the Lasso solution before
more sophisticated optimization algorithms preceded it. LARS method has
recently again increased its popularity due to its ability to find the values
of the penalty parameters, called knots, at which a new parameter enters the
active set of non-zero coefficients. Significance test for the Lasso by
Lockhart et al. (2014), for example, requires solving the knots via the LARS
algorithm. Elastic net (EN), on the other hand, is a highly popular extension
of Lasso that uses a linear combination of Lasso and ridge regression
penalties. In this paper, we propose a new novel algorithm, called pathwise
(PW-)LARS-EN, that is able to compute the EN knots over a grid of EN tuning
parameter {\alpha} values. The developed PW-LARS-EN algorithm decreases the EN
tuning parameter and exploits the previously found knot values and the original
LARS algorithm. A covariance test statistic for the Lasso is then generalized
to the EN for testing the significance of the predictors. Our simulation
studies validate the fact that the test statistic has an asymptotic Exp(1)

physics. We find the stellar masses of the galaxies formed in Self-Interacting
Dark Matter (SIDM) with $\sigma/m= 1\, cm^2/g$ are very similar to those in CDM
(spanning $M_{\star} \approx 10^{5.7 - 7.0} M_{\odot}$) and all runs lie on a
similar stellar mass -- size relation. The logarithmic dark matter density
slope ($\alpha=d\log \rho / d\log r$) in the central $250-500$ pc remains
steeper than $\alpha= -0.8$ for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass
$M_{\star} \sim 10^{6.6} M_{\odot}$ and core-like in the most massive galaxy.
In contrast, every SIDM hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with
$\alpha >-0.4$. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs
without baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2 baryonic
physics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the inclusion of
(potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this mass scale,
suggesting SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM using low-mass galaxies. Our
FIRE simulations predict that galaxies less massive than $M_{\star} < 3 \times
10^6 M_{\odot}$ provide potentially ideal targets for discriminating models,
with SIDM producing substantial cores in such tiny galaxies and CDM producing
cusps.

that are increasingly being considered as a powerful error correction tool for
modern dense storage devices. The increasing levels of asymmetry incorporated
by the channels underlying modern dense storage systems exacerbates the error
floor problem. In a recent research, the weight consistency matrix (WCM)
framework was introduced as an effective NB-LDPC code optimization methodology
that is suitable for modern Flash memory and magnetic recording (MR) systems.
In this paper, we provide the in-depth theoretical analysis needed to
understand and properly apply the WCM framework. We focus on general absorbing
sets of type two (GASTs). In particular, we introduce a novel tree
representation of a GAST called the unlabeled GAST tree, using which we prove
that the WCM framework is optimal. Then, we enumerate the WCMs. We demonstrate
the significance of the savings achieved by the WCM framework in the number of
matrices processed to remove a GAST. Moreover, we provide a linear-algebraic
analysis of the null spaces of WCMs associated with a GAST. We derive the
minimum number of edge weight changes needed to remove a GAST via its WCMs,
along with how to choose these changes. Additionally, we propose a new set of
problematic objects, namely the oscillating sets of type two (OSTs), which
contribute to the error floor of NB-LDPC codes with even column weights on
asymmetric channels, and we show how to customize the WCM framework to remove
OSTs. We also extend the domain of the WCM framework applications by
demonstrating its benefits in optimizing column weight 5 codes, codes used over
Flash channels with soft information, and spatially-coupled codes. The
performance gains achieved via the WCM framework range between 1 and nearly 2.5
orders of magnitude in the error floor region over interesting channels.

present a three-stage approach for the design of high performance non-binary SC

number of detrimental general absorbing sets of type two (GASTs) in the graph
of the designed NB-SC code. In the first stage, we deploy a novel partitioning
mechanism, called the optimal overlap partitioning, which acts on the

smallest number of detrimental objects. In the second stage, we apply a new
circulant power optimizer to further reduce the number of detrimental GASTs. In
the third stage, we use the weight consistency matrix framework to manipulate
edge weights to eliminate as many as possible of the GASTs that remain in the

synchronising high-speed photography with fast force sensing, we simultaneously
measure the temporal evolution of the shape and impact force of impacting drops
over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re). At high Re, when inertia dominates
the impact processes, we show that the early-time evolution of impact force
follows a square-root scaling, quantitatively agreeing with a recent
self-similar theory. This observation provides direct experimental evidence on
the existence of upward propagating self-similar pressure fields during the
initial impact of liquid drops at high Re. When viscous forces gradually set in
with decreasing Re, we analyse the early-time scaling of the impact force of
viscous drops using a perturbation method. The analysis quantitatively matches
our experiments and successfully predicts the trends of the maximum impact
force and the associated peak time with decreasing Re. Furthermore, we discuss
the influence of viscoelasticity on the temporal signature of impact forces.
Last but not least, we also investigate the spreading of liquid drops at high
Re following the initial impact. Particularly, we find an exact parameter-free
self-similar solution for the inertia-driven drop spreading, which
quantitatively predicts the height of spreading drops at high Re. The limit of
the self-similar approach for drop spreading is also discussed. As such, our
study provides a quantitative understanding of the temporal evolution of impact
forces across the inertial, viscous and viscoelastic regimes and sheds new
light on the self-similar dynamics of drop impact processes.

three spacetime dimensions is explored. The asymptotic symmetries are spanned
by an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\hat{u}(1)$
currents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to $U(1)$
fields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the
$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide
nontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to
the energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological
spacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the
$\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state
corresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the
canonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like
$\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the
ground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\hat{u}(1)$ charge. If
the spin structure is even, the same bound for the energy generically holds,
unless the absolute value of the electric-like charge is less than minus the
mass of Minkowski spacetime in vacuum, so that the energy has to be
nonnegative. The explicit form of the Killing spinors is found for a wide class
of configurations that fulfills our boundary conditions, and they exist
precisely when the corresponding bounds are saturated. It is also shown that
the spectra with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic
fields are related by spectral flow, in a similar way as it occurs for the
$\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Virasoro algebra. Indeed, our super-BMS$_3$ algebra can
be recovered from the flat limit of the superconformal algebra with
$\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$, truncating the fermionic generators of the right copy.

located in the core of the globular cluster Terzan 5. This is a mildly recycled
accreting pulsar with a peculiar evolutionary history since its total age has
been suggested to be less than a few hundred Myr, despite the very old age of
Terzan 5 (~12 Gyr). Solving the origin of this age discrepancy might be very
valuable because it can reveal why systems like IGR J17480-2446 are so rare in
our Galaxy. We have performed numerical simulations (dynamical and binary
evolution) to constrain the evolutionary history of IGR J17480-2446 . We find
that the binary has a high probability to be the result of close encounters,
with a formation mechanism compatible with the tidal capture of the donor star.
The result reinforces the hypothesis that IGR J17480-2446 is a binary that
started mass transfer in an exceptionally recent time. We also show that
primordial interacting binaries in the core of Terzan 5 are strongly affected
by a few hundred close encounters (fly-by) during their lifetime. This effect
might delay, accelerate or even interrupt the Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) phase.
Our calculations show that systems of this kind can form exclusively in dense
environments like globular clusters.

to the round-trip (uplink beacon and downlink WPT) signal propagation loss

each ER independently adjusts the beacon power based on its current harvested

whisker-trigeminal system. Raw sensory data arrives in the form of mechanical
input to the exquisitely sensitive, actively-controllable whisker array, and is
processed through a sequence of neural circuits, eventually arriving in
cortical regions that communicate with decision-making and memory areas.
Although a long history of experimental studies has characterized many aspects
of these processing stages, the computational operations of the
whisker-trigeminal system remain largely unknown. In the present work, we take
a goal-driven deep neural network (DNN) approach to modeling these
computations. First, we construct a biophysically-realistic model of the rat
whisker array. We then generate a large dataset of whisker sweeps across a wide
variety of 3D objects in highly-varying poses, angles, and speeds. Next, we
train DNNs from several distinct architectural families to solve a shape
recognition task in this dataset. Each architectural family represents a
structurally-distinct hypothesis for processing in the whisker-trigeminal
system, corresponding to different ways in which spatial and temporal
information can be integrated. We find that most networks perform poorly on the
challenging shape recognition task, but that specific architectures from
several families can achieve reasonable performance levels. Finally, we show
that Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs), a tool for comparing
population codes between neural systems, can separate these higher-performing
networks with data of a type that could plausibly be collected in a
neurophysiological or imaging experiment. Our results are a proof-of-concept
that goal-driven DNN networks of the whisker-trigeminal system are potentially

novel materials with enhanced optical nonlinearities at moderate input

theoretically derive an Ising Hamiltonian from the FG system in its
single-electron region. Recent high-density NAND flash memories are subject to
several problems that originate from their small FG cells. In order to store
information reliably, the number of electrons in each FG cell should be
sufficiently large. However, the number of electrons stored in each FG cell
becomes smaller and can be countable. So we utilize the countable electron
region to operate single-electron effects of FG cells. Second, in the
conventional NAND flash memory, the high density of FG cells induces the
problem of cell-to-cell interference through their mutual capacitive couplings.
This interference problem is usually solved by various methods using a software
of error-correcting codes. We derive the Ising interaction from this natural
capacitive coupling. Considering the size of the cell, 10 nm, the operation
temperature is expected to be approximately that of a liquid nitrogen. If a
commercial 64 Gbit NAND flash memory is used, ideally we expect it to be
possible to construct 2 megabytes (MB) entangled qubits by using the

a multi-core system where cores are explicitly designated as critical or
non-critical. HourGlass is a time-based cache coherence protocol for
dual-critical multi-core systems that ensures worst-case latency (WCL) bounds
for memory requests originating from critical cores. Although HourGlass does
not provide either WCL or bandwidth guarantees for memory requests from
non-critical cores, it promotes the use of timers to improve its bandwidth
utilization while still maintaining WCL bounds for critical cores. This
encourages a trade-off between the WCL bounds for critical cores, and the
improved memory bandwidth for non-critical cores via timer configurations. We
evaluate HourGlass using gem5, and with multithreaded benchmark suites
including SPLASH-2, and synthetic workloads. Our results show that the WCL for
critical cores with HourGlass is always within the analytical WCL bounds, and
provides a tighter WCL bound on critical cores compared to the state-of-the-art
real-time cache coherence protocol. Further, we show that HourGlass enables a
trade-off between provable WCL bounds for critical cores, and improved
bandwidth utilization for non-critical cores. The average-case performance of
HourGlass is comparable to the state-of-the-art real-time cache coherence
protocol, and suffers a slowdown of 1.43x and 1.46x compared to the
conventional MSI and MESI protocols.

the product of structural modifications along with differences in participant

the result of changing the attitudes of participants in the network, then the
question arises whether network structure can affect participant attitude.
Taking citizen par-ticipation as an example, engagement with relevant
stakeholders reveals trust and motivation to be the major objectives for the
network. Using a typology to de-scribe network state based on multiple
characteristic or dimensions, we can pre-dict possible behavioural outcomes in
the network. However, this has to be medi-ated via attitude change. Motivation
for the citizen participation network can only increase in line with enhanced
trust. The focus for changing network dynamics, therefore, shifts to the
dimensional changes needed to encourage increased trust. It turns out that the
coordinated manipulation of multiple dimensions is needed to bring about the
desired shift in attitude.

a non-trivial way. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the
magnetic volume fraction increases strongly. The reason could be a charge
redistribution of the free carriers due to the opening of the superconducting

have been anecdotal reports of censorship leakage, there has yet to be a
systematic study of censorship leakage at a global scale. In this paper, we
combine a global censorship measurement platform (ICLab) with a general-purpose
technique -- boolean network tomography -- to identify which AS on a network
path is performing censorship. At a high-level, our approach exploits BGP churn
to narrow down the set of potential censoring ASes by over 95%. We exactly

functions offer an interesting dispersion dissipation behaviour: dispersion
errors are very low for a broad range of scales, while dissipation errors are
very low for well resolved scales and are very high for scales close to the
Nyquist cutoff. This observation motivates the trend that DG methods with
Riemann solvers are used without an explicit LES model added. Due to
under-resolution of vortical dominated structures typical for LES type setups,
element based high order methods suffer from stability issues caused by
aliasing errors of the non-linear flux terms. A very common strategy to fight
these aliasing issues (and instabilities) is so-called polynomial de-aliasing,
where interpolation is exchanged with projection based on an increased number
of quadrature points. In this paper, we start with this common no-model or
implicit LES (iLES) DG approach with polynomial de-aliasing and Riemann solver
dissipation and review its capabilities and limitations. We find that the
strategy gives excellent results, but only when the resolution is such, that
about 40\% of the dissipation is resolved. For more realistic, coarser
resolutions used in classical LES e.g. of industrial applications, the iLES DG
strategy becomes quite in-accurate. The core of this work is a novel LES
strategy based on split form DG methods that are kinetic energy preserving.
Such discretisations offer excellent stability with full control over the
amount and shape of the added artificial dissipation. This premise is the main
idea of the work and we will assess the LES capabilities of the novel split
form DG approach. We will demonstrate that the novel DG LES strategy offers
similar accuracy as the iLES methodology for well resolved cases, but strongly
increases fidelity in case of more realistic coarse resolutions.

temperatures of $1000 - 2500 \ \mathrm{Kelvin}$. Incoming irradiation directly
heats just their thin outer layer, down to pressures of $\sim 0.1 \
\mathrm{bars}$. In standard irradiated evolution models of hot Jupiters,
predicted transit radii are too small. Previous studies have shown that deeper
heating -- at a small fraction of the heating rate from irradiation -- can
explain observed radii. Here we present a suite of evolution models for HD
209458b where we systematically vary both the depth and intensity of internal
heating, without specifying the uncertain heating mechanism(s). Our models
start with a hot, high entropy planet whose radius decreases as the convective
interior cools. The applied heating suppresses this cooling. We find that very
shallow heating -- at pressures of $1 - 10 \ \mathrm{bars}$ -- does not
significantly suppress cooling, unless the total heating rate is $\gtrsim 10\%$
of the incident stellar power. Deeper heating, at $100 \ \mathrm{bars}$,
requires heating at only $1\%$ of the stellar irradiation to explain the
observed transit radius of $1.4 R_{\rm Jup}$ after 5 Gyr of cooling. In
general, more intense and deeper heating results in larger hot Jupiter radii.
Surprisingly, we find that heat deposited at $10^4 \ \mathrm{bars}$ -- which is
exterior to $\approx 99\%$ of the planet's mass -- suppresses planetary cooling
as effectively as heating at the center. In summary, we find that relatively
shallow heating is required to explain the radii of most hot Jupiters, provided
that this heat is applied early and persists throughout their evolution.

as well as in integrated quantum photonics and quantum information processing
as single-photon emitters. Single-particle spectroscopy of 10-nm QDs with
3.2-nm cores reveals strong photon antibunching attributed to fast (70-ps)
Auger recombination of multiple excitons. The QDs exhibit very good
photostability under strong optical excitation. We demonstrate that the
antibunching is preserved when the QDs are excited above the saturation
intensity of the fundamental-exciton transition. This result paves the way
towards their usage as high-purity on-demand single-photon emitters at room
temperature. Unconventionally, despite the strong Auger blockade mechanism,
InP/ZnSe QDs also display very little luminescence intermittency (""blinking""),
with a simple on/off blinking pattern. The analysis of single-particle
luminescence statistics places these InP/ZnSe QDs in the class of nearly
blinking-free QDs, with emission stability comparable to state-of-the-art
thick-shell and alloyed-interface CdSe/CdS, but with improved single-photon
purity.

Starting from this classical theorem, our first main result is a general
instability criterion for timelike and spacelike closed semi-Riemannian

index, a new topological invariant that we define through the spectral flow
(being the Morse index truly infinite) of a path of selfadjoint Fredholm

formula. Bott's iteration formula, introduced by author in 1956, relates in a
clear way the Morse index of an iterated closed Riemannian geodesic and the
so-called $\omega$-Morse indices. Our second result is a semi-Riemannian
generalization of the famous Bott-type iteration formula in the case of closed

result is a strong instability result obtained by controlling the Morse index
of the geodesic and of all of its iterations.

and its applications. During last few years, several different techniques are
proposed to localize the nonlocal fractional diffusion operator. They are based
on transformation of the original problem to a local elliptic or
pseudoparabolic problem, or to an integral representation of the solution, thus
increasing the dimension of the computational domain. More recently, an
alternative approach aimed at reducing the computational complexity was
developed. The linear algebraic system $\cal A^\alpha \bf u=\bf f$, $0< \alpha
<1$ is considered, where $\cal A$ is a properly normalized (scalded) symmetric
and positive definite matrix obtained from finite element or finite difference
approximation of second order elliptic problems in $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$,
$d=1,2,3$. The method is based on best uniform rational approximations (BURA)
of the function $t^{\beta-\alpha}$ for $0 < t \le 1$ and natural $\beta$.
  The maximum principles are among the major qualitative properties of linear
elliptic operators/PDEs. In many studies and applications, it is important that
such properties are preserved by the selected numerical solution method. In
this paper we present and analyze the properties of positive approximations of
$\cal A^{-\alpha}$ obtained by the BURA technique. Sufficient conditions for
positiveness are proven, complemented by sharp error estimates. The theoretical
results are supported by representative numerical tests.

benefits associated with centralized cloud processing and wireless edge caching
enabling primarily low-latency transmission under moderate fronthaul capacity
requirements. The F-RAN we consider in this paper is composed of a centralized
cloud server which is connected through fronthaul links to two edge nodes
serving two mobile users through a Z-shaped partially connected wireless
network. We define an information-theoretic metric, the delivery time per bit
(DTB), that captures the worst-case per-bit delivery latency for conveying any
requested content to the users. For the cases when cloud and wireless
transmission occur either sequentially or in parallel, we establish coinciding
lower and upper bounds on the DTB as a function of cache size, backhaul
capacity and wireless channel parameters. Through optimized rate allocation,
our achievability scheme determines the best combination of private, common
signalling and interference neutralization that matches the converse. Our
converse bounds use subsets of wireless, fronthaul and caching resources of the
F-RAN as side information that enable a single receiver to decode either one or
both users' requested files. We show the optimality on the DTB for all channel
regimes. In case of serial transmission, the functional DTB-behavior changes at
fronthaul capacity thresholds. In this context, we combine multiple channel
regimes to classes of channel regimes which share the same fronthaul capacity
thresholds and as such the same DTB-functional. In total, our analysis
identifies four classes; in only three of those edge caching and cloud
processing can provide nontrivial synergestic and non-synergestic performance

liquid xenon (LXe) can be used to build a Cherenkov-based TOF-PET, with an
intrinsic coincidence resolving time (CRT) in the vicinity of 10 ps. This
extraordinary performance is due to three facts: a) the abundant emission of
Cherenkov photons by liquid xenon; b) the fact that LXe is transparent to
Cherenkov light; and c) the fact that the fastest photons in LXe have
wavelengths higher than 300 nm, therefore making it possible to separate the
detection of scintillation and Cherenkov light. The CRT in a Cherenkov LXe
TOF-PET detector is, therefore, dominated by the resolution (time jitter)
introduced by the photosensors and the electronics. However, we show that for
sufficiently fast photosensors (e.g, an overall 40 ps jitter, which can be
achieved by current micro-channel plate photomultipliers) the overall CRT
varies between 30 and 55 ps, depending of the detection efficiency. This is
still one order of magnitude better than commercial CRT devices and improves by
a factor 3 the best CRT obtained with small laboratory prototypes.

edge mode might have been experimentally detected. There have been very many
recent experiments which conjecture that a single chiral QAH edge mode always
materializes along with a pair of quasi-helical quantum spin Hall (QSH) edge
modes. The reason for this seems to lie in the origin of QAH edge modes. These
evolve from QSH edge modes via suppression of one of the spin edge modes by
application of a ferromagnet or magnetic impurity. In this work we deal with a
substantial 'What If ?' question- in case the QSH edge modes, from which these
QAH edge modes evolve, are not topologically protected then the QAH edge modes
wont be topologically protected too and thus unfit for use in any applications.
Further, as a corollary one can also ask if the topological protection of QSH
edge modes does not carry over during the evolution process to QAH edge modes
then again our 'What if?' scenario becomes apparent. The ""how"" of the
resolution of this 'What if?' conundrum is the main objective of our work. We
show in similar set-ups affected by disorder and inelastic scattering,
transport via trivial QAH edge mode leads to quantization of Hall resistance
and not that via topological QAH edge modes. This perhaps begs a substantial
reinterpretation of those experiments which purported to find signatures of
chiral(topological) QAH edge modes albeit in conjunction with quasi helical QSH
edge modes.

understand driver behaviors. The amount of data affects the experiment cost and
conclusions in the analysis. Insufficient data may lead to inaccurate models
while excessive data waste resources. For projects that cost millions of
dollars, it is critical to determine the right amount of data needed. However,
how to decide the appropriate amount has not been fully studied in the realm of
driver behaviors. This paper systematically investigates this issue to estimate
how much naturalistic driving data (NDD) is needed for understanding driver
behaviors from a statistical point of view. A general assessment method is
proposed using a Gaussian kernel density estimation to catch the underlying
characteristics of driver behaviors. We then apply the Kullback-Liebler
divergence method to measure the similarity between density functions with
differing amounts of NDD. A max-minimum approach is used to compute the
appropriate amount of NDD. To validate our proposed method, we investigated the
car-following case using NDD collected from the University of Michigan Safety
Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program. We demonstrate that from a statistical
perspective, the proposed approach can provide an appropriate amount of NDD
capable of capturing most features of the normal car-following behavior, which
is consistent with the experiment settings in many literatures.

First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of the pomeron diagram

a novel software named EasyCrania to design the cranial implants conveniently
and efficiently. The process can be divided into five steps, which are
mirroring model, clipping surface, surface fitting, the generation of the
initial implant and the generation of the final implant. The main concept of
our method is to use the geometry information of the mirrored model as the base
to generate the final implant. The comparative studies demonstrated that the
EasyCrania can improve the efficiency of cranial implant design significantly.
And, the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the software were stable, which
were 87.07+/-1.6% and 87.73+/-1.4% respectively.

work, by investigating a simple distributed elliptic optimal control problem,
we first show that enforcing such a stringent condition of commutative property
is only sufficient but not necessary for achieving the desired convergence. We
then propose to add some suitable $H_1$ semi-norm penalty/regularization terms
to recover the lost convergence due to the inconsistency caused by the loss of
commutativity. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify our theoretical

distribution is a special case. Recently Kundu (2014) introduced a geometric
skew-normal distribution and showed that it has certain advantages over
Azzalini's skew-normal distribution. In this paper we discuss about the
multivariate geometric skew-normal distribution. It can be used as an
alternative to Azzalini's skew normal distribution. We discuss different
properties of the proposed distribution. It is observed that the joint
probability density function of the multivariate geometric skew normal
distribution can take variety of shapes. Several characterization results have
been established. Generation from a multivariate geometric skew normal
distribution is quite simple, hence the simulation experiments can be performed
quite easily. The maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters can
be obtained quite conveniently using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.
We perform some simulation experiments and it is observed that the performances
of the proposed EM algorithm are quite satisfactory. Further, the analyses of
two data sets have been performed, and it is observed that the proposed methods
and the model work very well.

attention in the last few years. In this paper we consider the joint
progressive censoring scheme for two populations. It is assumed that the
lifetime distribution of the items from the two populations follow Weibull
distribution with the same shape but different scale parameters. Based on the
joint progressive censoring scheme first we consider the maximum likelihood
estimators of the unknown parameters whenever they exist. We provide the
Bayesian inferences of the unknown parameters under a fairly general priors on
the shape and scale parameters. The Bayes estimators and the associated
credible intervals cannot be obtained in closed form, and we propose to use the
importance sampling technique to compute the same. Further, we consider the
problem when it is known apriori that the expected lifetime of one population
is smaller than the other. We provide the order restricted classical and
Bayesian inferences of the unknown parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are
performed to observe the performances of the different estimators and the
associated confidence and credible intervals. One real data set has been

state at recommendation time. Recent approaches that leverage Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) for session-based recommendations have shown that Deep Learning
models can provide useful user representations for recommendation. However,
current RNN modeling approaches summarize the user state by only taking into
account the sequence of items that the user has interacted with in the past,
without taking into account other essential types of context information such
as the associated types of user-item interactions, the time gaps between events
and the time of day for each interaction. To address this, we propose a new
class of Contextual Recurrent Neural Networks for Recommendation (CRNNs) that
can take into account the contextual information both in the input and output
layers and modifying the behavior of the RNN by combining the context embedding
with the item embedding and more explicitly, in the model dynamics, by
parametrizing the hidden unit transitions as a function of context information.
We compare our CRNNs approach with RNNs and non-sequential baselines and show
good improvements on the next event prediction task.

$U-V$ rest-frame colors; the latter are an indicator of the luminosity-weighted
age of the stellar population in a galaxy. We also estimated the local observed

transposed them into local $U-V$ rest-frame colors. Selecting SNIa based on
host photometry quality, we then performed cosmological fits using local color
as a third standardization variable, for which we split the sample at the

astrophysical tools. Reddening maps may be based on the inversion of color
excess measurements for individual target stars or on statistical methods using

(DIBs) have also been produced. All methods benefit from the advent of massive
surveys and from Gaia data. We first updated our previous local dust maps based
on a regularized Bayesian inversion of individual color excess data by
replacing Hipparcos or photometric distances with Gaia Data Release 1 values
when available. Secondly, we complemented this database with a series of ~5,000
color excess values estimated from the strength of the lambda 15273 DIB toward
stars from SDSS/APOGEE, possessing a Gaia parallax. Third, we computed a
low-resolution map based on a grid of Pan-STARRS reddening measurements by
means of a new hierarchical technique and used this map as the prior
distribution during the inversion of the two other datasets. Here we present a
first attempt to combine different datasets and methods to improve the local
maps. The use of Gaia parallaxes introduces significant changes in some areas
and globally increases the compactness of the structures. Additional DIB-based
data make it possible to assign distances to clouds located behind closer
opaque structures and do not introduce contradictory information for the close
structures. A more realistic prior distribution instead of a plane-parallel
homogeneous distribution helps better define the structures. We validated the
results through comparisons with other maps and with soft X-ray data. Our study
demonstrates that the combination of various tracers is a potential tool for
more accurate maps. An online tool makes it possible to retrieve maps and
reddening estimations (http://stilism.obspm.fr).

this basic problem of query complexity of interactive clustering, and provide
strong information theoretic lower bounds, as well as nearly matching upper
bounds. Most clustering problems come with a similarity matrix, which is used
by an automated process to cluster similar points together. Our main
contribution in this paper is to show the dramatic power of side information
aka similarity matrix on reducing the query complexity of clustering. A
similarity matrix represents noisy pair-wise relationships such as one computed
by some function on attributes of the elements. A natural noisy model is where
similarity values are drawn independently from some arbitrary probability
distribution $f_+$ when the underlying pair of elements belong to the same
cluster, and from some $f_-$ otherwise. We show that given such a similarity
matrix, the query complexity reduces drastically from $\Theta(nk)$ (no
similarity matrix) to $O(\frac{k^2\log{n}}{\cH^2(f_+\|f_-)})$ where $\cH^2$
denotes the squared Hellinger divergence. Moreover, this is also
information-theoretic optimal within an $O(\log{n})$ factor. Our algorithms are
all efficient, and parameter free, i.e., they work without any knowledge of $k,

used to analyze the early-universe cosmology, when the scalar field $\phi$
dominates over standard matter. We have obtained solutions to the Klein-Gordon

$\left(f(R)=\beta R^{n}\right)$, as time increases the scalar field decreases

Generating a synthetic dataset of meteoroid orbits is a crucial step
in analysing the probabilities of random grouping of meteoroid orbits in
automated meteor shower surveys. Recent works have shown the importance of
choosing a low similarity threshold value of meteoroid orbits, some pointing
out that the recent meteor shower surveys produced false positives due to
similarity thresholds which were too high. On the other hand, the methods of
synthetic meteoroid orbit generation introduce additional biases into the data,
thus making the final decision on an appropriate threshold value uncertain.
  Aims. As a part of the ongoing effort to determine the nature of meteor
showers and improve automated methods, it was decided to tackle the problem of
synthetic meteoroid orbit generation, the main goal being to reproduce the
underlying structure and the statistics of the observed data in the synthetic
orbits.
  Methods. A new method of generating synthetic meteoroid orbits using the
Kernel Density Estimation method is presented. Several types of approaches are
recommended, depending on whether one strives to preserve the data structure,
the data statistics or to have a compromise between the two.
  Results. The improvements over the existing methods of synthetic orbit
generation are demonstrated. The comparison between the previous and newly
developed methods are given, as well as the visualization tools one can use to
estimate the influence of different input parameters on the final data.

becoming increasingly precise. However, there may be significant bias and
scatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called
mass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong
lenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet
transformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting
lenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%
with an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a
different simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing
observables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not
detect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or
observational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens
configuration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate
estimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased
low (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced $\chi^2 > 1$,
a power-law dependence of the $\chi^2$ on the lens environment (number of
nearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two
double lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias,
suggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking
into account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.

of the self-information (i.e. the logarithm) and the inverse of the Lambert $W$
function. It means that we consider that Shannon entropy has the trace form:
$-k \sum_{i} W^{-1} \circ \mathsf{ln}(p_{i})$. Based on this remark we define a
generalized entropy which has as a limit the Shannon entropy. In order to
facilitate the reasoning this generalized entropy is obtained by a
one-parameter deformation of the logarithmic function.
  Introducing a new concept of independence of two systems the Shannon
additivity is replaced by a non-commutative and non-associative law which limit
is the usual addition. The main properties associated with the generalized
entropy are established, particularly those corresponding to statistical
ensembles. The Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered as a limit. The
connection with thermodynamics is also studied. We also provide a guideline for
systematically defining a deformed algebra which limit is the classical linear
algebra. As an illustrative example we study a generalized entropy based on
Tsallis self-information. We point out possible connections between deformed
algebra and fuzzy logics. Finally, noticing that the new concept of
independence is based on t-norm the one-parameter deformation of the logarithm
is interpreted as an additive generator of t-norms.

investigation of the effect of selecting and activating seed nodes in multiple
phases. Specifically, we study diffusion in two phases assuming the
well-studied independent cascade model. First, we formulate an objective
function for two-phase diffusion, investigate its properties, and propose
efficient algorithms for finding seed nodes in the two phases. Next, we study
two associated problems: (1) budget splitting which seeks to optimally split
the total budget between the two phases and (2) scheduling which seeks to
determine an optimal delay after which to commence the second phase. Our main
conclusions include: (a) under strict temporal constraints, use single phase
diffusion, (b) under moderate temporal constraints, use two-phase diffusion
with a short delay while allocating most of the budget to the first phase, and
(c) when there are no temporal constraints, use two-phase diffusion with a long
delay while allocating roughly one-third of the budget to the first phase.

fluctuations of CdTe films deposited on polymeric substrates, based on a huge
spatio-temporal surface sampling acquired through atomic force microscopy. A
\textit{pseudo}-steady state (where average surface roughness and spatial
correlations stay constant in time) is observed at initial times, persisting up
to deposition of $\sim 10^{4}$ monolayers. This state results from a fine
balance between roughening and smoothening, as supported by a phenomenological
growth model. KPZ statistics arises at long times, thoroughly verified by
universal exponents, spatial covariance and several distributions. Recent
theoretical generalizations of the Family-Vicsek scaling and the emergence of
log-normal distributions during interface growth are experimentally confirmed.
These results confirm that high vacuum vapor deposition of CdTe constitutes a
genuine 2D-KPZ system, and expand our knowledge about possible

transformations; they are defined by high speed collective displacements of the
atoms, the existence of a parent/daughter orientation relationship, and plate
or lath morphologies. The current crystallographic models of deformation
twinning in metals are based on the 150 year-old concept of simple shear. For
martensitic transformations, a generalized version of simple shear called
invariant plane strain takes into account the volume change; it is associated
with one or two simple shears in the phenomenological theory of martensitic
crystallography built more than 60 years ago. As simple shears would involve
unrealistic stresses, dislocation/disconnection-mediated versions of the usual
crystallographic models of displacive transformations have been developed over
the last decades. However, fundamental questions remain unsolved. How do the
atoms move? How could dislocations be created and propagate in a coordinated
way at the speed of sound? In order to solve these issues an approach that is
not based on simple shear nor on dislocation/disconnection has been applied to
different displacive transformations over the last years. It assumes that the
atoms are hard-spheres, which permits for any specific orientation relationship
to determine the atomics trajectories, the lattice distortion and shuffling (if
required) as analytical functions of a unique angular parameter. The aim of the
present paper is to give a brief historical review of the current models based

Trefftz type approaches and discusses the interrelationship between various
concepts of the displacement, hybrid and Trefftz methods. The basic concept of
the displacement version of the reduced Trefftz method operates on the natural
boundary conditions enforced in an integral form whereas the stress version of
the reduced Trefftz type approach operates on the essential boundary conditions
enforced in an integral sense. The application of the method proposed in the
framework of the finite element method is briefly outlined. The methods used by
the reduced Trefftz type approach for enforcing conformity and interelement
continuity between neighboured elements are also discussed. Comparisons with
other known methods for the same purpose are performed. General strategy for
developing finite elements of general geometric form such as quadrilateral
elements with invariance properties is presented. The basic idea of this
strategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the
element geometry and performing the element integration in the biunit interval.
For defining the approximation functions a local coordinate system defined from
the directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular
contravariant base vectors computed in the geometric centre of the element is
used. This strategy can also be used to implement other versions of finite
elements and other forms of finite elements. Different numerical calculations
and comparisons in the linear statics and kinetics are performed in order to
assess the convergence and the numerical performance of finite elements
developed by applying the reduced Trefftz type approach.

combine the features of concurrent transformation of multiple variables in each
elementary reaction event, and nonlinear relations between states and their
rates of change. Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted
cases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes value 0 or
1. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for
stochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the case of the mass-action
rate law, that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of
factorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of
high-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation
reduces solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a
heat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate
between low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated
separately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-0 networks, and
connected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable
or metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the
starting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments,
reversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies. A basis for a
subset of network flows defined by having the same mean-regressing property as
the flows in deficiency-0 networks gives the leading contribution to low-order
moments in CRNs at general deficiency, in a $1/n$-expansion in large particle
numbers. Our results give a physical picture of the different informational
roles of mean-regressing and non-mean-regressing flows, and clarify the
dynamical meaning of deficiency not only for first-moment conditions but for
all orders in fluctuations.

thus observations of a nearby pair-instability supernova would allow us to test

be sought within the electromagnetic radiation we detect from such a supernova

contain unique signatures of the event that unambiguously identify this type of

periods and determine timing solutions relying on the timing of their
individual pulses, while some of the less sporadic RRATs can be timed by using
folding techniques as we do for other pulsars. Here, based on Parkes and Green
Bank Telescope (GBT) observations, we introduce our results on eight RRATs
including their timing-derived rotation parameters, positions, and dispersion
measures (DMs), along with a comparison of the spin-down properties of RRATs
and normal pulsars. Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period
derivatives are generally larger than those of normal pulsars, independent of
any intrinsic correlation with period, indicating that RRATs' highly sporadic
emission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields. We carry
out Lomb$-$Scargle tests to search for periodicities in RRATs' pulse detection
times with long timescales. Periodicities are detected for all targets, with
significant candidates of roughly 3.4 hr for PSR J1623$-$0841 and 0.7 hr for
PSR J1839$-$0141. We also analyze their single-pulse amplitude distributions,
finding that log-normal distributions provide the best fits, as is the case for
most pulsars. However, several RRATs exhibit power-law tails, as seen for
pulsars emitting giant pulses. This, along with consideration of the selection
effects against the detection of weak pulses, imply that RRAT pulses generally
represent the tail of a normal intensity distribution.

relations in quantum mechanics (QM) (where they are fixed and
field-independent), and in general relativity (where they are field-dependent
and dynamic). This paper aims to attenuate that friction, by encoding gravity
in the timeless configuration space of spatial fields with dynamics given by a
path integral. The framework demands that boundary conditions for this path
integral be uniquely given, but unlike other approaches where they are
prescribed --- such as the no-boundary and the tunneling proposals --- here I
postulate basic principles to identify boundary conditions in a large class of
theories. Uniqueness arises only if a reduced configuration space can be
defined and if it has a profoundly asymmetric fundamental structure. These
requirements place strong restrictions on the field and symmetry content of
theories encompassed here; shape dynamics is one such theory. Also as in other
boundary proposals, Time, including space-time, emerges as an effective
concept; valid for certain curves in configuration space but not assumed from
the start. When some such notion of time becomes available, conservation of
(positive) probability currents ensues. I show that, in the appropriate limits,
a Schroedinger equation dictates the evolution of weakly coupled source fields
on a classical gravitational background. Due to the asymmetry of reduced
configuration space, these probabilities and currents avoid a known difficulty
of standard WKB approximations for Wheeler DeWitt in minisuperspace: the
selection of a unique Hamilton-Jacobi solution to serve as background. I
illustrate these constructions with a simple example of a full quantum
gravitational theory (i.e. not in minisuperspace) for which the formalism is
applicable, and give a formula for calculating gravitational semi-classical
relative probabilities in it.

such a framework, by first analyzing in detail a case study of the construction

namely qualitative interview analysis and quantitative citation network

knowledge entreprises as perspectives, with co-evolving components within
complementary knowledge domains. We finally discuss potential applications and

electronically complex and often have large data storage requirements to
process element level data. Recently, the concept of a single-pixel-imager has
garnered interest in the electromagnetics literature due to it's ability to
form high quality images with a single receiver paired with shaped aperture
screens that allow for the collection of spatially orthogonal measurements.
Here, we present a method for creating an acoustic analog to the
single-pixel-imager found in electromagnetics. Additionally, diffraction is
considered to account for screen openings comparable to the acoustic
wavelength. A diffraction model is presented and incorporated into the single
pixel framework. The method is experimentally validated with laboratory
measurements made in air.

covariant, this paper gives a general relativistic covariant Lagrangian of
superfluid systems, and naturally finds the non-relativistic Lagrangian and its
all corresponding theories after making approximations. The equation of motion
obtained from the old non-relativistic Lagrangian density is not complete, it
lost some important terms. The new deduced equation can be approximated to the
old equations of motion, the new momentum and energy can return to the old
expressions of superfluid systems under some conditions, and the energy and
momentum from the general Lagrangian density is accurate, no ignoring some
terms. This paper reveals that the current classical superfluid Lagrangian
density is only an approximation Lagrangian density under conditions: the
scalar field is inverse proportional to its complex conjugate field and the
square of time derivative of scalar field logarithm approximates to zero. This
paper deduces that the divergence of velocity field is zero under classic
superfluid, gives two different expressions of Lagrangian, gets the same
equation, and finds its solutions. Using two different Lagrangian densities,
this paper obtains different forces. Therefore, this paper discovers a general,
fundamental and real physics symmetry Lagrangian deducing the real physics
equation of the superfluid, and further discover the symmetry breaking
processes and the special conditions from the general Lagrangian to the special
Lagrangian. This paper gives both superfluid theory of scalar field and
comparing investigations with its corresponding theory of quantum mechanics.

  Single-Price Balancing Market",,,"10.3390/en11061345",,"q-fin.GN q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the limited predictability of wind power and other stochastic
generation, trading this energy in competitive electricity markets is
challenging. This paper derives revenue-maximising and risk-constrained
strategies for stochastic generators participating in electricity markets with
a single-price balancing mechanism. Starting from the optimal---and
impractical---strategy of offering zero or nominal power, which exposes the
participant to potentially large imbalance costs, we develop a number of
strategies that control risk by hedging against penalising balancing prices in
favour of rewarding ones. Trading strategies are formulated in a probabilistic
framework in order to address asymmetry in balancing prices. The large-scale
communication of system information characteristic of modern power systems is
utilised to inputs for electricity price forecasts and probabilistic system
length forecasts. A case study using data from the GB market in the UK is
presented and the ability of the proposed strategies to increase revenue and
reduce risk is demonstrated and analysed.
