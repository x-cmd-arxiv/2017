with the stringent limits from observed nucleon stability. Scalar leptoquark
$S_3$ with left-handed couplings to 2nd and 3rd generations of charged leptons
and down-type quarks seems well-suited to address both $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and
$R_{D^{(*)}}$. We quantify this suitability with numerical fits to a plethora
of relevant flavor observables. The proposed $SU(5)$ model calls for a second
leptoquark state, i.e., $\tilde{R}_2$ with quantum numbers
$(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2},1/6)$, if one is to generate gauge coupling unification
and neutrino mass. We accordingly include it in our study to investigate
$\tilde{R}_2$'s ability to offset adverse effects of $S_3$ and thus improve a
quality of numerical fits. A global fit of the leptoquark Yukawa couplings
shows that large couplings of light $S_3$ to $\tau$ leptons are preferred. We
furthermore identify $B \to K^{(*)} \bar\nu\nu$ as the most sensitive channel
to probe the preferred region of parameter space. Large couplings of $S_3$ to
$\tau$ leptons are finally confronted with the experimental searches for $\tau$

atomic Zeeman states, while the atom's vibrational states in the trap represent
the bosonic mode. The coupling is mediated by a suitable fictitious magnetic
field pattern. We show that all important system parameters, i.e., the

Starobinsky-type model with concave inflation potential is favored over the
convex-type chaotic inflation. Is there any reason for that? Here we argue that
if our universe began with a Euclidean wormhole, then the Starobinsky-type
inflation is probabilistically favored. It is known that for a more generic
choice of parameters than that originally assumed by Hartle and Hawking, the
Hartle-Hawking wave function is dominated by Euclidean wormholes, which can be
interpreted as the creation of two classical universes from nothing. We show
that only one end of the wormhole can be classicalized for a convex potential,
while both ends can be classicalized for a concave potential. The latter is
therefore more probable.

make the difference between succeeding and failing, even between life and
death. At different scales, this applies to molecular encounters in the cell
cytoplasm, to animals looking for food or mates in natural landscapes, to
rescuers during search-and-rescue operations in disaster zones, as well as to
genetic computer algorithms exploring parameter spaces. When looking for sparse
targets in a homogeneous environment, a combination of ballistic and diffusive
steps is considered optimal; in particular, more ballistic L\'evy flights with
exponent {\alpha} <= 1 are generally believed to optimize the search process.
However, most search spaces present complex topographies, with boundaries,
barriers and obstacles. What is the best search strategy in these more
realistic scenarios? Here we show that the topography of the environment
significantly alters the optimal search strategy towards less ballistic and
more Brownian strategies. We consider an active particle performing a blind
search in a two-dimensional space with steps drawn from a L\'evy distribution
with exponent varying from {\alpha} = 1 to {\alpha} = 2 (Brownian). We
demonstrate that the optimal search strategy depends on the topography of the
environment, with {\alpha} assuming intermediate values in the whole range
under consideration. We interpret these findings in terms of a simple
theoretical model, and discuss their robustness to the addition of Brownian
diffusion to the searcher's motion. Our results are relevant for search
problems at different length scales, from animal and human foraging to
microswimmers' taxis, to biochemical rates of reaction.

between discrete states. Starting from an individual-based model we derive
stochastic differential equations to describe the dynamics, and obtain
analytical expressions for the mean instantaneous growth rates based on the

heterogeneity than in the case of deterministic periodic environments, net
growth rates tend to be higher under stochastic environmental dynamics. The
combined system of environment and population of cells can be interpreted as
host-pathogen interaction, in which the host tries to choose environmental

in the universe. However, the central wavelengths of almost all DIBs do not
correspond with electronic transitions of known atomic or molecular species and
the specific physical nature of their carriers remains inconclusive despite
decades of observational, theoretical, and experimental research. It is well
established that DIB carriers are located in the interstellar medium, but the
recent discovery of time-varying DIBs in the spectra of the extragalactic
supernova SN2012ap suggests that some may be created in massive star
environments. Here we report evidence of short time-scale (10-60 d) changes in
DIB absorption line substructure toward 3 of 17 massive stars observed as part
of a pathfinder survey of variable DIBs conducted with the 1.5-m Tillinghast

(R = 44000) having signal-to-noise ratios of 5-15 around the 5797 and 6614

investigation. We find that these changes are potentially consistent with
interactions between stellar winds and DIB carriers in close proximity. Our
findings motivate a larger survey to further characterize these variations and
may establish a powerful new method for probing the poorly understood physical
characteristics of DIB carriers.

pulsations. These pulsations provide information on the global and structural
parameters of the star. The pulsation periods range from seconds to years,
depending on the compactness of the star and properties of the matter that
forms its outer layers. Here, we report the discovery of more than a dozen of
previously unknown short-period variable stars: blue large-amplitude pulsators.
These objects show very regular brightness variations with periods in the range
of 20-40 min and amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in the optical passbands. The phased
light curves have a characteristic sawtooth shape, similar to the shape of
classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae-type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode.
The objects are significantly bluer than main sequence stars observed in the
same fields, which indicates that all of them are hot stars. Follow-up
spectroscopy confirms a high surface temperature of about 30,000 K. Temperature
and colour changes over the cycle prove the pulsational nature of the
variables. However, large-amplitude pulsations at such short periods are not
observed in any known type of stars, including hot objects. Long-term
photometric observations show that the variable stars are very stable over
time. Derived rates of period change are of the order of 10^-7 per year and, in
most cases, they are positive. According to pulsation theory, such
large-amplitude oscillations may occur in evolved low-mass stars that have
inflated helium-enriched envelopes. The evolutionary path that could lead to
such stellar configurations remains unknown.

given in terms of the square root of a matrix which is in general nonunique and

further constrains the allowed metrics to admit compatible notions of space and

second-neighbor $J_2$ antiferromagnetic couplings on the honeycomb lattice. We
perform a systematic comparison of magnetically ordered and nonmagnetic states

diagram. N\'eel order is stabilized for small values of the frustrating
second-neighbor coupling. Increasing the ratio $J_2/J_1$, we find strong
evidence for a continuous transition to a nonmagnetic phase at $J_2/J_1 \approx
0.23$. Close to the transition point, the Gutzwiller-projected uniform
resonating valence bond state gives an excellent approximation to the exact
ground-state energy. For $0.23 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.4$, a gapless $Z_2$
spin liquid with Dirac nodes competes with a plaquette valence-bond solid. In
contrast, the gapped spin liquid considered in previous works has significantly
higher variational energy. Although the plaquette valence-bond order is
expected to be present as soon as the N\'eel order melts, this ordered state
becomes clearly favored only for $J_2/J_1 \gtrsim 0.3$. Finally, for $0.36
\lesssim J_2/J_1 \le 0.5$, a valence-bond solid with columnar order takes over
as the ground state, being also lower in energy than the magnetic state with
collinear order. We perform a detailed finite-size scaling and standard data
collapse analysis, and we discuss the possibility of a deconfined quantum
critical point separating the N\'eel antiferromagnet from the plaquette
valence-bond solid.

we simulate a mock cluster that resembles MACS J0416.1-2403 in order to explore
the effects of line-of-sight structures on cluster mass modelling. By
systematically analysing the mock cluster under different model assumptions, we
find that neglecting the lensing environment has a significant impact on the
reconstruction of image positions (rms ~0.3""); accounting for line-of-sight
galaxies as if they were at the cluster redshift can partially reduce this
offset. Moreover, foreground galaxies are more important to include into the
model than the background ones. While the magnification factors of the lensed
multiple images are recovered within ~10% for ~95% of them, those ~5% that lie
near critical curves can be significantly affected by the exclusion of the
lensing environment in the models (up to a factor of ~200). In addition,
line-of-sight galaxies cannot explain the apparent discrepancy in the
properties of massive subhalos between MACS J0416.1-2403 and N-body simulated

reduced modestly the rms offset in the image positions, we conclude that

electromagnetic spectrum, and physical parameters of GRB jets and their
surroundings have been derived using broadband modeling. While well-sampled
lightcurves across the broadband spectrum are necessary to constrain all the
physical parameters, some can be strongly constrained by the right combination
of just a few observables, almost independently of the other unknowns. We
present a method involving the peaks of radio lightcurves to constrain the
fraction of shock energy that resides in electrons, $\epsilon_e$. This
parameter is an important ingredient for understanding the microphysics of
relativistic shocks; Based on a sample of 36 radio afterglows, we find
$\epsilon_e$ has a narrow distribution centered around $0.13-0.15$. Our method
is suggested as a diagnostic tool for determining $\epsilon_e$, and to help
constrain the broadband modeling of GRB afterglows. Some earlier measurements
of the spreads in parameter values for $\epsilon_e$, the kinetic energy of the
shock, and the density of the circumburst medium, based on broadband modeling
across the entire spectrum, are at odds with our analysis of radio peaks. This
could be due to different modeling methods and assumptions, and possibly
missing ingredients in past and current modeling efforts. Furthermore, we show
that observations at $\gtrsim10$~GHz performed $0.3-30$ days after the GRB
trigger, are best suited for pinpointing the synchrotron peak frequency, and
consequently $\epsilon_e$. At the same time, observations at lower radio
frequencies can pin down the synchrotron self-absorption frequency and help
constrain the other physical parameters of GRB afterglows.

identifying close friends and family (i.e., strong ties) can typically be done
reliably, listing all of one's acquaintances (i.e., weak ties) is subject to
error due to respondent fatigue. This issue is commonly circumvented through
the use of so-called ""fixed choice"" surveys where respondents are asked to name
a fixed, small number of their weak ties (e.g., two or ten). Of course, the
resulting crude observed network will omit many ties, and using this crude
network to infer properties of the network, such as its degree distribution or
clustering coefficient, will lead to biased estimates. This paper develops
estimators, based on the method of moments, for a number of network
characteristics including those related to the first and second moments of the
degree distribution as well as the network size, using fixed-choice survey
data. Experiments with simulated data illustrate that the proposed estimators
perform well across a variety of network topologies and measurement scenarios,
and the resulting estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained
directly using the crude observed network, which are commonly used in the
literature. We also describe a variation of the Jackknife procedure that can be
used to obtain an estimate of the estimator variance.

location-based services (LBS) have gained in popularity. Nowadays, an
increasingly larger number of map-based applications enable users to ask a
wider variety of queries. Researchers have studied the ride-sharing, the
carpooling, the vehicle routing, and the collective travel planning problems
extensively in recent years. Collective traveling has the benefit of being
environment-friendly by reducing the global travel cost, the greenhouse gas
emission, and the energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce several
optimization problems to recommend a suitable route and stops of a vehicle, in
a road network, for a group of users intending to travel collectively. The goal
of each problem is to minimize the aggregate cost of the individual travelers'
paths and the shared route under various constraints. First, we formulate the
problem of determining the optimal pair of end-stops, given a set of queries
that originate and terminate near the two prospective end regions. We outline a
baseline polynomial-time algorithm and propose a new faster solution - both
calculating an exact answer. In our approach, we utilize the path-coherence
property of road networks to develop an efficient algorithm. Second, we define
the problem of calculating the optimal route and intermediate stops of a
vehicle that picks up and drops off passengers en-route, given its start and
end stoppages, and a set of path queries from users. We outline an exact
solution of both time and space complexities exponential in the number of
queries. Then, we propose a novel polynomial-time-and-space heuristic algorithm
that performs reasonably well in practice. We also analyze several variants of
this problem under different constraints. Last, we perform extensive
experiments that demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms.

while the formation as a whole globally tracks a desired trajectory. The
control law is first designed at the kinematic level and then extended to the

the equations of motion. These uncertainties are accounted for by employing an
adaptive control scheme. The proposed formation maneuvering controls are

start, i.e., each node may start running the algorithm in a different round.
Inactive nodes transmit only heartbeats, which contain no information but can
be detected by active nodes. We make no assumption on the way the nodes are
awakened, except that for each node u there is a time $s_u$ in which it is
awakened and starts to run the algorithm. The identities of the nodes are not
mutually known, and the network size is unknown as well.
  We present synchronization algorithms, which guarantee that after a finite
number of rounds, all nodes hold the same round number, which is incremented by
one each round thereafter. We study the time complexity and message size
required for synchronization, and specifically for simultaneous
synchronization, in which all nodes synchronize their round numbers at exactly
the same round.
  We show that there is a strong relation between the complexity of
simultaneous synchronization and the connectivity of the dynamic graphs: With
high connectivity which guarantees that messages can be broadcasted in a
constant number of rounds, simultaneous synchronization by all nodes can be
obtained by a deterministic algorithm within a constant number of rounds, and
with messages of constant size. With a weaker connectivity, which only
guarantees that the broadcast time is proportional to the network size, our
algorithms still achieve simultaneous synchronization, but within linear time
and long messages.
  We also discuss how information on the network size and randomization may
improve synchronization algorithms, and show related impossibility results.

efficient polynomial-time approximation algorithms are devised to tackle this

algorithm based on rank-one updates. Several theoretical fundamental limits on
the best achievable performance for the combinatorial problem is derived that
assist us to evaluate optimality gaps of our proposed algorithms. A detailed

This prescription for adding thermal velocities introduces numerical noise into
the initial conditions, which influences structure formation. At early times,
the noise affects dramatically the power spectra measured from simulations with
thermal velocities, with deviations of the order of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ (in
the matter power spectra) and of the order of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2)$ (in the

deviations of less than a few percent. Increasing the resolution of the N-body
simulation shifts these discrepancies to higher wavenumbers. We also find that
spurious haloes start to appear in simulations which include thermal velocities
at a mass that is $\sim$3 times larger than in simulations without thermal

parameterized by the number of paths by giving a practical linear fpt

Crucially, our solver finds exact solutions while achieving runtimes
competitive with a state-of-the-art heuristic. Finally, we contextualize our
design choices with two hardness results related to preprocessing and weight
recovery. Specifically, $k$-Flow Decomposition does not admit polynomial
kernels under standard complexity assumptions, and the related problem of
assigning (known) weights to a given set of paths is NP-hard.

translates to proportional performance gains. Specifically, for convolutional
layers LM's execution time scales inversely proportionally with the precisions
of both weights and activations. For fully-connected layers LM's performance
scales inversely proportionally with the precision of the weights. LM targets
area- and bandwidth-constrained System-on-a-Chip designs such as those found on
mobile devices that cannot afford the multi-megabyte buffers that would be
needed to store each layer on-chip. Accordingly, given a data bandwidth budget,
LM boosts energy efficiency and performance over an equivalent bit-parallel
accelerator. For both weights and activations LM can exploit profile-derived
perlayer precisions. However, at runtime LM further trims activation precisions
at a much smaller than a layer granularity. Moreover, it can naturally exploit
weight precision variability at a smaller granularity than a layer. On average,
across several image classification CNNs and for a configuration that can
perform the equivalent of 128 16b x 16b multiply-accumulate operations per
cycle LM outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator [1] by 4.38x
without any loss in accuracy while being 3.54x more energy efficient. LM can
trade-off accuracy for additional improvements in execution performance and
energy efficiency and compares favorably to an accelerator that targeted only
activation precisions. We also study 2- and 4-bit LM variants and find the the
2-bit per cycle variant is the most energy efficient.

trained for the subtasks, and the predictions of these networks are
subsequently used as additional features when training a model and doing
inference for a final task. In this work, we focus on improving learning for
such hierarchical models and demonstrate our method on the task of speaker
trait prediction. Speaker trait prediction aims to computationally identify
which personality traits a speaker might be perceived to have, and has been of

persuasive speakers have a large amount of influence on our thoughts, opinions

that have been applied to the lensed Cosmic Microwave Background, and which
have also been proposed for application to spectral data from 21cm radio
telescopes. As with 21cm data, the forest has the advantage of spectral
information, potentially yielding many lensed ""slices"" at different redshifts.
We perform an illustrative idealized test, generating a high resolution angular
grid of quasars (of order arcminute separation), and lensing the
Lyman-alphaforest spectra at redshifts z=2-3 using a foreground density field.
We find that standard quadratic estimators can be used to reconstruct images of
the foreground mass distribution at z~1. There currently exists a wealth of Lya
forest data from quasar and galaxy spectral surveys, with smaller sightline
separations expected in the future. Lyman-alpha forest lensing is sensitive to
the foreground mass distribution at redshifts intermediate between CMB lensing
and galaxy shear, and avoids the difficulties of shape measurement associated
with the latter. With further refinement and application of mass reconstruction
techniques, weak gravitational lensing of the high redshift Lya forest may
become a useful new cosmological probe.

functions. The main effect with environment is that central galaxies (and in
one model also the satellites) in denser regions start populating lower-mass
halos. A similar, but significantly stronger, trend exists with halo age, where
early-forming halos are more likely to host central galaxies at lower halo
mass. We discuss the origin of these trends and the connection to the stellar
mass -- halo mass relation. We find that, at fixed halo mass, older halos and
to some extent also halos in dense environments tend to host more massive
galaxies. Additionally, we see a reverse trend for the satellite galaxies
occupation where early-forming halos have fewer satellites, likely due to
having more time for them to merge with the central galaxy. We describe these
occupancy variations also in terms of the changes in the occupation function
parameters, which can aid in constructing realistic mock galaxy catalogs.
Finally, we study the corresponding galaxy auto- and cross-correlation
functions of the different samples and elucidate the impact of assembly bias on

lack of commutativity between the pairs of subalgebras. Given a maximally

Energy Survey (DES) imaging, which provide light curves spanning more than 15
years. We identified ~1000 EVQs with a maximum g band magnitude change of more
than 1 mag over this period, about 10% of all quasars searched. The EVQs have
L_bol~10^45-10^47 erg/s and L/L_Edd~0.01-1. Accounting for selection effects,
we estimate an intrinsic EVQ fraction of ~30-50% among all g<~22 quasars over a
baseline of ~15 years. These EVQs are good candidates for so-called
""changing-look quasars"", where a spectral transition between the two types of
quasars (broad-line and narrow-line) is observed between the dim and bright
states. We performed detailed multi-wavelength, spectral and variability
analyses for the EVQs and compared to their parent quasar sample. We found that
EVQs are distinct from a control sample of quasars matched in redshift and
optical luminosity: (1) their UV broad emission lines have larger equivalent
widths; (2) their Eddington ratios are systematically lower; and (3) they are
more variable on all timescales. The intrinsic difference in quasar properties
for EVQs suggest that internal processes associated with accretion are the main
driver for the observed extreme long-term variability. However, despite their
different properties, EVQs seem to be in the tail of a continuous distribution
of quasar properties, rather than standing out as a distinct population. We
speculate that EVQs are normal quasars accreting at relatively low accretion
rates, where the accretion flow is more likely to experience instabilities that
drive the factor of few changes in flux on multi-year timescales.

tackle this issue by first establishing a connection between the loss functions

are defined on links while major computation burdens are located at nodes. We
call this type of loss functions ""graph-based"" loss functions, for which varied
mini-batch sampling strategies can have different computational costs. Based on
the insight, three novel sampling strategies are proposed, which can
significantly improve the training efficiency of the proposed framework (up to
$\times 30$ times speedup in our experiments), as well as improving the
recommendation performance. Theoretical analysis is also provided for both the
computational cost and the convergence. We believe the study of sampling
strategies have further implications on general graph-based loss functions, and
would also enable more research under the neural network-based recommendation

practice, these methods are effective even for high-dimensional datasets. Their
practical success motivates our analysis of the function rank, an upper bound
of the matrix rank. In this paper, we consider radial basis functions (RBF),
approximate the RBF kernel with a low-rank representation that is a finite sum
of separate products and provide explicit upper bounds on the function rank and
the $L_\infty$ error for such approximations. Our three main results are as
follows. First, for a fixed precision, the function rank of RBFs, in the worst
case, grows polynomially with the data dimension. Second, precise error bounds
for the low-rank approximations in the $L_\infty$ norm are derived in terms of
the function smoothness and the domain diameters. Finally, a group pattern in
the magnitude of singular values for RBF kernel matrices is observed and
analyzed, and is explained by a grouping of the expansion terms in the kernel's
low-rank representation. Empirical results verify the theoretical results.

The RC system consists of a random fixed-weight RNN (the input-hidden reservoir

sequence learning problem, and we explore a different approach to RC. More
specifically, we remove the non-linear neural activation function, and we

converges strongly to the superposition of the solution to the ideal MHD

difficulties is to deal with the effect of the difference between viscosity and

from the Dirichlet boundary conditions for both the viscosity and the magnetic

identify here, there exist cancelations between the boundary layers of the
velocity field and that of the magnetic fields so that one can use an elaborate
energy method to take advantage this special structure. In addition, in the

estimators for high-dimensional linear regressions in which the number of

studies have examined the properties of the estimators when the errors and/or
the covariates are serially dependent. In this study, we investigate the
theoretical properties of the Lasso estimator for a linear regression with a
random design and weak sparsity under serially dependent and/or nonsubGaussian
errors and covariates. In contrast to the traditional case, in which the errors
are independent and identically distributed and have finite exponential
moments, we show that $p$ can be at most a power of $n$ if the errors have only
finite polynomial moments. In addition, the rate of convergence becomes slower
owing to the serial dependence in the errors and the covariates. We also
consider the sign consistency of the model selection using the Lasso estimator
when there are serial correlations in the errors or the covariates, or both.
Adopting the framework of a functional dependence measure, we describe how the
rates of convergence and the selection consistency of the estimators depend on
the dependence measures and moment conditions of the errors and the covariates.
Simulation results show that a Lasso regression can be significantly more
powerful than a mixed-frequency data sampling regression (MIDAS) and a Dantzig
selector in the presence of irrelevant variables. We apply the results obtained
for the Lasso method to nowcasting with mixed-frequency data, in which serially
correlated errors and a large number of covariates are common. The empirical
results show that the Lasso procedure outperforms the MIDAS regression and the
autoregressive model with exogenous variables in terms of both forecasting and
nowcasting.

(TRVB): given a multigraph $G$ some of whose vertices are marked ""breakable,""
is it possible to convert $G$ into a tree via a sequence of ""vertex-breaking""
operations (replacing a degree-$k$ breakable vertex by $k$ degree-$1$ vertices,
disconnecting the $k$ incident edges)?
  We characterize the computational complexity of TRVB with any combination of
the following additional constraints: $G$ must be planar, $G$ must be a simple
graph, the degree of every breakable vertex must belong to an allowed list $B$,
and the degree of every unbreakable vertex must belong to an allowed list $U$.
The two results which we expect to be most generally applicable are that (1)
TRVB is polynomially solvable when breakable vertices are restricted to have
degree at most $3$; and (2) for any $k \ge 4$, TRVB is NP-complete when the
given multigraph is restricted to be planar and to consist entirely of
degree-$k$ breakable vertices. To demonstrate the use of TRVB, we give a simple
proof of the known result that Hamiltonicity in max-degree-$3$ square grid
graphs is NP-hard.
  We also demonstrate a connection between TRVB and the Hypergraph Spanning
Tree problem. This connection allows us to show that the Hypergraph Spanning
Tree problem in $k$-uniform $2$-regular hypergraphs is NP-complete for any $k

digitized radio intensity data in the time domain and its capability to perform
off-line spectral analysis of the radio spectra. The analog signals received
via antennas and amplified with a low-noise amplifier are converted into
digital data at a speed reaching up to 32 k data points per millisecond. The
digital data are then saved into a high-speed electronic disk for further
off-line spectral analysis. Using different word length (1 k - 32 k) and time
cadence (5 ms - 10 s) for the off-line fast Fourier transform analysis, we can
obtain the dynamic spectrum of a radio burst with different (user-defined)
temporal (5 ms - 10 s) and spectral (3 kHz ~ 320 kHz) resolution. This brings a
great flexibility and convenience to data analysis of solar radio bursts,
especially when some specific fine spectral structures are under study.

Likelihood (ML) for all possible Shannon Channels or uncertain rules of
choosing hypotheses, so that we have to use iterative methods. According to the
Semantic Mutual Information (SMI) and R(G) function proposed by Chenguang Lu
(1993) (where R(G) is an extension of information rate distortion function
R(D), and G is the lower limit of the SMI), we can obtain a new iterative
algorithm of solving the MMI and ML for tests, estimations, and mixture models.
The SMI is defined by the average log normalized likelihood. The likelihood
function is produced from the truth function and the prior by semantic Bayesian
inference. A group of truth functions constitute a semantic channel. Letting
the semantic channel and Shannon channel mutually match and iterate, we can
obtain the Shannon channel that maximizes the Shannon mutual information and
the average log likelihood. This iterative algorithm is called Channels'
Matching algorithm or the CM algorithm. The convergence can be intuitively
explained and proved by the R(G) function. Several iterative examples for
tests, estimations, and mixture models show that the computation of the CM
algorithm is simple (which can be demonstrated in excel files). For most random
examples, the numbers of iterations for convergence are close to 5. For mixture
models, the CM algorithm is similar to the EM algorithm; however, the CM
algorithm has better convergence and more potential applications in comparison
with the standard EM algorithm.

employing a recently developed non-singular boundary integral method to solve

The non-singular boundary integral solution can enforce the radiation boundary
condition at infinity exactly and can account for multiple scattering effects
at all spacings between scatterers without adverse effects on the numerical
precision. More generally, the absence of singular kernels in the non-singular
integral equation confers high numerical stability and precision for smaller
numbers of degrees of freedom. The use of fast Fourier transform to obtain the

efficient for studying the response to different incident pulses by the same

one of the consequences, we prove a non-linear analog of Bogolubov's theorem --

is ubiquitous in diamond science and technology, since the presence of charge
traps in the active regions of different classes of diamond-based devices
(detectors, power diodes, transistors) can significantly affect their
performances, due to the formation of space charge, memory effects and the
degradation of the electronic response associated with radiation damage. Among

over limited interfaces which provide lookup access to the tuples matching a
given binding, but possibly restricting the number of output tuples returned.
Interfaces imposing such ""result bounds"" are common in accessing data via the
web. Given a query over a set of relations as well as some integrity
constraints that relate the queried relations to the data sources, we examine
the problem of deciding if the query is answerable over the interfaces; that
is, whether there exists a plan that returns all answers to the query, assuming
the source data satisfies the integrity constraints.
  The first component of our analysis of answerability is a reduction to a
query containment problem with constraints. The second component is a set of
""schema simplification"" theorems capturing limitations on how interfaces with
result bounds can be useful to obtain complete answers to queries. These
results also help to show decidability for the containment problem that
captures answerability, for many classes of constraints. The final component in
our analysis of answerability is a ""linearization"" method, showing that query
containment with certain guarded dependencies -- including those that emerge
from answerability problems -- can be reduced to query containment for a
well-behaved class of linear dependencies. Putting these components together,
we get a detailed picture of how to check answerability over result-bounded
services.

The
relationship between the cycle properties and global stellar parameters is not
fully understood yet.
  We searched for activity cycles in 90 solar-like stars with ages between 4
and 95 Myr aiming to investigate the properties of activity cycles in this age
range.
  We measured the length $P_{ cyc}$ of a given cycle by analyzing the long-term
time-series of three activity indexes. For each star, we computed also the
global magnetic activity index <IQR> that is proportional to the amplitude of
the rotational modulation and is a proxy of the mean level of the surface
magnetic activity. We detected activity cycles in 67 stars. Secondary cycles
were also detected in 32 stars. The lack of correlation between $P_{ cyc}$ and
$P_{ rot}$ suggest that these stars belong to the Transitional Branch and that
the dynamo acting in these stars is different from the solar one. This
statement is also supported by the analysis of the butterfly diagrams.
  We computed the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_{ S}$ between $P_{ cyc}$,
<IQR> and different stellar parameters. We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is
uncorrelated with all the investigated parameters. The <IQR> index is
positively correlated with the convective turn-over time-scale, the magnetic
diffusivity time-scale $\tau_{ diff}$, and the dynamo number $D_{ N}$, whereas
it is anti-correlated with the effective temperature $T_{ eff}$, the
photometric shear $\Delta\Omega_{\rm phot}$ and the radius $R_{ C}$ at which
the convective zone is located.
  We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is about constant and that <IQR> decreases with the
stellare age in the range 4-95 Myr. We investigated the magnetic activity of AB
Dor A by merging ASAS time-series with previous long-term photometric data. We
estimated the length of the AB Dor A primary cycle as $P_{ cyc} = 16.78 \pm 2

Then a scheme of two rules suffices to allow for logical retraction (deletion,

confluence result concerning the rule scheme and show its correctness. When

Logical retraction adds decrementality. Hence any algorithm written in CHR with

be removed at any point in the computation without compromising the correctness
of the result. We present two classical examples of dynamic algorithms, written

investigated. The most important ones for applications are specific classes of
(essentially) unitary boundary triples which guarantee that the Weyl functions
of boundary triples are Nevanlinna functions on ${\mathcal H}$, or at least
they belong to the class of Nevanlinna families. The boundary condition
$\Gamma_0f=0$ determines a reference operator $A_0$. The case where $A_0$ is
selfadjoint implies a relatively simple analysis, as the joint domain of the
trace mappings $\Gamma_0$ and $\Gamma_1$ admits a von Neumann type
decomposition. The case where $A_0$ is only essentially selfadjoint is more
involved, but appears to be of great importance, for instance, in applications
to PDEs and ODEs. Various classes of generalized boundary triples will be
characterized in purely analytic terms via the Weyl function $M$. These
characterizations involve solving direct and inverse problems for specific

specifies the analytic properties of $M$ which guarantee that $A_0$ is

computational power and storage capabilities in cloud environments we assisted
to the proliferation of new algorithms, methods, and approaches in two areas of
artificial intelligence: knowledge representation and machine learning. On the
one side, the generation of a high rate of structured data on the Web led to
the creation and publication of the so-called knowledge graphs. On the other
side, deep learning emerged as one of the most promising approaches in the
generation and training of models that can be applied to a wide variety of
application fields. More recently, autoencoders have proven their strength in
various scenarios, playing a fundamental role in unsupervised learning. In this
paper, we instigate how to exploit the semantic information encoded in a
knowledge graph to build connections between units in a Neural Network, thus
leading to a new method, SEM-AUTO, to extract and weigh semantic features that
can eventually be used to build a recommender system. As adding content-based
side information may mitigate the cold user problems, we tested how our

corresponds to a nondiagonal Drinfeld-Reshetikhin twist in the spin chain

still unclear despite many years of observational studies. The reason is that
the region is unresolved and the reverberation mapping results imply complex
velocity field. We adopt a theory-motivated approach to identify the principal
mechanism responsible for this complex phenomenon. We consider the possibility
that the role of dust is essential. We assume that the local radiation pressure
acting on the dust in the accretion disk atmosphere launches the outflow of
material, but higher above the disk the irradiation from the central parts
cause the dust evaporation and a subsequent fall back. This failed radiatively
accelerated dusty outflow (FRADO) is expected to represent the material forming
low ionization lines. In this paper we formulate simple analytical equations
describing the cloud motion, including the evaporation phase. The model is
fully described just by the basic parameters: black hole mass, accretion rate,
black hole spin and the viewing angle. We study how the spectral line generic
profiles correspond to this dynamics. We show that the virial factor calculated
from our model strongly depends on the black hole mass in case of enhanced dust
opacity, and thus it then correlates with the line width. This could explain
why the virial factor measured in galaxies with pseudo-bulges differs from that
obtained from objects with classical bulges although the trend predicted by the
current version of the model is opposite to the observed trend.

psychologically. They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people,
which may indicate that they can be influenced to seek for information given
their interest. For example, the game Pok\'emon GO spread rapidly because of
the aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information
propagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is
a dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our
model in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or
IC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world
networks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a
mean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of
macroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's
behavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the
mean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where
the information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it
spreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the
curiosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with
the spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial
networks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the
maximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition
point. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and
ideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling.
Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion
process and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.

functions by deriving conditions that imply their computability. We then apply
our results to study to the case of subshifts of finite type. We prove that
${\rm Rot}(\Phi)$ is computable and that ${\mathcal H}(w)$ is computable in the

specific issues of data citation.
  The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together
diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to
describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical (the
why and what) and the practical (the how) angle.

kinematic simulation. The systematic Lagrangian tracking of particles makes it
possible to identify the particles' clustering patterns for different values of
particle inertia and drift velocity. The different cases are characterised by
different pairs of Stokes number $St$ and Froude number $Fr$. For the present
study $0\leq St \leq 1$ and {$0.4 \leq Fr \leq 1.4$}. The main focus is to
identify and then quantify the clustering attractor - when it exists - that is
the set of points in the physical space where the particles settle when time
goes to infinity. Depending on gravity effect and inertia values, the
Lagrangian attractor can have different dimensions varying from the initial
three-dimensional space to two-dimensional layers and one-dimensional
attractors that can be shifted from a horizontal to a vertical position.

generic feature extractors for images, we propose TimeNet: a deep recurrent
neural network (RNN) trained on diverse time series in an unsupervised manner
using sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models to extract features from time
series. Rather than relying on data from the problem domain, TimeNet attempts
to generalize time series representation across domains by ingesting time
series from several domains simultaneously. Once trained, TimeNet can be used
as a generic off-the-shelf feature extractor for time series. The
representations or embeddings given by a pre-trained TimeNet are found to be
useful for time series classification (TSC). For several publicly available
datasets from UCR TSC Archive and an industrial telematics sensor data from
vehicles, we observe that a classifier learned over the TimeNet embeddings
yields significantly better performance compared to (i) a classifier learned
over the embeddings given by a domain-specific RNN, as well as (ii) a nearest
neighbor classifier based on Dynamic Time Warping.

"1706.08908","Alec Rhea","Alec Rhea","The Ordinals as a Consummate Abstraction of Number Systems","62 pages",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the course of many mathematical developments involving 'number systems'
like $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb {C}$ etc., it
sometimes becomes necessary to abstract away and study certain properties of
the number system in question so that we may better understand objects having
these properties in a more general setting -- a relevant example for this paper
would be Hausdorffs $\eta_\varepsilon$-fields, objects abstracted from the
property that there are no two disjoint intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ of
cardinality $\alpha \leq \aleph_0$ whose union is $\mathbb{R}$.
  My goal will be to reverse this process, so to speak -- I will begin in one
of the most abstract mathematical settings possible, using only the undefined
notions and axioms of MK class theory to define and subsequently add structure
to the class of all ordinals, $O_n$. I proceed in this fashion until the
construction (or a subclass thereof) is structurally isomorphic to whichever
'number system' we wish to consider. In the course of doing so, I construct a
proper class of set-sized non-isomorphic discretely ordered rings and a proper
class-sized discretely ordered ring, a proper class of non-isomorphic set-sized
densely ordered fields that are not real-closed and a proper class sized
densely ordered field that is not real-closed, a proper class of non-isomorphic
real-closed fields, and a proper class of non-isomorphic algebraically closed
fields. I also propose a new definition for the Surreal and Surcomplex numbers,
using a 'final culmination' of the process used to construct real-closed fields
and their algebraic closures.
  This process yields a straightforward and logically satisfying method for
moving back and forth between well-studied number systems like $\mathbb{R}$ and
very abstract number systems, such as an $\eta_{_{\omega^\omega}}$-field.

accurately forecast the power output of a wind turbine, as such predictions are
used for wind farm location assessment or power pricing and bidding,
monitoring, and preventive maintenance. As a first step, and following the
guidelines of the existing literature, we use the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) data to model the wind turbine power curve (WTPC). We
explore various parametric and non-parametric approaches for the modeling of
the WTPC, such as parametric logistic functions, and non-parametric piecewise
linear, polynomial, or cubic spline interpolation functions. We demonstrate
that all aforementioned classes of models are rich enough (with respect to
their relative complexity) to accurately model the WTPC, as their mean squared
error (MSE) is close to the MSE lower bound calculated from the historical
data. We further enhance the accuracy of our proposed model, by incorporating
additional environmental factors that affect the power output, such as the
ambient temperature, and the wind direction. However, all aforementioned
models, when it comes to forecasting, seem to have an intrinsic limitation, due
to their inability to capture the inherent auto-correlation of the data. To
avoid this conundrum, we show that adding a properly scaled ARMA modeling layer
increases short-term prediction performance, while keeping the long-term
prediction capability of the model.

Dirac delta function. It provides both Gaussian and Lorentzian representations
of the Dirac delta function (thoughthe Lorentzian is preferable on basic
grounds). KGEC provides decomposition of the conductivity into intra- and
inter-band contributions as well as degenerate state contributions. It
calculates the dc conductivity tensor directly. It is MPI parallelized over
k-points, bands, and plane waves, with an option to recover the plane wave
processes for their use in band parallelization as well. It is designed to
provide rapid convergence with respect to $\mathbf k$-point density. Examples

drift-diffusion (DD) model for the description of photoconversion mechanisms in
organic solar cells. The multiscale nature of the formulation is based on the
co-presence of light absorption, conversion and diffusion phenomena that occur
in the three-dimensional material bulk, of charge photoconversion phenomena
that occur at the two-dimensional material interface separating acceptor and
donor material phases, and of charge separation and subsequent charge transport
in each three-dimensional material phase to device terminals that are driven by
drift and diffusion electrical forces. The model accounts for the nonlinear
interaction among four species: excitons, polarons, electrons and holes, and
allows to quantitatively predict the electrical current collected at the device
contacts of the cell. Existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of the DD
system, as well as nonnegativity of all species concentrations, are proved in
the stationary regime via a solution map that is a variant of the Gummel
iteration commonly used in the treatment of the DD model for inorganic
semiconductors. The results are established upon assuming suitable restrictions
on the data and some regularity property on the mixed boundary value problem
for the Poisson equation. The theoretical conclusions are numerically validated
on the simulation of three-dimensional problems characterized by realistic
values of the physical parameters.
