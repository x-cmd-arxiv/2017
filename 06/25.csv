initiative will inevitably get charged through collisions with interstellar
particles and UV photons. Interstellar magnetic fields would, therefore,
deflect the trajectory of the spacecraft. We calculate the expected deflection
for typical interstellar conditions. We also find that the charge distribution
of the spacecraft is asymmetric, producing an electric dipole moment. The
interaction between the moving electric dipole and the interstellar magnetic
field is found to produce a large torque, which can result in fast oscillation
of the spacecraft around the axis perpendicular to the direction of motion,
with a period of $\sim$ 0.5 hr. We then study the spacecraft rotation arising
from impulsive torques by dust bombardment. Finally, we discuss the effect of
the spacecraft rotation and suggest several methods to mitigate it.

nonadditive exchange in dispersion-bonded trimers. By contrast, for
hydrogen-bonded systems range-separated hybrids achieve a qualitative agreement
to within 20% of the reference exchange energy. A reliable performance for all
systems is obtained only when the monomers interact through the Hartree-Fock

identify the nonadditive second-order exchange-dispersion energy as an

of a magnetar coupled to its internal magnetic field. We find that
magnetospheric currents can be maintained on long timescales of the order of
thousands of years. Meanwhile, the energy, helicity and twist stored in the
magnetosphere all gradually increase over the course of this evolution, until a
critical point is reached, beyond which a force-free magnetosphere cannot be
constructed. At this point, some large-scale magnetospheric rearrangement,
possibly resulting in an outburst or a flare, must occur, releasing a large
fraction of the stored energy, helicity and twist. After that, the quasi-steady
evolution should continue in a similar manner from the new initial conditions.
The timescale for reaching this critical point depends on the overall magnetic
field strength and on the relative fraction of the toroidal field. The energy
stored in the force-free magnetosphere is found to be up to $\sim 30\%$ larger
than the corresponding vacuum energy. This implies that for a $10^{14}$ G field
at the pole, the energy budget available for fast magnetospheric events is of
the order of a few $10^{44}$ erg. The spindown rate is estimated to increase by
up to $\sim 60\%$, since the dipole content in the magnetosphere is enhanced by
the currents present there. A rough estimate of the braking index $n$ reveals
that it is systematically $n < 3$ for the most part of the evolution,
consistent with actual measurements for pulsars and early estimates for several
magnetars.

(LCFT), which are constructed as kernel of screening operators acting on the
vertex algebra of the rescaled root lattice of a finite-dimensional semisimple
complex Lie algebra. In particular their representation theory should be
equivalent to the representation theory of an associated small quantum group.
This article solves the case of the rescaled root lattice $B_n/\sqrt{2}$ as a
first working example beyond $A_1/\sqrt{p}$. We discuss the kernel of short
screening operators, its representations and graded characters. Our main result
is that this vertex algebra is isomorphic to a well-known example: The even
part of $n$ pairs of symplectic fermions. In the screening operator approach
this vertex algebra appears as an extension of the vertex algebra associated to
rescaled $A_1^n$, which are $n$ copies of the even part of one pair. The new
long screenings give the global $C_n$-symmetry. The extension is due to a
degeneracy in this particular case: Rescaled long roots still have even integer
norm. The associated quantum group of divided powers has similar degeneracies
[Lent16]: It contains the small quantum group of type $A_1^n$ and the Lie
algebra $C_n$. Recent results [FGR17b] on symplectic fermions suggest finally
the conjectured category equivalence to this quantum group. We also study the
other degenerate cases of a quantum group, giving extensions of LCFT's of type
$D_n,D_4,A_2$ with larger global symmetry $B_n,F_4,G_2$.

locally uniformly to the zeta function. The numerators (and denominators) of
these rational functions can be expressed as characteristic polynomials of
matrices that are on the face of it very simple. As a consequence, the Riemann
hypothesis can be restated as what looks like a rather conventional spectral
problem but which is related to the one found by Connes in his analysis of the
zeta function. However the point here is that the rational approximations look
to be susceptible of quantitative estimation.

fingerprinting that uses data features from TLS as well as the TCP/IP and HTTP

significant information gain. We also show that obfuscation strategies can
often be defeated due to the difficulty of manipulating data features from all

fingerprinting system. Because devices running unpatched operating systems on
private networks create significant vulnerabilities, their detection is
critical; our approach achieved over 98% accuracy at this important goal.

defined upon the standard degrees of freedom associated with the underlying
method for polytopic domains. While method's mathematical analysis for both

study of the three-dimensional case, in which the method is nonconforming.

surprisingly long lifetime of band-edge photoluminescence in acid-treated

spectroscopy reveals an exponential tail of long-lived states extending
hundreds of meV into the band gap. These sub-band states, which are
characterized by a 4 microsecond radiative lifetime, quickly capture and store
photogenerated excitons before subsequent thermalization up to the band edge
where fast radiative recombination occurs. By intentionally saturating these
trap states, we are able to measure the ""true"" 150 ps radiative lifetime of the
band-edge exciton at 77 K, which extrapolates to ~600 ps at room temperature.
These experiments reveal the dominant role of dark exciton states in
acid-treated MoS2, and suggest that excitons spend > 95% of their lifetime at
room temperature in trap states below the band edge. We hypothesize that these
states are associated with native structural defects, which are not introduced
by the superacid treatment; rather, the superacid treatment dramatically
reduces non-radiative recombination through these states, extending the exciton
lifetime and increasing the likelihood of eventual radiative recombination.

communication nodes with random energy arrivals and a finite battery. We assume
a block i.i.d. stochastic model for the energy arrivals, in which the energy
arrivals are constant for a fixed duration $T$, but are independent across
different blocks, drawn from an arbitrary distribution. This model serves as a
simple approximation to a random process with coherence time $T$. We propose a
simple online power control policy, and prove that its performance gap to the
optimal throughput is bounded by a constant which is independent of the
parameters of the problem. This also yields a simple formula for the
approximately optimal long-term average throughput, which sheds some light on
the qualitative behavior of the throughput and how it depends on the coherence
time of the energy arrival process. Our results show that, perhaps
counter-intuitively, for a fixed mean energy arrival rate the throughput
decreases with increasing coherence time $T$ of the energy arrival process. In
particular, the battery size needed to approach the AWGN capacity of the
channel increases linearly with the coherence time of the process. Finally, we
show that our results can provide an approximation to the information-theoretic
capacity of the same channel.

sampling performance and UQ for noisy matrix completion. Using such insights,
we develop an efficient posterior sampler for UQ, which is then used to guide a

snowdrift game, there exist strategies that force the payoffs of the opponents
to be equal. These equalizer strategies form a subset of the more general
zero-determinant strategies that unilaterally set the payoff of an opponent. A
challenge in the attempts to understand the role of these strategies in the
evolution of animal behavior is the lack of iterations in the fights for mating
opportunities or territory control. We show that an arbitrary two-parameter
strategy may possess a corresponding equalizer strategy which produces the same
result: statistics of the fight outcomes in the contests with mutants are the
same for each of these two strategies. Therefore, analyzing only the equalizer
strategy space may be sufficient to predict animal behavior if nature, indeed,
reduces (marginalizes) complex strategies to equalizer strategy space. The
work's main finding is that there is a unique equalizer strategy that predicts
fight outcomes without mutual cooperation. The lack of mutual cooperation is a
common trait in conflict escalation contests that generally require a clear
winner. In addition this unique strategy does not assess information of the

options for assessing electrophysiological activity in these structures are
limited. Electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in subcortical
structures can be recorded non-invasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG)
and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these subcortical signals are much
weaker than those due to cortical activity. In addition, we show here that it
is difficult to resolve subcortical sources, because distributed cortical
activity can explain the MEG and EEG patterns due to deep sources. We then
demonstrate that if the cortical activity can be assumed to be spatially
sparse, both cortical and subcortical sources can be resolved with M/EEG.
Building on this insight, we develop a novel hierarchical sparse inverse
solution for M/EEG. We assess the performance of this algorithm on realistic
simulations and auditory evoked response data and show that thalamic and
brainstem sources can be correctly estimated in the presence of cortical
activity. Our analysis and method suggest new opportunities and offer practical
tools for characterizing electrophysiological activity in the subcortical
structures of the human brain.

and more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), effectively rendering them
semi-autonomous. However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle
complex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from
the sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate
of accidents in these settings prove that they constitute difficult driving
situations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of
important traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this article, we
propose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles
in such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining
compatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised
coordination scheme that overrides control inputs from human drivers when they
would result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary
intervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs
when collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe overriding
controls are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally
requested by the drivers. Simulation results based on a realistic physics
simulator show that our approach is scalable to real-world scenarios, and
computations can be performed in real-time on a standard computer for up to a
dozen simultaneous vehicles.

and possibly probe the thermal inflation scenario. These are dark matter halo
abundance at high redshifts, satellite galaxy abundance in the Milky Way, and
fluctuation in the 21-cm radiation background before the epoch of reionization.
The thermal inflation scenario leaves a characteristic signature on the matter
power spectrum by boosting the amplitude at a specific wavenumber determined by
the number of e-foldings during thermal inflation ($N_{\rm bc}$), and strongly
suppressing the amplitude for modes at smaller scales. For a reasonable range
of parameter space, one of the consequences is the suppression of minihalo
formation at high redshifts and that of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.
While this effect is substantial, it is degenerate with other cosmological or
astrophysical effects. The power spectrum of the 21-cm background probes this
impact more directly, and its observation may be the best way to constrain the
thermal inflation scenario due to the characteristic signature in the power
spectrum. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in phase 1 (SKA1) has sensitivity
large enough to achieve this goal for models with $N_{\rm bc}\gtrsim 26$ if a
10000-hr observation is performed. The final phase SKA, with anticipated
sensitivity about an order of magnitude higher, seems more promising and will
cover a wider parameter space.

feature that is advected by the moat flow from a sunspot towards a pore. The
moving feature is parasitic in that its magnetic polarity is opposite to that
of the spot and the pore. We used UV spectroscopic and slit-jaw observations
from the IRIS to identify and study chromospheric and transition region
spectral signatures of said UV burst. To investigate the magnetic topology
surrounding the UV burst, we used a two-hour-long time sequence of simultaneous
line-of-sight magnetograms from the HMI and performed data-driven 3D magnetic
field extrapolations by means of a magnetofrictional relaxation technique. We
can connect UV burst signatures to the overlying EUV coronal loops observed by
the AIA. The UV burst shows a variety of extremely broad line profiles
indicating plasma flows in excess of $\pm$200 km s$^{-1}$ at times. The whole
structure is divided into two spatially distinct zones of predominantly up- and
downflows. The magnetic field extrapolations show a persistent fan-spine
magnetic topology at the UV burst. The associated 3D magnetic null point exists
at a height of about 500 km above the photosphere and evolves co-spatially with
the observed UV burst. The EUV emission at the footpoints of coronal loops is
correlated with the evolution of the underlying UV burst. The magnetic field
around the null point is sheared by photospheric motions, triggering magnetic
reconnection that ultimately powers the observed UV burst and energises the
overlying coronal loops. The location of the null point suggests that the burst
is triggered low in the solar chromosphere.

star led to a rapid X-ray binary phase with little ($< \, 10^{-2} \, M_\odot$)
mass accretion onto the neutron star (NS); hence, the current pulsar mass is,
within uncertainties, its birth mass; the largest measured to date. We discuss
the discrepancy with previous mass measurements for this system; we conclude
that the measurements presented here are likely to be more accurate. Finally,
we highlight the usefulness of this system for testing alternative theories of
gravity by tightly constraining the presence of dipolar radiation. This is of
particular importance for certain aspects of strong-field gravity, like
spontaneous scalarization, since the mass of PSR~J2222$-0137$ puts that system
into a poorly tested parameter range.

relaxation behaviour of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and how these affect
the para-/ferroelectric behavior of this polymer. We use PVDF nanotubes that
were solidified in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. Dielectric
spectroscopy measurements evidence a bimodal relaxation process for PVDF
nanotubes: besides the bulk-like -relaxation, we detect a notably slower
relaxation that is associated with the PVDF regions of restricted dynamics at
the interface with the AAO pore. Strickingly, both the bulk-like and the
interfacial relaxation tend to become temperature independent as the
temperature increases - a behavior that has been observed before in inorganic
relaxor ferroelectrics. In line with this, we observe that the real part of the
dielectric permittivity of the PVDF nanotubes exhibits a broad maximum when
plotted against the temperature, which is, again, a typical feature of relaxor
ferroelectrics. As such, we propose that in nanotubular PVDF,
ferroelectric-like nanodomains are formed in the amorphous phase regions
adjacent to the AAO interface. These ferroelectric nanodomains may result from
an anisotropic chain conformation and a preferred orientation of local dipoles
due to selective H-bond formation between the PVDF macromolecues and the AAO
walls. Such relaxor-ferroelectric-like behaviour has not been observed for
non-irradiated PVDF homopolymer; our findings thus may enable in the future
alternative applications for this bulk commodity plastic, e.g., for the
production of electrocaloric devices for solid-state refrigeration which
benefit from a relaxor-ferroelectric-like response.

is an important example of collective behavior. It is interesting to ask how
the structural organization of network interactions influences this process.
Several studies have uncovered optimal topologies for synchronization by making
purposeful alterations to a network. Yet, the connectivity patterns of many
natural systems are often not static, but are rather modulated over time
according to their dynamics. This co-evolution - and the extent to which the
dynamics of the individual units can shape the organization of the network
itself - is not well understood. Here, we study initially randomly connected
but locally adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators. The system employs a
co-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on instantaneous, pairwise
phase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total
number of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated.
We find that a simple regulatory rule - which preserves connections between
more out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase
oscillators - can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more
structured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We
examine how this process unfolds over time, finding both a dependence on the
intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators and the global coupling. For large
enough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit
degree - frequency and frequency - neighbor frequency correlations. These
properties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or
explosive transitions. By considering a time-dependent interplay between
structure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent
phenomena can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.

which types of noise processes can support information transmission, and which

for nucleon scattering on $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U nuclei is extended to
describe scattering on even-even actinides with $Z=$90--98. A
soft-rotator-model (SRM) description of the low-lying nuclear structure is
used, where SRM Hamiltonian parameters are adjusted to the observed collective
levels of the target nucleus. SRM nuclear wave functions (mixed in $K$ quantum
number) have been used to calculate coupling matrix elements of the generalized
optical model. The ""effective"" deformations that define inter-band couplings
are derived from SRM Hamiltonian parameters. Conservation of nuclear volume is
enforced by introducing a dynamic monopolar term to the deformed potential
leading to additional couplings between rotational bands. Fitted static
deformation parameters are in very good agreement with those derived by Wang
and collaborators using the Weizs\""acker-Skyrme global mass model (WS4),
allowing to use the latter to predict cross section for nuclei without
experimental data. A good description of scarce ""optical"" experimental database
is achieved. SRM couplings and volume conservation allow a precise calculation
of the compound-nucleus formation cross sections, which is significantly
different from the one calculated with rigid-rotor potentials coupling the
ground-state rotational band. Derived parameters can be used to describe both
neutron and proton induced reactions.

to generalize to a target domain. However, an adaptive classifier can perform
worse than a non-adaptive classifier due to invalid assumptions, increased
sensitivity to estimation errors or model misspecification. Our goal is to
develop a domain-adaptive classifier that is robust in the sense that it does
not rely on restrictive assumptions on how the source and target domains relate
to each other and that it does not perform worse than the non-adaptive
classifier. We formulate a conservative parameter estimator that only deviates
from the source classifier when a lower risk is guaranteed for all possible
labellings of the given target samples. We derive the classical least-squares
and discriminant analysis cases and show that these perform on par with
state-of-the-art domain adaptive classifiers in sample selection bias settings,
while outperforming them in more general domain adaptation settings.

multiple artificial three-level atoms, namely qutrits, strongly coupled to a

the process that does not conserve the number of excitations can happen
determinatively. Therefore, we can realize coherent exchange interaction among
three or more atoms mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. In addition,
we generalize the one cavity mode mediated interactions to the multi-cavity
situation, providing a method to entangle atoms located in different cavities.
Using experimental feasible parameters, we investigate the dynamics of the
model including three cyclic-transition three-level atoms, for which the two
lowest-energy levels can be treated as qubits. Hence, we have found that two
qubits can jointly exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and
reversible way. In the whole process, the population in the third level of

Calculations using the derived OMP potential reproduce measured total
cross-section differences between several actinide pairs within experimental

Coupling of ground-state rotational band levels in odd-$A$ nuclei is sufficient

difficult to reward more interesting long-term behaviors, such as always
closing a door after it has been opened, or providing coffee only following a
request. Extending MDPs to handle such non-Markovian reward function was the
subject of two previous lines of work, both using variants of LTL to specify
the reward function and then compiling the new model back into a Markovian
model. Building upon recent progress in the theories of temporal logics over
finite traces, we adopt LDLf for specifying non-Markovian rewards and provide
an elegant automata construction for building a Markovian model, which extends
that of previous work and offers strong minimality and compositionality
guarantees.

As an extension of our previous research works, a new chaotic iterations keyed
hash function is proposed in this article. Chaotic iterations are used both to
construct strategies with pseudorandom number generator and to calculate new

operational and planned water-Cherenkov neutrino telescopes, most notably
KM3NeT, include acoustic sensors in addition to the optical ones. These
acoustic sensors could be used as instruments for acoustic detection, while
their main purpose is the position calibration of the detection units. In this
article, a Monte Carlo simulation chain for acoustic detectors will be
presented, covering the initial interaction of the neutrino up to the signal
classification of recorded events. The ambient and transient background in the
simulation was implemented according to data recorded by the acoustic set-up
AMADEUS inside the ANTARES detector. The effects of refraction on the neutrino
signature in the detector are studied, and a classification of the recorded
events is implemented. As bipolar waveforms similar to those of the expected
neutrino signals are also emitted from other sound sources, additional features
like the geometrical shape of the propagation have to be considered for the
signal classification. This leads to a large improvement of the background
suppression by almost two orders of magnitude, since a flat cylindrical
""pancake"" propagation pattern is a distinctive feature of neutrino signals. An
overview of the simulation chain and the signal classification will be

based on the prepared data repository consisting of synchronized depth and
accelerometric data. The study was carried out in the scenario with a static

The experimental results showed that the developed algorithms for fall

with regard to low computational demands and possibility to run on ARM

are called insertion sequences (ISs), they are the simplest types of
transposable elements (TEs) that widely spread within prokaryotic genomes. ISs
can be defined as DNA segments that have the ability to move (cut and paste)
themselves to another location within the same chromosome or not. Due to their
ability to move around, they are often presented as responsible of some of
these genomic recombination. Authors of this research work have regarded this
claim, by checking if a relation between insertion sequences (ISs) and genome
rearrangements can be found. To achieve this goal, a new pipeline that combines
various tools have firstly been designed, for detecting the distribution of
ORFs that belongs to each IS category. Secondly, links between these predicted
ISs and observed rearrangements of two close genomes have been investigated, by
seeing them with the naked eye, and by using computational approaches. The
proposal has been tested on 18 complete bacterial genomes of Pseudomonas

multimodal deep learning architecture using new nested structures that
explicitly leverage deep features within or across modalities. This aims at
making the early layers of the architecture structured and sparse so that the
final architecture becomes scalable to the number of modalities. We evaluate
the scalable architecture for brain tumour segmentation and give evidence of
its regularisation effect compared to the conventional concatenation approach.

super-Eddington Type-1 QSO RX J0439.6-5311. We combine the latest XMM-Newton
observation with all archival data from infrared to hard X-rays. The optical
spectrum is very similar to that of 1H 0707-495 in having extremely weak [O
{\sc iii}] and strong Fe {\sc ii} emission lines, although the black hole mass
is probably slightly higher at $5-10 \times10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot}$. The broadband
SED is uniquely well-defined due to the extremely low Galactic and intrinsic
absorption, so the bolometric luminosity is tightly constrained. The optical/UV
accretion disc continuum is seen down to 900 \AA, showing that there is a
standard thin disc structure down to $R \ge$ 190-380 $R_{\rm g}$ and
determining the mass accretion rate through the outer disc. This predicts a
much higher bolometric luminosity than observed, indicating that there must be
strong wind and/or advective energy losses from the inner disc, as expected for
a highly super-Eddington accretion flow. Significant outflows are detected in
both the NLR and BLR emission lines, confirming the presence of a wind. We
propose a global picture for the structure of a super-Eddington accretion flow
where the inner disc puffs up, shielding much of the potential NLR material,
and show how inclination angle with respect to this and the wind can explain
very different X-ray properties of RX J0439.6-5311 and 1H 0707-495. Therefore,
this source provides strong supporting evidence that `simple' and `complex'
super-Eddington NLS1s can be unified within the same accretion flow scenario
but with different inclination angles. We also propose that these extreme NLS1s
could be the low-redshift analogs of weak emission-line quasars (WLQs).

many computer-assisted robotic surgical systems and of critical importance in
robotic surgical data science. We propose two novel deep learning architectures
for automatic segmentation of non-rigid surgical instruments. Both methods take
advantage of automated deep-learning-based multi-scale feature extraction while
trying to maintain an accurate segmentation quality at all resolutions. The two
proposed methods encode the multi-scale constraint inside the network
architecture. The first proposed architecture enforces it by cascaded
aggregation of predictions and the second proposed network does it by means of
a holistically-nested architecture where the loss at each scale is taken into
account for the optimization process. As the proposed methods are for real-time
semantic labeling, both present a reduced number of parameters. We propose the
use of parametric rectified linear units for semantic labeling in these small
architectures to increase the regularization ability of the design and maintain
the segmentation accuracy without overfitting the training sets. We compare the
proposed architectures against state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks.
We validate our methods using existing benchmark datasets, including ex vivo
cases with phantom tissue and different robotic surgical instruments present in
the scene. Our results show a statistically significant improved Dice
Similarity Coefficient over previous instrument segmentation methods. We
analyze our design choices and discuss the key drivers for improving accuracy.

  Methods: In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose the use of data
primitives as a common currency between analytical methods. The four data
primitives we have identified are time series, text, annotated graph and
triangulated mesh, with associated metadata. Using only data primitives to
store data and as algorithm input, output, and intermediate results, promotes
interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility in scientific studies.
  Results: Data primitives were used in a multi-omic, multi-scale systems
