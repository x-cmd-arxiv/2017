Supergravity. Then it builds a new theory, incorporating the ideas of
Suppressed SUSY. Suppressed SUSY is an alternative to the spontaneous breaking
of SUSY. It does not need an invisible sector or explicit soft breaking of
SUSY. It varies the content of the supermultiplets while keeping the
restrictive nature of SUSY. For the simple model and sector constructed here,
Suppressed SUSY has only three dimensionless parameters, plus the Planck mass.
At tree level, this predicts a set of 8 different new masses, along with a
cosmological constant that is naturally zero. The X and Y vector bosons get
Planck scale masses $2 \sqrt{10} g_5 M_{\rm P}$. The five scalar multiplets
that accompany the Higgs, and the Gravitino, all get colossally huge
`SuperPlanck' scale masses of order $M_{\rm SP} \approx 10^{17} M_{\rm P}$ from
a see-saw mechanism that arises from the theory. This new mass spectrum, the
well-known $SU(5)$ weak angle problem, and the cosmological constant value,
should serve as guides for further modifications for the new Action.

and even hostile environments, which prompts a number of security issues.
Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so
in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical
capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues:
(1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling
algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary
to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to
reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes
scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to
guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation
requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will
be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of
these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.

Our proposed model recovers SAGA, SDCA, Finito, and SAG as special cases. Then
we combine jump system theory with several simple quadratic inequalities to
derive sufficient conditions for convergence rate certifications of the
proposed jump system model under various assumptions (with or without
individual convexity, etc). The derived conditions are linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs) whose sizes roughly scale with the size of the training
set. We make use of the symmetry in the stochastic optimization methods and
reduce these LMIs to some equivalent small LMIs whose sizes are at most 3 by 3.
We solve these small LMIs to provide analytical proofs of new convergence rates
for SAGA, Finito and SDCA (with or without individual convexity). We also
explain why our proposed LMI fails in analyzing SAG. We reveal a key difference
between SAG and other methods, and briefly discuss how to extend our LMI

vapor is described. The technique can be used to minimize vector light shifts.
The method involves measurement of ellipticity-induced resonances in the
magnetic-field dependence of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation of
frequency-modulated light. The light propagation direction is orthogonal to the
applied magnetic field $\textbf{B}$ and the major axis of the light
polarization ellipse is along $\textbf{B}$. When the light modulation frequency
matches the Larmor frequency, elliptically polarized light produces precessing
atomic spin orientation transverse to $\textbf{B}$ via synchronous optical
pumping. The precessing spin orientation causes optical rotation oscillating at
the Larmor frequency by modulating the atomic vapor's circular birefringence.
Based on this technique's precision, in-situ nature (which avoids systematic
errors arising from optical interfaces), and independent control of the most
important systematic errors, it is shown that the accuracy of light ellipticity
measurements achievable with this technique can exceed that of existing methods

Folklore alludes to such a relationship, but previous scientific analyses have
failed to find significant associations. It has been shown that lunar cycles
indeed have effects on animals; significant associations between human
circadian rhythms and lunar cycles have also been reported. We set out to
determine whether a significant statistical correlation exists between the
lunar phase and sex determination during conception. We found that significant
associations (\textit{p}-value $< 5 \times 10^{-5}$) exist between the average
sex ratio (male:female) and the lunar month. The likelihood of conception of a
male is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest
likelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon.
Furthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with
the amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight). Our results
suggest that sex determination may be influenced by the moon cycle, which
suggests the possibility of lunar influence on other biological phenomena. We
suggest for future research the exploration of similar effects in other
phenomena involving humans and other species.

$f:G\to\mathbb R$ defined on an open convex subset $G$ of a metric linear space
$X$ is continuous if it is upper bounded on a subset $B$ which is not
null-finite and whose closure is contained in $G$. This gives an alternative

a mid-point convex function $f:G\to\mathbb R$ defined on an open covex subset

defined on an open convex subset $G$ of a complete linear metric space $X$ is
continuous if it is upper bounded on a Borel subset $B\subset G$ which is not

functional scPBE0 in calculating the band gap of oxide semiconductors. The
computational procedure is based on the self-consistent evaluation of the
mixing parameter $\alpha$ by means of an iterative calculation of the static
dielectric constant using the perturbation expansion after discretization
(PEAD) method and making use of the relation $\alpha = 1/\epsilon_{\infty}$.
Our materials dataset is formed by 30 compounds covering a wide range of band
gaps and dielectric properties, and includes materials with a wide spectrum of
application as thermoelectrics, photocatalysis, photovoltaics, transparent
conducting oxides, and refractory materials. Our results show that the scPBE0
functional provides better band gaps than the non self-consistent hybrids PBE0
and HSE06, but scPBE0 does not show significant improvement on the description
of the static dielectric constants. Overall, the scPBE0 data exhibit a mean
absolute percentage error of 14 \% (band gaps) and 10 \% ($\epsilon_\infty$).
For materials with weak dielectric screening and large excitonic biding
energies scPBE0, unlike PBE0 and HSE06, overestimates the band gaps, but the
value of the gap become very close to the experimental value when excitonic
effects are included (e.g. for SiO$_2$). However, special caution must be given
to the compounds with small band gaps due to the tendency of scPBE0 to
overestimate the dielectric constant in proximity of the metallic limit.

determinate Euler Bernoulli beams with arbitrary stress-strain laws following
Cauchy elastic behavior. The VRF is a Green's function that maps the spectral
density function (SDF) of a statistically homogeneous random field describing
the correlation structure of input uncertainty to the variance of a response
quantity. The appeal of such Green's functions is that the variance can be
determined for any correlation structure by a trivial computation of a
convolution integral. The method introduced in this work derives VRFs in closed
form for arbitrary nonlinear Cauchy-elastic constitutive laws and is
demonstrated through three examples. It is shown why and how higher order
spectra of the random field affect the response variance for nonlinear
constitutive laws. In the general sense, the VRF for a statically determinate
beam is found to be a matrix kernel whose inner product by a matrix of higher
order SDFs and statistical moments is integrated to give the response variance.
The resulting VRF matrix is unique regardless of the random field's marginal
probability density function (PDF) and SDFs.

minimization algorithm has been one of the most commonly used methods, and it
is very simple to implement. Current work has proved that when the observation

$N(0, I)$, it recovers the underlying signal with a good initialization when
$m=O(n)$, or with random initialization when $m=O(n^2)$, and it conjectured
that random initialization succeeds with $m=O(n)$. This work proposes a
modified alternating minimization method in a batch setting, and proves that
when $m=O(n\log^{3}n)$, the proposed algorithm with random initialization
recovers the underlying signal with high probability. The proof is based on the
observation that after each iteration of alternating minimization, with high

  Proposition 3, and other minor improvements",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper explores the relationship between two ideas in network information
theory: edge removal and strong converses. Edge removal properties state that
if an edge of small capacity is removed from a network, the capacity region
does not change too much. Strong converses state that, for rates outside the
capacity region, the probability of error converges to 1 as the blocklength
goes to infinity. Various notions of edge removal and strong converse are
defined, depending on how edge capacity and error probability scale with
blocklength, and relations between them are proved. Each class of strong
converse implies a specific class of edge removal. The opposite directions are
proved for deterministic networks. Furthermore, a technique based on a novel,
causal version of the blowing-up lemma is used to prove that for discrete
memoryless networks, the weak edge removal property--that the capacity region
changes continuously as the capacity of an edge vanishes--is equivalent to the
exponentially strong converse--that outside the capacity region, the
probability of error goes to 1 exponentially fast. This result is used to prove
exponentially strong converses for several examples, including the discrete
2-user interference channel with strong interference, with only a small
variation from traditional weak converse proofs.

of Dirac degeneracies are protected by various space symmetries, where Bloch

Dirac points can also be realized in effective media through the intrinsic
degrees of freedom in electromagnetism under electromagnetic duality. A pair of
spin polarized Fermi arc like surface states is observed at the interface
between air and the Dirac metamaterials. These surface states show linear
k-space dispersion relation, resulting in nearly diffraction-less propagation.
Furthermore, eigen reflection fields show the decomposition from a Dirac point

photonic Dirac point lays foundation for unveiling the connection between
intrinsic physics and global topology in electromagnetism.

domain-specific text corpora (e.g., news articles, scientific papers) is rather
challenging. Current systems take an entity name string as input to find out
other names that are synonymous, ignoring the fact that often times a name
string can refer to multiple entities (e.g., ""apple"" could refer to both Apple
Inc and the fruit apple). Moreover, most existing methods require training data
manually created by domain experts to construct supervised-learning systems. In
this paper, we study the problem of automatic synonym discovery with knowledge
bases, that is, identifying synonyms for knowledge base entities in a given
domain-specific corpus. The manually-curated synonyms for each entity stored in
a knowledge base not only form a set of name strings to disambiguate the
meaning for each other, but also can serve as ""distant"" supervision to help
determine important features for the task. We propose a novel framework, called
DPE, to integrate two kinds of mutually-complementing signals for synonym
discovery, i.e., distributional features based on corpus-level statistics and
textual patterns based on local contexts. In particular, DPE jointly optimizes
the two kinds of signals in conjunction with distant supervision, so that they
can mutually enhance each other in the training stage. At the inference stage,
both signals will be utilized to discover synonyms for the given entities.
Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

theory, of the form \begin{eqnarray} S_n=\frac{1}{\log(p_n)} \sum_{k=1}^n X_k

studying the fixed points of the transformation \begin{eqnarray*} s(W^*)=_d

non-identity utility functions $s(\cdot)$ in Vervaat perpetuities. We obtain
distributional bounds for recursive methods that can be used to simulate from
this family.

the planar tunneling spectroscopy of the topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$.
Contrasting behaviors of the tunnel junctions prepared in two different ways
are analyzed and explained in detail. The conventional approach based on an
AlO$_\text{x}$ tunnel barrier results in unsatisfactory results due to the
inter-diffusion between SmB$_6$ and deposited Al. On the contrary, plasma
oxidation of SmB$_6$ crystals produces high-quality tunnel barriers on both
(001) and (011) surfaces. Resultant conductance spectra are highly reproducible
with clear signatures for the predicted surface Dirac fermions and the bulk
hybridization gap as well. The surface states are identified to reside on two
or one {\it distinguishable} Dirac cone(s) on the (001) and (011) surface,
respectively, in good agreement with the recent literature. However, their
topological protection is found to be limited within the low energy region due
to their inevitable interaction with the bulk excitations, called spin
excitons, consistent with a recent theoretical prediction. Implications of our
findings on other physical properties in SmB$_6$ and also other correlated
topological materials are remarked.

isotherm was used to improve the classical Poisson-Boltzmann equation for
polyelectrolyte solutions by introducing a new solution parameters to consider
the effect of the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen ions on the electrical
potential. Second, inspired by the Parsegian's mesoscopic attraction potential
for cation condensed DNAs, the graded distribution properties of the particles
were taken in the construction of an alternative interaction potential for both
attraction-dominated and repulsion-dominated films. The new model parameters
were obtained by curve fitting with the bending deflection experiments of a
microcantilever done by Arroyo-Hernandez et al. Third, by the improved
interaction potential and the thought experiment about the compression of a DNA
bar in the context of macroscopic continuum mechanics, we investigated the
diversity of elastic properties of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) films due to the
self-adaptability of its microstructures and constituents to the pH value, salt
concentration and cation valence. Numerical results show that electronegative
DNA could be overcharged with a positive electrical potential when the particle
distribution conforms with the condition that the sign of the new introduced
solution parameter is negative. There exists a transition from the pH-sensitive
interval to pH-insensitive one for bending signals and elastic moduli. Negative
elastic modulus is first revealed in the attraction-dominated ssDNA film

the Knudsen number. For computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the numerical flow
field is the projection of the physical flow field onto the discrete space and

regimes are controlled by these two parameters. According to the values of
Knudsen number and cell Knudsen number, we study the classification of the
numerical flow regimes. In the process of mesh refinement, the numerical
experiments show the change of numerical flow regime from continuum, to
near-continuum, and to non-equilibrium one. The change of flow regime with
different cell resolution is the limitation principle for the numerical
simulation, which is the best a multiscale method can do. In other words, we
should have changeable numerical governing equations in different mesh size
scale, and they are coupled with the traditional physical equations in
different scales, such as the Navier-Stokes and Boltzmann. Under the multiscale
modeling, a mesh refinement is a process in resolving the flow physics in
different scale. The verification and validation (V$\&$V) need include the
physical modeling mechanism in the mesh refinement process. The traditional
idea of mesh refinement for targeting a fixed partial differential equation
cannot achieve the final goal of computation, which is to recover the flow
physics as truthfully as possible under the limitation of the cell resolution.

rigorous control objectives that enable new therapeutic methods to mitigate
seizure occurrence. In multichannel electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings
acquired in 21 subjects during a total of 94 seizures, we apply dynamical
systems stability analysis to assess the balance versus imbalance of seizure
dynamics across different timescales and brain regions. Specifically, we
consider a sliding time window multivariate autoregressive linear approximation
of the data captured by the ECoG channels, where eigendecomposition of the
estimated matrix of coefficients describes the contribution of different
regions to the spatiotemporal process (eigenvectors) associated with a
particular timescale (eigenvalues). Interestingly, we observe a pattern of
eigenvalue evolution and slowly changing (or approximately time-invariant)
eigenvectors across both seizures and subjects. The seizure-onset is marked by
an increase in high frequency spatial information to which a few regions
contribute for a long period. By contrast, the seizure termination is
characterized by a sudden, small time period change in dynamics to which many
regions contribute. As the seizure terminates, the relatively stable ictal
dynamics rapidly transition into the post-ictal regime, marked by relatively
fast-damping oscillations. Our methodology offers a subject-specific
characterization of the spatiotemporal behavior of the seizure, providing new
insights into the dynamic patterns and functional interactions between brain
regions that occur over different timescales. More generally, our approach
informs the development of engineering objectives that can be used to deploy
new control strategies to prevent seizure evolution or to hasten seizure
termination.

symmetric points of the Brillouin zone. Here, we present a new type of the
phononic topological insulator in the square lattice with position-variational
Dirac cones along the high symmetric lines. The emergence of such Dirac cones,
characterized by the vortex structure in a momentum space, is attributed to the
unavoidable band crossing protected by the mirror symmetry. By rotating the
square columns, these Dirac points are lifted and a complete band gap is
induced because of the mirror-symmetry-breaking. Along the topological domain
wall between the phononic crystals (PhCs) with the distinct topological phases
stemming from the mirror symmetry inversion, we obtain a topological edge state
for the neutral scalar sound which is absence of the intrinsic polarization and
is uncoupled from an external field. Within a wide rotational range of the
square column, the topological edge state in our PhCs evolves from a gapless
one into a gapped one with a robust edge transport against cavities and
disorders. Our excellent results are promising for the exploration of the new

the flexibility of the rotational square columns provides an interesting

(SSRM) is proposed, in which a special optimization problem is solved to update
the surrogate model of the limit state function (LSF) iteratively. The
objective of the optimization problem is to find a new point to maximize the
probability density function (PDF), subject to the constraints that the new
point is on the approximated LSF and the minimum distance to the existing
points is greater than or equal to the given distance. By updating the
surrogate model with the new points, the surrogate model of the LSF becomes
more and more accurate in the important region with a high failure probability
and on the LSF boundary. Moreover, the accuracy of the unimportant region is
also improved within the iteration due to the minimum distance constraint. SSRM
takes advantage of the information of PDF and LSF to capture the failure
features, which decreases the number of the expensive LSF evaluations. Six
numerical examples show that SSRM improves the accuracy of the surrogate model
in the important region around the failure boundary with small number of
samples and has better adaptability to the nonlinear LSF, hence increases the
accuracy and efficiency of the reliability analysis.

magnitudes higher than ASGD which makes it very slow. On the other hand, IS

on any explicit object detection or tracking scheme, SLCAN reads the whole
input image and directly decides whether initiation of the lane-change at the
moment is safe or not. We collected and annotated 77,273 rear side view images
to train and test SLCAN. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves 96.98% classification accuracy although the test images are from
unseen roadways. We also visualize the saliency map to understand which part of

casting is currently used to produce acetabular shells followed by lengthy and
complex secondary processes such as machining and polishing. Living organs and
medical models have intricate 3D shapes that are challenging to identity in
X-ray CT images. These images are used for preparing treatment plans to improve
the quality of the surgeries regarding waiting and surgery time per procedure

can be carried out on each acetabulum due to a decrease of bone thickness.
Rapid prototyping is a suitable treatment planning tool in complex cases to
enhance the quality of surgical procedure and provide long-term stability that
can be used to customize the shape and size of the acetabular shell. In this

recent theoretical analysis in Arora et al (to appear at ICML 2017) raised
doubts whether the same holds when discriminator has finite size. It showed
that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the

experiments suggesting that such problems are not merely theoretical. It
presents empirical evidence that well-known GANs approaches do learn

When the force error lies in the typical value from first-principles

commonly prescribed drugs and many of these might alter drug efficacy. We
further computed the likelihood of 1,236 FDA approved drugs to be affected by
functional-variants in their targets and show that the patient-risk varies for

oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying

on the efficiency of the organization, because information systems are not

orbit coupling (SOC), and becomes the father of a new multifunctional material,
i.e., ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor. In the present work, we investigate
Rashba SOC at the interface of the ferroelectric semiconductor superlattice
GeTe(111)/InP(111) by using the first principles calculation. Contribution of
the interface electric field and the ferroelectric field to Rashba SOC is
revealed. A large modulation to Rashba SOC and a reversal of the spin
polarization is obtained by switching the ferroelectric polarization. Our
investigation about GeTe(111)/InP(111) superlattice is of great importance in
the application of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor in the spin field effect
transistor.

this paper formally defines a database operator that extracts the 'directly

to do in-database process mining and to flexibly evaluate process mining
related queries, such as: ""which employee most frequently changes the 'amount'

the well-known relational algebra that forms the formal underpinning of

professional photographers and automatically adjust photos to the learned
style. There have been many attempts to model the tone and the color adjustment
globally with low-level color statistics. Also, spatially varying photo
adjustment methods have been studied by exploiting high-level features and
semantic label maps. Those methods are semantics-aware since the color mapping
is dependent on the high-level semantic context. However, their performance is
limited to the pre-computed hand-crafted features and it is hard to reflect
user's preference to the adjustment. In this paper, we propose a deep neural
network that models the semantics-aware photo adjustment. The proposed network
exploits bilinear models that are the multiplicative interaction of the color

adjustment map, which discovers the inherent photo retouching presets that are
applied according to the scene context. The proposed method is trained using a
robust loss with a scene parsing task. The experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms the existing method both quantitatively and
qualitatively. The proposed method also provides users a way to retouch the

every integer has a unique finite representation, up to leading zeroes. This
work is a contribution to the study of the set of the representations of
integers. This prefix-closed subset of the free monoid is naturally represented
as a highly non-regular tree. Its nodes are the integers, its edges bear labels
taken in {0,1,...,p-1}, and its subtrees are all distinct.
  We associate with each subtree (or with its root n) three infinite words. The
bottom word of n is the lexicographically smallest word that is the label of a
branch of the subtree. The top word of n is defined similarly. The span-word of
n is the digitwise difference between the latter and the former.
  First, we show that the set of all the span-words is accepted by an infinite
automaton whose underlying graph is essentially the same as the tree itself.
Second, we study the function that computes for all n the bottom word
associated with n+1 from the one associated with n, and show that it is
realised by an infinite sequential transducer whose underlying graph is once
again essentially the same as the tree itself.
  An infinite word may be interpreted as an expansion in base p/q after the
radix point, hence evaluated to a real number. If T is a subtree whose root is
n, then the evaluations of the labels of the branches of T form an interval of
$\mathbb{R}$. The length of this interval is called the span of n and is equal
to the evaluation of the span-word of n. The set of all spans is then a subset
of R and we use the preceding construction to study its topological closure. We
show that it is an interval when p is greater than or equal to 2q-1, and a
Cantor set of measure zero otherwise.

moving themselves into genomes. These types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs)

prokaryotic genomes, but the tools that deal with discovering ISs in an

factors have big effects on IS discovery, namely: genes annotation and
functionality prediction. Indeed, some specific genes called ""transposases"" are
enzymes that are responsible of the production and catalysis for such
transposition, but there is currently no fully accurate method that could
decide whether a given predicted gene is either a real transposase or not. This
is why authors of this article aim at designing a novel pipeline for ISs
detection and classification, which embeds the most recently available tools
developed in this field of research, namely OASIS (Optimized Annotation System
for Insertion Sequence) and ISFinder database (an up-to-date and accurate
repository of known insertion sequences). As this latter depend on predicted
coding sequences, the proposed pipeline will encompass too various kinds of
bacterial genes annotation tools (that is, Prokka, BASys, and Prodigal). A
complete IS detection and classification pipeline is then proposed and tested
on a set of 23 complete genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pipeline can
also be used as an investigator of annotation tools performance, which has led
us to conclude that Prodigal is the best software for IS prediction. A deepen
study regarding IS elements in P.aeruginosa has then been conducted, leading to
the conclusion that close genomes inside this species have also a close numbers

  with Trust Gates",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted a lot of research
attention during the past few years. Recent works attempted to utilize
recurrent neural networks to model the temporal dependencies between the 3D
positional configurations of human body joints for better analysis of human
activities in the skeletal data. The proposed work extends this idea to spatial
domain as well as temporal domain to better analyze the hidden sources of
action-related information within the human skeleton sequences in both of these
domains simultaneously. Based on the pictorial structure of Kinect's skeletal
data, an effective tree-structure based traversal framework is also proposed.
In order to deal with the noise in the skeletal data, a new gating mechanism
within LSTM module is introduced, with which the network can learn the
reliability of the sequential data and accordingly adjust the effect of the
input data on the updating procedure of the long-term context representation
stored in the unit's memory cell. Moreover, we introduce a novel multi-modal
feature fusion strategy within the LSTM unit in this paper. The comprehensive
experimental results on seven challenging benchmark datasets for human action
recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

thickened (closed oriented) surfaces, up to self-diffeomorphism of the surface
and certain handle stabilisations. The slice genus of a virtual knot is defined
diagrammatically, in direct analogy to that of a classical knot. However, it
may be defined, equivalently, as follows: a representative of a virtual knot is
an embedding of $ S^1 $ into a thickened surface $ \Sigma_g \times I $; what is
the minimal genus of oriented surfaces $ S \hookrightarrow M \times I $ with
the embedded $ S^1 $ as boundary, where $ M $ is an oriented $ 3 $-manifold
with $ \partial M = \Sigma_g $?
  We compute and estimate the slice genus of all virtual knots of $4$ classical
crossings or less. We also compute or estimate the slice genus of $46$ virtual
knots of $5$ and $6$ classical crossings whose slice status is not determined
in the work of Boden, Chrisman, and Gaudreau. The computations are made using
two distinct virtual extensions of the Rasmussen invariant, one due to Dye,
Kaestner, and Kauffman, the other due to the author. Specifically, the
computations are made using bounds on the two extensions of the Ramussen
invariant which we construct and investigate. The bounds are themselves
generalisations of those on the classical Rasmussen invariant due,
independently, to Kawamura and Lobb. The bounds allow for the computation of
the extensions of the Rasmussen invariant in particular cases. As asides we
identify a class of virtual knots for which the two extensions of the Rasmussen
invariant agree, and show that the extension due to Dye, Kaestner, and Kauffman
is additive with respect to the connect sum.

d-dimensional quantum critical fields with a dynamic exponent $z$ in weakly
squeezed states are studied by the holographic approach. The dual description
is a $n+1$-dimensional probe brane moving in the $d+1$-dimensional asymptotic
Lifshitz geometry with gravitational wave perturbations. Using the holographic
influence functional method, we find that the large coupling constant of the
fields reduces the position uncertainty of the mirror, but enhances the
momentum uncertainty. As such, the product of the position and momentum
uncertainties is independent of the coupling constant. The proper choices of
the phase of the squeezing parameter might reduce the uncertainties,
nevertheless large values of its amplitude always lead to the larger
uncertainties due to the fact that more quanta are excited as compared with the
corresponding normal vacuum and thermal states. In the squeezed vacuum state,
the position and momentum of the mirror gain maximum uncertainties from the
field at the dynamic exponent $z=n+2$ when the same squeezed mode is
considered. As for the squeezed thermal state, the contributions of thermal
fluctuations to the uncertainties decrease as the temperature increases in the
case $1<z<n+2$, whereas for $z>n+2$ the contributions increase as the
temperature increases. These results are in sharp contrast with those in the
environments of the relativistic free field. Some possible observable effects

processes, and in particular supernova feedback after bursts of star formation,
can alter the structure of dark matter haloes and transform primordial cusps
into shallower cores. To assess whether this mechanism offers a solution to the
cusp-core controversy, simulated haloes must be compared to real dark matter
haloes inferred from galaxy rotation curves. For this purpose, two new dark
matter density profiles were recently derived from simulations of galaxies in
complementary mass ranges: the DC14 halo ($10^{10} < M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot}
< 8 \times 10^{11}$) and the coreNFW halo ($10^{7} < M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot}
< 10^{9}$). Both models have individually been found to give good fits to
observed rotation curves. For the DC14 model, however, the agreement of the
predicted halo properties with cosmological scaling relations was confirmed by
one study, but strongly refuted by another. A next question is whether the two
models converge to the same solution in the mass range where both should be
appropriate. To investigate this, we tested the DC14 and cNFW halo models on
the rotation curves of a selection of galaxies with halo masses in the range $4
\times 10^{9}$ - $7 \times 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. We further applied the DC14
model to a set of rotation curves at higher halo masses, up to $9 \times
10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, to verify the agreement with the cosmological scaling
relations. We find that both models are generally able to reproduce the
observed rotation curves, in line with earlier results, and the predicted dark
matter haloes are consistent with the cosmological $c-M_{\text{halo}}$ and
$M_{*}-M_{\text{halo}}$ relations. The DC14 and cNFW models are also in fairly
good agreement with each other, even though DC14 tends to predict slightly less
extended cores and somewhat more concentrated haloes than cNFW.

discovered that energy transfer is more efficient in a dimerized ring than that

production with the subsequent decay of the two Higgs bosons into a pair of

order accuracy in QCD and find that QCD corrections lead to a substantial
increase of the production cross section due to new channels opening up at
next-to-leading order and their inclusion is therefore inevitable for a
reliable prediction. Furthermore, the approximation of massless b-quarks is
scrutinized by calculating the process with both massless and massive b-quarks.
We find that the massive bottom quark leads to a substantial reduction of the

method for power electronic dominated systems. An inconvenient property with
this method is that impedance models are normally referred to their own local
reference frame, and need to be recalculated when referring to a global
reference frame in a given network. This letter presents a simple method for
translating impedance sub-models within a complex network, from their own
reference frames to any given point in the network. What distinguishes this
method is that by using a simple rotational matrix, it only needs impedance
models in their own local reference frames, to be translated to a global
reference in the network. By way of this method, standard circuit analysis
rules for series and parallel connection are applicable, as proven in the
letter. The method is defined and validated for impedances in the dq and
modified sequence domains, and it is shown that the dependency on reference
frame is marginal in the latter. An additional finding from the application of
this method is that components or subsystems with a certain symmetry property
called Mirror Frequency Decoupling are invariant to the choice of reference
frame.

preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can
process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA
can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by
forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness
and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new
framework which match the best-known results for the special case of
forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of
bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity. This is
in stark contrast to the unweighted case, where bidirectional finite automata
are no more expressive but exponentially more succinct than their forward-only

geo-referencing the sampling units, namely the dwellings in which the surveys
are carried. This opens new possibilities in analysing and estimating
unemployment and its spatial distribution across any region. The labor force
survey choose, according to an preestablished sampling criteria, a certain
number of dwellings across the nation and survey the number of unemployed in
these dwellings. Based on this survey, the National Statistical Institute of
Portugal presently uses direct estimation methods to estimate the national
unemployment figures. Recently, there has been increased interest in estimating
these figures in smaller areas. Direct estimation methods, due to reduced
sampling sizes in small areas, tend to produce fairly large sampling variations
therefore model based methods, which tend to ""borrow strength"" from area to
area by making use of the areal dependence, should be favored. These model
based methods tend use areal counting processes as models and typically
introduce spatial dependence through the model parameters by a latent random
effect. In this paper, we suggest modeling the spatial distribution of
residential buildings across Portugal by a Log Gaussian Cox process and the
number of unemployed per residential unit as a mark attached to these random
points. Thus the main focus of the study is to model the spatial intensity
function of this marked point process. Number of unemployed in any region can
then be estimated using a proper functional of this marked point process. The
principal objective of this point referenced method for unemployment estimation
is to get reliable estimates at higher spatial resolutions and at the same time
incorporate in the model the auxiliary information available at residential
units such as average income or education level of individuals surveyed in
these units.

the unseen instance. Traditional multi-label learning algorithms treat each
class label as a logical indicator of whether the corresponding label is
relevant or irrelevant to the instance, i.e., +1 represents relevant to the
instance and -1 represents irrelevant to the instance. Such label represented
by -1 or +1 is called logical label. Logical label cannot reflect different
label importance. However, for real-world multi-label learning problems, the
importance of each possible label is generally different. For the real
applications, it is difficult to obtain the label importance information
directly. Thus we need a method to reconstruct the essential label importance
from the logical multilabel data. To solve this problem, we assume that each
multi-label instance is described by a vector of latent real-valued labels,
which can reflect the importance of the corresponding labels. Such label is
called numerical label. The process of reconstructing the numerical labels from
the logical multi-label data via utilizing the logical label information and
the topological structure in the feature space is called Label Enhancement. In
this paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning framework called LEMLL,
i.e., Label Enhanced Multi-Label Learning, which incorporates regression of the
numerical labels and label enhancement into a unified framework. Extensive
comparative studies validate that the performance of multi-label learning can
be improved significantly with label enhancement and LEMLL can effectively
reconstruct latent label importance information from logical multi-label data.

Therefore, aptamer production and selection for therapeutic and diagnostic
applications is very challenging. Usually they are in vitro generated, but,
recently, computational approaches have been developed for the in silico
selection, with a higher affinity for the specific target. Anyway, the
mechanism of aptamer-ligand formation is not completely clear, and not obvious
to predict. This paper aims to develop a computational model able to describe
aptamer-ligand affinity performance by using the topological structure of the
corresponding graphs, assessed by means of numerical tools such as the
conventional degree distribution, but also the rank-degree distribution
(hierarchy) and the node assortativity. Calculations are applied to the
thrombin binding aptamer (TBA), and the TBA-thrombin complex, produced in the
presence of Na+ or K+. The topological analysis reveals different affinity
performances between the macromolecules in the presence of the two cations, as
expected by previous investigations in literature. These results nominate the
graph topological analysis as a novel theoretical tool for testing affinity.
Otherwise, starting from the graphs, an electrical network can be obtained by
using the specific electrical properties of amino acids and nucleobases.
Therefore, a further analysis concerns with the electrical response, which
reveals that the resistance sensitively depends on the presence of sodium or
potassium thus posing resistance as a crucial physical parameter for testing
affinity.

Majorana neutrinos are an irrefutable proof of physics beyond the Standard
Model. Neutrinoless double electron capture is not a process but a virtual
$\Delta L = 2$ mixing between a parent $^AZ$ atom and a daughter $^A(Z-2)$
excited atom with two electron holes. As a mixing between two neutral atoms and
the observable signal in terms of emitted two-hole X-rays, the strategy,
experimental signature and background are different from neutrinoless double
beta decay. The mixing is resonantly enhanced for almost degeneracy and, under
these conditions, there is no irreducible background from the standard
two-neutrino channel. We reconstruct the natural time history of a nominally
stable parent atom since its production either by nature or in the laboratory.
After the time periods of atom oscillations and the decay of the short-lived
daughter atom, at observable times the relevant ""stationary"" states are the
mixed metastable long-lived state and the non-orthogonal short-lived excited
state, as well as the ground state of the daughter atom. We find that they have
a natural population inversion which is most appropriate for exploiting the
bosonic nature of the observed atomic transitions radiation. Among different
observables of the atom Majorana mixing, we include the enhanced rate of
stimulated X-ray emission from the long-lived metastable state by a
high-intensity X-ray beam: a gain factor of 100 can be envisaged at current
XFEL facilities. On the other hand, the historical population of the daughter
atom ground state can be probed by exciting it with a current pulsed optical
laser, showing the characteristic absorption lines: the whole population can be
excited in a shorter time than typical pulse duration.

a two-step process. First, matter in the stellar atmosphere is levitated by
shock waves, induced by stellar pulsation, and second, this matter is
accelerated by radiation pressure on dust, resulting in a wind. In dynamical
atmosphere and wind models the effects of the stellar pulsation are often
simulated by a simplistic prescription at the inner boundary. We test a sample
of dynamical models for M-type AGB stars, for which we kept the stellar
parameters fixed to values characteristic of a typical Mira variable but varied
the inner boundary condition. The aim was to evaluate the effect on the
resulting atmosphere structure and wind properties. The results of the models
are compared to observed mass-loss rates and wind velocities, photometry, and
radial velocity curves, and to results from 1D radial pulsation models.
Dynamical atmosphere models are calculated, using the DARWIN code for different
combinations of photospheric velocities and luminosity variations. The inner
boundary is changed by introducing an offset between maximum expansion of the
stellar surface and the luminosity and/or by using an asymmetric shape for the
luminosity variation. Models that resulted in realistic wind velocities and
mass-loss rates, when compared to observations, also produced realistic
photometric variations. For the models to also reproduce the characteristic
radial velocity curve present in Mira stars (derived from CO $\Delta v = 3$
lines), an overall phase shift of 0.2 between the maxima of the luminosity and
radial variation had to be introduced. We find that a group of models with
different boundary conditions (29 models, including the model with standard
boundary conditions) results in realistic velocities and mass-loss rates, and
in photometric variations.

variational energy minimization, such that it simultaneously maximizes
photo-consistency and the compatibility of the semantic segmentations across a
set of calibrated images. Label-specific shape priors account for interactions
between the geometry and the semantic labels in 3D. In the semantic
segmentation step, the labels on the mesh are updated with MRF inference, such
that they are compatible with the semantic segmentations in the input images.
Also, this step includes prior assumptions about the surface shape of different
semantic classes. The priors induce a tight coupling, where semantic
information influences the shape update and vice versa. Specifically, we
introduce priors that favor (i) adaptive smoothing, depending on the class
label; (ii) straightness of class boundaries; and (iii) semantic labels that
are consistent with the surface orientation. The novel mesh-based
reconstruction is evaluated in a series of experiments with real and synthetic
data. We compare both to state-of-the-art, voxel-based semantic 3D
reconstruction, and to purely geometric mesh refinement, and demonstrate that
the proposed scheme yields improved 3D geometry as well as an improved semantic
segmentation.

generalized inverses that minimize matrix norms. Such generalized inverses are
famously represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) which happens to
minimize the Frobenius norm. Freeing up the degrees of freedom associated with
Frobenius optimality enables us to promote other interesting properties. In
this Part I, we look at the basic properties of norm-minimizing generalized
inverses, especially in terms of uniqueness and relation to the MPP. We first
show that the MPP minimizes many norms beyond those unitarily invariant, thus
further bolstering its role as a robust choice in many situations. We then
concentrate on some norms which are generally not minimized by the MPP, but
whose minimization is relevant for linear inverse problems and sparse
representations. In particular, we look at mixed norms and the induced $\ell^p
\rightarrow \ell^q$ norms. An interesting representative is the sparse
pseudoinverse which we study in much more detail in Part II. Next, we shift
attention from norms to matrices with interesting behaviors. We exhibit a class
whose generalized inverse is always the MPP-even for norms that normally result
in different inverses-and a class for which many generalized inverses coincide,
but not with the MPP. Finally, we discuss efficient computation of
norm-minimizing generalized inverses.

bias with true mass even in the absence of measurement errors for example
caused by cluster triaxiality and large scale structure. Knowledge of the bias
and scatter values is fundamental for both cluster cosmology and astrophysics.
In this paper we show that the intrinsic scatter of a mass proxy can be
constrained by measurements of the gas fraction because masses with higher
values of intrinsic scatter with true mass produce more scattered gas
fractions. Moreover, the relative bias of two mass estimates can be constrained
by comparing the mean gas fraction at the same (nominal) cluster mass. Our
observational study addresses the scatter between caustic (i.e., dynamically
estimated) and true masses, and the relative bias of caustic and hydrostatic
masses. For these purposes, we used the X-ray Unbiased Cluster Sample, a
cluster sample selected independently from the intracluster medium content with
reliable masses: 34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe,
mostly with $14<\log M_{500}/M_\odot \lesssim 14.5$, and with caustic masses.
We found a 35\% scatter between caustic and true masses. Furthermore, we found
that the relative bias between caustic and hydrostatic masses is small,
$0.06\pm0.05$ dex, improving upon past measurements. The small scatter found
confirms our previous measurements of a highly variable amount of feedback from

with an amplitude ratio in the Fourier transform of 2:1, enabling muon stopping
sites to be traced at the geometric centers of the edges of the crystal
lattice. Characteristic strong and weak magnetic sites are deduced,
additionally verified by mathematical relationships. Results can readily be

Understanding the underlying dynamic characteristics of objects is a key
enabler for achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a method for
pointwise semantic classification of 3D LiDAR data into three classes:
non-movable, movable and dynamic. We concentrate on understanding these
specific semantics because they characterize important information required for
an autonomous system. Non-movable points in the scene belong to unchanging
segments of the environment, whereas the remaining classes corresponds to the
changing parts of the scene. The difference between the movable and dynamic
class is their motion state. The dynamic points can be perceived as moving,
whereas movable objects can move, but are perceived as static. To learn the
distinction between movable and non-movable points in the environment, we
introduce an approach based on deep neural network and for detecting the
dynamic points, we estimate pointwise motion. We propose a Bayes filter
framework for combining the learned semantic cues with the motion cues to infer
the required semantic classification. In extensive experiments, we compare our
approach with other methods on a standard benchmark dataset and report
competitive results in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we show an improvement in the classification of points by

content with reliable masses to measure the mean gas mass fraction and its
scatter, the biases of the X-ray selection on gas mass fraction, and the
covariance between the X-ray luminosity and gas mass. The sample is formed by
34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe, mostly with
$14<\log M_{500}/M_\odot \lesssim 14.5$, and with masses calculated with the
caustic technique. First, we found that integrated gas density profiles have
similar shapes, extending earlier results based on subpopulations of clusters
such as those that are relaxed or X-ray bright for their mass. Second, the
X-ray unbiased selection of our sample allows us to unveil a variegate
population of clusters; the gas mass fraction shows a scatter of $0.17\pm0.04$
dex, possibly indicating a quite variable amount of feedback from cluster to
cluster, which is larger than is found in previous samples targeting
subpopulations of galaxy clusters, such as relaxed or X-ray bright clusters.
The similarity of the gas density profiles induces an almost scatterless
relation between X-ray luminosity, gas mass, and halo mass, and modulates
selection effects in the halo gas mass fraction: gas-rich clusters are
preferentially included in X-ray selected samples. The almost scatterless
relation also fixes the relative scatters and slopes of the $L_X-M$ and
$M_{gas}-M$ relations and makes core-excised X-ray luminosities and gas masses
fully covariant. Therefore, cosmological or astrophysical studies involving
X-ray or SZ selected samples need to account for both selection effects and
covariance of the studied quantities with X-ray luminosity/SZ strength.

carefully designed computational and memory access sequence to reduce atomic

our method using a main-stream GPU is 7-8 times faster than histogram based

according to some partial order fixed by the adversary before the execution,
and study how they affect performance of algorithms. We focus on the Do-All
problem of performing t tasks on a shared channel consisting of p crash-prone
stations. The channel restricts communication: no message is delivered to the
alive stations if more than one station transmits at the same time. The
performance measure for the Do-All problem is work: the total number of
available processor steps during the whole execution. We address the question
of how the ordered adversaries controlling crashes of stations influence work
performance of Do-All algorithms. The first presented algorithm solves Do-All
with work O(t+p\sqrt{t}\log p) against the Linearly-Ordered adversary,
restricted by some pre-defined linear order of crashing stations. Another
algorithm runs against the Weakly-Adaptive adversary, restricted by some
pre-defined set of f crash-prone stations (it can be seen as restricted by the
order being an anti-chain of crashing stations). The work done by this
algorithm is O(t+p\sqrt{t}+p\min{p/(p-f),t}\log p). Both results are close to
the corresponding lower bounds from [CKL]. We generalize this result to the
class of adversaries restricted by a partial order with a maximum anti-chain of
size k and complement with the lower bound. We also consider a class of delayed
adaptive adversaries, who could see random choices with some delay. We give an
algorithm that runs against the 1-RD adversary (seeing random choices of
stations with one round delay), achieving close to optimal O(t+p\sqrt{t}\log^2
p) work complexity. This shows that restricting adversary by even 1 round delay
results in (almost) optimal work on a shared channel.

degrees of freedom are usually coupled through symmetric parameter matrices.
This coupling symmetry is a consequence of time-reversal symmetry of the

resulting noise is called multiplicative. For example, mechanical oscillators
can be coupled through a fluctuating, symmetric matrix of spring ""constants"".
Such systems exhibit well-studied instabilities. In this note, we study the
complementary case of antisymmetric, time-reversal symmetry breaking coupling
that can be realized with Lorentz forces or various gyrators. We consider the
case that these antisymmetric couplings fluctuate. This type of multiplicative
noise does not lead to instabilities in the stationary state but renormalizes
the effective non-equilibrium friction. Fluctuating Lorentz-force-like
couplings also allow to control and rectify heat transfer. A noteworthy
property of this mechanism of producing asymmetric heat flux is that the
controlling couplings do not exchange energy with the system..

on a graph $G$. All players occupy vertices of $G$. The game operates in
rounds; in each round the cops move to neighboring vertices, after which the
robber does the same. The minimum number of cops needed to guarantee capture of
a robber on $G$ is the cop number of $G$, denoted $c(G)$, and the minimum
number of rounds needed for them to do so is the capture time. It has long been
known that the capture time of an $n$-vertex graph with cop number $k$ is
$O(n^{k+1})$. More recently, Bonato, Golovach, Hahn, and Kratochv\'{i}l (2009)
and Gaven\v{c}iak (2010) showed that for $k = 1$, this upper bound is not
asymptotically tight: for graphs with cop number 1, the cop can always win
within $n-4$ rounds. In this paper, we show that the upper bound is tight when
$k \ge 2$: for fixed $k \ge 2$, we construct arbitrarily large graphs $G$
having capture time at least $\left (\frac{\vert V(G) \vert}{40k^4}\right
)^{k+1}$.
  In the process of proving our main result, we establish results that may be
of independent interest. In particular, we show that the problem of deciding
whether $k$ cops can capture a robber on a directed graph is polynomial-time
equivalent to deciding whether $k$ cops can capture a robber on an undirected
graph. As a corollary of this fact, we obtain a relatively short proof of a
major conjecture of Goldstein and Reingold (1995), which was recently proved
through other means by the author (2015). We also show that $n$-vertex
strongly-connected directed graphs with cop number 1 can have capture time
$\Omega(n^2)$, thereby showing that the result of Bonato et al. does not extend

increasing attentions in recent years. It is applicable to imaging at
non-visible wavelengths and imaging under low light conditions. However,
single-pixel imaging has once encountered problems of low reconstruction
quality and long data-acquisition time. This situation has been changed thanks
to the developments of Hadamard single-pixel imaging (HSI) and Fourier
single-pixel imaging (FSI). Both techniques are able to achieve high-quality
and efficient imaging, remarkably improving the applicability of single-pixel
imaging scheme. In this paper, we compare the performances of HSI and FSI with
theoretical analysis and experiments. The results show that FSI is more
efficient than HSI while HSI is more noise-robust than FSI. Our work may
provide a guideline for researchers to choose suitable single-pixel imaging
technique for their applications.

of a spinning electron. From Dirac equation, the relationships among the
expectation values of the Pryce's mass-center operator, the position operator,
the spin operator and the canonical momentum operator are investigated. By
requiring that the center of mass for the classical spinning electron is
related to the expectation value of the Pryce's mass-center operator, one can
obtain a classical expression for the position of the electron. With the
classical equations of motion, the anomalous velocity of a spinning electron
can be easily calculated. It is shown that two factors contribute to the
anomalous velocity: one is dependent on the selection of the Pryce's
mass-center operators and the other is a type-independent velocity expressed by
the rotational velocity and the Lorentz force.

accelerated in the anti-parallel direction by the parallel electric field. At

key for star formation. Mass estimates are crucial to determine gravitational
collapse conditions for the birth of new stellar objects in molecular clouds.
However, most of these estimates rely on dust models that need further
observational constraints from clouds to prestellar and protostellar cores. We
present results of a study of dust emissivity changes based on mm-continuum
data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM-30m telescope. Observing dust
emission at 1.15 mm and 2 mm allows us to constrain the dust emissivity index
($\beta$) in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust spectral energy distribution
(SED) far from its peak emission, where the contribution of other parameters
(i.e. dust temperature) is important. Focusing on the Taurus molecular cloud, a
low-mass star-forming regions in the Gould Belt, we analyze the emission
properties of several distinct objects in the B213 filament: three prestellar
cores, two Class-0/I protostellar cores and one Class-II object. By means of
the ratio of the two NIKA channel-maps, we show that in the Rayleigh-Jeans
approximation the dust emissivity index varies among the objects. For one
prestellar and two protostellar cores, we produce a robust study using Herschel
data to constrain the dust temperature of the sources. By using the Abel
transform inversion technique we get accurate radial $\beta$ profiles. We find
systematic spatial variations of $\beta$ in the protostellar cores that is not
observed in the prestellar core. While in the former case $\beta$ decreases
toward the center, in the latter it remains constant. Moreover, $\beta$ appears
anticorrelated with the dust temperature. We discuss the implication of these
results in terms of dust grain evolution between pre- and protostellar cores.

Curticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC 17] who used a result of Lov\'asz stating that
the number of subgraph embeddings from a graph H to a graph G can be expressed
as such a sum over the lattice of partitions of H. In the first step we
introduce what we call graphically restricted homomorphisms that, inter alia,
generalize subgraph embeddings as well as locally injective homomorphisms. We
provide a complete parameterized complexity dichotomy for counting such
homomorphisms, that is, we identify classes of patterns for which the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), including an algorithm, and prove that all
other pattern classes lead to #W[1]-hard problems. The main ingredients of the
proof are the complexity classification of linear combinations of homomorphisms

NBC Theorem which states that the sign of the M\""obius function over a

imaging (EPI). THEORY AND METHODS: EPI- trajectory auto-corrected image
reconstruction (EPI-TrACR) is an iterative maximum-likelihood technique that
exploits data redundancy provided by multiple receive coils between nearby
lines of k-space to determine and correct line-to-line trajectory delays and
phase errors that cause ghosting artifacts. EPI-TrACR was applied to in vivo
data acquired at 7 Tesla across acceleration and multishot factors, and in a
dynamic time series. The method was efficiently implemented using a segmented
FFT and compared to a conventional calibrated reconstruction. RESULTS: Compared
to conventional calibrated reconstructions, EPI-TrACR reduced ghosting up to
moderate acceleration factors and across multishot factors. It also maintained
low ghosting in a dynamic time series. Averaged over all cases, EPI-TrACR
reduced root-mean-square ghosted signal outside the brain by 27% compared to
calibrated reconstruction. CONCLUSION: EPI-TrACR is effective in automatically
correcting line-to-line delays and phase errors in multishot, accelerated, and
dynamic EPI. While the method benefits from additional calibration data, it is
not a requirement.

$\infty$, namely $U(t):= {\rm e}^{-t}X({\rm e}^t-1)$. We point out that $U$ is
always a (topologically) recurrent Markov process and identify its invariant
measure in terms of the law of the exponential functional $\hat I :=
\int_0^\infty \exp(\hat\xi_s) {\rm d}s$, where $\hat\xi$ is the dual of the

$\xi_1\not \in L^1(\mathbb{P})$. In that case, we determine the family of
L\'evy processes $\xi$ for which $U$ fulfills the conclusions of the

discrete patches of habitat. The species that inhabit the patches interact with
each other through a foodweb, the network of feeding interactions. The
meta-foodweb model proposed by Pillai et al. combines the feeding relationships
at each patch with the dispersal of species between patches, such that the
whole system is represented by a network of networks. Previous work on
meta-foodwebs has focussed on landscape networks that do not have an explicit
spatial embedding, but in real landscapes the patches are usually distributed
in space. Here we compare the dispersal of a meta-foodweb on \ER networks, that
do not have a spatial embedding, and random geometric networks, that do have a
spatial embedding. We found that local structure and large network distances in
spatially embedded networks, lead to meso-scale patterns of patch occupation by
both specialist and omnivorous species. In particular, we found that spatial
separations make the coexistence of competing species more likely. Our results
highlight the effects of spatial embeddings for meta-foodweb models, and the
need for new analytical approaches to them.

developed to calculate the complexity of all integers up to $n$. Currently, the
fastest known algorithm runs in time $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.230175})$ and was given
by J. Arias de Reyna and J. van de Lune in 2014. This algorithm makes use of a
recursive definition given by Guy and iterates through products, $f(d) +

$a$ up to some function of $n$. The rate-limiting factor is iterating through
the sums. We discuss potential improvements to this algorithm via a method that
provides a strong uniform bound on the number of summands that must be

dwarf novae, albeit with an unusually bright and early type mass donor which
outshines the accretion disk and the mass gainer to a degree that many normal

the development of sophisticated rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for
analyzing random structures.
  Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, nearly all
theoretical work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables.
In contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable
occurrence. This can be modeled by a scale-free distribution of the variables,
which results in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.
  We study random k-SAT on n variables, $m=\Theta(n)$ clauses, and a power law
distribution on the variable occurrences with exponent $\beta$. We observe a
satisfiability threshold at $\beta=(2k-1)/(k-1)$. This threshold is tight in
the sense that instances with $\beta\le(2k-1)/(k-1)-\varepsilon$ for any

$\beta\geq(2k-1)/(k-1)+\varepsilon$, the picture is reminiscent of the uniform

order to increase processing speed. Then, the image is segmented by color and
with the binarized version of the image using morphological operations (erosion

regular measured quantum groupoid on a finite basis $\cal G$, we associate a

Kasparov product generalizes to this setting. By applying recent results
concerning actions of regular measured quantum groupoids on a finite basis [S.

normal and tangential components of the internal surface forces per unit area
and gave the tetrahedron argument to prove the existence of stress tensor.
These great achievements form the main part of the foundation of continuum
mechanics. For about two centuries, some versions of tetrahedron argument and a
few other proofs of the existence of stress tensor are presented in every text
on continuum mechanics, fluid mechanics, and the relevant subjects. In this
article, we show the birth, importance, and location of these Cauchy's
achievements, then by presenting the formal tetrahedron argument in detail, for
the first time, we extract some fundamental challenges. These conceptual
challenges are related to the result of applying the conservation of linear
momentum to any mass element, the order of magnitude of the surface and volume
terms, the definition of traction vectors on the surfaces that pass through the
same point, the approximate processes in the derivation of stress tensor, and
some others. In a comprehensive review, we present the different tetrahedron
arguments and the proofs of the existence of stress tensor, discuss the
challenges in each one, and classify them in two general approaches. In the
first approach that is followed in most texts, the traction vectors do not
exactly define on the surfaces that pass through the same point, so most of the
challenges hold. But in the second approach, the traction vectors are defined
on the surfaces that pass exactly through the same point, therefore some of the
relevant challenges are removed. We also study the improved works of Hamel and
Backus, and indicate that the original work of Backus removes most of the
challenges. This article shows that the foundation of continuum mechanics is
not a finished subject and there are still some fundamental challenges.

used metrics have been focused on journal-level measurements, such as the
Impact Factor and the Eigenfactor, as well as on researcher-level metrics like
the Hirsch index (h-index) and i10 index. On the other hand, reliable
article-level metrics are less widespread, and are often reserved to
non-standardized and non-scientific characteristics of individual articles,

These characteristics are known as 'altmetrics'. However, when the number of

firewall becomes a naked singularity. We find some vacuum analytical solutions
in $R^n$-gravity of the firewall-type and use these solutions as concrete
models to study the naked singularities. By using standard quantum theory, we
investigate the Hawking radiation emitted from the black holes with naked
singularities. Here we show that the singularity itself does not destroy

singularity. We discuss the validity of our result in general relativity.
Further our result demonstrates that the temperature of the Hawking radiation

new results on action-angle variables in many different contexts, including
systems on contact manifolds, systems on presymplectic and Dirac manifolds,
action-angle variables near singularities, stochastic systems, and so on. Even
when there are no natural action variables, our approach still leads to useful
normal forms for dynamical systems, which are not necessarily integrable.

criteria. As a real-world illustrative example of these methods, this
manuscript evaluates the problem of detecting statistical dependencies in shot
outcomes in free throw shooting. Over three NBA seasons analyzed, several
players exhibited statistical dependencies in free throw hitting probability of
various types - hot handedness, cold handedness, and error correction. For the
2013-2014 through 2015-2016 NBA seasons, I detected statistical dependencies in
23% of all player-seasons. Focusing on a single player, in two of these three
seasons, LeBron James shot a better percentage after an immediate miss than
otherwise. In those seasons, conditioning on the previous outcome makes for a
more predictive model than treating free throw makes as independent. When
extended to data from the 2016-2017 NBA season specifically for LeBron James, a
model depending on the previous shot (single-step Markovian) does not clearly
beat a model with independent outcomes. An error-correcting variable length
model of two parameters, where James shoots a higher percentage after a missed
free throw than otherwise, is more predictive than either model.

the hydrostatic approximation (balance), derived by performing the formal small

the Navier-Stokes equations, after being scaled appropriately by the small

groups are required in the study of physical systems whose Hamiltonian includes
spin-dependent terms. In the symmetry analysis of such systems, instead of the
irreducible representations of the space groups, it is necessary to consider
the single- and double-valued irreducible representations of the double space
groups. The new section includes databases of symmetry operations (DGENPOS) and
of irreducible representations of the double (point and space) groups
(REPRESENTATIONS DPG and REPRESENTATIONS DSG). The tool DCOMPATIBILITY
RELATIONS provides compatibility relations between the irreducible
representations of double space groups at different k-vectors of the Brillouin

which establishes symmetry relations between localized and extended crystal
states, using representations of the double groups. As an application of this
approach, the program BANDREP calculates the band representations and the
elementary band representations induced from any Wyckoff position of any of the

bands. Recently, the results of BANDREP have been extensively applied in the

sampling errors on uneven outcrop surfaces. Consequently, data collected on

sufficient representation of fracture network characteristic in outcrops.
Recent development of techniques that obtain DOMs from outcrops and extract the
full extent of individual fractures offers the opportunity to address the
problem of performing the conventional sampling methods on uneven outcrop
surfaces. In this study, we propose a new method that performs outcrop fracture
characterization on suppositional planes cutting through DOMs. The
suppositional plane is the best fit plane of the outcrop surface, and the
fracture trace map is extracted on the suppositional plane so that the fracture
network can be further characterized. The amount of sampling errors introduced
by the conventional methods and avoided by the new method on 16 uneven outcrop
surfaces with different roughnesses are estimated. The results show that the
conventional sampling methods don't apply to outcrops other than bedding
surfaces or outcrops whose roughness > 0.04 m, and that the proposed method can
greatly extend the types of outcrop surfaces for outcrop fracture
characterization with the suppositional plane cutting through DOMs.

integro-differential equations d dt [x(t)-- L(x t)] = A[x(t)-- L(x t)]+ G(x t)+
t --$\infty$ a(t-- s)x(s)ds+ f (t), (0 $\le$ t $\le$ 2$\pi$) with the periodic
condition x(0) = x(2$\pi$), where a $\in$ L 1 (R +). Our approach is based on
the M-boundedness of linear operators, Fourier type, B s p,q-multipliers and
Besov spaces.

  Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiments",,"10.1088/1742-5468/aa7ab7",,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is devoted to assess the presence of some regularities in the
magnitudes of the earthquakes in Italy between January $24^{th}$, 2016 and
January $24^{th}$, 2017, and to propose an earthquakes cost indicator. The
considered data includes the catastrophic events in Amatrice and in Marche
region. To our purpose, we implement two typologies of rank-size analysis: the
classical Zipf-Mandelbrot law and the so-called universal law proposed by
Cerqueti and Ausloos (2016). The proposed generic measure of the economic
impact of earthquakes moves from the assumption of the existence of a
cause-effect relation between earthquakes magnitudes and economic costs. At
this aim, we hypothesize that such a relation can be formalized in a functional
way to show how infrastructure resistance affects the cost. Results allow us to
clarify the impact of an earthquake on the social context and might serve for
strengthen the struggle against the dramatic outcomes of such natural
phenomena.

share massive amounts of personal data in such a way that leaves no space for
transparency. When a user needs to achieve a simple task like applying for
college or a driving license, he needs to visit a lot of institutions and
organizations, thus leaving a lot of private data in many places. The same
happens when using the Internet. These privacy issues raised by the centralized
architectures along with the recent developments in the area of serverless
applications demand a decentralized private data layer under user control. We
introduce the Private Data System (PDS), a distributed approach which enables
self-sovereign storage and sharing of private data. The system is composed of
nodes spread across the entire Internet managing local key-value databases. The
communication between nodes is achieved through executable choreographies,
which are capable of preventing information leakage when executing across
different organizations with different regulations in place. The user has full
control over his private data and is able to share and revoke access to
organizations at any time. Even more, the updates are propagated instantly to
all the parties which have access to the data thanks to the system design.
Specifically, the processing organizations may retrieve and process the shared
information, but are not allowed under any circumstances to store it on long
term. PDS offers an alternative to systems that aim to ensure self-sovereignty
of specific types of data through blockchain inspired techniques but face
various problems, such as low performance. Both approaches propose a
distributed database, but with different characteristics. While the
blockchain-based systems are built to solve consensus problems, PDS's purpose
is to solve the self-sovereignty aspects raised by the privacy laws, rules and
principles.
