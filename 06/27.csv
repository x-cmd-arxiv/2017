condensed matter systems. The bottleneck has been the ability to adiabatically
drive an electron coherently across a large portion of the Brillouin zone in a
solid where the scattering is strong and complicated. We break through this
bottleneck and show that high-order sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors
is intimately affected by Berry phases. Electron-hole recollisions and HSG
occur when a near-band gap laser beam excites a semiconductor that is driven by
sufficiently strong terahertz (THz)-frequency electric fields. We carried out
experimental and theoretical studies of HSG from three GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
wells. The observed HSG spectra contain sidebands up to the 90th order, to our
knowledge the highest-order optical nonlinearity observed in solids. The
highest-order sidebands are associated with electron-hole pairs driven
coherently across roughly 10% of the Brillouin zone around the \Gamma point.
The principal experimental claim is a dynamical birefringence: the sidebands,
when the order is high enough (> 20), are usually stronger when the exciting
near-infrared (NIR) and the THz electric fields are polarized perpendicular
than parallel; the sideband intensities depend on the angles between the THz
field and the crystal axes in samples with sufficiently weak quenched disorder;
and the sidebands exhibit significant ellipticity that increases with
increasing sideband order, despite nearly linear excitation and driving fields.
We explain dynamical birefringence by generalizing the three-step model for
high order harmonic generation. The hole accumulates Berry phases due to
variation of its internal state as the quasi-momentum changes under the THz
field. Dynamical birefringence arises from quantum interference between
time-reversed pairs of electron-hole recollision pathways.

enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of

pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned
in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80% have been previously reported
as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g.
between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order
relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived

indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing

optical excitations, excitons, to charg-transfer sites. Measuring exciton
migration has, however, been challenging because of the mismatch between
nanoscale migration lengths and the diffraction limit. In organic
semiconductors, common bulk methods employ a series of films terminated at
quenching substrates, altering the spatioenergetic landscape for migration.
Here we instead define quenching boundaries all-optically with sub-diffraction
resolution, thus characterizing spatiotemporal exciton migration on its native
nanometer and picosecond scales without disturbing morphology. By transforming
stimulated emission depletion microscopy into a time-resolved ultrafast
approach, we measure a 16-nm migration length in CN-PPV conjugated polymer
films. Combining these experiments with Monte Carlo exciton hopping simulations
shows that migration in CN-PPV films is essentially diffusive because intrinsic
chromophore energetic disorder is comparable to inhomogeneous broadening among
chromophores. This framework also illustrates general trends across materials.
Our new approach's sub-diffraction resolution will enable previously
unattainable correlations of local material structure to the nature of exciton
migration, applicable not only to photovoltaic or display-destined organic
semiconductors but also to explaining the quintessential exciton migration
exhibited in photosynthesis.

polariton enhancement of the radiative decay. Unusual features, including
highly anisotropic dispersions and adjustable Fano resonances in reflectance,

adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user.

aim of this paper is to propose a sufficiently general and reasonable formal
criterion for expressiveness, so as to apply not only to model-theoretic
logics, but also to Tarskian and proof-theoretic logics. For model-theoretic
logics there is a standard framework of relative expressiveness, based on the
capacity of characterizing structures, and a straightforward formal criterion
issuing from it. The problem is that it only allows the comparison of those
logics defined within the same class of models. The urge for a broader
framework of expressiveness is not new. Nevertheless, the enterprise is complex
and a reasonable model-theoretic formal criterion is still wanting. Recently
there appeared two criteria in this wider framework, one from Garc\'ia-Matos &
V\""a\""an\""anen and other from L. Kuijer. We argue that they are not adequate.
Their limitations are analyzed and we propose to move to an even broader
framework lacking model-theoretic notions, which we call ""translational
expressiveness"". There is already a criterion in this later framework by
Mossakowski et al., however it turned out to be too lax. We propose some
adequacy criteria for expressiveness and a formal criterion of translational
expressiveness complying with them is given.

monodomain models, local perturbations can propagate at infinite speed. We
address this unrealistic property by developing a hyperbolic bidomain model
that is based on a generalization of Ohm's law with a Cattaneo-type model for
the fluxes. Further, we obtain a hyperbolic monodomain model in the case that
the intracellular and extracellular conductivity tensors have the same
anisotropy ratio. In one spatial dimension, the hyperbolic monodomain model is
equivalent to a cable model that includes axial inductances, and the relaxation
times of the Cattaneo fluxes are strictly related to these inductances. A
purely linear analysis shows that the inductances are negligible, but models of
cardiac electrophysiology are highly nonlinear, and linear predictions may not
capture the fully nonlinear dynamics. In fact, contrary to the linear analysis,
we show that for simple nonlinear ionic models, an increase in conduction
velocity is obtained for small and moderate values of the relaxation time. A
similar behavior is also demonstrated with biophysically detailed ionic models.
Using the Fenton-Karma model along with a low-order finite element spatial
discretization, we numerically analyze differences between the standard
monodomain model and the hyperbolic monodomain model. In a simple benchmark
test, we show that the propagation of the action potential is strongly
influenced by the alignment of the fibers with respect to the mesh in both the
parabolic and hyperbolic models when using relatively coarse spatial
discretizations. Accurate predictions of the conduction velocity require
computational mesh spacings on the order of a single cardiac cell. We also
compare the two formulations in the case of spiral break up and atrial
fibrillation in an anatomically detailed model of the left atrium, and [...].

(coherent state) pairs. The continuous variable halves of each of these pairs
are sent through lossy optical fibre to a middle location, where these states
are then mixed (using a 50:50 beam-splitter) and measured. The detection scheme
we use is to measure one of these modes via vacuum detection, and to measure
the other mode using homodyne detection.
  In this work we show that the Bell state $\lvert\Phi^{+}\rangle=(\lvert

this scheme with high fidelity and entanglement, even when allowing for a small

($\alpha$) of the coherent state when allowing for such loss. We also
investigate the realistic circumstance when the loss is not balanced in the
propagating modes. We demonstrate that a small amount of loss mismatch does not
destroy the overall entanglement, thus demonstrating the physical practicality

This problem arises naturally in many scientific applications, such as

Unfortunately, phase retrieval is ill-posed for almost all one-dimensional

it is common to use a technique called Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating
(FROG). In FROG, the measured data, referred to as FROG trace, is the Fourier
magnitude of the product of the underlying signal with several translated
versions of itself. The FROG trace results in a system of phaseless quartic
Fourier measurements. In this paper, we prove that it suffices to consider only
three translations of the signal to determine almost all bandlimited signals,
up to trivial ambiguities. In practice, one usually also has access to the
signal's Fourier magnitude. We show that in this case only two translations
suffice. Our results significantly improve upon earlier work.

Phenomenological and theoretical considerations suggest that the smallest
viable flavor symmetry (not including any extra U(1) factors) is chiral ${\rm

not distinguish between quarks and leptons. Spontaneous breaking of the

this framework, showing that it is highly constrained by LHC dilepton searches,
meson mixing, $Z$ decays and CKM unitarity. Similar anomalies are predicted for
semileptonic decays of $B$ to lighter mesons, with excesses in the
$ee,\tau\tau$ channels and deficits in $\mu\mu$, but no deviation in $\nu\nu$.

utilizing the conformal algebra and cohomology and (ii) momentum space via an
algebraic formulation in terms of a ring of momenta with kinematics implemented
as an ideal. These frameworks systematically handle redundancies associated
with equations of motion (on-shell) and integration by parts (momentum
conservation).
  We introduce a partition function, termed the Hilbert series, to enumerate
the operator basis--correspondingly, the $S$-matrix--and derive a matrix
integral expression to compute the Hilbert series. The expression is general,
easily applied in any spacetime dimension, with arbitrary field content and
(linearly realized) symmetries.
  In addition to counting, we discuss construction of the basis. Simple
algorithms follow from the algebraic formulation in momentum space. We
explicitly compute the basis for operators involving up to $n=5$ scalar fields.
This construction universally applies to fields with spin, since the operator
basis for scalars encodes the momentum dependence of $n$-point amplitudes.
  We discuss in detail the operator basis for non-linearly realized symmetries.
In the presence of massless particles, there is freedom to impose additional
structure on the $S$-matrix in the form of soft limits. The most na\""ive
implementation for massless scalars leads to the operator basis for pions,
which we confirm using the standard CCWZ formulation for non-linear

a global anomaly which is an analogue of the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions

of the two-dimensional BTI state by explicitly computing the partition function

being generated radiatively at one or more loops. The new couplings, together

Therefore, in these models there are no large mass hierarchies and they can be
tested using different searches, making their detailed phenomenological study
very appealing. In particular, the new particles can be searched for at
colliders and generically induce signals in lepton-flavor and lepton-number
violating processes (in the case of Majorana neutrinos), which are not
independent from reproducing correctly the neutrino masses and mixings. The
main focus of the review is on Majorana neutrinos. We order the allowed theory

approach to lepton number violation, (ii) by the number of loops at which the
Weinberg operator is generated, (iii) within a given loop order, by the
possible irreducible topologies. We also discuss in more detail some popular

radio halos, indicate the presence of high energy cosmic ray (CR) electrons and
cluster-wide magnetic fields. We can predict from theory the expected surface
brightness of a radio halo, given magnetic field and CR density profiles.
Previous studies have shown that the nature of CR transport can radically
effect the expected radio halo emission from clusters (Wiener et al. 2013).
Reasonable levels of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave damping can lead to
significant CR streaming speeds. But a careful treatment of MHD waves in a high
$\beta$ plasma, as expected in cluster environments, reveals damping rates may
be enhanced by a factor of $\beta^{1/2}$. This leads to faster CR streaming and
lower surface brightnesses than without this effect. In this work we re-examine
the simplified, 1D Coma cluster simulations (with radial magnetic fields) of
Wiener et al. (2013) and discuss observable consequences of this high $\beta$
damping. Future work is required to study this effect in more realistic
simulations.

in the language of twisted de Rham theory. There, open string amplitudes are
understood as pairings between twisted cycles and cocycles. Similarly, closed
string amplitudes are given as a pairing between two twisted cocycles. Finally,
objects relating the two types of string amplitudes are the $\alpha'$-corrected
bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes recently defined by the author [arXiv:1610.04230].
We show that they naturally arise as intersection numbers of twisted cycles. In
this work we focus on the combinatorial and topological description of twisted
cycles relevant for string theory amplitudes. In this setting, each twisted
cycle is a polytope, known in combinatorics as the associahedron, together with
an additional structure encoding monodromy properties of string integrals. In
fact, this additional structure is given by higher-dimensional generalizations
of the Pochhammer contour. An open string amplitude is then computed as an
integral of a logarithmic form over an associahedron. We show that the inverse
of the KLT kernel can be calculated from the knowledge of how pairs of
associahedra intersect one another in the moduli space. In the field theory
limit, contributions from these intersections localize to vertices of the
associahedra, giving rise to the bi-adjoint scalar partial amplitudes.

calculate and find extrema of $\Delta \mu$, the difference between the distance
modulus of a $w_z$CDM cosmology and a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology as a
function of redshift, given 68\% likelihood constraints on the parameters

than 0.05 mag from the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at high redshift,
implying that high redshift standard candles will not aid in discerning between
a $w_z$CDM cosmology and the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Conversely, this
implies that if high redshift standard candles are found to be in disagreement

down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH.
According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM
halos which state could results in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies
and thus could be at the origin of the limited stellar mass growth. As a
result, galaxies on the MS can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram
while still forming stars. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to
retrieve the SFR of galaxies from SED fitting is studied. Due to mathematical
limitations, the exp-declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR which
starts to be problematic at z>2. The exp-rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the
opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model
starburst galaxies, but not low values such as those expected at low redshift
for massive galaxies. We show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR
of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are,
however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS but
all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However,
these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS which is
not exhibited by a simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real
data, using a sample of GOODS-South galaxies at 1.5<z<1.2. We propose a SFH
composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population plus a
flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR
of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all z. Furthermore, used on
the GOODS-South sample, the age gradient disappears, showing its dependency on
the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.

pulsed emission comparable to known pulsars and magnetars. In this paper we
show that, if present, a periodic signal would be detectable during the plateau

demonstrate that we would able to detect pulsations from the magnetar central

consider these constraints in the context of the potential emission mechanisms.
The non-detection is consistent with the emission being reprocessed in the

observing angle. As the emission may be reprocessed, the expected periodic
emission may only constitute a few percent of the total emission and be
undetectable in our observations. Applying this strategy to future observations

fossil groups in the $M_{200}=10^{13}-10^{13.5}M_{\odot}/h$ mass regime. We
examine the formation of the two primary features of fossil groups: the large
magnitude gap between their two brightest galaxies, and their exceptionally
luminous brightest group galaxy (BGG). For fossils and non-fossils identified
at $z=0$, we find no difference in their halo mass assembly at early times,
departing from previous studies. However, we do find a significant difference
in the recent accretion history of fossil and non-fossil halos; in particular,
fossil groups show a lack of recent accretion and have in majority assembled
80\% of their $M_{200}(z=0)$ mass before $z\sim 0.4$. For fossils, massive
satellite galaxies accreted during this period have enough time to merge with
the BGG by the present day, producing a more massive central galaxy; and, the
lack of recent group accretion prevents replenishment of the bright satellite
population, allowing for a large magnitude gap to develop within the past few
Gyr. We thus find that the origin of the magnitude gap and overmassive BGG of
fossils in Illustris depends on the recent accretion history of the groups and
merger history of the BGG after their collapse at $z\sim1$. This indicates that
selecting galaxy groups by their magnitude gap does not guarantee obtaining
neither early-forming galaxy systems nor undisturbed central galaxies.

in the calculation of the dark matter induced gamma ray signal, is modified in
the presence of mediators. We also derive the anisotropy which the cosmic ray
positron flux exhibits in this scenario. We finally comment upon a recent
proposal based on long-lived mediators where the effective dark matter density
at the Earth is increased such as to explain the cosmic ray positron anomaly.
We conclude that this scenario is barely tenable as regards the very dense dark
matter spike which it requires at the Galactic center. The associated positron
anisotropy is very small and undetectable, except at high energies where it
reaches a level of order $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$.

position-velocity (PV) diagrams enables a direct comparison with observations

observed PV diagrams. On the other hand, the presence of a central dusty source
might be able to explain the compactness of G2's dust component. In the present
scenario, 5-10 years after pericentre the compact source should decouple from
the previously ejected material, due to the hydrodynamic interaction of the
latter with the surrounding hot and dense atmosphere. In this case, a new
outflow should form, ahead of the previous one, which would be the smoking gun
evidence for an outflow scenario.

becomes the Weyl semimetal by breaking time-reversal symmetry when the nodal
lines enclose time-reversal invariant momenta (type-A nodal lines). We also
discuss an effect of crystallographic symmetries determining the band structure
of the topological nodal-line semimetals. Thanks to protection by the
symmetries, the topological nodal-line semimetals can transit into the spinless
Weyl semimetals or maintain the nodal lines in many crystals after inversion

to reduce the risk of collision. We show that probability dilution is a symptom
of a fundamental deficiency in probabilistic representations of statistical
inference, in which there are propositions that will consistently be assigned a
high degree of belief, regardless of whether or not they are true. We call this
deficiency false confidence. In satellite conjunction analysis, it results in a

identify statistical methods that are free from false confidence. Such
inferences will necessarily be non-probabilistic. In satellite conjunction
analysis, we show that uncertainty ellipsoids satisfy the validity criterion.
Performing collision avoidance maneuvers based on ellipsoid overlap will ensure
that collision risk is capped at the user-specified level. Further, this
investigation into satellite conjunction analysis provides a template for
recognizing and resolving false confidence issues as they occur in other

to interventions. This task is inherently linked to estimating the system's
underlying causal structure. To this end, Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP)
(Peters et al., 2016) has been proposed which learns a causal model exploiting
the invariance of causal relations using data from different environments. When
considering linear models, the implementation of ICP is relatively
straightforward. However, the nonlinear case is more challenging due to the
difficulty of performing nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In
this work, we present and evaluate an array of methods for nonlinear and
nonparametric versions of ICP for learning the causal parents of given target
variables. We find that an approach which first fits a nonlinear model with
data pooled over all environments and then tests for differences between the
residual distributions across environments is quite robust across a large
variety of simulation settings. We call this procedure ""invariant residual
distribution test"". In general, we observe that the performance of all
approaches is critically dependent on the true (unknown) causal structure and
it becomes challenging to achieve high power if the parental set includes more
than two variables. As a real-world example, we consider fertility rate
modelling which is central to world population projections. We explore
predicting the effect of hypothetical interventions using the accepted models
from nonlinear ICP. The results reaffirm the previously observed central causal
role of child mortality rates.

With orbital velocities of 300 km/sec, systems of solids with initial

with radii $r \lesssim$ 100--300 km are ground to dust. This process converts
1-100 km asteroids into 1 $\mu$m particles in $10^2 - 10^6$ yr. Throughout this
evolution, the swarm maintains an initially large vertical scale height $H$.
Adding solids at a rate $\dot{M}$ enables the system to find an equilibrium
where the mass in solids is roughly constant. This equilibrium depends on
$\dot{M}$ and $r_0$, the radius of the largest solid added to the swarm. When
$r_0 \lesssim$ 10 km, this equilibrium is stable. For larger $r_0$, the mass
oscillates between high and low states; the fraction of time spent in high
states ranges from 100% for large $\dot{M}$ to much less than 1% for small
$\dot{M}$. During high states, the stellar luminosity reprocessed by the solids
is comparable to the excess infrared emission observed in many metallic line

  We use nets in an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm that computes both upper and lower

downstream must in turn be able to read out the predictive information from the
spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells. Here we investigate whether a
downstream cell could learn efficient encoding of predictive information in its
inputs in the absence of other instructive signals, from the correlations in
the inputs themselves. We simulate learning driven by spiking activity recorded
in salamander retina. We model a downstream cell as a binary neuron receiving a
small group of weighted inputs and quantify the predictive information between
activity in the binary neuron and future input. Input weights change according
to spike timing-dependent learning rules during a training period. We
characterize the readouts learned under spike timing-dependent learning rules,
finding that although the fixed points of learning dynamics are not associated
with absolute optimal readouts, they convey nearly all the information conveyed
by the optimal readout. Moreover, we find that learned perceptrons transmit
position and velocity information of a moving bar stimulus nearly as
efficiently as optimal perceptrons. We conclude that predictive information is,
in principle, readable from the perspective of downstream neurons in the
absence of other inputs, and consequently suggests that bottom-up prediction
may play an important role in sensory processing.

matter (WDM) or the warmness of baryonic matter in the approximation when the
interaction between the particles is irrelevant. The use of Maxwell
distribution leads to the complicated equation of state of the J\""{u}ttner
model of relativistic ideal gas. The RRG enables one to reproduce the same
physical situation but in a much simpler form. For this reason RRG can be a
useful tool for the theories with some sort of a ""new Physics"". On the other
hand, even without the qualitatively new physical implementations, the RRG can
be useful to describe the general features of WDM in a model-independent way.
In this sense one can see, in particular, to which extent the cosmological
manifestations of WDM may be dependent on its Particle Physics background. In
the present work RRG is used as a complementary approach to derive the main
observational exponents for the WDM in a model-independent way. The only
assumption concerns a non-negligible velocity $v$ for dark matter particles
which is parameterized by the warmness parameter $b$. The relatively high
values of $b$ ( $b^2\gtrsim 10^{-6}$) erase the radiation (photons and
neutrinos) dominated epoch and cause an early warm matter domination after
inflation. Furthermore, RRG approach enables one to quantify the lack of power
in linear matter spectrum at small scales and in particular, reproduces the
relative transfer function commonly used in context of WDM with accuracy of
$\lesssim 1\%$. A warmness with $b^2\lesssim 10^{-6}$ (equivalent to $v\lesssim
300 km/s$) does not alter significantly the CMB power spectrum and is in
agreement with the background observational tests.

Two-Stage Luce model (2SLM), a discrete choice model introduced by Echenique
and Saito (2018) that generalizes the multinomial logit model (MNL). The model
employs an utility function as in the the MNL, and a dominance relation between
products. When consumers are offered an assortmentS , they first discard all
dominated products in S and then select one of the remaining products using the
standard MNL. This model may violate the regularity condition, which states
that the probability of choosing a product cannot increase if the offer set is
enlarged. Therefore, the 2SLM falls outside the large family of discrete choice
models based on random utility which contains almost all choice models studied
in revenue management. We prove that the assortment problem under the 2SLM is
polynomial-time solvable. Moreover, we show that the capacitated assortment
optimization problem is NP-hard and but it admits polynomial-time algorithms
for the relevant special cases cases where (1) the dominance relation is
attractiveness-correlated and (2) its transitive reduction is a forest. The
proofs exploit a strong connection between assortments under the 2SLM and
independent sets in comparability graphs. Finally, we study the associated
joint pricing and assortment problem under this model. First, we show that well
known optimal pricing policy for the MNL can be arbitrarily bad. Our main
result in this section is the development of an efficient algorithm for this
pricing problem. The resulting optimal pricing strategy is simple to describe:
it assigns the same price for all products, except for the one with the highest
attractiveness and as well as for the one with the lowest attractiveness.

multi-layered body with an arbitrary number of homogeneous layers. Starting
with the static equilibrium figure, modified to include tide and differential
rotation, and using the Newtonian creep approach, we find the dynamical
equilibrium figure of the deformed body, which allows us to calculate the tidal
potential and the forces acting on the tide generating body, as well as the
rotation and orbital elements variations. In the particular case of the
two-layer model, we study the tidal synchronization when the gravitational
coupling and the friction in the interface between the layers is added. For
high relaxation factors (low viscosity), the stationary solution of each layer
is synchronous with the orbital mean motion (n) when the orbit is circular, but
the spin rates increase if the orbital eccentricity increases. For low
relaxation factors (high viscosity), as in planetary satellites, if friction
remains low, each layer can be trapped in different spin-orbit resonances with
frequencies n/2,n,3n/2,... . We apply the theory to Titan. The main results
are: i) the rotational constraint does not allow us confirm or reject the
existence of a subsurface ocean in Titan; and ii) the crust-atmosphere exchange
of angular momentum can be neglected. Using the rotation estimate based on
Cassini's observation, we limit the possible value of the shell relaxation
factor, when a subsurface ocean is assumed, to 10^-9 Hz, which correspond to a
shell's viscosity 10^18 Pa s, depending on the ocean's thickness and viscosity
values. In the case in which the ocean does not exist, the maximum shell
relaxation factor is one order of magnitude smaller and the corresponding
minimum shell's viscosity is one order higher.

molecular scale height as defined by the Half Width at Half Maxima (HWHM) in
the spiral galaxy NGC 7331. The scale height of the molecular gas was found to
vary between $\sim 100-200$ pc depending on the radius and assumed velocity
dispersion. The solutions of the hydrostatic equation and the observed rotation
curve were used to produce a dynamical model and consequently a simulated
column density map of the molecular disk. The modelled molecular disk found to
match with the observed one reasonably well except at the outer disk regions.
The molecular disk of NGC 7331 was projected to an inclination of 90$^o$ to
estimate its observable edge-on thickness (HWHM), which was found to be $\sim
500$ pc. With an HWHM of $\sim 500$ pc, the observed edge-on extent of the
molecular disk was seen to be $\sim$ 1 kpc from the mid-plane. This indicates
that in a typical galaxy, hydrostatic equilibrium, in fact, can produce a few
kilo-parsec thick observable molecular disk which was thought to be difficult
to explain earlier.

be recognized in isolation can no longer be recognized when other objects,
called flankers, are placed close to it. In this work, we study the effect of
crowding in artificial Deep Neural Networks for object recognition. We analyze
both standard deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as well as a new
version of DCNNs which is 1) multi-scale and 2) with size of the convolution
filters change depending on the eccentricity wrt to the center of fixation.
Such networks, that we call eccentricity-dependent, are a computational model
of the feedforward path of the primate visual cortex. Our results reveal that
the eccentricity-dependent model, trained on target objects in isolation, can
recognize such targets in the presence of flankers, if the targets are near the
center of the image, whereas DCNNs cannot. Also, for all tested networks, when
trained on targets in isolation, we find that recognition accuracy of the
networks decreases the closer the flankers are to the target and the more
flankers there are. We find that visual similarity between the target and
flankers also plays a role and that pooling in early layers of the network
leads to more crowding. Additionally, we show that incorporating the flankers
into the images of the training set does not improve performance with crowding.

the magnitude of the spin polarization of the double quantum dot, as measured

in such system: there exists a billiard trajectory on which the energy tends to

space near a homoclinic intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of

studies of the Arnold diffusion; the scattering maps defined by the projection
along the strong stable and strong unstable foliations $W^{ss,uu}$ of the

its relative moment-of-inertia $I^* \equiv {I}_p/{I}_f$. This supersedes the
current understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\approx$ 0.54) alone
triggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations. Using over 144 combinations
of ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering
very heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire
data collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal
number, $St_t \approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a
regime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime
to the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from
the classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.
Thus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and
wakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.

long-term microgravity conditions. The objectives of the experiment were (a) to
observe collisions between mm-sized particles at relative velocities of
$<$1~cm/s, and (b) to study the formation and disruption of particle clusters
for different particle types and collision velocities. Four types of particles
were used: mm-sized acrylic, glass, and copper beads, and 0.75 mm-sized JSC-1
lunar regolith simulant grains. The particles were placed in sample cells
carved out of an aluminum tray. This tray was attached to one side of the
payload casing with three springs. Every 60~s, the tray was agitated and the
resulting collisions between the particles in the sample cells were recorded by
the experiment camera.
  During the 18 months the payload stayed on ISS, we obtained 158 videos, thus
recording a great number of collisions. The average particle velocities in the
sample cells after each shaking event were around 1 cm/s. After shaking
stopped, the inter-particle collisions damped the particle kinetic energy in
less than 20~s, reducing the average particle velocity to below 1 mm/s, and
eventually slowing them to below our detection threshold. As the particle
velocity decreased, we observed the transition from bouncing to sticking
collisions. We recorded the formation of particle clusters at the end of each
experiment run. This paper describes the design and performance of the
NanoRocks ISS payload.

$\beta(\omega)$ can also be determined from the experimental frequencies, we

function $\beta(\omega)$, and with the purpose of quantifying the magnitude of
the ionization processes occurring in the outer layers of these stars, we
define two indexes, $\Delta \beta_1$ and $\Delta \beta_2$. These indexes allow
us to connect the microphysics of the interior of the star with macroscopic
observable characteristics. Motivated by the distinct magnetic activity
behaviors of F-stars, we studied the relation between the star's rotation
period and these indexes. We found a trend, in the form of a power-law
dependence, that favors the idea that ionization is acting as an underlying
mechanism, which is crucial for understanding the relation between rotation and

the QFI is completely protected in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes by
increasing the number of additional qubits. Besides, the phenomena of QFI
display monotonic decay or non-monotonic with revival oscillations depending on
the number of additional qubits in a common dissipative reservoir. Moreover, we
extend this model to investigate the effect of additional qubits N-1 and the
initial conditions of the system on the geometric phase. It is found that, the
robustness of GP against the dissipative reservoir has been demonstrated by
increasing gradually the number of additional qubits. Besides, the GP is
sensitive to the initial parameter theta, and possesses symmetric in a range

investigators believe that the geology indicates the presence of surface water,
disagreement has persisted regarding how warm and wet the surface must have
been and how long such conditions may have existed. Although the geologic
evidence is most easily explained by a persistently warm climate, the perceived
difficulty that climate models have in generating warm surface conditions has
seeded various models that assume a cold and glaciated early Mars punctuated by
transient warming episodes. However, I use a single-column radiative-convective
climate model to show that it is relatively more straightforward to satisfy
warm and relatively unglaciated early Mars conditions, requiring only about 1
percent H2 and 3 bar CO2 or about 20 percent H2 and 0.55 bar CO2. In contrast,
the reflectivity of surface ice greatly increases the difficulty to transiently
warm an initially frozen surface. Surface pressure thresholds required for warm
conditions increase about 10 to 60 percent for transient warming models,
depending on ice cover fraction. No warm solution is possible for ice cover
fractions exceeding 40, 70, and 85 percent for mixed snow and ice and 25, 35,
and 49 percent for fresher snow and ice at H2 concentrations of 3, 10, and 20
percent, respectively. If high temperatures (298 to 323 K) were required to
produce the observed surface clay amounts on a transiently warm early Mars
(Bishop et al), I show that such temperatures would have required surface
pressures that exceed available paleopressure constraints for nearly all H2
concentrations considered (1 to 20 percent). I then argue that a warm and
semi-arid climate remains the simplest and most logical solution to Mars
paleoclimate.

has continuously increased and cost has continuously decreased over decades.
This positive growth is a result of two key trends: (1) effective process
technology scaling, and (2) multi-level (e.g., MLC, TLC) cell data coding.
Unfortunately, the reliability of raw data stored in flash memory has also
continued to become more difficult to ensure, because these two trends lead to
(1) fewer electrons in the flash memory cell (floating gate) to represent the
data and (2) larger cell-to-cell interference and disturbance effects. Without
mitigation, worsening reliability can reduce the lifetime of NAND flash memory.
As a result, flash memory controllers in solid-state drives (SSDs) have become
much more sophisticated: they incorporate many effective techniques to ensure
the correct interpretation of noisy data stored in flash memory cells.
  In this article, we review recent advances in SSD error characterization,
mitigation, and data recovery techniques for reliability and lifetime
improvement. We provide rigorous experimental data from state-of-the-art MLC
and TLC NAND flash devices on various types of flash memory errors, to motivate
the need for such techniques. Based on the understanding developed by the
experimental characterization, we describe several mitigation and recovery
techniques, including (1) cell-to-cell interference mitigation, (2) optimal
multi-level cell sensing, (3) error correction using state-of-the-art
algorithms and methods, and (4) data recovery when error correction fails. We
quantify the reliability improvement provided by each of these techniques.
Looking forward, we briefly discuss how flash memory and these techniques could
evolve into the future.

include spin polarized current injections from ferromagnetic metals, spin Hall

current generation based on nonlinear phenomena. By using Boltzmann transport
theory, we show that a simple application of the electric field $\bf{E}$
induces spin current proportional to $\bf{E^2}$ in noncentrosymmetric
spin-orbit coupled systems. We demonstrate that the nonlinear spin current of
the proposed mechanism is supported in the surface state of three-dimensional
topological insulators and two-dimensional semiconductors with the Rashba
and/or Dresselhaus interaction. In the latter case, the angular dependence of
the nonlinear spin current can be manipulated by the direction of the electric
field and by the ratio of the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. We find that
the magnitude of the spin current largely exceeds those in the previous methods
for a reasonable magnitude of the electric field. Furthermore, we show that
application of AC electric fields (e.g. terahertz light) leads to the
rectifying effect of the spin current where DC spin current is generated. These
findings will pave a new route to manipulate the spin current in
noncentrosymmetric crystals.

is based on a novel Class Adapting Principal Directions (CAPD) concept that
allows multiple embeddings of image features into a semantic space. Given an
image, our method produces one principal direction for each seen class. Then,
it learns how to combine these directions to obtain the principal direction for
each unseen class such that the CAPD of the test image is aligned with the
semantic embedding of the true class, and opposite to the other classes. This
allows efficient and class-adaptive information transfer from seen to unseen
classes. In addition, we propose an automatic process for selection of the most
useful seen classes for each unseen class to achieve robustness in zero-shot
learning. Our method can update the unseen CAPD taking the advantages of few
unseen images to work in a few-shot learning scenario. Furthermore, our method
can generalize the seen CAPDs by estimating seen-unseen diversity that
significantly improves the performance of generalized zero-shot learning. Our
extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently
achieves superior performance in zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and

In this case it satisfies a nonlinear ODE that has the Painlev\'e property and
its solutions can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'e transcendent $P_6$.
We also study the corresponding classical analogs of these potentials. The

the simulation to investigate the effect of mass of colliding clouds and
collision speeds on the resulting core population. Our results demonstrate that
smaller cloud property is more important for results of cloud cloud collisions.
The mass function of formed cores can be approximated by a power law relation
with index $\gamma$ = -1.6 in slower cloud cloud collisions ($v \sim 5 $ km/s),
in good agreement with observation of MCs. A faster relative velocity increases
the number of cores formed in the early stage of collisions and shortens gas
accretion phase of cores in the shocked region, leading to suppression of core
growth. The bending point appears in the high mass part of the core mass
function and the bending point mass decreases with increasing of the collision
velocity for the same combination of colliding clouds. The high mass part of
the core mass function than the bending point mass can be approximated by a
power law with $\gamma$ = -2.3 that is very similar to the power index of the
massive part of the observed initial stellar mass function. We discuss
implication of our results for the massive star formation in our Galaxy.

However, human
interpretation limits high throughput analysis, limiting echocardiography from
reaching its full clinical and research potential for precision medicine. Deep
learning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in
analyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to
echocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view,
multi modality format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer
assisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can
learn to recognize standard views. To this end, we anonymized 834,267
transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51
percent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them
according to standard views. Images covered a range of real world clinical
variation. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used
supervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty
percent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved
for validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images
from each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent
overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution
images, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5
percent for board-certified echocardiographers. Confusional matrices, occlusion
experiments, and saliency mapping showed that the model finds recognizable
similarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image
features. In conclusion, deep neural networks can classify essential
echocardiographic views simultaneously and with high accuracy. Our results
provide a foundation for more complex deep learning assisted echocardiographic

participation during the active phase as well as on sufficient follow-up during
the surveillance phase when newly infested houses or infested houses that had
not participated in the active phase will receive treatment. Queueing models
which are widely used in operations management give us a mathematical
representation of the operational efforts needed to contain the spread of
infestation. By modeling the queue as consisting of all infested houses in a
given locality, we capture the dynamics of the insect population due to
prevalence of infestation and to the additional growth of infestation by
redispersion, i.e. by the spread of infestation to previously uninfested houses
during the wait time for treatment. In contrast to traditional queueing models,
houses waiting for treatment are not known but must be identified through a
search process by public health workers. Thus, both the arrival rate of houses
to the queue as well as the removal rate from the queue depend on the current
level of infestation. We incorporate these dependencies through a load
dependent queueing model which allows us to estimate the long run average rate
of removing houses from the queue and therefore the cost associated with a

(Ni, Pd, Pt) group and the (Se, Te) group, the band gap increases with
increasing cation size. However, no observed chemical trend with respect to
cation size for band gap was found for the (Si, Sn, Ge, Pb) group. The findings
in this work provide guidelines for the design of halide A$_2$BX$_6$ compounds
for potential photovoltaic applications.

solution achieves fully autonomous perception and locomotion on slippery

neighboring nuclei on the upper left corner and the lower right corner
respectively. We empirically obtained a new residual interaction formula of
even-$A$ ($A$ is the mass number) nuclei, and it is an revision based on the
existing empirical local formula of the proton-neutron interactions between the
last proton and the last neutron ($\delta V_{1p-1n}$). We then calculated the
even-$A$ nuclear masses. The differences between our calculated values and the
AME2012 database show that the root-mean-squared deviations (RMSD) are small
(for even-$A$ nuclei: $A$ $\geq$ 42, RMSD $\approx$ 161 keV; $A$ $\geq$ 100,
RMSD $\approx$ 125 keV), while for heavy nuclei, some of our calculated values
can reach an accuracy of a few tens of keV. With our residual interaction
formula including one parameter, we have successfully predicted some unknown
masses. Some of our predicted values compared well with the experimental values

medium and heavy nuclei are comparable to those of the AME2012 (AME2016)

subject of research, with graphene as the most prominent example. However, the
Dirac points in existing 2D materials, including graphene, are vulnerable
against spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, based on first-principles calculations
and theoretical analysis, we propose a new family of stable 2D materials, the
HfGeTe-family monolayers, which represent the first example to host so-called
spin-orbit Dirac points (SDPs) close to the Fermi level. These Dirac points are
special in that they are formed only under significant SOC, hence they are
intrinsically robust against SOC. We show that the existence of a pair of SDPs
are dictated by the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry of the system, which are
very robust under various types of lattice strains. The energy, the dispersion,
and the valley occupation around the Dirac points can be effectively tuned by
strain. We construct a low-energy effective model to characterize the Dirac
fermions around the SDPs. Furthermore, we find that the material is
simultaneously a 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological metal, which possesses
nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant in the bulk and spin-helical edge states on
the boundary. From the calculated exfoliation energies and mechanical
properties, we show that these materials can be readily obtained in experiment
from the existing bulk materials. Our result reveals HfGeTe-family monolayers
as a promising platform for exploring spin-orbit Dirac fermions and novel
topological phases in two-dimensions.

first is the analysis of interventions by a social planner with a networked
objective function while the second is network routing games with atomic
players and information constraints. By exploiting a primal reformulation of a
sensitivity analysis result for variational inequalities, we provide a
characterization of the sensitivity of the Nash equilibrium that depends on

the mapping associated with the game. As the second main result, we derive
sufficient conditions that guarantee this strong monotonicity property in

dependent mixed state in NaFe1-xCoxAs (x=0.01, 0.03, and 0.07) crystals using
the magnetoresistivity in the case of B//c-axis and B//ab-plane. It was found
clearly that irrespective of the doping ratio, magnetoresistivity showed a
distinct tail just above the Tc, offset associated with the thermally activated
flux flow (TAFF) in our crystals. Furthermore, in TAFF region the temperature
dependence of the activation energy follows the relation U(T, B)=U_0 (B)
(1-T/T_c )^q with q=1.5 in all studied crystals. The magnetic field dependence
of the activation energy follows a power law of U_0 (B)~B^(-{\alpha}) where the
exponent {\alpha} is changed from a low value to a high value at a crossover
field of B=~2T, indicating the transition from collective to plastic pinning in
the crystals. Finally, it is suggested that the 3D vortex phase is the dominant
phase in the low-temperature region as compared to the TAFF region in our

The mQAP is defined as having as input several flows between the facilities

In this study, we propose PasMoQAP, a parallel asynchronous memetic algorithm
to solve the Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem. PasMoQAP is based on
an island model that structures the population by creating sub-populations. The

inverse Compton-scattering of soft photons by the pulsar wind. The soft photons
are from an accretion disk around the pulsar, which is composed by the matter
from CD captured by the pulsar's gravity at disk-crossing before the

CD is not high enough so that accretion is prevented by the pulsar wind shock.

molecular gas consisting of two components with velocity difference of {$\sim
5$ \kms}. One of them, the small cloud, has typical velocity of {$-63$ \kms} \
and the other, the large cloud, has that of $-58$ \kms. The large cloud has a
nearly circular intensity depression whose size is similar to the small cloud.
We present an interpretation that the cavity was created by a collision between
the two clouds and the collision compressed the gas into a dense layer
elongated along the western rim of the small cloud. In this scenario, the O
stars including those in the three Spitzer bubbles were formed in the interface
layer compressed by the collision. By assuming that the relative motion of the
clouds has a tilt of \timeform{45D} to the line of sight, we estimate that the
collision continued over the last 1 Myr at relative velocity of $\sim$10 \kms.
In the S116--117--118 system the \HII \ regions are located outside of the
cavity. This morphology is ascribed to the density-bound distribution of the
large cloud which made the \HII \ regions more easily expand toward the outer
part of the large cloud than inside of the cavity. The present case proves that
a cloud-cloud collision creates a cavity without an action of O star feedback,
and suggests that the collision-compressed layer is highly filamentary.

half-filled superconducting bands of special symmetry and is evidently
responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs in all superconductors. Here we
consider this new mechanism within an outer magnetic field. We show that in the
magnetic field the constraining forces produce Cooper pairs of non-vanishing
total momentum with the consequence that an electric current flows within the

leads to the Meissner effect. This theoretical result is confirmed by the

modeling of discrete tracers of the large scale structure. Recent work has
shown that the shot noise in the halo power spectrum becomes increasingly
sub-Poissonian at high mass. Interestingly, while the halo model predicts a
shot noise power spectrum in qualitative agreement with the data, it leads to
an unphysical white noise in the cross halo-matter and matter power spectrum.
In this work, we show that absorbing all the halo model sources of shot noise
into the halo fluctuation field leads to meaningful predictions for the shot
noise contributions to halo clustering statistics and remove the unphysical
white noise from the cross halo-matter statistics. Our prescription
straightforwardly maps onto the general bias expansion, so that the
renormalized shot noise terms can be expressed as combinations of the halo
model shot noises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Poissonian
contributions are related to volume integrals over correlation functions and
their response to long-wavelength density perturbations. This leads to a new
class of consistency relations for discrete tracers, which appear to be
satisfied by our reformulation of the halo model. We test our theoretical
predictions against measurements of halo shot noise bispectra extracted from a
large suite of numerical simulations. Our model reproduces qualitatively the
observed sub-Poissonian noise, although it underestimates the magnitude of this
effect.

For mmWave channels the virtual channel matrix obtained by applying fixed
discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) beamformers at both the transmitter and the
receiver is sparse. This results into a sparsity of the resulting multiple
access channel, which is exploited to simplify scheduling, first establishing
an interference graph among users and then grouping users according to their
orthogonality. The original scheduling problem is solved using a graph-coloring
algorithm on the interference graph in order to select sub-sets of orthogonal
VR users. Two options are considered for FR users: either they are chosen
orthogonal to VR users or non-orthogonal. A waterfilling algorithm is then used
to allocate power to the FR users.

simplest version of these models, Yukawa couplings are just modular forms and
the only source of flavour symmetry breaking is the vacuum expectation value of
a single complex field, the modulus. In the special case where modular forms

The paper presents an explicit parametric description of the band structure
governing the free propagation of elastic waves. By virtue of multiparametric
perturbation techniques, sensitivity analyses are performed to achieve
analytical asymptotic approximation of the dispersion functions. The parametric
conditions for the existence of full band gaps in the low-frequency range are
established. Furthermore, the band gap amplitude is analytically assessed in

functions or surfaces in applications ranging from regression to classification
to spatial processes. Although there is an increasingly vast literature on
applications, methods, theory and algorithms related to GPs, the overwhelming
majority of this literature focuses on the case in which the input domain
corresponds to a Euclidean space. However, particularly in recent years with
the increasing collection of complex data, it is commonly the case that the
input domain does not have such a simple form. For example, it is common for
the inputs to be restricted to a non-Euclidean manifold, a case which forms the
motivation for this article. In particular, we propose a general extrinsic
framework for GP modeling on manifolds, which relies on embedding of the
manifold into a Euclidean space and then constructing extrinsic kernels for GPs
on their images. These extrinsic Gaussian processes (eGPs) are used as prior
distributions for unknown functions in Bayesian inferences. Our approach is
simple and general, and we show that the eGPs inherit fine theoretical
properties from GP models in Euclidean spaces. We consider applications of our
models to regression and classification problems with predictors lying in a
large class of manifolds, including spheres, planar shape spaces, a space of
positive definite matrices, and Grassmannians. Our models can be readily used
by practitioners in biological sciences for various regression and
classification problems, such as disease diagnosis or detection. Our work is
also likely to have impact in spatial statistics when spatial locations are on
the sphere or other geometric spaces.

unveil cosmological information it is indispensable to understand the HI
distribution with respect to dark matter. Using a full one-loop derivation of
the power spectrum of HI, we show that higher order corrections change the
amplitude and shape of the power spectrum on typical cosmological (linear)
scales. These effects go beyond the expected dark matter non-linear corrections
and include non-linearities in the way the HI signal traces dark matter. We
show that, on linear scales at z = 1, the HI bias drops by up to 15% in both
real and redshift space, which results in underpredicting the mass of the halos
in which HI lies. Non-linear corrections give rise to a significant scale
dependence when redshift space distortions arise, in particular on the scale
range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). There is a factor of 5
difference between the linear and full HI power spectra over the full BAO scale
range, which will modify the ratios between the peaks. This effect will also be
seen in other types of survey and it will be essential to take it into account
in future experiments in order to match the expectations of precision

be discrepant by a factor of approximately two relative to those calculated

Galaxies with such high O32 are thought to be promising candidates for leaking
large amounts of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation and, at high redshifts, for
contributing to the reionization of the Universe. The equivalent widths
EW(Hbeta) of the Hbeta emission line in the studied galaxies are very high,
~350-520A, indicating very young ages for the star formation bursts, <3 Myr.
All galaxies are characterized by low oxygen abundances 12+logO/H = 7.46 - 7.79
and low masses Mstar~10^6-10^7 Msun, much lower than the Mstar for known
low-redshift LyC leaking galaxies, but probably more typical of the
hypothetical population of low-luminosity dwarf LyC leakers at high redshifts.
A broad Halpha emission line is detected in the spectra of all CSFGs, possibly
related to expansion motions of supernova remnants. Such rapid ionized gas
motions would facilitate the escape of the resonant Ly$\alpha$ emission from
the galaxy. We show that high O32 may not be a sufficient condition for LyC
leakage and propose new diagnostics based on the HeI 3889/6678 and 7065/6678
emission-line flux ratios. Using these diagnostics we find that three CSFGs in
our sample are likely to have density-bounded HII regions and are thus leaking
large amounts of LyC radiation. The amount of leaking LyC radiation is probably
much lower in the other two CSFGs.

reparametrizations of the reference configuration, suitably adapted to the
geometrically linear setting. The model features a defect energy contribution
which is quadratic in the tensor $inc(\epsilon_p)$ and it contains isotropic
hardening based on the rate of the symmetric infinitesimal plastic strain
tensor $\dot{\epsilon_p}$. We motivate the new model by introducing a novel
rotational invariance requirement in gradient plasticity, which we call
micro-randomness, suitable for the description of polycrystalline aggregates on
a mesoscopic scale and not coinciding with classical isotropy requirements.
This new condition effectively reduces the increments of the non-symmetric
infinitesimal plastic distortion $\dot{p}$ to their symmetric counterpart
$\dot{\epsilon_p}$. In the polycrystalline case, this condition is a statement
about insensitivity to arbitrary superposed grain rotations. We formulate a
mathematical existence result for a suitably regularized non-gauge-invariant

the reference configuration including infinitesimal conformal mappings.

handed out specially programmed smartphones to study participants, we developed
an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data from participants
own smartphones. In this study, we compared the networks estimated with the
smartphone app to those obtained from sociometric badges and self-report data.
Participants (n=21) installed the app on their phone and wore a sociometric
badge during office hours. Proximity data was collected for 4 weeks. A
contingency table revealed a significant association between proximity data
(rho = 0.17, p<0.0001), but the marginal odds were higher for the app (8.6%)
than for the badges (1.3%), indicating that dyads were more often detected by
the app. We then compared the networks that were estimated using the proximity
and self-report data. All three networks were significantly correlated,
although the correlation with self-reported data was lower for the app (rho =
0.25) than for badges (rho = 0.67). The scanning rates of the app varied
considerably between devices and was lower on iOS than on Android. The
association between the app and the badges increased when the network was
estimated between participants whose app recorded more regularly. These
findings suggest that the accuracy of proximity networks can be further
improved by reducing missing data and restricting the interpersonal distance at
which interactions are detected.

agent has discrete and/or continuous decision variables that need to be set so
as to optimize the sum of linear local cost functions, in presence of linear
local and global constraints. The problem reduces to a Mixed Integer Linear
Program (MILP) that is here addressed according to a decentralized iterative
scheme based on dual decomposition, where each agent determines its decision
vector by solving a smaller MILP involving its local cost function and
constraint given some dual variable, whereas a central unit enforces the global
coupling constraint by updating the dual variable based on the tentative primal
solutions of all agents. An appropriate tightening of the coupling constraint
through iterations allows to obtain a solution that is feasible for the
original MILP. The proposed approach is inspired by a recent method to the MILP
approximate solution via dual decomposition and constraint tightening, and
presents the advantage of guaranteeing feasibility in finite-time and providing
better performance guarantees. The two approaches are compared on a numerical
example on plug-in electric vehicles optimal charging.

value of internal energy, structure, and free energy can be well characterized
by a single specially-selected microscopic structure. This finding relies on
the fact that configurational density of states (CDOS) for typical classical
system before applying interatomic interaction can be well characterized by
multidimensional gaussian distribution. Although gaussian distribution is an
well-known and widely-used function in diverse fields, it is quantitatively
unclear why the CDOS takes gaussian when system size gets large, even for
projected CDOS onto a single chosen coordination. Here we demonstrate that for
equiatomic binary system, one-dimensional CDOS along coordination of pair
correlation can be reasonably described by gaussian distribution under an
appropriate condition, whose deviation from real CDOS mainly reflects the
existence of triplet closed link consisting of the pair figure considered. The
present result thus significantly makes advance in analytic determination of
the special microscopic states to characterized macroscopic physical property
in equilibrium state.

negative pressure generated by evaporation of water from leaves. Nevertheless,
trees pose multiple challenges and seem to live in unphysical conditions: the
negative pressure increases cavitation; it is possible to obtain a water
equilibrium between connected parts where one is at a positive pressure and the
other one is at negative pressure; no theory is able to satisfactorily account
for the refilling of vessels after embolism events. A theoretical form of our
paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology is proposed together with new
results: a continuum mechanics model of the disjoining pressure concept refers
to the Derjaguin School of physical chemistry. A comparison between liquid
behaviour both in tight-filled microtubes and in liquid thin-films is offered
when the pressure is negative in liquid bulks and is positive in liquid
thin-films and vapour bulks. In embolized xylem microtubes, when the air-vapour
pocket pressure is greater than the air-vapour bulk pressure, a refilling flow
occurs between the air-vapour domains to empty the air-vapour pockets although
the liquid-bulk pressure remains negative. The model has a limit of validity
taking the maximal size of trees into account. These results drop inkling that
the disjoining pressure is an efficient tool to study biological liquids in
contact with substrates at a nanoscale range.

  hyperbolic surfaces",,,,,"math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A celebrated result of Mirzakhani states that, if $(S,m)$ is a finite area
\emph{orientable} hyperbolic surface, then the number of simple closed
geodesics of length less than $L$ on $(S,m)$ is asymptotically equivalent to a
positive constant times $L^{\dim\mathcal{ML}(S)}$, where $\mathcal{ML}(S)$
denotes the space of measured laminations on $S$. We observed on some explicit
examples that this result does not hold for \emph{nonorientable} hyperbolic
surfaces. The aim of this article is to explain this surprising phenomenon. Let
$(S,m)$ be a finite area \emph{nonorientable} hyperbolic surface. We show that
the set of measured laminations with a closed one--sided leaf has a peculiar
structure. As a consequence, the action of the mapping class group on the
projective space of measured laminations is not minimal. We determine a partial
classification of its orbit closures, and we deduce that the number of simple
closed geodesics of length less than $L$ on $(S,m)$ is negligible compared to
$L^{\dim\mathcal{ML}(S)}$. We extend this result to general multicurves. Then
we focus on the geometry of the moduli space. We prove that its Teichm\""uller
volume is infinite, and that the Teichm\""uller flow is not ergodic. We also
consider a volume form introduced by Norbury. We show that it is the right
generalization of the Weil--Petersson volume form. The volume of the moduli
space with respect to this volume form is again infinite (as shown by Norbury),
but the subset of hyperbolic surfaces whose one--sided geodesics have length at
least $\varepsilon>0$ has finite volume. These results suggest that the moduli
space of a nonorientable surface looks like an infinite volume geometrically
finite orbifold. We discuss this analogy and formulate some conjectures.

potential applications such as video surveillance, human computer interaction,

actions happening within videos. Historically, hand crafted video features were
used to address the task of action recognition. With the success of Deep
ConvNets as an image analysis method, a lot of extensions of standard ConvNets

novel recurrent ConvNet architecture called recurrent residual networks to
address the task of action recognition. The approach extends ResNet, a state of
the art model for image classification. While the original formulation of
ResNet aims at learning spatial residuals in its layers, we extend the approach
by introducing recurrent connections that allow to learn a spatio-temporal
residual. In contrast to fully recurrent networks, our temporal connections
only allow a limited range of preceding frames to contribute to the output for
the current frame, enabling efficient training and inference as well as
limiting the temporal context to a reasonable local range around each frame. On
a large-scale action recognition dataset, we show that our model improves over
both, the standard ResNet architecture and a ResNet extended by a fully

fractional quantum Hall liquids. We consider electrons at various filling
fractions $f$ in the lowest Landau level, with Coulomb interactions. At
$f=1/3,1/5$ and $2/5$ where an incompressible ground-state manifold exists at
zero disorder, we observe a pronounced minimum in the derivative of
entanglement entropy with respect to disorder. At each filling, the position of
this minimum is stable against increasing system size, but its magnitude grows
monotonically and appears to diverge in the thermodynamic limit. We consider
this behaviour of the entropy derivative as a compelling signal of the expected
disorder-driven phase transition from a topological fractional quantum Hall
phase to a trivial insulating phase. On the contrary, at $f=1/2$ where a
compressible composite fermion sea is present at zero disorder, the entropy
derivative exhibits much greater, almost chaotic, finite-size effects, without
a clear phase transition signal for system sizes within our exact
diagonalization limit. However, the dependence of entanglement entropy with
system size changes with increasing disorder, consistent with the expectation
of a phase transition from a composite fermion sea to an insulator. Finally, we
consider $f=1/7$ where compressible Wigner crystals are quite competitive at
zero disorder, and analyze the level statistics of entanglement spectrum at
$f=1/3$.

magnetospheric X-ray emission which, uniquely amongst magnetic stars, is
clearly modulated with the star's pulsation period. The rotational period
$P_{\rm rot}$ has yet to be identified, with multiple competing claims in the
literature. We present an analysis of a large ESPaDOnS dataset with a 9-year
baseline. The longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_{\rm Z}\rangle$ shows a
significant annual variation, suggesting that $P_{\rm rot}$ is at least on the
order of decades. The possibility that the star's H$\alpha$ emission originates
around a classical Be companion star is explored and rejected based upon VLTI
AMBER and PIONIER interferometry, indicating that the emission must instead
originate in the star's magnetosphere and should therefore also be modulated
with $P_{\rm rot}$. Period analysis of H$\alpha$ equivalent widths measured
from ESPaDOnS and CORALIE spectra indicates $P_{\rm rot} > 30$ yr. All evidence
thus supports that $\xi^1$ CMa is a very slowly rotating magnetic star hosting
a dynamical magnetosphere. H$\alpha$ also shows evidence for modulation with
the pulsation period, a phenomenon which we show cannot be explained by
variability of the underlying photospheric line profile, i.e. it may reflect
changes in the quantity and distribution of magnetically confined plasma in the
circumstellar environment. In comparison to other magnetic stars with similar
stellar properties, $\xi^1$ CMa is by far the most slowly rotating magnetic
B-type star, is the only slowly rotating B-type star with a magnetosphere
detectable in H$\alpha$ (and thus, the coolest star with an optically
detectable dynamical magnetosphere), and is the only known early-type magnetic
star with H$\alpha$ emission modulated by both pulsation and rotation.

such as spectrographs and interferometers owing to their small footprints and
diverse range of functionalities. Operating at the diffraction-limit, it is
notoriously difficult to efficiently couple such devices directly with large
telescopes. We demonstrate that with careful control of both the non-ideal
pupil geometry of a telescope and residual wavefront errors, efficient coupling
with single-mode devices can indeed be realised. A fibre injection was built
within the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument.
Light was coupled into a single-mode fibre operating in the near-IR (J-H bands)
which was downstream of the extreme adaptive optics system and the pupil
apodising optics. A coupling efficiency of 86% of the theoretical maximum limit
was achieved at 1550 nm for a diffraction-limited beam in the laboratory, and
was linearly correlated with Strehl ratio. The coupling efficiency was constant
to within <30% in the range 1250-1600 nm. Preliminary on-sky data with a Strehl
ratio of 60% in the H-band produced a coupling efficiency into a single-mode
fibre of ~50%, consistent with expectations. The coupling was >40% for 84% of
the time and >50% for 41% of the time. The laboratory results allow us to
forecast that extreme adaptive optics levels of correction (Strehl ratio >90%
in H-band) would allow coupling of >67% (of the order of coupling to multimode
fibres currently). For Strehl ratios <20%, few-port photonic lanterns become a
superior choice but the signal-to-noise must be considered. These results
illustrate a clear path to efficient on-sky coupling into a single-mode fibre,
which could be used to realise modal-noise-free radial velocity machines,
very-long-baseline optical/near-IR interferometers and/or simply exploit
photonic technologies in future instrument design.

studying the chemistry induced by thermal and energetic processing of frozen

observed so far) and water. We present the results of a series of laboratory
experiments concerning thermal processing of different H2O:SO2 mixtures and ion

spectroscopy to investigate the induced effects. The results indicate that
ionic species such as HSO$_{3}^{-}$, HSO$_{4}^{-}$, and S$_2$O$_{5}^{2-}$ are
easily produced. Energetic processing also produces SO$_3$ polymers and a
sulfurous refractory residue. The produced ionic species exhibit spectral
features in a region that, in astronomical spectra of dense molecular clouds,
is dominated by strong silicate absorption. However, such a dominant feature is
associated with some spectral features, some of which have not yet been

in polymer-mediated forces that can be repulsive (due to loss of entropy) or
attractive (if some or all surfaces are covered by adsorbing layers). The
strength and sign of the force in general depends on the detailed shape and
adsorption properties of the obstacles, but assumes simple universal forms if
characteristic length scales associated with the objects are large. This occurs
for scale-free shapes (such as a flat plate, straight wire, or cone), when the
polymer is repelled by the obstacles, or is marginally attracted to it (close
to the depinning transition where the absorption length is infinite). In such
cases, the separation $h$ between obstacles is the only relevant macroscopic
length scale, and the polymer mediated force equals ${\cal A} \, k_{B}T/h$,
where $T$ is temperature. The amplitude ${\cal A}$ is akin to a critical
exponent, depending only on geometry and universality of the polymer system.
The value of ${\cal A}$, which we compute for simple geometries and ideal
polymers, can be positive or negative. Remarkably, we find ${\cal A}=0$ for
ideal polymers at the adsorption transition point, irrespective of shapes of
the obstacles, i.e. at this special point there is no polymer-mediated force
between obstacles (scale-free or not).

have one and only one dark energy phase, either occurring in the contracting

asymmetric. We calculate the spectral indexes and amplitudes of scalar and
tensor perturbations numerically, considering the whole history of the model,
including the bounce phase itself, without making any approximation or using
any matching condition on the perturbations. As the background model is
necessarily dust dominated in the far past, the usual adiabatic vacuum initial
conditions can be easily imposed in this era. Hence, this is a cosmological
model where the presence of dark energy behavior in the Universe does not turn
problematic the usual vacuum initial conditions prescription for cosmological
perturbation in bouncing models. Scalar and tensor perturbations end up being
almost scale invariant, as expected. The background parameters can be adjusted,
without fine tunings, to yield the observed amplitude for scalar perturbations,
and also for the ratio between tensor and scalar amplitudes, $r = T/S \lesssim
0.1$. The amplification of scalar perturbations over tensor perturbations takes
place only around the bounce, due to quantum effects, and it would not occur if
General Relativity has remained valid throughout this phase. Hence, this is a
bouncing model where a single field induces not only an expanding background
dark energy phase, but also produces all observed features of cosmological
perturbations of quantum mechanical origin at linear order.

with NOEMA of the DCN(2-1) and H13CN(2-1) lines to compute the deuterated

from L1157-B1 shock. Dfrac(HCN) is ~4x10$^{-3}$ and given the uncertainties, we
did not find significant variations across the bow-shock. Contrary to HDCO,
whose emission delineates the region of impact between the jet and the ambient
material, DCN is more widespread and not limited to the impact region. This is
consistent with the idea that gas-phase chemistry is playing a major role in
the deuteration of HCN in the head of the bow-shock, where HDCO is undetected
as it is a product of grain-surface chemistry. The spectra of DCN and H13CN
match the spectral signature of the outflow cavity walls, suggesting that their
emission result from shocked gas. The analysis of the time dependent gas-grain
chemical model UCL-CHEM coupled with a C-type shock model shows that the
observed Dfrac(HCN) is reached during the post-shock phase, matching the
dynamical timescale of the shock. Our results indicate that the presence of DCN

widespread DCN emission, dominating in the head of the bow-shock, and
sputtering from grain mantles toward the jet impact region.

scalable quantum computation. Although electric dipoles are highly attractive
to couple spin qubits electrically over long distances, mechanisms identified
to control two-qubit couplings do not permit single-qubit operations while
two-qubit couplings are off. Here we identify a mechanism to modulate
electrical coupling of spin qubits that overcomes this drawback for hole spin
qubits in acceptors,that is based on the electrical tuning of the direction of
the spin-dependent electric dipole by a gate. In this way, inter-qubit coupling
can be turned off electrically by tuning to a ""magic angle"" of vanishing
electric dipole-dipole interactions, while retaining the ability to manipulate
the individual qubits. This effect stems from the interplay of the $\rm T_d$
symmetry of the acceptor state in the Si lattice with the magnetic field
orientation, and the spin-3/2 characteristic of hole systems. Magnetic field
direction also allows to greatly suppress spin relaxation by phonons that limit
single qubit performance, while retaining sweet spots where the qubits are
insensitive to charge noise. Our findings can be directly applied to
state-of-the-art acceptor based architectures, for which we propose suitable
protocols to practically achieve full electrical tunability of entanglement and
the realization of a decoherence-free subspace.

velocity field up to a scale larger than those with the density field, x>100

the momentum correlation associated with the physical halo boundary, or the

capabilities, especially for DRAM deployed in large-scale data centers, as
process technology scaling has increased the susceptibility of these devices to
errors. To provide fast error detection and correction, error-correcting codes
(ECC) are placed on an additional DRAM chip in a DRAM module. This additional
chip expands the raw capacity of a DRAM module by 12.5%, but the applications
are unable to use any of this extra capacity, as it is used exclusively to
provide reliability for all data. In reality, there are a number of
applications that do not need such strong reliability for all their data
regions (e.g., some user batch jobs executing on a public cloud), and can
instead benefit from using additional DRAM capacity to store extra data. Our
goal in this work is to provide the additional capacity within an ECC DRAM
module to applications when they do not need the high reliability of error
correction.
  In this paper, we propose Capacity- and Reliability-Adaptive Memory (CREAM),
a hardware mechanism that adapts error correcting DRAM modules to offer
multiple levels of error protection, and provides the capacity saved from using
weaker protection to applications. For regions of memory that do not require
strong error correction, we either provide no ECC protection or provide error
detection using multibit parity. We evaluate several layouts for arranging the
data within ECC DRAM in these reduced-protection modes, taking into account the
various trade-offs exposed from exploiting the extra chip. Our experiments show
that the increased capacity provided by CREAM improves performance by 23.0% for
a memory caching workload, and by 37.3% for a commercial web search workload
executing production query traces. In addition, CREAM can increase bank-level
parallelism within DRAM, offering further performance improvements.

cycle (SC) 23 and 21 from SC 24. Among those CMEs, 63% originated from the same

predecessor (defined as D-type). Their distinctly different waiting time
distribution, peaking around 7.5 and 1.5 hours for S- and D-type CMEs, suggests
that they might involve different physical mechanisms with different
characteristic time scales. Through detailed analysis based on non-linear force
free (NLFF) coronal mag- netic field modeling of two exemplary cases, we
propose that the S-type QH CMES might involve a recurring energy release
process from the same source location (by magnetic free energy replenishment),
whereas the D-type QH CMEs can happen when a flux tube system disturbed by a
nearby CME.

independently, and we evaluate its robustness in the absence of any (recovery)
learning phase. We give tight bounds on the number of neurons that can fail
without harming the result of a computation. To determine our bounds, we
leverage the fact that neural activation functions are Lipschitz-continuous.
Our bound is on a quantity, we call the \textit{Forward Error Propagation},
capturing how much error is propagated by a neural network when a given number
of components is failing, computing this quantity only requires looking at the
topology of the network, while experimentally assessing the robustness of a
network requires the costly experiment of looking at all the possible inputs
and testing all the possible configurations of the network corresponding to
different failure situations, facing a discouraging combinatorial explosion.
  We distinguish the case of neurons that can fail and stop their activity
(crashed neurons) from the case of neurons that can fail by transmitting
arbitrary values (Byzantine neurons). Interestingly, as we show in the paper,
our bound can easily be extended to the case where synapses can fail.
  We show how our bound can be leveraged to quantify the effect of memory cost
reduction on the accuracy of a neural network, to estimate the amount of
information any neuron needs from its preceding layer, enabling thereby a
boosting scheme that prevents neurons from waiting for unnecessary signals. We
finally discuss the trade-off between neural networks robustness and learning
cost.

these stars will hardly form observable PNe. Stars with a lower mass loss rate

for the presence of bright PNe in old stellar populations. We present the
evolution of four exoplanetary systems that represent stellar masses in the

assumption that the stellar samples that were used to derive the traditional

describing numerous physical systems. It is studied for different sources of
quenched disorder: random couplings, random fields, or both them. The belief
propagation algorithm and the cavity method are exploited to solve the model on
the sparse topology provided by Bethe lattices. It is found that the
discretized version of the XY model, the so-called $Q$-state clock model,
provides a reliable and efficient proxy for the continuous model with an error
going to zero exponentially in $Q$, so implying a remarkable speedup in
numerical simulations. Interesting results regard the low-temperature solution
of the spin glass XY model, which is by far more unstable toward the replica
symmetry broken phase with respect to what happens in discrete models.
Moreover, even the random field XY model with ferromagnetic couplings exhibits
a replica symmetry broken phase, at variance with both the fully connected
version of the same model and the diluted random field Ising model, as a
further evidence of a more pronounced glassiness of the diluted XY model. Then,
the instabilities of the spin glass XY model in an external field are
characterized, recognizing different critical lines according to the different
symmetries of the external field. Finally, the inherent structures in the
energy landscape of the spin glass XY model in a random field are described,
exploiting the capability of the zero-temperature belief propagation algorithm
to actually reach the ground state of the system. Remarkably, the density of
soft modes in the Hessian matrix shows a non-mean-field behaviour, typical of
glasses in finite dimension, while the critical point of replica symmetry
instability predicted by the belief propagation algorithm seems to correspond
to a delocalization of such soft modes.

systems of independent fermions, in which translation symmetry is broken only
by arbitrary boundary conditions, by providing exact, analytic expressions for
all energy eigenvalues and eigenstates. By transforming the single-particle
Hamiltonian into a corner-modified banded block-Toeplitz matrix, a key step is
a bipartition of the lattice, which splits the eigenvalue problem into a system
of bulk and boundary equations. The eigensystem inherits most of its solutions
from an auxiliary, infinite translation-invariant Hamiltonian that allows for
non-unitary representations of translation symmetry. A reformulation of the
boundary equation in terms of a boundary matrix ensures compatibility with the
boundary conditions, and determines the allowed energy eigenstates. We show how
the boundary matrix captures the interplay between bulk and boundary
properties, leading to efficient indicators of bulk-boundary correspondence.
Remarkable consequences of our generalized Bloch theorem are the engineering of
Hamiltonians that host perfectly localized, robust zero-energy edge modes, and
the predicted emergence, e.g. in Kitaev's chain, of localized excitations whose
amplitudes decay exponentially with a power-law prefactor. We further show how
the theorem yields diagonalization algorithms for the class of Hamiltonians
under consideration, and use the proposed bulk-boundary indicator to
characterize the topological response of a multi-band time-reversal invariant
s-wave superconductor under twisted boundary conditions, showing how a
fractional Josephson effect can occur without a fermionic parity switch.
Finally, we establish connections to the transfer matrix method and
demonstrate, using the paradigmatic Kitaev's chain example, that a
non-diagonalizable transfer matrix signals the presence of solutions with a
power-law prefactor.

Infrared dark clouds represent the earliest stages of high-mass star
formation. Detailed observations of their physical conditions on all physical
scales are required to improve our understanding of their role in fueling star
formation.
  Methods. We investigate the large-scale structure of the IRDC G035.39-00.33,
probing the dense gas with the classical ammonia thermometer. This allows us to
put reliable constraints on the temperature of the extended, pc-scale dense gas
reservoir and to probe the magnitude of its non-thermal motions. Available
far-infrared observations can be used in tandem with the observed ammonia
emission to estimate the total gas mass contained in G035.39-00.33.
  Results. We identify a main velocity component as a prominent filament,
manifested as an ammonia emission intensity ridge spanning more than 6 pc,
consistent with the previous studies on the Northern part of the cloud. A
number of additional line-of-sight components are found, and a large scale,
linear velocity gradient of ~0.2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is found along the ridge
of the IRDC. In contrast to the dust temperature map, an ammonia-derived
kinetic temperature map, presented for the entirety of the cloud, reveals local
temperature enhancements towards the massive protostellar cores. We show that
without properly accounting for the line of sight contamination, the dust
temperature is 2-3 K larger than the gas temperature measured with NH$_3$.
  Conclusions. While both the large scale kinematics and temperature structure
are consistent with that of starless dark filaments, the kinetic gas
temperature profile on smaller scales is suggestive of tracing the heating
mechanism coincident with the locations of massive protostellar cores.

far away from today, in the near future, it is possible to have medium-size,
special-purpose, quantum devices that can perform computational tasks not
efficiently simulable with any classical computer. This status is known as
quantum supremacy (or quantum advantage), where one of the promising approaches
is through the sampling of chaotic quantum circuits. Sampling of ideal chaotic
quantum circuits has been argued to require an exponential time for classical
devices. A major question is whether quantum supremacy can be maintained under
noise without error correction, as the implementation of fault-tolerance would
cost lots of extra qubits and quantum gates. Here we show that, for a family of
chaotic quantum circuits subject to Pauli errors, there exists an
non-exponential classical algorithm capable of simulating the noisy chaotic
quantum circuits with bounded errors. This result represents a serious
challenge to a previous result in the literature suggesting the failure of
classical devices in simulating noisy chaotic circuits with about 48 qubits and
depth 25. Moreover, even though our model does not cover all types of
experimental errors, from a practical point view, our result describes a
well-defined setting where quantum supremacy can be tested against the
challenges of classical rivals, in the context of chaotic quantum circuits.

Several classes of contact scenario are examined, and existing approaches to
the search for extra-terrestrial life and intelligence are situated within the
range of possible search strategies and targets illuminated by this particular
choice of parameters, as are some examples of contact scenarios from popular
culture. The resulting possibility space can also suggest new search strategies

Some possible extensions to the parameters used, as well as some preliminary
observations about modelling the range and extent of human societal responses

which solutions scatter to an unstable excited state $(\phi, 0)$ forms a finite
co-dimensional path connected $C^1$ manifold in the energy space. This manifold
is a global and unique center-stable manifold associated with $(\phi,0)$. It is
constructed in a first step locally around any solution scattering to $\phi$,
which might be very far away from $\phi$ in the $\dot{H}^1\times
L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ norm. In a second crucial step a no-return property is
proved for any solution which starts near, but not on the local manifolds. This
ensures that the local manifolds form a global one. Scattering to an unstable
steady state is therefore a non-generic behavior, in a strong topological sense
in the energy space. This extends our previous result [18] to the nonradial
case. The new ingredients here are (i) application of the reversed Strichartz
estimate from [3] to construct a local center stable manifold near any solution
that scatters to $(\phi, 0)$. This is needed since the endpoint of the standard
Strichartz estimates fails nonradially. (ii) The nonradial channel of energy

solutions that start off but near the local manifolds associated with $\phi$
emit some amount of energy into the far field in excess of the amount of energy

the range 10 - 300 K and at room temperature in the 5 - 40 $\mu$m range. The
MAC of ferromagnesium samples behaves in the same way as the MAC of pure
Mg-rich amorphous silicate samples. In the 30 - 300 K range, the MAC increases
with increasing grain temperature whereas in the range 10 - 30 K, we do not see
any change of the MAC. The MAC cannot be described by a single power law in
${\lambda}^{-\beta}$. The MAC of all the samples is much higher than the MAC
calculated by dust models. The complex behavior of the MAC of amorphous
silicates with wavelength and temperature is observed whatever the exact
silicate composition (Mg vs. Fe amount). It is a universal characteristic of
amorphous materials, and therefore of amorphous cosmic silicates, that should
be taken into account in astronomical modeling. The enhanced MAC of the
measured samples compared to the MAC calculated for cosmic dust model implies
that dust masses are overestimated by the models.

papyri, a new enhanced method for virtual unfolding and peeling of ancient
unopened papyrus rolls has been developed. This new algorithms-based and
semi-automatic procedure allowed to investigate with high resolution the 3D
internal structure of two ancient papyrus rolls formerly analysed by X-ray
phase-contrast tomography. Through a new rendering procedure, selected regions
inside the rolls could be identified and isolated and the different sheets
could be peeled one by one virtually, all without damaging these very precious
manuscripts. Subsequently, traces of possible text were identified on the
single sheets. Finally, by applying an additional flattening procedure we
restored for the first time several extensive textual portions of Greek, the
largest ever detected so far in unopened Herculaneum papyrus rolls, with
different degrees of resolution and contrast

difficult to apply conventional fully digital precoding techniques but call for
low cost analog radio-frequency (RF) and digital baseband hybrid precoding
methods. This paper investigates joint RF-baseband hybrid precoding for the
downlink of multiuser multi-antenna mmWave systems with a limited number of RF
chains. Two performance measures, maximizing the spectral efficiency and the
energy efficiency of the system, are considered. We propose a codebook based RF
precoding design and obtain the channel state information via a beam sweep
procedure. Via the codebook based design, the original system is transformed
into a virtual multiuser downlink system with the RF chain constraint.
Consequently, we are able to simplify the complicated hybrid precoding
optimization problems to joint codeword selection and precoder design (JWSPD)
problems. Then, we propose efficient methods to address the JWSPD problems and
jointly optimize the RF and baseband precoders under the two performance
measures. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoders.

series arrays of identical current biased Josephson junctions coupled through
various shared loads. The equations describing the dynamics are invariant under
permutation of the junctions so that in addition to the usual dynamical systems
and numerical methods, group theoretic methods can be applied. In practice it
is desirable to operate these circuits at a stable in-phase oscillation. The
works summarized here are devoted to the study of where in parameter space the
in-phase oscillations are stable and how the stability is lost. In particular,
they focus on the variety of states produced through bifurcation as the
in-phase oscillation loses stability. These states include discrete rotating
waves and semirotors.

invokes recent results on the physics of a strongly and spherically perturbed
't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, the role of the central spatial region in a
Harrington-Shepard (HS) (anti)caloron, the latter's deformation towards
maximally non-trivial holonomy and subsequent dissociation into a pair of a
screened BPS monopole and antimonopole, the energy-density of the deconfining
thermal ground state, and the critical temperature $T_c$ for the
deconfining-preconfining transition. We estimate the typical spatial extent of
the selfintersection region and the monopole core size, implying that the
electron/positron, judged by its Compton wave length, is anything but a point
particle. Our results support and elucidate the ideas of Louis de Broglie on
the thermodynamics of an isolated particle.

amounts of time and labor; yet, they provide a relatively small set of data
that cannot be considered representative of the study region. Terrestrial laser
scanners are increasingly used for fracture surveys because they can
efficiently acquire large area, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) point
clouds from outcrops. However, extracting fractures and other planar surfaces
from 3D outcrop point clouds is still a challenging task. No method has been
reported that can be used to automatically extract the full extent of every
individual fracture from a 3D outcrop point cloud. In this study, we propose a
method using a region-growing approach to address this problem; the method also
estimates the orientation of each fracture. In this method, criteria based on
the local surface normal and curvature of the point cloud are used to initiate
and control the growth of the fracture region. In tests using outcrop point
cloud data, the proposed method identified and extracted the full extent of
individual fractures with high accuracy. Compared with manually acquired field
survey data, our method obtained better-quality fracture data, thereby
demonstrating the high potential utility of the proposed method.

reduce the data acquisition time. The latter is useful for high-throughput
analysis of materials structure and chemistry. In this work, we present a novel
machine learning based method for dynamic sparse sampling of EDS data using a
scanning electron microscope. Our method, based on the supervised learning
approach for dynamic sampling algorithm and neural networks based
classification of EDS data, allows a dramatic reduction in the total sampling
of up to 90%, while maintaining the fidelity of the reconstructed elemental
maps and spectroscopic data. We believe this approach will enable imaging and
elemental mapping of materials that would otherwise be inaccessible to these
analysis techniques.
