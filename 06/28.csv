superluminous supernova (SLSN) to date, and first near the center of a massive
spiral galaxy (NGC 3191). Using SDSS spectra of NGC 3191, we find a metallicity
~2 Z$_\odot$ at the nucleus and ~1.3 Z$_\odot$ for a star forming region at a
radial offset similar to SN 2017egm. Archival radio-to-UV photometry reveals a
star-formation rate ~15 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (with ~70% dust-obscured), which
can account for a Swift X-ray detection, and stellar mass ~$10^{10.7}$
M$_\odot$. We model the early UV-optical light curves with a magnetar
central-engine model, using the Bayesian light curve fitting tool MOSFiT. The
fits indicate ejecta mass 2-4 M$_\odot$, spin period 4-6 ms, magnetic field
(0.7-1.7)$\times 10^{14}$G, and kinetic energy 1-2 $\times10^{51}$ erg. These
parameters are consistent with the overall distributions for SLSNe, modeled by
Nicholl et al (2017), although the derived mass and spin are towards the low
end, possibly indicating enhanced loss of mass and angular momentum before
explosion. This has two implications: (i) SLSNe can occur at solar metallicity,
although with a low fraction ~10%; and (ii) metallicity has at most a modest
effect on their properties. Both conclusions are in line with results for long
gamma-ray bursts. Assuming a monotonic rise gives an explosion date MJD
$57889\pm1$. However, a short-lived excess in the data relative to the
best-fitting models may indicate an early-time `bump'. If confirmed, SN 2017egm
would be the first SLSN with a spectrum during the bump-phase; this shows the
same O II lines seen at maximum light, which may be an important clue for
explaining these bumps.

Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity by considering two nondynamical models for

demonstrate that the metric and its first derivative become discontinuous for a
domain wall of $\theta$, and we determine the boundary conditions by realizing
that the additional contribution to the wave equation corresponds to one of the
self-adjoint extensions of the D'Alembert operator. Nevertheless, such
discontinuous metric satisfies the area matching conditions introduced by
Barrett. On the other hand, the propagation through a surface layer of $\theta$
behaves similarly to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in CS extended
electrodynamics. In both cases we calculate the corresponding reflection and
transmission amplitudes. As a consequence of the distributional character of
the additional terms in the equations that describe wave propagation, the
results obtained for the domain wall are not reproduced when the thickness of
the surface layer goes to zero, as one could naively expect.

finally compute an ensemble model at any location. Using a synthetic catalog,
we also check that the proposed method correctly inverts the known parameters.
We apply the proposed method to earthquakes included in the ANSS catalog that
occurred within the time period 1981-2015 in a spatial polygon around
California. The results indicate a significant spatial variation of the ETAS
parameters. We find that the efficiency of earthquakes to trigger future ones
(quantified by the branching ratio) positively correlates with surface heat
flow. In contrast, the rate of earthquakes triggered by far-field tectonic
loading or background seismicity rate shows no such correlation, suggesting the
relevance of triggering possibly through fluid-induced activation. Furthermore,
the branching ratio and background seismicity rate are found to be uncorrelated
with hypocentral depths, indicating that the seismic coupling remains invariant
of hypocentral depths in the study region. Additionally, triggering seems to be
mostly dominated by small earthquakes. Consequently, the static stress change
studies should not only focus on the Coulomb stress changes caused by specific
moderate to large earthquakes but also account for the secondary static stress
changes caused by smaller earthquakes.

graviton amplitudes on a gravitational plane wave are the double copy of gluon

a non-local replacement rule for the background fields and the momenta and

called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC) uses a family of Gaussian
mixture models for clustering. HDDC is based on the idea that high-dimensional
data usually exists in lower-dimensional subspaces; as such, an intrinsic
dimension for each sub-population of the observed data can be estimated and
cluster analysis can be performed in this lower-dimensional subspace. As a
result, only a fraction of the total number of parameters need to be estimated

algorithm was developed. This family of models has gained attention due to its
superior classification performance compared to other families of mixture
models; however, it still suffers from the usual limitations of Gaussian

that is sustained by the explicit emergence and dispersal of bipolar magnetic
regions (BMRs). On average, each BMR has a systematic tilt given by Joy's law.
Randomness and nonlinearity in the BMR emergence of our model produce variable
magnetic cycles. However, when we allow for a random scatter in the tilt angle
to mimic the observed departures from Joy's law, we find more variability in
the magnetic cycles. We find that the observed standard deviation in Joy's law
of $\sigma_\delta = 15^\circ$ produces a variability comparable to observed
solar cycle variability of $\sim $ 32%, as quantified by the sunspot number
maxima between 1755--2008. We also find that tilt angle scatter can promote
grand minima and grand maxima. The time spent in grand minima for
$\sigma_\delta = 15^\circ$ is somewhat less than that inferred for the Sun from
cosmogenic isotopes (about 9% compared to 17%). However, when we double the
tilt scatter to $\sigma_\delta = 30^\circ$, the simulation statistics are
comparable to the Sun ($\sim $18% of the time in grand minima and $\sim 10$% in
grand maxima). Though the Babcock--Leighton mechanism is the only source of
poloidal field, we find that our simulations always maintain magnetic cycles
even at large fluctuations in the tilt angle. We also demonstrate that tilt
quenching is a viable and efficient mechanism for dynamo saturation; a
suppression of the tilt by only 1-2$^\circ$ is sufficient to limit the dynamo
growth. Thus, any potential observational signatures of tilt quenching in the

Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, and the
optimization can be trapped at poor stationary points. In this paper we show
that it is possible to characterize all critical points of the non-convex
problem. This allows us to provide an efficient criterion to determine whether
a critical point is also a global minimizer. Our analysis suggests an iterative
meta-algorithm that dynamically expands the parameter space and allows the
optimization to escape any non-global critical point, thereby converging to a

  Microscopy",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An atomic force microscope (AFM) is capable of producing ultra-high
resolution measurements of nanoscopic objects and forces. It is an
indispensable tool for various scientific disciplines such as molecular
engineering, solid-state physics, and cell biology. Prior to a given
experiment, the AFM must be calibrated by fitting a spectral density model to
baseline recordings. However, since AFM experiments typically collect large
amounts of data, parameter estimation by maximum likelihood can be
prohibitively expensive. Thus, practitioners routinely employ a much faster
least-squares estimation method, at the cost of substantially reduced
statistical efficiency. Additionally, AFM data is often contaminated by
periodic electronic noise, to which parameter estimates are highly sensitive.
This article proposes a two-stage estimator to address these issues.
Preliminary parameter estimates are first obtained by a variance-stabilizing
procedure, by which the simplicity of least-squares combines with the
efficiency of maximum likelihood. A test for spectral periodicities then
eliminates high-impact outliers, considerably and robustly protecting the
second-stage estimator from the effects of electronic noise. Simulation and
experimental results indicate that a two- to ten-fold reduction in mean squared
error can be expected by applying our methodology.

high-resolution clinical needs. Some applications, such as mammography and
extremities imaging, require spatial resolution beyond current capabilities.
Thorough understanding of system properties may help tailor system design,
acquisition protocols, and reconstruction algorithms to improve image quality.
Using a high-fidelity measurement model, we analyze the effects of
shift-variant focal spot blur due to depth-dependence and anode angulation on
image quality throughout the three-dimensional field of view of a simulated
extremities scanner. A model of the shift-variant blur associated with this
device is then incorporated into a Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR)
algorithm, which is then compared to FDK and MBIR with simpler blur models at
select locations throughout the field of view. We show that shift-variant focal
spot blur leads to location-dependent imaging performance. Furthermore,
changing the orientation of the X-ray tube alters this spatial dependence. The
analysis suggests methods to improve imaging performance based on specific
image quality needs. The results also demonstrate that image quality can be
improved by combining accurate blur modeling with MBIR. Specifically, across
the entire field of view, MBIR with shift-variant blur modeling yielded the
best image quality, followed by MBIR with a shift-invariant blur model, MBIR
with an identity blur model, and FDK, respectively. These results suggest a
number of opportunities for the optimization of imaging system performance in
the hardware setup, the imaging protocol, and the reconstruction approach.
While the high-fidelity models used here are applied using the specifications
of a dedicated extremities imaging system, the methods are general and may be
applied to optimize imaging performance in any CT system.

Principal Chiral Model (PCM) on the cylinder R x S1 with variable

can be interpreted as signatures of a weak crossover or phase transition
between the regimes of small and large L0. In particular, at small L0
thermodynamic quantities exhibit nontrivial dependence on L0, and the static
correlation length exhibits a weak enhancement at some ""critical"" value of L0.
We also observe important differences between the two boundary conditions,
which indicate that the transition scenario is more likely in the periodic case
than in the twisted one. In particular, the enhancement of correlation length
for periodic boundary conditions becomes more pronounced at large N, and
practically does not depend on N for twisted boundary conditions. Using
Gradient Flow we study non-perturbative content of the theory and find that the
peaks in the correlation length appear when the length L0 becomes comparable
with the typical size of unitons, unstable saddle points of PCM. With twisted
boundary conditions these saddle points become effectively stable and
one-dimensional in the regime of small N L0, whereas at large N L0 they are
very similar to the two-dimensional unitons with periodic boundary conditions.
In the context of adiabatic continuity conjecture for PCM with twisted boundary
conditions, our results suggest that while the effect of the compactification
is clearly different for different boundary conditions, one still cannot
exclude the possibility of a weak crossover separating the strong-coupling
regime at large N L0 and the Dunne-Unsal regime at small N L0 with twisted
boundary conditions.

complete sample of 12 optically/UV selected TDE host galaxies (down to
$g_{host}$$\leq$22 mag and $z$=0.37) in the Northern sky. The mass estimates
are based on velocity dispersion measurements, performed on late time optical
spectroscopic observations. We find black hole masses in the range
3$\times$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$$\leq$M$_{\rm BH}$$\leq$2$\times$10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$.
The TDE host galaxy sample is dominated by low mass black holes ($\sim$10$^6$
M$_{\odot}$), as expected from theoretical predictions. The blackbody peak
luminosity of TDEs with M$_{\rm BH}$$\leq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ is consistent
with the Eddington limit of the SMBH, whereas the two TDEs with M$_{\rm
BH}$$\geq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ have peak luminosities below their SMBH
Eddington luminosity, in line with the theoretical expectation that the
fallback rate for M$_{\rm BH}$$\geq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ is sub-Eddington. In
addition, our observations suggest that TDEs around lower mass black holes
evolve faster. These findings corroborate the standard TDE picture in 10$^6$
M$_{\odot}$ black holes. Our results imply an increased tension between
observational and theoretical TDE rates. By comparing the blackbody emission
radius with theoretical predictions, we conclude that the optical/UV emission
is produced in a region consistent with the stream self-intersection radius of
shallow encounters, ruling out a compact accretion disk as the direct origin of
the blackbody radiation at peak brightness.

achieved by introducing additional block sampling procedures for unknown

presented ARES framework for Bayesian large scale structure analyses. As a
result the method infers jointly and fully self-consistently three dimensional
density fields, cosmological power-spectra, luminosity dependent galaxy biases,
noise levels of respective galaxy distributions and coefficients for a set of a
priori specified foreground templates. In addition this fully Bayesian approach
permits detailed quantification of correlated uncertainties amongst all
inferred quantities and correctly marginalizes over observational systematic
effects. We demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our approach in
obtaining unbiased estimates of power-spectra via applications to realistic
mock galaxy observations subject to stellar contamination and dust extinction.
While simultaneously accounting for galaxy biases and unknown noise levels our
method reliably and robustly infers three dimensional density fields and
corresponding cosmological power-spectra from deep galaxy surveys. Further our
approach correctly accounts for joint and correlated uncertainties between
unknown coefficients of foreground templates and the amplitudes of the
power-spectrum. An effect amounting up to $10$ percent correlations and

protoplanetary disks are crucial for planet formation. Dust grains radially
drift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from
dust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the
viscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.
The feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small
and the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift
velocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.
When the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so
effective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is
affected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably
reproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D
two-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from
the grains on the evolution of the gas disk. We show that when the feedback is
effective, the gas flows outward and the gas density at the region within $\sim
10\ \mbox{AU}$ is significantly depleted. As a result, the dust-to-gas mass
ratio at the inner radii may significantly excess unity, providing the
environment where planetesimals are easily formed via, e.g., streaming
instability. We also show that a simplified 1D model well reproduces the
results of the 2D two-fluid simulations, which would be useful for future
studies.

brightness interior to their given effective radius, ~0.2 Jy arcsec$^{-2}$ (or
8 K in brightness temperature). The same trend remains, but the 0.2dex of
dispersion perpendicular to this relation essentially disappears, when we
account for the irradiation environment of each disk with a crude approximation
of the dust temperatures based on the stellar host luminosities. We consider
two (not mutually exclusive) explanations for the origin of this
size-luminosity relationship. Simple models of the growth and migration of disk
solids can account for the observed trend for a reasonable range of initial
conditions, but only on timescales that are much shorter than the nominal ages
present in the sample. An alternative scenario invokes optically thick emission
concentrated on unresolved scales, with filling factors of a few tens of
percent, that are perhaps manifestations of localized particle traps.

dependence for older stars is not well understood. This is mainly because
absolute stellar ages for older stars are hard to measure. However, relatively
accurate stellar ages have recently come into reach through asteroseismology.
In this work we present X-ray luminosities, which are a measure for magnetic
activity displayed by the stellar coronae, for 24 stars with well-determined
ages older than a gigayear. We find 14 stars with detectable X-ray luminosities
and use these to calibrate the age-activity relationship. We find a
relationship between stellar X-ray luminosity, normalized by stellar surface
area, and age that is steeper than the relationships found for younger stars,
with an exponent of $-2.80 \pm 0.72$. Previous studies have found values for
the exponent of the age-activity relationship ranging between -1.09 to -1.40,
dependent on spectral type, for younger stars. Given that there are recent
reports of a flattening relationship between age and rotational period for old
cool stars, one possible explanation is that we witness a strong steepening of

discrepancy in the inner radius of the accretion disk and that of the

each model, both model components indicate a truncated accretion disk that
resiles with decreasing luminosity. The evolution of the characteristic

the interpretation of a truncated and evolving disk in the hard state. The

Due to the multi-photon mechanism of upconversion, its quantum yield cannot

single-photon absorption; in this process, unlike in multiple-photon

The energy required for such an upconversion is drawn from the reservoir, which
destroys coherence. Decoherence leads to the transition of the system from the

star formation in their host galaxies. Systemic CO(3-2) emission has been
detected only in one quasar, LBQS 0109+0213, where the CO(3-2) emission is
spatially anti-correlated with the ionised outflow, suggesting that most of the
molecular gas may have been dispersed or heated in the region swept by the
outflow. In all three sources, including the one detected in CO, our
constraints on the molecular gas mass indicate a significantly reduced
reservoir compared to main-sequence galaxies at the same redshift, supporting a
negative feedback scenario. In the quasar 2QZ J002830.4-281706, we tentatively
detect an emission line blob blue-shifted by $v\sim-2000$ km/s with respect to
the galaxy systemic velocity and spatially offset by 0.2 arcsec (1.7 kpc) with
respect to the ALMA continuum peak. Interestingly, such emission feature is
coincident in both velocity and space with the ionised outflow as seen in

outflow driven by the AGN. Finally, in all ALMA maps we detect the presence of
serendipitous line emitters within a projected distance $\sim 160$ kpc from the

resolved given our photometric cadence of 5.7 hr during that time span. We
model the light curve as the combination of early shocking of the supernova
ejecta against a nondegenerate companion star plus a standard SN Ia component.
Our best-fit model suggests the presence of a subgiant star 56 solar radii from
the exploding white dwarf, although this number is highly model-dependent.
While this model matches the optical light curve well, it overpredicts the
observed flux in the ultraviolet bands. This may indicate that the shock is not
a blackbody, perhaps because of line blanketing in the UV. Alternatively, it
could point to another physical explanation for the optical blue bump, such as
interaction with circumstellar material or an unusual nickel distribution.

day -13 with respect to maximum light, suggesting that the progenitor system

the $I-V$ ($I$: current, $V$: voltage) characteristic is generally expected to
depend on the direction of $I$, which is known as nonreciprocal response and,
for example, found in p-n junction. However, it is a highly nontrivial issue in
translationally invariant systems since the time-reversal symmetry
($\mathcal{T}$) plays an essential role, where the two states at crystal
momenta $k$ and $-k$ are connected in the band structure. Therefore, it has
been considered that the external magnetic field ($B$) or the magnetic order
which breaks the $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry is necessary to realize the
nonreciprocal $I-V$ characteristics, i.e., magnetochiral anisotropy. Here we
theoretically show that the electron correlation in $\mathcal{I}$-broken
multi-band systems can induce nonreciprocal $I-V$ characteristics {\it without}
$\mathcal{T}$-breaking. An analog of Onsager's relation shows that
nonreciprocal current response without $\mathcal{T}$-breaking generally
requires two effects: dissipation and interactions. By using nonequilibrium
Green's functions, we derive general formula of the nonreciprocal response for
two-band systems with onsite interaction. The formula is applied to Rice-Mele

materials are discussed. This finding offers a coherent understanding of the
origin of nonreciprocal $I-V$ characteristics, and will pave a way to design

clustering algorithms exhibit a strong contrast between a favorable performance
in practice and bad theoretical worst-cases. Prime examples are least-squares
assignments and the popular $k$-means algorithm. We are interested in this
contrast and study it through polyhedral theory. Several popular clustering
algorithms can be connected to finding a vertex of the so-called bounded-shape
partition polytopes. The vertices correspond to clusterings with extraordinary
separation properties, in particular allowing the construction of a separating
power diagram, defined by its so-called sites, such that each cluster has its
own cell.
  First, we quantitatively measure the space of all sites that allow
construction of a separating power diagram for a clustering by the volume of
the normal cone at the corresponding vertex. This gives rise to a new quality
criterion for clusterings, and explains why good clusterings are also the most
likely to be found by some classical algorithms. Second, we characterize the
edges of the bounded-shape partition polytopes. Through this, we obtain an
explicit description of the normal cones. This allows us to compute measures
with respect to the new quality criterion, and even compute ""most stable""
sites, and thereby ""most stable"" power diagrams, for the separation of
clusters. The hardness of these computations depends on the number of edges

compare the system-wide 5th percentile spectral efficiency (SE) when UABSs are

tidal dissipation in a steadily spinning rotator. First, libration changes the
spectral distribution of tidal damping across the tidal modes, as compared to
the case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating rate and the tidal
torque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating
deformation only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a
librating body is also subject to a toroidal force proportional to the angular
acceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force in a steadily spinning body
renders only a permanent deformation, in a librating body this force contains
two alternating components $-$ one radial, another a degree-2 potential force.
Both contribute to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential.
  We build a formalism to describe dissipation in a homogeneous terrestrial
body performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism
incorporates a linear rheological law defining the response of the material to
forcing. While the formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we
consider a simple example of a Maxwell material.
  We show that, independent of rheology, the forced libration in longitude can
provide a considerable and even leading input in the tidal heating. Based on
the observed parameters, this input amounts to 52% in Phobos, 33% in Mimas, 23%
in Enceladus, and 96% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis by Makarov &
Efroimsky (2014) that the additional damping due to forced libration may have
participated in the early heating up of some moons. As one possibility, a moon
could have been chipped by collisions $-$ whereby it acquired a higher
triaxiality and a higher forced-libration magnitude and, consequently, a higher
heating rate. After the moon warms up, its triaxiality reduces, and so does the
tidal heating.

crystals uncovers for $N$ interacting and ring-confined rotating particles the
existence of low-lying states with proper space-time crystal behavior. The
construction of the corresponding many-body trial wave functions proceeds first
via symmetry breaking at the mean-field level followed by symmetry restoration
using projection techniques. The ensuing correlated many-body wave functions
are stationary states and preserve the rotational symmetries, and at the same
time they reflect the point-group symmetries of the mean-field crystals. This
behavior results in the emergence of sequences of select magic angular momenta
$L_m$. For angular-momenta away from the magic values, the trial functions
vanish. Symmetry breaking beyond mean field can be induced by superpositions of
such good-$L_m$ many-body stationary states. We show that superposing a pair of
adjacent magic angular momenta states leads to formation of special
broken-symmetry states exhibiting quantum space-time-crystal behavior. In
particular, the corresponding particle densities rotate around the ring,
showing undamped and nondispersed periodic crystalline evolution in both space
and time. The experimental synthesis of such quantum space-time-crystal wave
packets is predicted to be favored in the vicinity of ground-state energy
crossings of the Aharonov-Bohm-type spectra accessed via an externally applied

considerable attention. They are coalition forming games of selfish agents
based on their mutual preferences. Most of the work in the literature
characterizes the existence and structure of stable outcomes (i.e., partitions
in coalitions), assuming that preferences are given. However, there is little
discussion on this assumption. In fact, agents receive different utilities if
they belong to different partitions, and thus it is natural for them to declare
their preferences strategically in order to maximize their benefit. In this
paper we consider strategyproof mechanisms for additively separable hedonic
games and fractional hedonic games, that is, partitioning methods without
payments such that utility maximizing agents have no incentive to lie about
their true preferences. We focus on social welfare maximization and provide
several lower and upper bounds on the performance achievable by strategyproof
mechanisms for general and specific additive functions. In most of the cases we
provide tight or asymptotically tight results. All our mechanisms are simple
and can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, all the lower bounds are
unconditional, that is, they do not rely on any computational or complexity

first-order phase-transition-like behavior. For the pair of +1/2 defects by
splitting a +1 defect, we find the curvature driven alternating repulsive and

spherical disk these two defects tend to approach and finally recombine towards
a +1 defect texture. The sensitive response of defects to curvature and the

limit that $n$ has a much smaller mass than $X$, the multi-photon final state
may dominantly appear as a two photon final state because the $\gamma$s from
the $n$ decay are highly collinear and remain unresolved. We discuss how to
discriminate this scenario from $X \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$: rather than
discarding non-isolated photons, it is better instead to relax the isolation
criterion and instead form photon jet substructure variables. The spins of $X$
and $n$ leave their imprint upon the distribution of pseudorapidity gap $\Delta
\eta$ between the apparent two photon states. Depending on the total integrated
luminosity, this can be used in many cases to claim discrimination between the
possible spin choices of $X$ and $n$, although the case where $X$ and $n$ are
both scalar particles cannot be discriminated from the direct $X \rightarrow

gained by considering the mass of each photon jet.

an amount $x_a$ to pass on to the principal (keeping $v_a-x_a$ for itself). All
non-pulled arms get reward $0$. Each strategic arm tries to maximize its own

  When private rewards are stochastically drawn each round ($v_a^t \leftarrow

dominant strategy, the principal sees expected reward $\mu'T - o(T)$, where
$\mu'$ is the second-largest of the means $\mathbb{E}[D_{a}]$. This algorithm
maintains its guarantee if the arms are non-strategic ($x_a = v_a$), and also

is based on some recurrence procedures including the basic arithmetical
operations with the coefficients of some expansions only. This is an exact
symbolic algorithm (ESA) for $m=\infty$ and a truncated symbolic algorithm
(TSA) for a finite $m$. Numerical examples are presented to support the theory.

also fulfill an inversion equation and complement each other. In this
contribution we report findings on a measurement of the power area density of

Fefferman-Stein type inequalities. In particular, we obtain that the $L^2(w)$

Tapiola and the second author.
  A suitable convex-body valued version of the sparse bound is also deduced and
employed towards novel matrix weighted norm inequalities for the maximal

at horizon re-entry the fluctuations form standing waves with the correct
temporal phase (specifically, sine waves). We quantify this requirement and
relate it to the initial conditions fed into the radiation dominated epoch by
whatever phase of the Universe produced the fluctuations. The only relevant
quantity turns out to be the degree of suppression of the momentum, $p$, of the
fluctuations, $y$, which we measure by $\sigma\sim \omega^2 |y|^2/|p|^2$. Even
though $\sigma$ equals the squeezing parameter, $s$, in the case of inflation
and bimetric varying speed of light scenarios, this is not true in general,
specifically in some bouncing Universe models. It is also not necessary to
produce a large $\sigma$ at the end of the primordial phase: it is enough that
$\sigma$ be not too small. This is the case with scenarios based on modified
dispersion relations (MDR) emulating the dispersion relations of
Horava-Lifshitz theory, which produce $\sigma\sim 1$, enough to comply with the
observational requirements. Scenarios based on MDR leading to a slightly red
spectrum are also examined, and shown to satisfy the observational constraints.

field (commonly known as Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and non-backscattering
electron interactions is generally expected to produce inelastic backscattering
in 1D helical electron liquids at the edge of 2D topological insulators, as
theoretically predicted in a number of works. An opposite conclusion of absent
backscattering was reached in a recent work [H.-Y. Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
116, 086603 (2016)] for the ""local"" model of the backscattering field and
interactions. Motivated to resolve this potential controversy, in the present
work, we study backscattering effects employing fermionic perturbation theory
and considering quite general forms of the backscattering field and electron
interactions. We discover that backscattering effects are crucially sensitive
to the locality properties of the backscattering field and electron
interactions, to the symmetry of the latter, as well as to the presence or
absence of the cutoff of the electron spectrum. We find that backscattering is
indeed absent under the following assumptions: (i) local backscattering field;
(ii.a) local or (ii.b) SU(2)-symmetric interactions; (iii) absent cutoff of the
edge-state spectrum. However, violation of any of these conditions leads to
backscattering. This also reconciles with the results based on the bosonization
technique. We calculate the associated backscattering current, establish its
low-bias scaling behavior, and predict a crossover between two different
scaling regimes. The main implication of our findings is that backscattering of
some magnitude is inevitable in a real system, although could be quite
suppressed for nearly local backscattering field and interactions.

topic of influence, we build on a multilinear tensor regression framework
(MLTR) that captures influence relationships using a tensor generalization of a
vector autoregression model. Influence relationships in that approach are
captured in a pair of n x n matrices and provide measurements of how the
network actions of one actor may influence the future actions of another. A
limitation of the MLTR and earlier latent space approaches is that there are no
direct mechanisms through which to explain why a certain actor is more or less
influential than others. Our new framework, social influence regression,
provides a way to statistically model the influence of one actor on another as
a function of characteristics of the actors. Thus we can move beyond just
estimating that an actor influences another to understanding why. To highlight
the utility of this approach, we apply it to studying monthly-level conflictual
events between countries as measured through the Integrated Crisis Early

occurs at 4.7-fold of the initial density and we show radiation effects
significantly increase the shock compression ratio above 2 Gbar, surpassing
relativistic effects. The single-peaked structure of the Hugoniot curves
contrasts with previous work on higher-$Z$ plasmas, which exhibit a two-peak
structure corresponding to both $K$- and $L$-shell ionization. Analysis of the

to another five stars in the APOGEE field with similar radial velocities and
metallicities as those of Pal 1. Only one of these new candidates, Star F, may
be a member located in the tidal tail based on its heliocentric radial
velocity, metallicity, and chemistry. The other four candidates are not well
aligned with the tidal tails, and comparison to the Besancon model (Robin et
al. 2003) suggests that they are more likely to be non-members, i.e. part of
the Galactic halo. This APOGEE field could be re-examined for other new

minifilaments themselves. We find that they result from flux cancelation
between minority-polarity and majority-polarity flux patches. In each of ten
pre-jet regions, we find that opposite-polarity patches of magnetic flux
converge and cancel, with a flux reduction of 10--40% from before to after the
minifilament appears. For our ten events, the minifilaments exist for periods
ranging from 1.5 hr to two days before erupting to make a jet. Apparently, the
flux cancelation builds highly sheared field that runs above and traces the
neutral line, and the cool-transition-region-plasma minifilament forms in this
field and is suspended in it. We infer that the convergence of the
opposite-polarity patches results in reconnection in the low corona that builds
a magnetic arcade enveloping the minifilament in its core, and that the
continuing flux cancelation at the neutral line finally destabilizes the
minifilament field so that it erupts and drives the production of a coronal
jet. Thus our observations strongly support that quiet region magnetic flux
cancelation results in both the formation of the pre-jet minifilament and its
jet-driving eruption.

by coupling the dual CFT$_3$ to Chern-Simons gauge theory and 3D gravity in a
""probe"" large-level limit. The infinite-dimensional symmetries are shown to
arise when one is restricted to boundary subspaces with effectively
two-dimensional geometry. A canonical example of such a restriction occurs
within the 4D subregion described by a Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctional of AdS$_4$
quantum gravity. An AdS$_4$ analog of Minkowski ""super-rotation"" asymptotic
symmetry is probed by 3D Einstein gravity, yielding CFT$_2$ structure, via
AdS$_3$ foliation of AdS$_4$ and the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The
maximal asymptotic symmetry is however probed by 3D conformal gravity. Both 3D
gravities have Chern-Simons formulation, manifesting their topological
character. Chern-Simons structure is also shown to be emergent in the Poincare
patch of AdS$_4$, as soft/boundary limits of 4D gauge theory, rather than ""put
in by hand"", with a finite effective Chern-Simons level. Several of the
considerations of asymptotic symmetry structure are found to be simpler for
AdS$_4$ than for Mink$_4$, such as non-zero 4D particle masses, 4D
non-perturbative ""hard"" effects, and consistency with unitarity. The last of
these, in particular, is greatly simplified, because in some set-ups the time
dimension is explicitly shared by each level of description: Lorentzian
AdS$_4$, CFT$_3$ and CFT$_2$. The CFT$_2$ structure clarifies the sense in
which the infinite asymptotic charges constitute a useful form of ""hair"" for
black holes and other complex 4D states. An AdS$_4$ (holographic) ""shadow""
analog of Minkowski ""memory"" effects is derived. Lessons from AdS$_4$ provide
hints for better understanding Minkowski asymptotic symmetries, the 3D
structure of its soft limits, and Minkowski holography.

2.5~$\mu_\mathrm{B}$/Pr along the orthorhombic $c$-axis and evidence the lack
of ordering in the Fe sublattice. The inelastic neutron scattering study
reveals one crystalline electric field excitation near 19~meV at 5~K in \PFA.
The energy-integrated intensity of the 19~meV excitation as a function of |$Q$|
$(A^{-1})$ follows the square of the magnetic form factor of Pr$^{3+}$ thereby
confirming that the inelastic excitation belongs to the Pr sublattice. The
second sum rule applied to the dynamic structure factor indicates only
1.6(2)~$\mu_\mathrm{B}$ evolving at the 19~meV peak compared to the
3.58~$\mu_\mathrm{B}$ for free Pr$^{3+}$, indicating that the crystal field
ground state is magnetic and the missing moment is associated with the
resolution limited quasi-elastic line. The magnetic order occurring in Pr in
\PFA\ is counter-intuitive to the symmetry-allowed crystal field level scheme,
hence, is suggestive of exchange-mediated mechanisms of ordering stemming from
the magnetic ground state of the crystal field levels.

moderately successful in designing sequences with reduced immunogenicity, but
do not account for the varying frequencies of different human leucocyte antigen

optimization that simultaneously optimizes the likelihood of a functional

a target population. We bypass the need for three-dimensional protein structure

generating sequences using probabilistic models that have been used previously

Furthermore, $\Omega(n^2)$ Steiner points are sometimes necessary, even for a

one of the most common motor neuron diseases, and people of all races and
ethnic backgrounds are affected. There is currently no cure. Brain computer
interfaces (BCIs) can establish a communication channel directly between the
brain and an external device by recognizing brain activities that reflect user
intent. Therefore, this technology could help ALS patients in promoting
functional independence through BCI-based speller systems and motor assistive
devices. Methods: In this paper, two kinds of ERP-based speller systems were
tested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) assess performance when they spelled 42
characters online continuously, without a break; and (2) to compare performance
between a matrix-based speller paradigm (MS-P, mean visual angle 6 degree) and
a new speller paradigm that used a larger visual angle called the large visual
angle speller paradigm (LS-P, mean visual angle 8 degree). Results: Although
results showed that there were no significant differences between the two
paradigms in accuracy trend over continuous use (p>0.05), the fatigue during
the LS-P condition was significantly lower than that of MS-P (p<0.05). Results
also showed that continuous use slightly reduced the performance of this
ERP-based BCI. Conclusion: 15 subjects obtained higher than 80% feedback
accuracy (online output accuracy) and 9 subjects obtained higher than 90%
feedback accuracy in one of the two paradigms, thus validating the BCI
approaches in this study. Significance: Most ALS subjects in this study could
spell effectively after continuous use of an ERP-based BCI. The new LS-P
display may be easier for subjects to use, resulting in lower fatigue.

Specifically, a dual deep convolutional neural network with a synergic signal

is used to verify whether the input image pair belongs to the same category and
to give the corrective feedback if a synergic error exists. Our SDL model can
be trained 'end to end'. In the test phase, the class label of an input can be
predicted by averaging the likelihood probabilities obtained by two

states in low-dimensional structures for electronic and spintronic
applications. We study the edge magnetic coupling and anisotropy in zigzag
stanene nanoribbons, by first-principles calculations. Taking into account
considerable spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetism at each edge, zigzag
stanene nanoribbon is insulating and its band gap depends on the inter-edge
magnetic coupling and the magnetization direction. Especially for nanoribbon
edges with out-of-plane antiferromagnetic coupling, two non-degenerate valleys
of edge states emerge and the spin degeneracy is tunable by a transverse
electric field, which give full play to spin and valley degrees of freedom.
More importantly, both the magnetic order and anisotropy can be selectively
controlled by electron and hole doping, demonstrating a readily accessible
gate-induced modulation of magnetism. These intriguing features offer a
practical avenue for designing energy-efficient devices based on multiple
degrees of freedom of electron and magneto-electric couplings.

its association with novel ground-states including spin liquids (SLs). Many
recently synthesized kagome materials feature rare-earth ions, which may be
expected to exhibit highly anisotropic exchange interactions. The consequences
of this combination of strong exchange anisotropy and extreme geometrical
frustration are yet to be fully understood. Here, we establish a general
picture of the interactions and resulting ground-states (GSs) arising from
nearest neighbour exchange anisotropy on the kagome lattice. We determine a
generic anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian from symmetry arguments. In the
high-symmetry case where reflection in the kagome plane is a symmetry of the
system, the generic nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian can be locally defined as a
XYZ model with out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We proceed to
study its phase diagram in the classical limit, making use of an exact
reformulation of the Hamiltonian in terms of irreducible representations
(irreps) of the lattice symmetry group. This reformulation in terms of irreps
naturally explains the three-fold mapping between SLs recently studied on
kagome by the present authors [Nat Commun 7, 10297 (2016)]. In addition, a
number of unusual states are stabilised in the regions where different forms of
GS order compete, including a stripy phase with a local Z8 symmetry and a
classical analogue of a chiral SL. This generic Hamiltonian also turns out to
be a fruitful hunting ground for coexistence of different forms of magnetic
order, or of order and disorder, which we find is a particular property of the
kagome lattice arising from the odd number of spins per frustrated unit. These
results are compared and contrasted with those obtained on the pyrochlore

we use the low temperature universal curve of the impurity entropy, we get a
quadratic function. These results indicate that the previous debates about the
influence of the spin-orbit coupling on the Kondo temperature may come from the
different definitions of the Kondo temperature. When the RKKY interaction is
ferromagnetic, there are two stages of the Kondo screening. Both the two
estimations demonstrate that the second stage of the Kondo temperature is
exponentially dependent on the DM interaction. There results are dramatically
different from those calculated via perturbation theory.

theory. The satisfactory comparison with available experiments demonstrates
that this approach provides an accurate description of electronic stopping
power. The velocity-proportional stopping power is predicted for protons and
helium ions in the low energy region, which conforms the linear response
theory. Due to the existence of wide band gap, a threshold effect in extremely
low velocity regime below excitation is expected. For protons, the threshold
velocity is observable, while it does not appear in helium ions case. This
indicates the existence of extra energy loss channels beyond the electron--hole
pair excitation when helium ions are moving through the crystal. To analyze it,
we checked the charge state of the moving projectiles and an explicit charge
exchange behavior between the ions and host atoms is found. The missing
threshold effect for helium ions is attributed to the charge transfer, which

severe RTT fairness problem: a BBR flow with longer RTT dominates a competing
flow with shorter RTT.
  Somewhat surprisingly, our deployment of BBR on the Internet and an in-house
cluster unearthed a consistent bandwidth disparity among competing flows. Long
BBR flows are bound to seize bandwidth from short ones. Intrigued by this
unexpected behavior, we ask, is the phenomenon intrinsic to BBR? how's the
severity? and what's the root cause? To this end, we conduct thorough
measurements and develop a theoretical model on bandwidth dynamics. We find, as
long as the competing flows are of different RTTs, bandwidth disparities will
arise. With an RTT ratio of 10, even flow starvation can happen. We blame it on
BBR's connivance at sending an excessive amount of data when probing bandwidth.
Specifically, the amount of data is in proportion to RTT, making long RTT flows
overwhelming short ones. Based on this observation, we design a derivative of
BBR that achieves guaranteed flow fairness, at the meantime without losing any
merits. We have implemented our proposed solution in Linux kernel and evaluated

executions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to
behave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are
likely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime
behavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on
these observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and
use their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness.
  Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated
from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS and
HDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3\% of the incorrect patches
to be generated, without blocking any correct patches.

tight-binding linear chain, assisted by an imaginary gauge field, is
theoretically proposed. The gauge field undergoes a linear gradient in time,
from a negative to a positive value, which results in an effective transfer of
excitation between the two edge sites of the chain. An imaginary (gain and
loss) gradient of site energy potentials is introduced to exactly cancel
nonadiabatic effects, thus providing an effective shortcut to adiabaticity and
pseudo-Hermitian dynamics. Numerical simulations indicate that the
non-Hermitian excitation transfer method is very robust against disorder in
hopping rates and site energy of the chain.

to the energies, forces and stress tensors of a large density functional theory

We will outline a systematic model development process, which includes a
rigorous approach to structural selection based on principal component

nano-scale waveguides for ultracompact opto-electronic devices. Gold is an
important material for plasmonic waveguides, but although its linear optical
properties are fairly well understood, the nonlinear response is still under
investigation. We consider propagation of pulses in ultrathin gold strip
waveguides, modeled by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The nonlinear
response of gold is accounted for by the two-temperature model, revealing it as
a delayed nonlinearity intrinsic in gold. The consequence is that the measured
nonlinearities are strongly dependent on pulse duration. This issue has so far
only been addressed phenomenologically, but we provide an accurate estimate of
the quantitative connection as well as a phenomenological theory to understand
the enhanced nonlinear response as the gold thickness is reduced. In comparison
with the previous works, the analytical model for the power-loss equation has
been improved, and can be applied now to cases with a high laser peak power. We
show new fits to experimental data from literature and provide updated values
for the real and imaginary part of the nonlinear susceptibility of gold for
various pulse durations and gold layer thicknesses. Our simulations show that
the nonlinear loss is inhibiting efficient nonlinear interaction with low-power
laser pulses. We therefore propose to design waveguides suitable for the
mid-IR, where the ponderomotive instantaneous nonlinearity can dominate over
the delayed hot-electron nonlinearity and provide a suitable plasmonics
platform for efficient ultrafast nonlinear optics.

penalize confidence, enhance language smoothness and relieve learning burden.
Experiments conducted on two recognized sequence prediction tasks (machine

yield significant improvements over strong baselines. Furthermore, by analyzing
samples drawn from different bridges, expected influences on the generator are
verified.

by Fitbit, the wearables market leader. We reveal an intricate security through
obscurity approach implemented by the user activity synchronization protocol

reverse engineer the message semantics, demonstrate how falsified user activity

can be performed at scale to obtain financial gains. We further document a
hardware attack vector that enables circumvention of the end-to-end protocol

valid encrypted fitness data. Finally, we give guidelines for avoiding similar

distinctive three-ribbon flare, having two parallel ribbons corresponding to
the ribbons of a standard two-ribbon flare, and a larger-scale third
quasi-circular ribbon offset from the other two ribbons. There are two
components to this eruptive event. First, a flux rope forms above a
strong-field polarity-inversion line and erupts and grows as the parallel
ribbons turn on, grow, and spread part from that polarity-inversion line; this
evolution is consistent with the tether-cutting-reconnection mechanism for
eruptions. Second, the eruption of the arcade that has the erupting flux rope
in its core under goes magnetic reconnection at the null point of a fan dome
that envelops the erupting arcade, resulting in formation of the quasi-circular
ribbon; this is consistent with the breakout reconnection mechanism for
eruptions. We find that the parallel ribbons begin well before (12 min)
circular ribbon onset, indicating that tether-cutting reconnection (or a
non-ideal MHD instability) initiated this event, rather than breakout
reconnection. The overall setup for this large-scale (circular-ribbon diameter
100000 km) eruption is analogous to that of coronal jets (base size 10000 km),
many of which, according to recent findings, result from eruptions of
small-scale minifilaments. Thus these findings confirm that eruptions of
sheared-core magnetic arcades seated in fan-spine null-point magnetic topology

a local reduced space approximating the range of the transfer operator and thus
the optimal local approximation spaces. The adaptive algorithm relies on a

that will then happen with a stochas-tic delay. We assume that the probability
of conversion associated with each action is unknown while the distribution of
the conversion delay is known, distinguishing between the (idealized) case
where the conversion events may be observed whatever their delay and the more
realistic setting in which late conversions are censored. We provide
performance lower bounds as well as two simple but efficient algorithms based
on the UCB and KLUCB frameworks. The latter algorithm, which is preferable when
conversion rates are low, is based on a Poissonization argument, of independent
interest in other settings where aggregation of Bernoulli observations with
different success probabilities is required.

  effects of exposures",,,"10.1002/sim.7842",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Cox regression it is sometimes of interest to study time-varying effects
(TVE) of exposures and to test the proportional hazards assumption. TVEs can be
investigated with log hazard ratios modelled as a function of time. Missing
data on exposures are common and multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach
to handling this, to avoid the potential bias and loss of efficiency resulting
from a 'complete-case' analysis. Two MI methods have been proposed for when the
substantive model is a Cox proportional hazards regression: an approximate
method (White and Royston, Statist. Med. 2009;28:1982-98) and a
substantive-model-compatible method (Bartlett et al., SMMR 2015;24:462-87). At
present, neither method accommodates TVEs of exposures. We extend them to do so
for a general form for the TVEs and give specific details for TVEs modelled
using restricted cubic splines. Simulation studies assess the performance of
the methods under several underlying shapes for TVEs. Our proposed methods give
approximately unbiased TVE estimates for binary exposures with missing data,
but for continuous exposures the substantive-model-compatible method performs
better. The methods also give approximately correct type I errors in the test
for proportional hazards when there is no TVE, and gain power to detect TVEs
relative to complete-case analysis. Ignoring TVEs at the imputation stage
results in biased TVE estimates, incorrect type I errors and substantial loss
of power in detecting TVEs. We also propose a multivariable TVE model selection
algorithm. The methods are illustrated using data from the Rotterdam Breast
Cancer Study. Example R code is provided.

set for a graph, which is a set of vertices in which for any two given distinct

check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation

linear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation
coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We
also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping
provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is,
non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the
Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales
that is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG)
effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not

showing strong, complex Zeeman linear polarisation signatures. This paper
describes magnetic and chemical surface maps obtained for 49 Cam using the
INVERS10 magnetic Doppler imaging code and high-resolution spectropolarimetric
data in all four Stokes parameters collected with the ESPaDOnS and Narval
spectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Pic du Midi
Observatory. The reconstructed magnetic field maps of 49 Cam show a relatively
complex structure. Describing the magnetic field topology in terms of spherical
harmonics, we find significant contributions of modes up to l=3, including
toroidal components. Observations cannot be reproduced using a simple low-order
multipolar magnetic field structure. 49 Cam exhibits a level of field
complexity that has not been seen in magnetic maps of other cool Ap stars.
Hence we concluded that relatively complex magnetic fields are observed in Ap
stars at both low and high effective temperatures. In addition to mapping the
magnetic field, we also derive surface abundance distributions of nine chemical
elements, including Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu. Comparing these
abundance maps with the reconstructed magnetic field geometry, we find no clear
relationship of the abundance distributions with the magnetic field for some

discuss these results in the context of other recent magnetic mapping studies

graph was recently defined to be the maximum amount of information that can be
stored across the vertices of a graph such that the information at any vertex
can be recovered from the information stored at the neighboring vertices.
Computing the storage capacity is a fundamental problem in network coding and
is related, or equivalent, to some well-studied problems such as index coding
with side information and generalized guessing games. In this paper, we
consider storage capacity as a natural information-theoretic analogue of the
minimum vertex cover of a graph. Indeed, while it was known that storage
capacity is upper bounded by minimum vertex cover, we show that by treating it
as such we can get a 3/2 approximation for planar graphs, and a 4/3
approximation for triangle-free planar graphs. Since the storage capacity is
intimately related to the index coding rate, we get a 2 approximation of index
coding rate for planar graphs and 3/2 approximation for triangle-free planar
graphs. We also show a polynomial time approximation scheme for the index
coding rate when the alphabet size is constant. We then develop a general
method of ""gadget covering"" to upper bound the storage capacity in terms of the
average of a set of vertex covers. This method is intuitive and leads to the
exact characterization of storage capacity for various families of graphs. As
an illustrative example, we use this approach to derive the exact storage
capacity of cycles-with-chords, a family of graphs related to outerplanar
graphs. Finally, we generalize the storage capacity notion to include recovery
from partial node failures in distributed storage. We show tight upper and
lower bounds on this partial recovery capacity that scales nicely with the
fraction of failures in a vertex.

To reduce latency, caching and pre fetching techniques can be used. However,
caching fails for dynamic websites which keeps on changing rapidly. Another
technique is web prefetching, which prefetches the web pages that the user is
likely to request for in the future. Semantic web prefetching makes use of
keywords and descriptive texts like anchor text, titles, text surrounding
anchor text of the present web pages for predicting users future requests.
Semantic information is embedded within the web pages during their designing
for the purpose of reflecting the relationship between the web pages. The
client can fetch this information from the server. However, this technique
involves load on web designers for adding external tags and on server for
providing this information along with the desired page, which is not desirable.
This paper is an effort to find the semantic relation between web pages using
the keywords provided by the user and the anchor texts of the hyperlinks on the

on the orbits of other objects such as Mars, spacecraft, or other asteroids

leads to an inverse problem in at least 13 dimensions where the aim is to
derive the mass of the perturbing asteroid(s) and six orbital elements for both
the perturbing asteroid(s) and the test asteroid(s) based on astrometric
observations. We have developed and implemented three different mass estimation
algorithms utilizing asteroid-asteroid perturbations: the very rough 'marching'
approximation, in which the asteroids' orbital elements are not fitted, thereby
reducing the problem to a one-dimensional estimation of the mass, an
implementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex method, and most significantly, a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We describe each of these algorithms
with particular focus on the MCMC algorithm, and present example results using
both synthetic and real data. Our results agree with the published mass
estimates, but suggest that the published uncertainties may be misleading as a
consequence of using linearized mass-estimation methods. Finally, we discuss
remaining challenges with the algorithms as well as future plans.

Newtonian/non-Newtonian shear-thinning fluids is investigated with respect to
all wavelength perturbations. The Carreau model has been chosen for the
modeling of the rheology of a shear-thinning fluid, owing to its capability to
describe properly the constant viscosity limits (Newtonian behavior) at low and
high shear rates. The results are presented in the form of stability boundaries
on flow pattern maps (with the phases' superficial velocities as coordinates)
for several practically important gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems. The
stability maps are accompanied by spatial profiles of the critical
perturbations, along with the distributions of the effective and tangent
viscosities in the non-Newtonian layer, to show the influence of the complex
rheological behavior of shear-thinning liquids on the mechanisms responsible
for triggering instability. Due to the complexity of the considered problem, a
working methodology is proposed to alleviate the search for the stability
boundary. Implementation of the proposed methodology helps to reveal that in
many cases the investigation of the simpler Newtonian problem is sufficient for
the prediction of the exact (non-Newtonian) stability boundary of smooth
stratified flow (i.e., in case of horizontal gas-liquid flow). Therefore, the
knowledge gained from the stability analysis of Newtonian fluids is applicable
to those (usually highly viscous) non-Newtonian systems. Since the stability of
stratified flow involving highly viscous Newtonian liquids has not been
researched in the literature, interesting findings on the viscosity effects are
also obtained.

Some of these processes change gradually enough across both space and time to
be oversampled by the satellite image archive. In these cases, image time
series of Earth observations can support robust spatiotemporal analysis. In
this analysis, we leverage the spectral differences of green vegetation, soil,
and clouds to perform an EOF analysis which simultaneously characterizes
monsoon cloud cover and vegetation phenology in a temperate cloud forest in
Dhofar, southern Oman. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of daily
MODIS reflectance clearly distinguishes clouds and bare soil from both
grassland and cloud forest vegetation. Using the temporal feature space of the
low order principal components of the NDVI time series, we identify distinct
annual cycles of cloud cover and vegetation phenology corresponding to
geographically contiguous areas of coupled monsoon-phenological activity
(phenoregions). The EOF analysis characterizes the temporal dynamics of these
phenoregions. The wadi cloud forests of the Jabal Al Qara and Jabal Al Qamar
can each be described with 2 distinct spatiotemporal patterns of monsoon
phenology, corresponding to the eastern and western portions of each range. In
addition, the rangetop grasslands of the Jabal Al Qara show 3 distinct
spatiotemporal patterns, corresponding to eastern, central, and western
portions of the range. While each phenoregion has a clearly repeating annual
cycle, each also demonstrates substantial interannual variability in both cloud
cover and phenology. This interannual variability is of a sufficient magnitude
to mask any trends in cloud cover or phenology in any of the regions in the
Dhofar Mountains. Finally, using the degree of asymmetry of the cumulative NDVI
time series, we infer a causal link between duration of cloud cover and
amplitude of phenology.

oscillating radio-frequency (RF) pulse/field is delicately dependent on the
ratio of the quadrupolar coupling constant to the amplitude of the pulse in
addition to its duration and oscillating frequency. Consequently, analytic
description of the excitation process in the density operator formalism has
remained less transparent within existing theoretical frameworks. As an
alternative, the utility of the ""concept of effective Floquet Hamiltonians"" is
explored in the present study to explicate the nuances of the excitation
process in multilevel systems. Employing spin I=3/2 as a case study, a unified
theoretical framework for describing the excitation of multiple-quantum (MQ)
transitions in static isotropic and anisotropic solids is proposed within the
framework of perturbation theory. The challenges resulting from the anisotropic
nature of the quadrupolar interactions are addressed within the effective
Hamiltonian framework. The possible role of the various interaction frames on
the convergence of the perturbation corrections is discussed along with a
proposal for a ""hybrid method"" for describing the excitation process in
anisotropic solids. Employing suitable model systems, the validity of the
proposed hybrid method is substantiated through a rigorous comparison between
simulations emerging from exact numerical and analytic methods.

abstraction of polynomials as exponent vectors over the natural numbers tagged
with the signs of the corresponding coefficients. It then uses, in turn, SMT to
solve linear problems over the reals to heuristically find suitable points that
translate back to satisfying points for the original problem. Systematic

strong decision procedure by itself but a valuable heuristic to use within a

entanglement and supporting emergent gauge fields. A vigorous search for
experimental realizations of these states has identified several materials with
properties hinting at QSL physics. A key issue in understanding these QSL
candidates is often the interplay of weak disorder of the crystal structure
with the spin liquid state. It has recently been pointed out that in at least
one important class of candidate QSLs - pyrochlore magnets based on non-Kramers
ions such as Pr$^{3+}$ or Tb$^{3+}$- structural disorder can actually promote a
$U(1)$ QSL ground state. Here we set this proposal on a quantitative footing by
analyzing the stability of the QSL state in the minimal model for these
systems: a random transverse field Ising model. We consider two kinds of
instability, which are relevant in different limits of the phase diagram:
condensation of spinons and confinement of the $U(1)$ gauge fields. Having
obtained stability bounds on the QSL state we apply our results directly to the
disordered candidate QSL Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. We find that the available data for
currently studied samples of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is most consistent with it a
ground state outside the spin liquid regime, in a paramagnetic phase with
quadrupole moments near saturation due to the influence of structural disorder.

Navier-Stokes equations using high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods
for discretization in space. For DG methods applied to the dual splitting
projection method, instabilities have recently been reported that occur for
coarse spatial resolutions and small time step sizes. By means of numerical
investigation we give evidence that these instabilities are related to the
discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the velocity divergence term and the
pressure gradient term that couple velocity and pressure. Integration by parts
of these terms with a suitable definition of boundary conditions is required in
order to obtain a stable and robust method. Since the intermediate velocity
field does not fulfill the boundary conditions prescribed for the velocity, a
consistent boundary condition is derived from the convective step of the dual
splitting scheme to ensure high-order accuracy with respect to the temporal
discretization. This new formulation is stable in the limit of small time steps
for both equal-order and mixed-order polynomial approximations. Although the
dual splitting scheme itself includes inf-sup stabilizing contributions, we
demonstrate that spurious pressure oscillations appear for equal-order
polynomials and small time steps highlighting the necessity to consider inf-sup
stability explicitly.

the modern transplant operation is well established, the lack of heart
donations becomes a big restriction on transplantation frequency. With respect
to this matter, ventricular assist devices (VADs) can play an important role in
supporting patients during waiting period and after the surgery. Moreover, it
has been shown that VADs by means of blood pump have advantages for working
under different conditions. While a lot of work has been done on modeling the
functionality of the blood pump, but quantifying uncertainties in a numerical
model is a challenging task. We consider the Polynomial Chaos (PC) method,
which is introduced by Wiener for modeling stochastic process with Gaussian
distribution. The Galerkin projection, the intrusive version of the generalized
Polynomial Chaos (gPC), has been densely studied and applied for various
problems. The intrusive Galerkin approach could represent stochastic process
directly at once with Polynomial Chaos series expansions, it would therefore
optimize the total computing effort comparing with classical non-intrusive
methods. We compared different preconditioning techniques for a steady state
simulation of a blood pump configuration in our previous work, the comparison
shows that an inexact multilevel preconditioner has a promising performance. In
this work, we show an instationary blood flow through a FDA blood pump
configuration with Galerkin Projection method, which is implemented in our open
source Finite Element library Hiflow3. Three uncertainty sources are
considered: inflow boundary condition, rotor angular speed and dynamic
viscosity, the numerical results are demonstrated with more than 30 Million
degrees of freedom by using supercomputer.

superconducting circuits and molecular qubits, for attractive candidates of
quantum computations. Molecular qubits, which benefit from the power of
chemistry for the tailored and inexpensive synthesis of new systems, face the
challenge from decoherence effect. The decoherence effect is due to the
molecular qubits' inevitable interactions to their environment. Strategies to
overcome decoherence effect have been developed, such as designing a nuclear
spin free environment and working at atomic clock transitions. These chemical
approaches, however, have some fundamental limitations. For example, chemical
approach restricts the ligand selection and design to ligands with zero nuclear
magnetic dipole moment, such as carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Herein, a physical
approach, named Dynamical decoupling (DD), is utilized to combat decoherence,
while the limitations of the chemical approaches can be avoided. The phase
memory time $T_2$ for a transition metal complex has been prolonged to exceed
one millisecond ($1.4~$ms) by employing DD. The single qubit figure of merit
$Q_M $ reaches $ 1.4\times 10^5$, which is $40$ times better than that
previously reported value for such system. Our results show that molecular
qubits, with milliseconds $T_2$, are promising candidates for quantum
information processing.

since it can be used to entangle spin qubits and create logical spin qubits.
However, the influence of the electronic valley degree of freedom in silicon on
exchange interactions is presently the subject of important open questions.
Here we investigate the influence of valleys on exchange in a coupled
donor/quantum dot system, a basic building block of recently proposed schemes
for robust quantum information processing. Using a scanning tunneling
microscope tip to position the quantum dot with sub-nm precision, we find a
near monotonic exchange characteristic where lattice-aperiodic modulations
associated with valley degrees of freedom comprise less than 2~\% of exchange.
From this we conclude that intravalley tunneling processes that preserve the
donor's $\pm x$ and $\pm y$ valley index are filtered out of the interaction
with the $\pm z$ valley quantum dot, and that the $\pm x$ and $\pm y$
intervalley processes where the electron valley index changes are weak.
Complemented by tight-binding calculations of exchange versus donor depth, the
demonstrated electrostatic tunability of donor/QD exchange can be used to
compensate the remaining intravalley $\pm z$ oscillations to realise uniform
interactions in an array of highly coherent donor spins.

using electrochemical measurements that the capacitance is not significantly
affected when switching from a pure ionic liquid to a conventional organic
electrolyte using the same ionic species. By performing additional molecular
dynamics simulations, we interpret this result as an increasing difficulty of
separating ions of opposite charges when they are more concentrated, i.e. in
the absence of a solvent which screens the Coulombic interactions. The charging
mechanism consistently changes with ion concentration, switching from
counter-ion adsorption in the diluted organic electrolyte to ion exchange in
the pure ionic liquid. Contrarily to the capacitance, in-pore diffusion
coefficients largely depend on the composition, with a noticeable slowing of
the dynamics in the pure ionic liquid.

quest is extremely challenging, and it has become clear that a firm theoretical
concept from the viewpoint of band-structure engineering is needed. In this

compounds, which originally attracted attention as a family of superconductors

very high thermoelectric performance with elemental substitution. In

the square-lattice network. Our study offers one ideal limit of the band

phonon-mediated process whose energy evolution with the number of layers
surprisingly follows a simple model of a two-dimensional confinement. The
energy position of the direct band-gap response (A and B resonances) is only
weakly dependent on the layer thickness, which underlines an approximate
compensation of the effect of the reduction of the exciton binding energy by
the shrinkage of the apparent band gap. The A-exciton absorption-type spectra
in multilayer WS$_2$ display a non-trivial fine structure which results from
the specific hybridization of the electronic states in the vicinity of the

network attacks such as session hijacking. Hence, research focuses on network
anomaly detection based on meta--data (message sizes, timing, command
sequence), or on the state values of the physical process. In this work we
present a class of semantic network-based attacks against SCADA systems that
are undetectable by the above mentioned anomaly detection. After hijacking the
communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), our attacks cause the HMI to present a
fake view of the industrial process, deceiving the human operator into taking
manual actions. Our most advanced attack also manipulates the messages
generated by the operator's actions, reversing their semantic meaning while
causing the HMI to present a view that is consistent with the attempted human
actions. The attacks are totaly stealthy because the message sizes and timing,
the command sequences, and the data values of the ICS's state all remain
legitimate.
  We implemented and tested several attack scenarios in the test lab of our
local electric company, against a real HMI and real PLCs, separated by a
commercial-grade firewall. We developed a real-time security assessment tool,
that can simultaneously manipulate the communication to multiple PLCs and cause
the HMI to display a coherent system--wide fake view. Our tool is configured
with message-manipulating rules written in an ICS Attack Markup Language (IAML)
we designed, which may be of independent interest. Our semantic attacks all
successfully fooled the operator and brought the system to states of blackout

behave according to certain consistency criteria like atomicity, despite being
optimized to avoid blocking and exploit parallelism, e.g., by using atomic
machine instructions like compare and exchange (cmpxchg). Exposing atomicity
violations is important since they generally lead to elusive bugs that are
difficult to identify, reproduce, and ultimately repair.
  In this work we expose atomicity violations in concurrent object
implementations from the most widely-used software development kit: The Java

harnesses containing few concurrent method invocations. While stress testing is
effective at exposing violations given catalytic test harnesses and lightweight
means of falsifying atomicity, divining effectual catalysts can be difficult,
and atomicity checks are generally cumbersome. We overcome these problems by
automating test-harness search, and establishing atomicity via membership in
precomputed sets of acceptable return-value outcomes. Our approach enables
testing millions of executions of each harness each second (per processor
core). This scale is important since atomicity violations are observed in very

issues intensively based on data. The large variety and quantity of data
available should be explored but this brings important challenges. For
instance, although there are powerful computer vision methods that may be
explored, they may require large annotated datasets. In this work we propose a
novel approach to automatically creating an object recognition system with
minimal manual annotation. The basic idea behind the method is to use large
input datasets using available online cameras on large cities. A off-the-shelf
weak classifier is used to detect an initial set of urban elements of interest
(e.g. cars, pedestrians, bikes, etc.). Such initial dataset undergoes a quality
control procedure and it is subsequently used to fine tune a strong classifier.
Quality control and comparative performance assessment are used as part of the
pipeline. We evaluate the method for detecting cars based on monitoring
cameras. Experimental results using real data show that despite losing
generality, the final detector provides better detection rates tailored to the
selected cameras. The programmed robot gathered 770 video hours from 24 online
city cameras (\~300GB), which has been fed to the proposed system. Our approach
has shown that the method nearly doubled the recall (93\%) with respect to
state-of-the-art methods using off-the-shelf algorithms.

no effect. Within the full relativistic picture this remains an important open

we show for the first time that the backreaction from structure can differ by
many orders of magnitude depending upon the slicing of spacetime one chooses to
average over. In the worst case, where smoothing is carried out in synchronous

(1) Orchestrating Network Formation: We consider the problem of orchestrating
formation of a social network having a certain given topology that may be
desirable for the intended usecases. Assuming the social network nodes to be
strategic in forming relationships, we derive conditions under which a given
topology can be uniquely obtained. We also study the efficiency and robustness
of the derived conditions. (2) Multi-phase Influence Maximization: We propose
that information diffusion be carried out in multiple phases rather than in a
single instalment. With the objective of achieving better diffusion, we
discover optimal ways of splitting the available budget among the phases,
determining the time delay between consecutive phases, and also finding the
individuals to be targeted for initiating the diffusion process. (3) Scalable
Preference Aggregation: It is extremely useful to determine a small number of
representatives of a social network such that the individual preferences of
these nodes, when aggregated, reflect the aggregate preference of the entire
network. Using real-world data collected from Facebook with human subjects, we
discover a model that faithfully captures the spread of preferences in a social
network. We hence propose fast and reliable ways of computing a truly
representative aggregate preference of the entire network. In particular, we
develop models and methods for solving the above problems, which primarily deal
with formation and analysis of social networks.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) affect all inhomogeneous magnetic
states either subtly or spectacularly. E.g., DMIs cause a chirality selection

analysis was used to get vibrations, and these are analysed using mode
character indicators which can quantify: how active an element is in a mode;
the overall direction of the mode; and which chemical coordinates are relevant.
We examined the 4 possible packing structures. We find that the more
thermodynamically stable structures were less perturbed by the surface and more
supported by the surrounding monolayer. The surface-perturbed modes were below
100cm$^{-1}$, had a higher global, carbon, sulfur, longitudinal and torsional
characters, indicating unit cell backbone motions, often with increased S
motion parallel to the surface, and an increased terminal methyl group motion.
Modes identified by this technique showed a difference between experimental
vibrations (with and without the surface) that was twice as large as those not
identified. The surrounding monolayer had a larger effect on a single molecule
dynamics than the surface, including stabilising the molecules enough for 12
high energy modes to move $\approx$425cm$^{-1}$ down in energy to below $k_B
T$, allowing them to be populated at room temperature. These modes had higher
local and higher H characters, and were highly modulated by the SAM structure.

there is a divergent length scale related to the response to an inclusion of

the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) to generate tracklets, tracks and
orbits with a realistic detection density for one month of the LSST survey. The
main goals of the study were to understand whether a) the linking of Near-Earth
Objects (NEOs) into orbits can succeed in a realistic survey, b) the number of
false tracks and orbits will be manageable, and c) the accuracy of linked
orbits would be sufficient for automated processing of discoveries and
attributions. We found that the overall density of asteroids was more than 5000
per LSST field near opposition on the ecliptic, plus up to 3000 false
detections per field in good seeing. We achieved 93.6% NEO linking efficiency
for H<22 on tracks composed of tracklets from at least three distinct nights
within a 12-day interval. The derived NEO catalog was comprised of 96% correct
linkages. Less than 0.1% of orbits included false detections, and the remainder
of false linkages stemmed from main belt confusion, which was an artifact of
the short time span of the simulation. The MOPS linking efficiency can be
improved by refined attribution of detections to known objects and by improved
tuning of the internal kd-tree linking algorithms.

with that asymptotic behaviour and with the known virial coefficients raises an
analytical difficulty which can be solved if a glassy transition occurs in the
disordered metastable phase at a density intermediate between the freezing
point and the random close packing limit, numerically close to the melting
point. The estimated value for the transition point, which is identified with
random loose packing, is in good agreement with earlier estimations.

mostly due to the implementation of ad-hoc designed experimental setups,
theoretical support methods and numerical reconstructions. Especially for
biological samples, the high number of scattering events occurring during the
photon propagation process limit the penetration depth and the possibility to
outperform direct imaging in thicker and not transparent samples. In this
thesis, we will examine theoretically and experimentally the scattering process
from two opposite points of view, focusing also on the continuous stimulus
offered by the will to tackle some specific challenges in the emerging optical
imaging science. Firstly, we will discuss the light propagation in diffusive
biological tissues considering the particular case of the presence of optically
transparent regions enclosed in a highly scattering environment. The correct
inclusion of this information, can ultimately lead to higher resolution
reconstruction, especially in neuroimaging. On the other hand, we will examine
the extreme case of the three-dimensional imaging of a totally hidden sample,
in which the phase has been scrambled by a random scattering layer. By making
use of appropriate numerical methods, we will prove how it is possible to
outperform such hidden reconstruction in a very efficient way, opening the path
toward the unexplored field of three-dimensional hidden imaging. Finally, we
will present how, the properties noticed while addressing these problems,
leaded us to the development of a novel alignment-free three-dimensional
tomographic technique that we refer to as Phase-Retrieved Tomography.
Ultimately, we used this technique for the study of the fluorescence

service robotics. Our aim is to perceive and model an unprepared kitchen
scenario with many objects. We start with the perception of a single target
object. The modeling relies especially on fusing and merging of weak
information from the sensors of the robot in order to localize objects. This
requires the representation of various probability distributions of pose in
$S_3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ as orientation and position have to be localized. In
this thesis I present a framework for probabilistic modeling of poses in $S_3
\times \mathbb{R}^3$ that represents a large class of probability distributions
and provides among others the operations of the fusion and the merge of
estimates. Further it offers the propagation of uncertain information data. I
work out why we choose to represent the orientation part of a pose by a unit
quaternion. The translation part is described either by a 3-dimensional vector
or by a purely imaginary quaternion. This depends on whether we define the
probability density function or whether we want to represent a transformation
which consists of a rotation and a translation by a dual quaternion. A basic
probability den- sity function over the poses is defined by a tangent point on
the hypersphere and a 6-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The hypersphere is
embedded to the R4 which is representing a unit quaternions whereas the
Gaussian is defined over the product of the tangent space of the sphere and of
the space of translations. The projection of this Gaussian to the hypersphere
induces a distribution over poses in $S_3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$. The set of
mixtures of projected Gaussians can approximate the probability density
functions that arise in our application. Moreover it is closed under the
operations introduced in this framework and allows for an efficient
implementation.

as the maximization of submodular function under a matroid constraint. In
particular, we propose to model the total waiting time of passengers using a
quadratic Boolean function. The unary and pairwise terms in the function denote
the waiting time for single and pairwise allocation of passengers to elevators,
respectively. We show that this objective function is submodular. The matroid
constraints ensure that every passenger is allocated to exactly one elevator.
We use a greedy algorithm to maximize the submodular objective function, and
derive provable guarantees on the optimality of the solution. We tested our
algorithm using Elevate 8, a commercial-grade elevator simulator that allows
simulation with a wide range of elevator settings. We achieve significant
improvement over the existing algorithms.

  port-Hamiltonian systems approach","11 pages,5 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a universal phenomenon that the state and input of the continuous
stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems are both disturbed. This paper proposes a
(state, input)-disturbed port-Hamiltonian framework that can be used to model
and further designs a stochastic passivity based controller to asymptotically
stabilize in probability the (state, input)-disturbed CSTR (sidCSTR) systems.
The opposite entropy function and the availability function are selected as the
Hamiltonian for the model and control purposes, respectively. Furthermore, the
proposed (state, input)-disturbed port-Hamiltonian model can simultaneously
characterize the first law and the second law of thermodynamics when the
opposite entropy function acts as the Hamiltonian. A simple CSTR example
illustrates how the port-Hamiltonian method is utilized for modeling and
controlling sidCSTR systems.

  Membrane and Sickle Hemoglobin Fibers",,,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we develop a two-component coarse-grained molecular dynamics
(CGMD) model for simulating the erythrocyte membrane. This proposed model
possesses the key feature of combing the lipid bilayer and the erythrocyte
cytoskeleton, thus showing both the fluidic behavior of the lipid bilayer and
elastic properties of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. The proposed model
facilitates simulations that span large length-scales (~ micrometer) and
time-scales (~ ms). By tuning the interaction potential parameters, diffusivity
and bending rigidity of the membrane model can be controlled. In the study of
the membrane under shearing, we find that in low shear strain rate, the
developed shear stress is mainly due to the spectrin network, while the
viscosity of the lipid bilayer contributes to the resulting shear stress at
higher strain rates. In addition, the effects of the reduction of the spectrin
network connectivity on the shear modulus of the membrane are investigated.

algorithms (CLA) including related cortical-like algorithms that possesses
spatiotemporal properties. CLA is a suite of predictive machine learning
algorithms developed by Numenta Inc. and is based on the hierarchical temporal
memory (HTM). This paper presents an implementation of HTM-MAT with several
illustrative examples including several toy datasets and compared with two
sequence learning applications employing state-of-the-art algorithms - the
recurrentjs based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm and OS-ELM
which is based on an online sequential version of the Extreme Learning Machine.
The performance of HTM-MAT using two historical benchmark datasets and one real
world dataset is also compared with one of the existing sequence learning
applications, the OS-ELM. The results indicate that HTM-MAT predictions are
indeed competitive and can outperform OS-ELM in sequential prediction tasks.

around the world leading to higher frequency interactions between members of
communities that would be otherwise distant and disconnected. This paper
examines a model of opinion dynamics in interacting communities and studies how
increasing interaction frequency affects the ability for communities to retain
distinct identities versus falling into consensus or polarized states in which
community identity is lost. We also study the effect (if any) of opinion noise
related to a tendency for individuals to assert their individuality in
homogenous populations. Our work builds on a model we developed previously [11]
where the dynamics of opinion change is based on individual interactions that
seek to minimize some energy potential based on the differences between
opinions across the population.
