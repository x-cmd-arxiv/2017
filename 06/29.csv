the order-disorder transition, and with inter-particle interaction provide a
challenging research area in the field of quantum information. Experimental
progress with cold trapped atoms has corroborated this interest. In the present
work, S is calculated for the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dominant
dipolar interaction for different dipole strengths, trap aspect ratio and
number of particles (N). Trapped dipolar bosons in an anisotropic trap provide
an example of system where the effective interaction is strongly determined by
the trap geometry. The main conlcusion of the present calculation is that the
anisotropic trap reduces the number of degrees of freedom, resulting in more
ordered configurations. The Landsberg's order parameter exhibits quick
saturation with the increase in scattering length in both prolate and oblate
traps. We also define the threshold scattering length which makes the system
completely disordered. Unlike non-dipolar BEC in a spherical trap, we do not
find a universal linear relation between S and ln N, and we, therefore,
introduce a general quintic polynomial fit rather well working for a wide range
of particle number.

variable (including power law decay up to $t\mapsto (1+t)^{-(2+\varepsilon)}$

singularities of the form $x\mapsto 1/|x|^p$ in $d\geq 3$ or $x\mapsto
\delta_0(x)$ in $d=1$) attached to the space variables. These assumptions on
the interaction seem to be sharp and cover quantum mechanical models like the
Nelson model and the polaron problem with ultraviolet cut off (both carrying
bounded spatial interactions with power law decay in time) as well as the
Fr\""ohlich polaron with a short range interaction in time but carrying Coulomb
singularity in space. In this set up, we develop a unified approach for proving
a central limit theorem for the rescaled process of increments for any coupling
parameter and obtain an explicit expression for the limiting variance which is
strictly positive. As a further application, we study the solution of the
multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation in spatial dimensions $d\geq 3$.
When the noise is mollified both in time and space, we show that the averages

diffusion equation whose coefficients are homogenized in this limit.

partially-known environment or a robot arm moving around cluttered objects,
require finding collision-free paths quickly. Typically, this is solved by
constructing a graph, where vertices represent robot configurations and edges
represent potentially valid movements of the robot between these
configurations. The main computational bottlenecks are expensive edge
evaluations to check for collisions. State of the art planning methods do not
reason about the optimal sequence of edges to evaluate in order to find a
collision free path quickly. In this paper, we do so by drawing a novel
equivalence between motion planning and the Bayesian active learning paradigm
of decision region determination (DRD). Unfortunately, a straight application
of existing methods requires computation exponential in the number of edges in
a graph. We present BISECT, an efficient and near-optimal algorithm to solve
the DRD problem when edges are independent Bernoulli random variables. By
leveraging this property, we are able to significantly reduce computational
complexity from exponential to linear in the number of edges. We show that

treated within Kubo formalism and particular attention is payed to the
modifications that result from a finite $m$ and $b$. We consider how these
modifications change when a finite residual scattering rate $\Gamma$ is
included. For $\Gamma<m$ the A.C. conductivity as a function of photon energy
$\Omega$ continues to display the two quasilinear energy regions of the clean
limit for $\Omega$ below the onset of the second electronic band which is
gapped at ($ m+b $). For $\Gamma$ of the order $m$ little trace of two distinct
linear energy scales remain and the optical response has evolved towards that
for $m=b=0$. Although some quantitative differences remain there are no
qualitative differences. The magnitude of the D.C. conductivity
$\sigma^{DC}(T=0)$ at zero temperature ($T=0$) and chemical potential ($\mu=0$)
is altered. While it remains proportional to $\Gamma$ it becomes inversely
dependent on an effective Fermi velocity out of the Weyl nodes equal to
$v_{F}^\ast=v_{F}\sqrt{b^2-m^2}/b$ which decreases strongly as the phase
boundary between Weyl semimetal and gapped Dirac phase (GDSM) is approached at
$b=m$. The leading term in the approach to $\sigma^{DC}(T=0)$ for finite
$T/\Gamma$, $\mu/\Gamma$ and $\Omega/\Gamma$ is found to be quadratic. The
coefficient of these corrections tracks closely the $b/m$ dependence of the

Energy Survey (DES) 3x2pt DES Year 1 (Y1) analysis, which combines
configuration-space two-point statistics from three different cosmological
probes: cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, using data
from the first year of DES observations. We have developed two independent
modeling pipelines and describe the code validation process. We derive
expressions for analytical real-space multi-probe covariances, and describe
their validation with numerical simulations. We stress-test the inference
pipelines in simulated likelihood analyses that vary 6-7 cosmology parameters
plus 20 nuisance parameters and precisely resemble the analysis to be presented
in the DES 3x2pt analysis paper, using a variety of simulated input data
vectors with varying assumptions.
  We find that any disagreement between pipelines leads to changes in assigned
likelihood $\Delta \chi^2 \le 0.045$ with respect to the statistical error of
the DES Y1 data vector. We also find that angular binning and survey mask do
not impact our analytic covariance at a significant level. We determine lower
bounds on scales used for analysis of galaxy clustering (8 Mpc$~h^{-1}$) and
galaxy-galaxy lensing (12 Mpc$~h^{-1}$) such that the impact of modeling
uncertainties in the non-linear regime is well below statistical errors, and
show that our analysis choices are robust against a variety of systematics.
These tests demonstrate that we have a robust analysis pipeline that yields
unbiased cosmological parameter inferences for the flagship 3x2pt DES Y1
analysis. We emphasize that the level of independent code development and
subsequent code comparison as demonstrated in this paper is necessary to
produce credible constraints from increasingly complex multi-probe analyses of
current data.

interpreted as the consequence of topological valley Hall currents carried by
the Fermi sea states just beneath the bulk gap $E_g$ induced by the inversion
symmetry breaking. However, the valley Hall conductivity $\sigma^v_{xy}$,
quantized inside $E_g$, is not directly measurable. Conversely, the
Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formula, as numerically exact approach to observable
nonlocal transport quantities, yields $R_\mathrm{NL} \equiv 0$ for the same
simplistic Hamiltonian of gapped graphene that generates $\sigma^v_{xy} \neq
0$. We combine ab initio with quantum transport calculations to demonstrate
that G/hBN wires with zigzag edges host dispersive edge states near the DP that
are absent in theories based on the simplistic Hamiltonian. Although such edge
states exist also in isolated zigzag graphene wires, aligned hBN is required to
modify their energy-momentum dispersion and generate $R_\mathrm{NL} \neq 0$
near the DP persisting in the presence of edge disorder. Concurrently, the edge
states resolve the long-standing puzzle of why the highly insulating state of

relativistic mean field theory for hadronic matter. In the case of rapid
transitions at the interface we find a general relativistic version of the
reaction mode which has similar properties as its classical counterpart. We
also show that the usual static stability condition $\partial M/\partial

is $M$, remains always true for rapid transitions but breaks down in general
for slow transitions. In fact, for slow transitions we find that the frequency
of the fundamental mode can be a real number (indicating stability) even for
some branches of stellar models that verify $\partial M/\partial \rho_c \leq

modes, ""clockwork gravitons,"" with a very compressed mass spectrum, whose
interaction strengths are much stronger than that of massless gravitons. In
this work, we compute the lowest order contributions of the clockwork gravitons
to the anomalous magnetic moment, $g-2$, of muon in the context of extra
dimensional model with a five dimensional Planck mass, $M_5$. We find that the
total contributions are rather insensitive to the detailed model parameters,
and determined mostly by the value of $M_5$. In order to account for the
current muon $g-2$ anomaly, $M_5$ should be around $0.2~{\rm TeV}$, and the
size of the extra dimension has to be quite large, $l_5 \gtrsim 10^{-7}\,$m.
For $M_5\gtrsim1~{\rm TeV}$, the clockwork graviton contributions are too small
to explain the current muon $g-2$ anomaly. We also compare the clockwork
graviton contributions with other extra dimension models such as
Randall-Sundrum models or large extra dimension models. We find that the
leading contributions in the small curvature limit are universal, but the
cutoff-independent subleading contributions vary for different background
geometries and the clockwork geometry gives the smallest subleading
contributions.

accepted form of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (HUR). It gets modified
when we consider it for entangled particles. But this formulation does not
consider the measurement process itself. There are reformulation of the
uncertainty relations called the generalized uncertainty relations by including
the measurement process into the uncertainty relation. HUR gets modified for
the case of entangled particles. Here it is shown that the limit of the
Generalized Uncertainty Relation (GUR) also reduces for entangled particles.
So, GUR also shows similar trend as that of the HUR for entangled particles.
Also as entanglement increases, the uncertainty reduces and measurement becomes
more precise.

many-body systems is that the entanglement entropy is not an extensive
quantity. In one dimension, there exists a proof that a finite correlation
length sets a constant upper-bound on the entanglement entropy, called the area
law. However, the known bound exists only in a hypothetical limit, rendering
its physical relevance highly questionable. In this paper, we give a simple
proof of the area law for entanglement entropy in one dimension under the
condition of exponentially decaying correlations. Our proof dramatically
reduces the previously known bound on the entanglement entropy, bringing it,
for the first time, into a realistic regime. The proof is composed of several
simple and straightforward steps based on elementary quantum information tools.
We discuss the underlying physical picture, based on a renormalization-like
construction underpinning the proof, which transforms the entanglement entropy
of a continuous region into a sum of mutual informations in different length
scales and the entanglement entropy at the boundary.

(IoT) is to discover a massive number of devices and to allow them reliable
access to shared channels. Oftentimes these devices transmit short messages
randomly and sporadically. This paper proposes a novel signaling scheme for
grant-free massive access, where each device encodes its identity and/or
information in a sparse set of tones. Such transmissions are implemented in the
form of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Under some mild
conditions and assuming device delays to be bounded unknown multiples of symbol
intervals, sparse OFDMA is proved to enable arbitrarily reliable asynchronous
device identification and message decoding with a codelength that is O(K(log K
+ log S + log N)), where N denotes the device population, K denotes the actual
number of active devices, and log S is essentially equal to the number of bits
a device can send (including its identity). By exploiting the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), the computational complexity for discovery and decoding can be
made to be sub-linear in the total device population. To prove the concept, a
specific design is proposed to identify up to 100 active devices out of
$2^{38}$ possible devices with up to 20 symbols of delay and moderate
signal-to-noise ratios and fading. The codelength compares much more favorably

of astrophysics is built, but large swaths of model parameter space remain
uncalibrated by observations. The best calibrators are eclipsing binaries in
clusters, allowing measurement of masses, radii, luminosities, and
temperatures, for stars of known metallicity and age. We present the discovery
and detailed characterization of PTFEB132.707+19.810, a P=6.0 day eclipsing
binary in the Praesepe cluster ($\tau$~600--800 Myr; [Fe/H]=0.14$\pm$0.04). The
system contains two late-type stars (SpT$_P$=M3.5$\pm$0.2;
SpT$_S$=M4.3$\pm$0.7) with precise masses ($M_p=0.3953\pm0.0020$~$M_{\odot}$;
$M_s=0.2098\pm0.0014$~$M_{\odot}$) and radii ($R_p=0.363\pm0.008$~$R_{\odot}$;
$R_s=0.272\pm0.012$~$R_{\odot}$). Neither star meets the predictions of stellar
evolutionary models. The primary has the expected radius, but is cooler and
less luminous, while the secondary has the expected luminosity, but is cooler
and substantially larger (by 20%). The system is not tidally locked or
circularized. Exploiting a fortuitous 4:5 commensurability between $P_{orb}$
and $P_{rot,prim}$, we demonstrate that fitting errors from the unknown spot
configuration only change the inferred radii by <1--2%. We also analyze subsets
of data to test the robustness of radius measurements; the radius sum is more
robust to systematic errors and preferable for model comparisons. We also test
plausible changes in limb darkening, and find corresponding uncertainties of
~1%. Finally, we validate our pipeline using extant data for GU Boo, finding
that our independent results match previous radii to within the mutual
uncertainties (2--3%). We therefore suggest that the substantial discrepancies
are astrophysical; since they are larger than for old field stars, they may be
tied to the intermediate age of PTFEB132.707+19.810.

in generalized slow roll and a lower $H_0\approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. The
same in-phase acoustic residuals at $\ell>1000$ that drive the global $H_0$
constraints and appear as a lensing anomaly also favor running parameters which
allow even lower $H_0$, but not once lensing reconstruction is considered.
Polarization spectra are intrinsically highly sensitive to these parameter
shifts, and even more so in the Planck 2015 TE data due to an outlier at $\ell
\approx 165$, which disfavors the best fit $H_0$ $\Lambda$CDM solution by more
than $2\sigma$, and high $H_0$ value at almost $3\sigma$. Current polarization
data also slightly enhance the significance of a sharp suppression of
large-scale power but leave room for large improvements in the future with
cosmic variance limited $E$-mode measurements.

at a fraction of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate, since the stellar
envelope is inhomogeneous, but may still be able to accrete at hyper-critical

gravitational wave sources detectable in the Advanced LIGO band as far away as
the Magellanic Clouds. To characterize their evolution, we perform orbital
integrations using 1D models of $12 M_\odot$ and $20 M_\odot$ primaries,
considering the effects of density gradient on the accretion onto the NS and
spin evolution. From the range of possible accretion rates relevant to common
envelope evolution, we find that these systems may be louder gravitational wave
sources than low-mass X-ray binaries like Sco X-1, which are currently the

was located very close to the blackhole (~30 gravitational radii) and moved
sub-relativistically. We reanalyze the lag spectrum, pointing out that dilution
effects cause it to indicate a geometric scale an order of magnitude larger
than previously inferred. If the X-ray continuum is produced by a relativistic
jet, as suggested by rapid variability, high luminosity and hard spectrum, this
larger scale predicts an Fe ionization state consistent with efficient
K{\alpha} production. Moreover, the momentum of the jet radiation impinging on
the surrounding accretion flow on this larger scale accelerates a layer of gas
to speeds ~0.1-0.2c, consistent with the blueshifted line profile.
  Implications of our results on the global picture of jetted TDEs are
discussed. A power-law {\gamma}/X-ray spectrum may be produced by external
UV-optical photons being repetitively inverse-Compton scattered by cold
electrons in the jet, although our model for the K{\alpha} reverberation does
not depend on the jet radiation mechanism (magnetic reconnection in a Poynting
jet is still a viable mechanism). The non-relativistic wind driven by jet
radiation may explain the late-time radio rebrightening in Swift J1644+57. This
energy injection may also cause the thermal UV-optical emission from jetted
TDEs to be systematically brighter than in non-jetted ones.

be reformulated as a quadratic conic optimization problem. This connection
allows us to exchange concepts and ideas between quantum information and this
field of mathematics. For instance, copositive matrices can be understood as
indecomposable entanglement witnesses for DS states. As a consequence, we show
that positivity of the partial transposition (PPT) is sufficient and necessary

provide analytic examples of PPT-entangled states. Second, we develop new
sufficient separability conditions beyond the PPT criterion for bipartite DS

degenerate. The theoretical constraints of unitarity, perturbativity and vacuum
stability are considered, which requires that the heavy scalars $M_H \lesssim

also taken into account, including the direct searches of heavy neutral scalars
in the final state of the SM $h$, $W$ and $Z$ bosons, the differential
$t\bar{t}$ data, those from the charged scalar sector which is implied by the
oblique $T$ parameter, as well as the precise measurements of the electric

between the resonances and the SM background are crucially important for the
diphoton signals, and the CPV mixing of the quasi-degenerate heavy scalars
could enhance significantly the resonance peak. With an integrated luminosity
of 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC, almost the whole parameter space of CPV 2HDM
could be probed in the diphoton channel, and the CPV could also be directly

the optical thickness of the equatorial clouds is large compared to the polar

the integrated polarization can both increase or decrease with respect to a

will maximize the polarimetric signal whereas the integrated degree of

disk may also produce a detectable degree of polarization ($\lesssim$1%) even

extends over ~2000~${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and is broadly consistent with
expanding shell models. SED fitting that includes Spitzer/IRAC photometry

an evolved population. J1414+5446 lies 30"" from the centre of a known lensing

a highly uncertain estimate for the lensing magnification in the range $5 \leq

patients sleep positioning and motion affect recovery. Unfortunately, there is
no formal medical protocol to record, quantify, and analyze patient motion.
There is a small number of clinical studies, which use manual analysis of sleep
poses and motion recordings to support medical benefits of patient positioning
and motion monitoring. Manual processes are not scalable, are prone to human
errors, and strain an already taxed healthcare workforce. This study introduces
DECU (Deep Eye-CU): an autonomous mulitmodal multiview system, which addresses
these issues by autonomously monitoring healthcare environments and enabling
the recording and analysis of patient sleep poses and motion. DECU uses three
RGB-D cameras to monitor patient motion in a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
The algorithms in DECU estimate pose direction at different temporal
resolutions and use keyframes to efficiently represent pose transition
dynamics. DECU combines deep features computed from the data with a modified
version of Hidden Markov Model to more flexibly model sleep pose duration,
analyze pose patterns, and summarize patient motion. Extensive experimental
results are presented. The performance of DECU is evaluated in ideal (BC:
Bright and Clear/occlusion-free) and natural (DO: Dark and Occluded) scenarios
at two motion resolutions in a mock-up and a real ICU. The results indicate
that deep features allow DECU to match the classification performance of
engineered features in BC scenes and increase the accuracy by up to 8% in DO
scenes. In addition, the overall pose history summarization tracing accuracy
shows an average detection rate of 85% in BC and of 76% in DO scenes. The
proposed keyframe estimation algorithm allows DECU to reach an average 78%
transition classification accuracy.

direction, of the geometric entanglement entropy of an entangling cut passing
through $x$. Our proof involves a combination of the two independent methods
that were used recently to prove the weaker Averaged Null Energy Condition
(ANEC). In particular the properties of modular Hamiltonians under shape
deformations for the state $\psi$ play an important role, as do causality
considerations. We study the two point function of a ""probe"" operator
$\mathcal{O}$ in the state $\psi$ and use a lightcone limit to evaluate this
correlator. Instead of causality in time we consider \emph{causality in modular
time} for the modular evolved probe operators, which we constrain using
Tomita-Takesaki theory as well as certain generalizations pertaining to the
theory of modular inclusions. The QNEC follows from very similar considerations
to the derivation of the chaos bound and the causality sum rule. We use a kind
of defect Operator Product Expansion to apply the replica trick to these
modular flow computations, and the displacement operator plays an important
role. Our approach was inspired by the AdS/CFT proof of the QNEC which follows
from properties of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface near the boundary of AdS,
combined with the requirement of entanglement wedge nesting. Our methods were,
as such, designed as a precise probe of the RT surface close to the boundary of
a putative gravitational/stringy dual of \emph{any} QFT with an interacting UV

establish ebits of entanglement, qubits are more powerful resources than ebits.
We identify a new communications resource, the zero-bit, which is precisely
half the gap between them, replacing classical bits by zero-bits makes
teleportation asymptotically reversible. The decomposition of a qubit into an
ebit and two zero-bits has wide-ranging consequences including applications to
state merging, the quantum channel capacity, entanglement distillation, quantum
identification and remote state preparation. The source of these results is the
theory of approximate quantum error correction. The action of a quantum channel
is reversible if and only if no information is leaked to the environment, a
characterization that is useful even in approximate form. However, different
notions of approximation lead to qualitatively different forms of quantum error
correction in the limit of large dimension. We study the effect of a constraint
on the dimension of the reference system when considering information leakage.
While the resulting condition fails to ensure that the entire input can be
corrected, it does ensure that all subspaces of dimension matching that of the
reference are correctable. The size of the reference can be characterized by a
parameter $\alpha$, we call the associated resource an $\alpha$-bit. Changing
$\alpha$ interpolates between standard quantum error correction and quantum
identification, a form of equality testing for quantum states. We develop the
theory of $\alpha$-bits, including the applications above, and determine the

traction and stability control. Moreover, the emergence of new generation of
communication technologies has brought a new avenue to traditional studies on
vehicle estimation and control. To this end, this paper introduces a set of
distributed function calculation algorithms for vehicle networks, robust to
communication failures. The introduced algorithms enable each vehicle to gather
information from other vehicles in the network in a distributed manner. A
procedure to use such a bank of information for a single vehicle to diagnose
and correct a possible fault in its own speed estimation/measurement is
discussed. The functionality and performance of the proposed algorithms are
verified via illustrative examples and simulation results.

Considering a LC simulation centered at redshift $8$ where the mean neutral

misses out $\sim 40 \%$ of the information at the two ends of the $17.41 \,

and dynamic muscle states can be observed non-invasively, yet current
computational image understanding approaches are inadequate. We propose a new
approach in which deep learning methods are used for understanding the content
of ultrasound images of muscle in terms of its measured state. Ultrasound data
synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with measures of joint
torque/angle were recorded from 19 healthy participants (6 female, ages: 30 +-

extract a region of interest of the medial gastrocnemius. Then a deep
convolutional neural network was trained to predict the measured states (joint
angle/torque, electromyography) directly from the segmented images. Results
revealed for the first time that active and passive muscle states can be
measured directly from standard b-mode ultrasound images, accurately predicting
for a held out test participant changes in the joint angle, electromyography,

critical to maximizing its ability to classify data. In this paper, we compare
the standard ""fully supervised"" approach (that relies on knowledge of
event-by-event truth-level labels) with a recent proposal that instead utilizes
class ratios as the only discriminating information provided during training.
This so-called ""weakly supervised"" technique has access to less information
than the fully supervised method and yet is still able to yield impressive
discriminating power. In addition, weak supervision seems particularly well
suited to particle physics since quantum mechanics is incompatible with the
notion of mapping an individual event onto any single Feynman diagram. We
examine the technique in detail -- both analytically and numerically -- with a
focus on the robustness to issues of mischaracterizing the training samples.
Weakly supervised networks turn out to be remarkably insensitive to systematic
mismodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the event level outputs for
weakly versus fully supervised networks are probing different kinematics, even
though the numerical quality metrics are essentially identical. This implies
that it should be possible to improve the overall classification ability by
combining the output from the two types of networks. For concreteness, we apply
this technology to a signature of beyond the Standard Model physics to
demonstrate that all these impressive features continue to hold in a scenario
of relevance to the LHC.

speech recognition over the past few years. However, they are usually
computationally expensive due to the large number of matrix-vector

significant amounts of memory for inference because of the large model size.
For these two reasons, it is challenging to deploy neural network based speech
recognizers on resource-constrained platforms such as embedded devices. This
paper investigates the use of binary weights and activations for computation
and memory efficient neural network acoustic models. Compared to real-valued
weight matrices, binary weights require much fewer bits for storage, thereby
cutting down the memory footprint. Furthermore, with binary weights or
activations, the matrix-vector multiplications are turned into addition and
subtraction operations, which are computationally much faster and more energy
efficient for hardware platforms. In this paper, we study the applications of
binary weights and activations for neural network acoustic modeling, reporting
encouraging results on the WSJ and AMI corpora.

two-point functions in the massless regime of the XXZ spin-1/2 chain are
expressed in terms of properly regularised series of multiple integrals. These
series are obtained by taking, in an appropriate way, the thermodynamic limit
of the finite volume form factor expansions. The series are structured in way
allowing one to identify directly the contributions to the correlator stemming
from the conformal-type excitations on the Fermi surface and those issuing from
the massive excitations (deep holes, particles and bound states). The obtained
form factor series opens up the possibility of a systematic and exact study of
asymptotic regimes of dynamical correlation functions in the massless regime of
the XXZ spin $1/2$ chain. Furthermore, the assumptions on the microscopic
structure of the model's Hilbert space that are necessary so as to write down

prescription to associate the HI gas mass to N-body halos. We find that the DE
models leave a distinct signature on the HI spectra across a wide range of

onset of the non-linear regime of clustering. In the case of the non-standard

the topological quantum numbers of the quasiparticles, such as the fusion rules

associated with either time-reversal (denoted $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\bf T})$ or
spatial reflections. Under this symmetry, correlation functions of all Wilson
loop operators in the low energy topological quantum field theory (TQFT) are
invariant. However, the theories that we study possess a severe anomaly
associated with the failure to consistently localize the symmetry action to the
quasiparticles, precluding even defining a notion of symmetry
fractionalization. We present simple sufficient conditions which determine when
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{\bf T}$ symmetry localization anomalies exist. We present an
infinite series of TQFTs with such anomalies, some examples of which include
USp$(4)_2$ and SO$(4)_4$ Chern-Simons (CS) theory. The theories that we find
with these $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\bf T}$ anomalies can be obtained by gauging the
unitary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of a different TQFT with a $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\bf

true symmetry of the theory is $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\bf T}$, or (2) the theory can be
considered to be a theory of fermions, with ${\bf T}^2 = (-1)^{N_f}$
corresponding to fermion parity. Finally, we demonstrate that theories with the

higher compared to the Ring, whose velocity gradients appear to be flatter.

important to design systems with improved performance and stability. This is
problematic, however, because single-atom active sites are extremely difficult
to characterize with existing experimental techniques. Over the last 40 years,
surface science has provided the fundamental insights to understand
heterogeneous catalysis, but model systems in which metal atoms are stable on
well-characterized metal-oxide substrates at reaction temperatures are scarce.
In this perspective, I discuss what is already known about isolated metal atoms
adsorbed on model metal-oxide surfaces, and how this information can be used to
understand SAC. A key issue is that, although the highly-idealised model
systems studied in surface science may not be representative of a real working
catalyst, they do very much resemble what can be calculated using
state-of-the-art theoretical modelling. Thus, surface science offers an
opportunity to rigorously benchmark the theoretical approach to modelling SAC
in future. Perhaps more excitingly, several groups have developed model systems
where metal adatoms remain stable at elevated temperatures. To date however,
there has been no clear demonstration of catalytic activity. The perspective
closes with a brief discussion of the prospect for STM experiments under
realistic reaction conditions.

$r$, computed from the height fluctuation spectrum, is not equal to the bare
surface tension $\sigma$ introduced in the Helfrich theory. In this work we
relate these two surface tensions both analytically and numerically and compare
them to the Laplace tension $\gamma$, and the mechanical frame tension $\tau$.
Using one-loop renormalisation calculations, we obtain, in addition to the
effective bending modulus $\kappa_{\rm eff}$, a new expression for the
effective surface tension $\sigma_{\rm eff}=\sigma - \epsilon k_{\rm
B}T/(2a_p)$ where $a_p$ the projected cut-off area, and $\epsilon=3$ or 1
according to the allowed configurations. Moreover we show that the crumpling
transition for an infinite planar membrane occurs for $\sigma_{\rm eff}=0$, and
also that it coincides with vanishing Laplace and frame tensions. Using
extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, triangulated membranes of vesicles made
of $N=100-2500$ vertices are simulated. No local constraint is applied. It is
shown that the numerical $r$ is equal to $\sigma_{\rm eff}$ both with radial MC
moves ($\epsilon=3$) and with corrected MC moves locally normal to the
fluctuating membrane ($\epsilon=1$). For finite vesicles of typical size $R$,
two different regimes are defined: a tension regime for $\hat \sigma_{\rm

\sigma_{\rm eff}<0$. A shape transition from a quasi-spherical shape imposed by
the large surface energy, to more deformed shapes only controlled by the
bending energy, is observed numerically at $\hat \sigma_{\rm eff}\simeq 0$. We
propose that the buckling transition, observed for planar supported membranes
in the literature, occurs for $\hat \sigma_{\rm eff}\simeq-1$, the associated
negative frame tension playing the role of a compressive force.

that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound on local sensitivity and can
therefore be used to enforce differential privacy using any local

radiotherapy, that are currently used to treat cancer. It is common practice to
use a combination of these modalities to maximize clinical outcomes, which are
often measured by a balance between maximizing tumor damage and minimizing
normal tissue side effects due to treatment. However, multi-modality treatment
policies are mostly empirical in current practice, and are therefore subject to
individual clinicians' experiences and intuition. We present a novel
formulation of optimal multi-modality cancer management using a finite-horizon
Markov decision process approach. Specifically, at each decision epoch, the
clinician chooses an optimal treatment modality based on the patient's observed
state, which we define as a combination of tumor progression and normal tissue
side effect. Treatment modalities are categorized as (1) Type 1, which has a
high risk and high reward, but is restricted in the frequency of administration
during a treatment course, (2) Type 2, which has a lower risk and lower reward
than Type 1, but may be repeated without restriction, and (3) Type 3, no
treatment (surveillance), which has the possibility of reducing normal tissue
side effect at the risk of worsening tumor progression. Numerical simulations
using various intuitive, concave reward functions show the structural insights
of optimal policies and demonstrate the potential applications of using a
rigorous approach to optimizing multi-modality cancer management.

These approaches require advanced interference management techniques to cope

precoding and Multi User Detection. With respect to the former, several
peculiar challenges arise when designed for SatCom systems. In particular, to
maximise resource usage while minimising delay and latency, multiple users are
multiplexed in the same frame, thus imposing to consider multiple channel

users into simultaneously precoded and served clusters. Two similarity metrics
are used to this aim: the users' Euclidean distance and their channel distance,

magnetic field ($\vec B$), focused in the case in which $B$ is inhomogeneous,
keeping only the terms of the lowest order in $1/m^2_W$ and linear in the $B$
and its gradient. We show that the dispersion relation contains additional
anisotropic terms involving the derivatives of $\vec B$, such as the gradient
of $\hat k\cdot(\vec v\times\vec B)$, which involve the stream background
velocity, and a term of the form $\hat k\cdot(\nabla\times \vec B)$ that can be
present in the absence of the stream background, in addition to a term of the
form $\hat k\cdot\vec v$ and the well known term $\hat k\cdot\vec B$ that
arises in the constant $\vec B$ case. The derivative-dependent terms are even
under a $CP$ transformation. As a result, in contrast to the latter two just
mentioned, they depend on the sum of the particle and antiparticle densities
and therefore can be non-zero in a $CP$-symmetric medium in which the particle
and antiparticle densities are equal.

knowledge mobilization, specifically with respect to academia and industry
collaborations. These mechanisms include funding programs, research centers,
and conferences, among others. In this paper, we focus on one specific
knowledge mobilization mechanism, the CASCON conference, the annual conference
of the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS). The mandate of CAS when it was
established in 1990 was to foster collaborative work between the IBM Toronto
Lab and university researchers from around the world. The first CAS Conference
(CASCON) was held one year after CAS was formed in 1991. The focus of this
annual conference was, and continues to be, bringing together academic
researchers, industry practitioners, and technology users in a forum for
sharing ideas and showcasing the results of the CAS collaborative work. We
collected data about CASCON for the past 25 years including information about
papers, technology showcase demos, workshops, and keynote presentations. The
resulting dataset, called ""CASCONet"" is available for analysis and integration
with related datasets. Using CASCONet, we analyzed interactions between R&D
topics and changes in those topics over time. Results of our analysis show how
the domain of knowledge being mobilized through CAS had evolved over time. By
making CASCONet available to others, we hope that the data can be used in
additional ways to understand knowledge mobilization and translation in this
unique context.

$B$ mode polarization to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with a
sensitivity of about $10^{-3}$. Achieving this goal will not only require
sufficient detector array sensitivity but also unprecedented control of all
systematic errors inherent to CMB polarization measurements. Since polarization
measurements derive from differences between observations at different times
and from different sensors, detector response mismatches introduce leakages
from intensity to polarization and thus lead to a spurious $B$ mode signal.
Because the expected primordial $B$ mode polarization signal is dwarfed by the
known unpolarized intensity signal, such leakages could contribute
substantially to the final error budget for measuring $r.$ Using simulations we
estimate the magnitude and angular spectrum of the spurious $B$ mode signal
resulting from bandpass mismatch between different detectors. It is assumed
here that the detectors are calibrated, for example using the CMB dipole, so
that their sensitivity to the primordial CMB signal has been perfectly matched.
Consequently the mismatch in the frequency bandpass shape between detectors
introduces difference in the relative calibration of galactic emission
components. We simulate using a range of scanning patterns being considered for
future satellite missions. We find that the spurious contribution to $r$ from
reionization bump on large angular scales ($\ell < 10$) is $\approx 10^{-3}$
assuming large detector arrays and 20 percent of the sky masked. We show how
the amplitude of the leakage depends on the angular coverage per pixels that
results from the scan pattern.

The graph-based model is one of the typical cluster models. In the graph model,
clusters are generally defined as cliques. However, such an approach might be
too restrictive as in some applications, not all objects from the same cluster
must be connected. That is why different types of cliques relaxations often
considered as clusters.
  In our work, we consider a problem of partitioning graph into clusters and a
problem of isolating cluster of a special type whereby cluster we mean highly
connected subgraph. Initially, such clusterization was proposed by Hartuv and
Shamir. And their HCS clustering algorithm was extensively applied in practice.
It was used to cluster cDNA fingerprints, to find complexes in protein-protein
interaction data, to group protein sequences hierarchically into superfamily
and family clusters, to find families of regulatory RNA structures. The HCS
algorithm partitions graph in highly connected subgraphs. However, it is
achieved by deletion of not necessarily the minimum number of edges. In our
work, we try to minimize the number of edge deletions. We consider problems
from the parameterized point of view where the main parameter is a number of

particular, we augment the converter system with a virtual oscillator whose
frequency is driven by the DC-side voltage measurement and which sets the

between the converter in closed-loop and the SM dynamics. We then provide a
sufficient condition assuring existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic
stability of equilibria in a coordinate frame attached to the virtual
oscillator angle. By actuating the DC-side input of the converter we are able
to enforce this sufficient condition. In the same setting, we highlight strict
incremental passivity, droop, and power-sharing properties of the proposed

virtual transition amplitudes, and it is exactly solvable. In 2 * 1 model, the
probability for a particle, residing at time t -> -\infty in one dot, to remain
in the same dot at t -> \infty falls off exponentially with tunnel coupling. By
contrast, in 2 * 2 model, this probability grows exponentially with tunnel
coupling. The physical origin of this growth is the formation of the
tunneling-induced collective states in the system of two dots. This can be
viewed as manifestation of the Dicke effect.

to include the presence of deformed derivatives in the Lagrangian of a system
of particles and in the Lagrangian density of field-theoretic models. Classical
Euler-Lagrange equations and the Hamiltonian formalism have been re-assessed in
this approach. Whenever applied to a number of physical systems, the resulting
dynamical equations come out to be the correct ones found in the literature,
specially with mass-dependent and with non-linear equations for classical and
quantum-mechanical systems. In the present contribution, we extend the
variational approach with the intervalar form of deformed derivatives to study
higher-order dissipative systems, with application to concrete situations, such
as an accelerated point charge - this is the problem of the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force - to stochastic dynamics like the Langevin, the
advection-convection-reaction and Fokker-Planck equations, Korteweg-de Vries
equation, Landau-Lifshits-Gilbert equation and the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian.
By considering these different applications, we show that the formulation
investigated in this paper may be a simple and promising path for dealing with
dissipative, non-linear and stochastic systems through the variational

Scientific Collaboration has opened a new possibility for the study of
fundamental physics of gravitational interaction.
  This work conducts an analysis of possible polarization states of
gravitational waves (GW) radiated by the most promising types of sources to be
detected by the modern interferometric antennas: coalescing compact binaries
and collapsing supernovae. Several theoretical approaches to the current as
well as future gravitational wave signals interpretation are discussed together
with a strategy for a search for corresponding transients by means of
multimessenger astronomy.
  One of the aims of this thesis is to develop a new method for GW source
localization depending on a polarization state of an incoming GW in the case of
a detection by two interferometric antennas. Additionally, there is elaborated
a further method focused on a possibility to recognise different polarization
states of a GW detected by means of a network with three and more antennas in
operation. The both proposed methods have been applied to the LIGO events
GW150914, GW151226 and LVT151012, together with the matching of the results
with the currently known electromagnetic follow-ups to these GW events.
  The conclusion of this research is that there are opportunities for verifying
different predictions of the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation by means of
the analysis of the polarization states of the detected gravitational waves.
  All in all, this work provides a new test of the theoretical assumptions
about the nature of gravity as well as about the processes in relativistic
compact objects of various types.

how the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10-year LSST
survey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides
the most accurate photo-$z$ results. The LSST survey strategy naturally
produces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of
using an SED- and $z$-dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry
as a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass
effect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric
redshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be
adequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact
on LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass
effect can induce a bias in the photo-$z$ results, and caution against survey
strategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of
improving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide
for the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with

periodic modulation of $\approx1$ magnitude that is characteristic of the
heating of the photosphere of a low-mass companion star by a compact object.
The measured orbital period is 5.14817$\pm$0.00012 hr. The shape of the light
curve is variable, evidently due to the effects of flaring and asymmetric
heating. Spectroscopy reveals a companion of type M1 or later, having a radial
velocity amplitude of 315$\pm$17 km/s, with period and phasing consistent with
the heating interpretation. The mass function of the compact object is
0.69$\pm$0.11 $M_{\odot}$, which allows a neutron star in a high-inclination
orbit. Variable, broad H$\alpha$ emission is seen, which is probably associated
with a wind from the companion. These properties, as well as the X-ray and
gamma-ray luminosities at the inferred distance of <1.7 kpc, are consistent
with a redback millisecond pulsar in its non-accreting state. A search for

spectrum with signal to noise approximately 60 per pixel in the continuum near
Ly {\alpha} at $z_{\rm abs} = 2.504$. The larger dataset now available combines
to form an exceptionally high signal to noise spectrum, around 147 per pixel.
Several heavy element absorption lines are detected in this LLS, providing
strong constraints on the kinematic structure. We explore a suite of absorption
system models and find that the deuterium feature is likely to be contaminated
by weak interloping Ly {\alpha} absorption from a low column density H I cloud,
reducing the expected D/H precision. We find D/H =
$2.48^{+0.41}_{-0.35}\times10^{-5}$ for this system. Combining this new

implicitly inducing a covariate-dependent prior on the regression function.
Second, standard approaches to response surface modeling do not provide
adequate control over the strength of regularization over effect heterogeneity.
The Bayesian causal forest model permits treatment effect heterogeneity to be
regularized separately from the prognostic effect of control variables, making
it possible to informatively ""shrink to homogeneity"". We illustrate these
benefits via the reanalysis of an observational study assessing the causal
effects of smoking on medical expenditures as well as extensive simulation
studies.

efficiency in a one-dimensional chain of finite length $N$, and in particular
the beneficial or detrimental effect of dephasing on transport. The excitation
moves along the chain by coherent nearest-neighbor hopping $\Omega$, under the
action of static disorder $W$ and dephasing $\gamma$. The system is open due to
the coupling of the last site with an external acceptor system (sink), where
the excitation can be trapped with a rate $\Gamma_{\rm trap}$, which determines
the opening strength. While it is known that dephasing can help transport in
the localized regime, here we show that dephasing can enhance energy transfer
even in the ballistic regime. Specifically, in the localized regime we recover
previous results, where the optimal dephasing is independent of the chain
length and proportional to $W$ or $W^2/\Omega$. In the ballistic regime, the
optimal dephasing decreases as $1/N$ or $1/\sqrt{N}$ respectively for weak and
moderate static disorder. When focusing on the excitation starting at the
beginning of the chain, dephasing can help excitation transfer only above a
critical value of disorder $W^{\rm cr}$, which strongly depends on the opening
strength $\Gamma_{\rm trap}$. Analytic solutions are obtained for short chains.

are derived from spectra obtained by the Extreme-ultraviolet Variability
Experiment (EVE) over a 4-year period starting in 2010 near solar minimum and
continuing through the maximum of solar cycle 24. The DEMs are calculated using
six strong emission features dominated by Fe lines of charge states VIII, IX,
XI, XII, XIV, and XVI that sample the non-flaring coronal temperature range
0.3--5 MK. A proxy for the non-XVIII emission in the wavelength band around the
93.9 \AA\ line is demonstrated. There is little variability in the cool
component of the corona (T $<$ 1.3 MK) over the four years, suggesting that the
quiet-Sun corona does not respond strongly to the solar cycle, whereas the
hotter component (T $>$ 2.0 MK) varies by more than an order of magnitude. A
discontinuity in the behavior of coronal diagnostics in 2011 February--March,
around the time of the first X-class flare of cycle 24, suggests fundamentally
different behavior in the corona under solar minimum and maximum conditions.
This global state transition occurs over a period of several months. The DEMs
are used to estimate the thermal energy of the visible solar corona (of order
$10^{31}$ erg), its radiative energy loss rate (2.5--8 $\times 10^{27}$ erg
s$^{-1}$), and the corresponding energy turnover timescale (about an hour). The
uncertainties associated with the DEMs and these derived values are mostly due
to the coronal Fe abundance and density and the CHIANTI atomic line database.

of grand unification based on the view that lepton number is the fourth color.
Motivated by aesthetic demands, these attempts led to the suggestion that the
existing $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry be extended minimally to the quark-lepton
and left-right symmetric non-Abelian gauge structure $G(2,2,4) = SU(2)_L\times
SU(2)_R\times SU(4)$-color. This unified members of a family within a single
L-R self-conjugate multiplet. It also explained: the quantization of electric
charge, the co-existence of quarks and leptons, and that of their three forces,
while providing the appealing possibility that nature is fundamentally
left-right symmetric. The minimal extension of $G(2,2,4)$ to a simple group is
given by the symmetry $SO(10)$ that came a year later. The advantages of the
core symmetry $G(2,2,4)$, including those listed above (which are of course
retained by $SO(10)$), are noted. These include the introductions of: (i){ \it
the right-handed neutrino as a compelling member of each family}, (ii) (B-L) as
a local symmetry, and (iii) the relation $ m(\nu^\tau)_{Dirac} = m_{top}$.
These three features, as well as the gauge coupling unification scale, are
crucially needed to understand the tiny mass-scales of the neutrino
oscillations within the seesaw mechanism, and to implement successfully the
mechanism of baryogenesis via leptogenesis. Implications of a well-motivated
class of models based on supersymmetric $SO(10)$ or a string-unified $G(2,2,4)$
symmetry in 4D for (a) gauge coupling unification, (b) fermion masses and
mixings, (c) neutrino osillations, (d) baryogenesis via leptogenesis, and last
but not least (e) proton decay are presented. Recent works on the latter
providing upper limits on proton lifetimes suggest that the potential for
discovery of proton decay in the next-generation detectors would be high.

fluid-grain interactions, to understand the evolution of submerged granular
flows. The fluid phase is simulated using Multiple- Relaxation-Time LBM
(LBM-MRT) for numerical stability. In order to simulate interconnected pore
space in 2D, a reduction in the radius of the grains (hydrodynamic radius) is
assumed during LBM computations. The collapse of granular column in fluid is
compared with the dry cases to understand the effect of fluid on the runout

granular characteristics (initial packing) on the evolution of flow and run-out
distances for slope angles of 0{\deg}, 2.5{\deg}, 5{\deg} and 7.5{\deg}. The
granular flow dynamics is investigated by analysing the effect of hydroplaning,
water entrainment and viscous drag on the granular mass. The mechanism of
energy dissipation, shape of the flow front, water entrainment and evolution of
packing density is used to explain the difference in the flow characteristics

the large deformations of the objects, occlusions, and background clutter. In
this paper, we propose a frame-by-frame but computationally efficient approach
for video object segmentation by clustering visually similar generic object
segments throughout the video. Our algorithm segments various object instances
appearing in the video and then perform clustering in order to group visually
similar segments into one cluster. Since the object that needs to be segmented
appears in most part of the video, we can retrieve the foreground segments from
the cluster having maximum number of segments, thus filtering out noisy
segments that do not represent any object. We then apply a track and fill
approach in order to localize the objects in the frames where the object
segmentation framework fails to segment any object. Our algorithm performs
comparably to the recent automatic methods for video object segmentation when
benchmarked on DAVIS dataset while being computationally much faster.

using domain walls to manipulate the propagation of topologically protected

photons to the APOLLO detector at exquisitely well-defined time intervals as a

the ~3 mm level, suggesting that historical APOLLO data are of high quality and

all this gas collapsed under the influence of gravity and formed stars in a
local free-fall time, the star formation rate in the Galaxy would exceed that
observed by more than an order of magnitude. Other star-forming galaxies behave
similarly. Yet observations and simulations both suggest that the molecular gas
is indeed gravitationally collapsing, albeit hierarchically. Prompt stellar
feedback offers a potential solution to the low observed star formation rate if
it quickly disrupts star-forming clouds during gravitational collapse. However,
this requires that molecular clouds must be short-lived objects, raising the
question of how so much gas can be observed in the molecular phase. This can
occur only if molecular clouds form as quickly as they are destroyed,
maintaining a global equilibrium fraction of dense gas. We therefore examine
cloud formation timescales. We first demonstrate that supernova and superbubble
sweeping cannot produce dense gas at the rate required to match the cloud
destruction rate. On the other hand, Toomre gravitational instability can reach
the required production rate. We thus argue that, although dense, star-forming
gas may last only around a single global free-fall time, the dense gas in
star-forming galaxies can globally exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium
between formation by gravitational instability, and disruption by stellar
feedback. At redshift z >~ 2, the Toomre instability timescale decreases,
resulting in a prediction of higher molecular gas fractions at early times, in
agreement with observations.

  following the referee report",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aa7d55",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mechanism of angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks is
fundamental to understand the distributions of gas and dust in the disks. The
unprecedented, high spatial resolution ALMA observations taken toward HL Tau
and subsequent radiative transfer modeling reveal that a high degree of dust
settling is currently achieved at the outer part of the HL Tau disk. Previous
observations however suggest a high disk accretion rate onto the central star.
This configuration is not necessarily intuitive in the framework of the
conventional viscous disk model, since efficient accretion generally requires a
high level of turbulence, which can suppress dust settling considerably. We
develop a simplified, semi-analytical disk model to examine under what
condition these two properties can be realized in a single model. Recent,
non-ideal MHD simulations are utilized to realistically model the angular
momentum transport both radially via MHD turbulence and vertically via
magnetically induced disk winds. We find that the HL Tau disk configuration can
be reproduced well when disk winds are properly taken into account. While the
resulting disk properties are likely consistent with other observational
results, such an ideal situation can be established only if the plasma $\beta$
at the disk midplane is $\beta_0 \simeq 2 \times 10^4$ under the assumption of
steady accretion. Equivalently, the vertical magnetic flux at 100 au is about
0.2 mG. More detailed modeling is needed to fully identify the origin of the
disk accretion and quantitatively examine plausible mechanisms behind the
observed gap structures in the HL Tau disk.

semifinite von Neumann algebra. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a countably decomposable,
properly infinite, semifinite von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$ and let $\tau$ be a faithful normal semifinite tracial weight of
$\mathcal M$. Suppose that $H$ and $H_1$ are self-adjoint operators affiliated
with $\mathcal{M}$. We show that if $H-H_1$ is in $\mathcal{M}\cap
L^{1}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right)$, then the ${norm}$ absolutely continuous
parts of $H$ and $H_1$ are unitarily equivalent. This implies that the real
part of a non-normal hyponormal operator in $\mathcal M$ is not a perturbation
by $\mathcal{M}\cap L^{1}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right)$ of a diagonal operator.
Meanwhile, for $n\ge 2$ and $1\leq p<n$, by modifying Voiculescu's invariant we
give examples of commuting $n$-tuples of self-adjoint operators in
$\mathcal{M}$ that are not arbitrarily small perturbations of commuting
diagonal operators modulo $\mathcal{M}\cap L^{p}\left(\mathcal{M},\tau\right)$.

""feature engineering"" and conventional machine learning algorithms such as
conditional random fields and support vector machines. However, developing good
features is inherently heavily time-consuming. Conversely, more modern machine
learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved
capable of automatically learning effective features from either random
assignments or automated word ""embeddings"". Objectives. (i) To create a highly
accurate DNR and CCE system that avoids conventional, time-consuming feature
engineering. (ii) To create richer, more specialized word embeddings by using
health domain datasets such as MIMIC-III. (iii) To evaluate our systems over
three contemporary datasets. Methods. Two deep learning methods, namely the
Bidirectional LSTM and the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF, are evaluated. A CRF model
is set as the baseline to compare the deep learning systems to a traditional
machine learning approach. The same features are used for all the models.
Results. We have obtained the best results with the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF
model, which has outperformed all previously proposed systems. The specialized
embeddings have helped to cover unusual words in DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine,
but not in the 2010 i2b2/VA IRB Revision dataset. Conclusion. We present a
state-of-the-art system for DNR and CCE. Automated word embeddings has allowed
us to avoid costly feature engineering and achieve higher accuracy.
Nevertheless, the embeddings need to be retrained over datasets that are
adequate for the domain, in order to adequately cover the domain-specific
vocabulary.

(QTC) based on theoretical principles like information theory, Granger
causality and complexity. Recently, Virmani and Nagaraj (arXiv:1608.08450v2

Compression-Complexity, and on this basis, proposed a novel measure of network
complexity called Phi-Compression Complexity (Phi-C or $\Phi^C$). Their
computer simulations using Boolean networks showed that $\Phi^C$ compares
favorably to Giulio Tononi et al's Integrated Information measure $\Phi$ 3.0
and exhibits desirable mathematical and computational characteristics. Methods:
In the present work, $\Phi^C$ was measured for two types of simulated networks:
(A) Networks representing simple neuronal connectivity motifs (presented in
Fig.9 of Tononi and Sporns, BMC Neuroscience 4(1), 2003); (B) random networks
derived from Erd\""os-R \'enyi G(N, p)graphs. Code for all simulations was
written in Python 3.6, and the library NetworkX was used to simulate the
graphs. Results and discussions summary: In simulations A, for the same set of
networks, $\Phi^C$ values differ from the values of IIT 1.0 $\Phi$ in a
counter-intuitive manner. It appears that $\Phi^C$ captures some invariant
aspects of the interplay between information integration, network topology,
graph composition and node entropy. While Virmani and Nagaraj
(arXiv:1608.08450v2 [cs.IT]) sought to highlight the correlations between
$\Phi^C$ and IIT $\Phi$, the results of simulations A highlight the differences
between the two measures in the way they capture the integrated information. In
simulations B, the results of simulations A are extended to the more general
case of random networks. In the concluding section we outline the novel aspects
of this paper, and our ongoing and future research.

changing the orifice size, indicating its occurrence to be a localized

measurements using a batch algorithm, owing to computational and storage
constraints. It is not needed a priori to collect a fixed number of
measurements; rather one can keep collecting measurements until the quality of
reconstruction is satisfactory and stop taking further measurements once the
reconstruction is sufficiently accurate. We provide a proof-of-concept by
comparing the performance of our algorithm with the RLS-based batch
reconstruction strategy, known as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS),
on natural images. Experiments on a recently proposed focal plane array-based
imaging setup show up to 1 dB improvement in output peak signal-to-noise ratio
as compared with the total variation-based reconstruction.

edge- versus surface-contacted ferromagnetic metal-graphene interfaces (i.e.
nickel- and cobalt-graphene interfaces) using both single-layer and few-layer
graphene. Good qualitative agreement is obtained between theory and experiment.
In particular, in both theory and experiment, we observe that the contact
resistance of edge-contacted ferromagnetic metal-graphene interfaces is much
lower than that of surface-contacted ones, for all devices studied and
especially for the single-layer graphene systems. We show that this difference
in resistance is not due to differences in the metal-graphene coupling
strength, which we quantify using Hamiltonian matrix elements. Instead, the
larger contact resistance in surface contacts results from spin filtering at
the interface, in contrast to the edge-contacted case where both spins are
transmitted. Temperature-dependent resistance measurements beyond the Curie
temperature TC show that the spin degree of freedom is indeed important for the
experimentally measured contact resistance. These results show that it is
possible to induce a large change in contact resistance by changing the
temperature in the vicinity of TC, thus paving the way for

defined in terms of a center, which identifies a location of interest, such as
a post office or polling place, and all other network vertices must be labeled
with the center to which they are associated. We focus on defining geographic
districts that are equitable, in that every district has the same number of
vertices and the assignment is stable in terms of geographic distance. That is,
there is no unassigned vertex-center pair such that both would prefer each
other over their current assignments. We solve this problem using a version of
the classic stable matching problem, called symmetric stable matching, in which
the preferences of the elements in both sets obey a certain symmetry. In our
case, we study a graph-based version of stable matching in which nodes are
stably matched to a subset of nodes denoted as centers, prioritized by their
shortest-path distances, so that each center is apportioned a certain number of
nodes. We show that, for a planar graph or road network with $n$ nodes and $k$
centers, the problem can be solved in $O(n\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time, which improves
upon the $O(nk)$ runtime of using the classic Gale-Shapley stable matching
algorithm when $k$ is large. Finally, we provide experimental results on road
networks for these algorithms and a heuristic algorithm that performs better
than the Gale-Shapley algorithm for any range of values of $k$.

  Fibrosis","20 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Effective allocation of limited donor lungs in cystic fibrosis
(CF) requires accurate survival predictions, so that high-risk patients may be
prioritized for transplantation. In practice, decisions about allocation are
made dynamically, using routinely updated assessments. We present a novel tool
for evaluating risk prediction models that, unlike traditional methods,
captures the dynamic nature of decision-making. Methods: Predicted risk is used
as a score to rank incident deaths versus patients who survive, with the goal
of ranking the deaths higher. The mean rank across deaths at a given time
measures time-specific predictive accuracy; when assessed over time, it
reflects time-varying accuracy. Results: Applying this approach to CF Registry
data on patients followed from 1993-2011, we show that traditional methods do
not capture the performance of models used dynamically in the clinical setting.
Previously proposed multivariate risk scores perform no better than forced
expiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage of predicted normal (FEV1%)
alone. Despite its value for survival prediction, FEV1% has a low sensitivity
of 45% over time (for fixed specificity of 95%), leaving room for improvement
in prediction. Finally, prediction accuracy with annually-updated FEV1% shows
minor differences compared to FEV1% updated every 2 years, which may have
clinical implications regarding the optimal frequency of updating clinical
information. Conclusions: It is imperative to continue to develop models that
accurately predict survival in CF. Our proposed approach can serve as the basis
for evaluating the predictive ability of these models by better accounting for
their dynamic clinical use.

individual patients toward predicting likely transitions in their future health
status. If accurate predictions are developed, then a prognostic mode can
identify patients at greatest risk for future adverse events, and may be used
clinically to define populations appropriate for targeted intervention. In
practice, a prognostic model is often used to guide decisions at multiple time
points over the course of disease, and classification performance, i.e.
sensitivity and specificity, for distinguishing high-risk versus low-risk
individuals may vary over time as an individual's disease status and prognostic
information change. In this tutorial, we detail contemporary statistical
methods that can characterize the time-varying accuracy of prognostic survival
models when used for dynamic decision-making. Although statistical methods for
evaluating prognostic models with simple binary outcomes are well established,
methods appropriate for survival outcomes are less well known and require
time-dependent extensions of sensitivity and specificity to fully characterize
longitudinal biomarkers or models. The methods we review are particularly
important in that they allow for appropriate handling of censored outcomes
commonly encountered with event-time data. We highlight the importance of
determining whether clinical interest is in predicting cumulative (or
prevalent) cases over a fixed future time interval versus predicting incident
cases over a range of follow-up time, and whether patient information is static
or updated over time. We discuss implementation of time-dependent ROC
approaches using relevant R statistical software packages. The statistical
summaries are illustrated using a liver prognostic model to guide
transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis.

estimates in previous FIR catalogs. We identify robust near-infrared (NIR)
counterparts for all 11 sources with K$_s$ detection, the majority of which are
quite red, with eight having $F814W-K_s\gtrsim 4$ and five having
$F160W-[4.5]\gtrsim3$. From the FIR point of view, all our objects have
$z_{phot}$$\sim$1--3, whereas based on the optical SED one object prefers a
high-$z$ solution ($z\geq\ $7). Five objects among our sample have
spectroscopic redshifts from the GLASS survey for which we can reproduce their
SEDs with existing templates. This verification confirms the validity of our
photometric redshift methodology. The mean redshift of our sample is
$z_{phot}$=1.99$\pm$0.27. All 1.1mm selected objects are massive
(10.0$<\log[M_{\star}(M_{\odot})]<$ 11.5), with high star formation rates
($<\log[SFR(M_{\odot}/yr)]> \approx$1.6) and high dust contents (8.1
$<\log[M_{dust} (M_{\odot})]<$8.8), consistent with previous ALMA surveys.

noiseless setting and support recovery in the noisy case when some prior
information on the support of the signals is available. This prior support
consists of two parts. One part is a subset of the true support and another
part is outside of the true support. For $k$-sparse signals $\mathbf{x}$ with
the prior support which is composed of $g$ true indices and $b$ wrong indices,
we show that if the restricted isometry constant (RIC) $\delta_{k+b+1}$ of the

exact recovery of the remainder support (the part of the true support outside

$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{Ax}+\mathbf{v}$ under appropriate conditions. For the

conductance can vary by several orders of magnitude when strain is applied,
which is consistent with the current literature. Further, we demonstrate the
tuning of the sensor by an external gate which allows shifting the signal

with an orbital period ratio locked at a rational value (2/1, 3/2, etc.). Such
chains naturally form as a result of convergent migration of the planets in the
proto-planetary disk. In this article, I present an analytical model of
resonant chains of any number of planets. Using this model, I show that a
system captured in a resonant chain can librate around several possible
equilibrium configurations. The probability of capture around each equilibrium
depends on how the chain formed, and especially on the order in which the
planets have been captured in the chain. Therefore, for an observed resonant
chain, knowing around which equilibrium the chain is librating allows for
constraints to be put on the formation and migration scenario of the system. I
apply this reasoning to the four planets orbiting Kepler-223 in a 3:4:6:8
resonant chain. I show that the system is observed around one of the six
equilibria predicted by the analytical model. Using N-body integrations, I show
that the most favorable scenario to reproduce the observed configuration is to
first capture the two intermediate planets, then the outermost, and finally the
innermost.

partial prior support information is available, a sufficient condition based on
the high order block RIP is derived to guarantee stable and robust recovery of
block sparse signals via the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$ minimization. We then
show if the accuracy of arbitrary prior block support estimate is at least
$50\%$, the sufficient recovery condition by the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$
minimization is weaker than that by the $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$ minimization, and the
weighted $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$ minimization provides better upper bounds on the
recovery error in terms of the measurement noise and the compressibility of the
signal. Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$
minimization approach in the recovery performance of block sparse signals under
uniform and non-uniform prior information by extensive numerical experiments.
The significance of the results lies in the facts that making explicit use of
block sparsity and partial support information of block sparse signals can
achieve better recovery performance than handling the signals as being in the
conventional sense, thereby ignoring the additional structure and prior support
information in the problem.

boundary conditions are imposed. The configuration of the graph is
characterized by two lengths, $L_1$ and $L_2$, and we are interested in the
existence and properties of standing waves of given frequency $\omega$. For
every $\omega>0$ only solutions supported on the circle exist (cnoidal
solutions), and only for a rational value of $L_1/L_2$; they can be extended to
every $\omega\in \mathbb{R}$. We study, for $\omega<0$, the solutions periodic
on the circle but with nontrivial components on the half-lines. The problem
turns out to be equivalent to a nonlinear boundary value problem in which the
boundary condition depends on the spectral parameter $\omega$. After
classifying the solutions with rational $L_1/L_2$, we turn to $L_1/L_2$
irrational showing that there exist standing waves only in correspondence to a
countable set of frequencies $\omega_n$. Moreover we show that the frequency
sequence $\{\omega_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ has a cluster point at $-\infty$ and it
admits at least a finite limit point, in general non-zero. Finally, any

  Continuous Experimentation (CE) is an already increasingly adopted practice
in software-intensive web-based software systems to steadily improve them over
time. CE allows organizations to steer the development efforts by basing
decisions on data collected about the system in its field of application.
Despite the advantages of Continuous Experimentation, this practice is only
rarely adopted in cyber-physical systems and in the automotive domain. Reasons
for this include the strict safety constraints and the computational

local interstellar medium (LISM). The shape and position of the heliospheric
boundary, the heliopause, in space depend on the parameters of interacting
plasma flows. The interplay between the asymmetrizing effect of the
interstellar magnetic field and charge exchange between ions and neutral atoms
plays an important role in the SW-LISM interaction. By performing
three-dimensional, MHD plasma / kinetic neutral atom simulations, we determine
the width of the outer heliosheath - the LISM plasma region affected by the
presence of the heliosphere - and analyze quantitatively the distributions in
front of the heliopause. It is shown that charge exchange modifies the LISM
plasma to such extent that the contribution of a shock transition to the total
variation of plasma parameters becomes small even if the LISM velocity exceeds
the fast magnetosonic speed in the unperturbed medium. By performing adaptive
mesh refinement simulations, we show that a distinct boundary layer of
decreased plasma density and enhanced magnetic field should be observed on the
interstellar side of the heliopause. We show that this behavior is in agreement
with the plasma oscillations of increasing frequency observed by the plasma
wave instrument onboard Voyager 1. We also demonstrate that Voyager
observations in the inner heliosheath between the heliospheric termination
shock and the heliopause are consistent with dissipation of the heliospheric
magnetic field. The choice of LISM parameters in this analysis is based on the
simulations that fit observations of energetic neutral atoms performed by IBEX.

of these quantities arise at the rational submultiples of the said period. At
these local minima the evolving state coincides with the transient Yurke-Stoler
type of photon-added squeezed kitten states, which, for the choice of the phase
space variables reflecting their macroscopic nature, show extremely short-lived
behavior. Proceeding further we provide the closed form tomograms, which
furnish the alternate description of these short-lived states. The increasing

multiple times from a fluorescent dye. By confining the light and dye in a
microcavity, a minimum energy is set and the photons can then show
Bose-Einstein condensation. We present here the physical principles underlying
photon thermalization and condensation, and review the literature on the
subject. We then explore the `small' regime where very few photons are needed
for condensation. We compare thermal equilibrium results to a rate-equation
model of microlasers, which includes spontaneous emission into the cavity, and
we note that small systems result in ambiguity in the definition of threshold.

  Agents in Micro Grids",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In electrical distribution grids, the constantly increasing number of power
generation devices based on renewables demands a transition from a centralized
to a distributed generation paradigm. In fact, power injection from Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) can be selectively controlled to achieve other
objectives beyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power
losses along the distribution lines and the subsequent increase of the grid
hosting capacity. However, these technical achievements are only possible if
alongside electrical optimization schemes, a suitable market model is set up to
promote cooperation from the end users. In contrast with the existing
literature, where energy trading and electrical optimization of the grid are
often treated separately or the trading strategy is tailored to a specific
electrical optimization objective, in this work we consider their joint
optimization. Specifically, we present a multi-objective optimization problem
accounting for energy trading, where: 1) DERs try to maximize their profit,
resulting from selling their surplus energy, 2) the loads try to minimize their
expense, and 3) the main power supplier aims at maximizing the electrical grid
efficiency through a suitable discount policy. This optimization problem is
proved to be non convex, and an equivalent convex formulation is derived.
Centralized solutions are discussed first, and are subsequently distributed.
Numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the so obtained optimal
policies are then presented.

reproduce not only the precise form of the near boundary divergent behavior of

photoeffect the charge of such value could be easily accumulated on a solitary
dust particle, but if a dust particle has not yet taken off, the average value

arise due to fluctuations in the fluxes of the photoelectrons taking off and

calculate the damping rate for axisymmetric MHD waves in weakly twisted
magnetic flux tubes. Our aim is to investigate the impact of resonant damping
of these modes for solar atmospheric conditions. This analytical study is based
on an idealized configuration of a straight magnetic flux tube with a weak
magnetic twist inside as well as outside the tube. By implementing the
conservation laws derived by \cite{Sakurai:1991aa} and the analytic solutions
for weakly twisted flux tubes obtained recently by \cite{Giagkiozis:2015apj},
we derive a dispersion relation for resonantly damped axisymmetric modes in the
spectrum of the Alfv\'{e}n continuum. We also obtain an insightful analytical
expression for the damping rate in the long wavelength limit. Furthermore, it
shown that both the longitudinal magnetic field and the density, which are
allowed to vary continuously in the inhomogeneous layer, have a significant
impact on the damping time. Given the conditions in the solar atmosphere,
resonantly damped axisymmetric modes are highly likely to be ubiquitous and
play an important role in energy dissipation.
  We also suggest that given the character of these waves, it is likely that
they have already been observed in the guise of Alfv\'{e}n waves.

spacetimes, possessing a (conformal) light-like boundary. The first two
sections focus on explaining a few introductory aspects of this topic and on
providing the relevant geometric background material. The notions of
asymptotically flat spacetimes and of expanding universes with a cosmological
horizon are analysed in detail, devoting special attention to the
characterization of asymptotic symmetries. In the central part of the book, the
quantization of a real scalar field theory on such class of backgrounds is
discussed within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory. Subsequently
it is explained how it is possible to encode the information of the observables
of the theory in a second, ancillary counterpart, which is built directly on
the conformal (null) boundary. This procedure, dubbed bulk-to-boundary
correspondence, has the net advantage of allowing the identification of a
distinguished state for the theory on the boundary, which admits a counterpart
in the bulk spacetime which is automatically of Hadamard form. In the last part
of the book, some applications of these states are discussed, in particular the
construction of the algebra of Wick polynomials. This book is aimed mainly, but
not exclusively, at a readership with interest in the mathematical formulation
of quantum field theory on curved backgrounds.

we place these measures on a level playing field, to explore the qualitative
similarities and differences between them, and their shortcomings.
Specifically, using the Boltzmann machine architecture (a fully connected
recurrent neural network) with uniformly distributed weights as our model of
study, we numerically measure how complexity changes as a function of network
dynamics and network parameters. We apply an extension of one such
information-theoretic measure of complexity to understand incremental Hebbian
learning in Hopfield networks, a fully recurrent architecture model of
autoassociative memory. In the course of Hebbian learning, the total
information flow reflects a natural upward trend in complexity as the network
attempts to learn more and more patterns.

uniformly and alternately charged oscillators in dimension $1$. We prove that
the thermal conductivity diverges in dimension $1$ and $2$ while it remains
finite in dimension $3$. The Green--Kubo integral calculated with the
microcanonical ensemble diverges as $t^{1/4}$ for uniformly charged oscillators

field. This is the first rigorous example of the new exponent $1/4$ in the
asymptotic behavior for the Green-Kubo integral.

Sun's atmosphere. The main aim of this work is to advance the study of
axisymmetric modes of magnetic flux tubes by modeling both twisted internal and
external magnetic field, when the magnetic twist is weak. In this work, we
solve the derived wave equations numerically assuming twist outside the tube is
inversely proportional to the distance from its boundary. We also study the
case of constant magnetic twist outside the tube and solve these equations
analytically. We show that the solution for a constant twist outside the tube
is a good approximation to the case where the magnetic twist is proportional to
$1/r$, namely the error is in all cases less than $5.4\%$.The solution is in
excellent agreement with solutions to simpler models of twisted magnetic flux
tubes, i.e. without external magnetic twist. It is shown that axisymmetric
Alfv\'{e}n waves are naturally coupled with magnetic twist as the azimuthal
component of the velocity perturbation is nonzero. We compared our theoretical
results with observations and comment on what the Doppler signature of these
modes is expected to be. Lastly, we argue that the character of axisymmetric
waves in twisted magnetic flux tubes can lead to false positives in identifying
observations with axisymmetric Alfv\'{e}n waves.

Such qubit state correlators are defined for an ensemble of qubit trajectories,

because $S_{tot}/N$ shall contain the mixing entropy per particle $k_B s_m$ and
$S_v/N$ shall not, the configurational entropy per particle $S_c/N$ shall
diverge in the thermodynamic limit for continuous polydispersity due to the
diverging $s_m$. They also provided a resolution for this paradox and related
problems-it relies on a careful redefining of $S_c$ and $S_v$. Here, we note
that the relation $S_{tot}=S_c+S_v$ is essentially a geometric relation in the
phase space and shall hold without redefining $S_c$ and $S_v$. We also note
that the total entropy per particle $S_{tot}/N$ diverges with $N \to \infty$
with continuous polydispersity as well. The usual way to avoid this and other
difficulties with $S_{tot}/N$ is to work with the excess entropy $\Delta
S_{tot}$ (relative to the ideal gas of the same polydispersity). Speedy [Mol.
Phys., 1998, 95, 169] applied this approach to the relation above and wrote
this relation as $\Delta S_{tot}=S_c+\Delta S_v$. This form has flows as well,
because $S_v/N$ does not contain the $k_B s_m$ term and the latter is
introduced into $\Delta S_v/N$ instead. Here, we suggest that this relation
shall actually be written as $\Delta S_{tot}=\Delta_c S_c+\Delta_v S_v$, where
$\Delta=\Delta_c+\Delta_v$ while $\Delta_c S_c=S_c-k_B N s_m$ and $\Delta_v
S_v=S_v-k_B N[1+\ln(V/\Lambda^d N)+U/N k_B T]$ with $\Lambda$ standing for the
de Broglie wavelength. In this form, all the terms per particle are always
finite for $N \to \infty$ and continuous when introducing a small
polydispersity to a monodisperse system. We also suggest that the Adam-Gibbs
and related relations shall in fact contain $\Delta_c S_c/N$ instead of
$S_c/N$.

abundances for members of the Lupus T association, we analyzed three chemical
elements: lithium, iron, and barium. The aims were: to derive the Li abundance
for ~90% of known class II stars in the Lupus I, II, III, IV clouds; to perform
chemical tagging of a region where few Fe abundance measurements have been
obtained in the past, and no determination of the Ba content has been done up
to now. We also investigated possible Ba enhancement, as this element has
become increasingly interesting in the last years following the evidence of Ba
over-abundance in young clusters, the origin of which is still unknown. Using
X-shooter@VLT, we analyzed the spectra of 89 cluster members, both class II and
III stars. We measured the strength of the Li line and derived the abundance of
this element through equivalent width measurements and curves of growth. For
six class II stars we also measured the Fe and Ba abundances using the spectral
synthesis and the code MOOG. The veiling contribution was taken into account
for all three elements. We find a dispersion in the strength of the Li line at
low Teff and identify three targets with severe Li depletion. The nuclear age
inferred for these highly Li-depleted stars is around 15 Myr, which exceeds the
isochronal one. As in other star-forming regions, no metal-rich members are
found in Lupus, giving support to a recent hypothesis that the Fe abundance
distribution of most of the nearby young regions could be the result of a
common and widespread star formation episode involving the Galactic thin disk.
We find that Ba is over-abundant by ~0.7 dex with respect to the Sun. Since

that capture the essential physics and chemistry in Li-ion battery electrode
materials. In this paper a novel electrochemical phase-field model is presented
that captures the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithium-insertion in
TiO$_2$-anatase, a well-known and intensively studied Li-ion battery electrode
material. Previous experimental work on lithiated anatase TiO$_2$ provided all
parameters necessary for the phase-field simulations, giving the opportunity to
gain fundamental insight in the lithiation of anatase and validate this
phase-field model. The phase-field model captures the essential experimentally
observed phenomena, rationalising the impact of C-rate, particle size, surface
area, and the memory effect on the performance of anatase as a Li-ion battery
electrode. Thereby a comprehensive physical picture of the lithiation of
anatase TiO$_2$ is provided. The results of the simulations demonstrate that
the performance of anatase is limited by the formation of the poor Li-ion
diffusion in the Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of the particles. Unlike
other electrode materials, the kinetic limitations of individual anatase
particles limit the performance of full electrodes. Hence, rather than
improving the ionic and electronic network in electrodes, improving the
performance of anatase TiO$_2$ electrodes requires preventing the formation of
a blocking Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of particles. Additionally, the
qualitative agreement of the phase-field model, containing only parameters from
literature, with a broad spectrum of experiments demonstrates the capabilities
of phase-field models for understanding Li-ion electrode materials, and its
promise for guiding the design of electrodes through a thorough understanding
of material properties and their interactions.

course where the neutron-rich light and medium mass nuclei play a crucial role.
The neutron capture rates for these exotic nuclei could dominate over their
$\alpha$-capture rates, thereby enhancing their abundances at or near the drip
line. We calculate the radiative neutron capture cross-section for the
$^{33}$Na(n,$\gamma)^{34}$Na reaction via the Coulomb dissociation of $^{34}$Na
as it undergoes elastic breakup on $^{208}$Pb when directed at a beam energy of
100 MeV/u using the entirely quantum mechanical theory of finite range
distorted wave Born approximation upgraded to incorporate deformation effects.
The non-resonant one neutron radiative capture cross-section for
$^{33}$Na(n,$\gamma)^{34}$Na is calculated and is found to increase with
increasing deformation of $^{34}$Na. An analytic scrutiny of the capture
cross-section with neutron separation energy as a parameter is also done at
different energy ranges. The calculated reaction rate is compared with the rate
of the $^{33}$Na($\alpha$,n)$^{36}$Al reaction (deduced from the
Hauser-Feshbach theory), and is found to be significantly higher below a
temperature of $T_9 = 2$. Further, at the equilibrium temperature of $T_9 =
0.62$, the rate for the neutron capture had a small but non-negligible
dependence on the structural parameters of $^{34}$Na. In addition, this neutron
capture rate exceeded that of the $\alpha$-capture reaction by orders of
magnitude, indicating that the $\alpha$-process should not break the
(n,$\gamma$) \textit{r-}process path at the $^{33}$Na isotope, thus,
effectively pushing the abundance of sodium isotopes towards the neutron drip
line.

three regimes -- no delay, small delay and arbitrary delay. In the absence of
reaction delays, we show that the MOVM is locally stable. For small delays, we
then derive a sufficient condition for the MOVM to be locally stable. Next, for
an arbitrary delay, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the
local stability of the MOVM. We show that the traffic flow transits from the
locally stable to the locally unstable regime via a Hopf bifurcation. We also
derive the necessary and sufficient condition for non-oscillatory convergence
and characterize the rate of convergence of the MOVM. These conditions help
ensure smooth traffic flow, good ride quality and quick equilibration to the
uniform flow. Further, since a Hopf bifurcation results in the emergence of
limit cycles, we provide an analytical framework to characterize the type of

with the SM flavor structure demands additional sterile neutrinos as well as no

from local distance indicators and from cosmic microwave background is one of
the most highly debated issues in cosmology, as it possibly indicates new
physics or unknown systematics. In this work, we explore whether this tension
can be alleviated by the sample variance in the local measurements, which use a
small fraction of the Hubble volume. We use a large-volume cosmological
$N$-body simulation to model the local measurements and to quantify the
variance due to local density fluctuations and sample selection. We explicitly
take into account the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of type Ia supernovae.
Despite the faithful modelling of the observations, our results confirm
previous findings that sample variance in the local Hubble constant $(H_0^{\rm
loc})$ measurements is small; we find $\sigma(H_0^{\rm loc})=0.31\,{\rm km\
s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, a nearly negligible fraction of the $\sim6\,{\rm km\
s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ necessary to explain the difference between the local and the
global $H_0$ measurements. While the $H_0$ tension could in principle be
explained by our local neighbourhood being a underdense region of radius $\sim
150 \,\rm Mpc$ , the extreme required underdensity of such a void
$(\delta\simeq -0.8)$ makes it very unlikely in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, and it
also violates existing observational constraints. Therefore, sample variance in
a $\Lambda$CDM universe cannot appreciably alleviate the tension in $H_0$

red giants within about 800 pc of the Sun. The systematic variations of the
mode of their absolute magnitude as a function of the distance, magnitude, and
other parameters have been analyzed. We show that these variations reach 0.7
mag and cannot be explained by variations in the interstellar extinction or
intrinsic properties of stars and by selection. The only explanation seems to
be a systematic error of the Gaia DR1 TGAS parallax dependent on the square of
the observed distance in kpc: $0.18R^2$ mas. Allowance for this error reduces
significantly the systematic dependences of the absolute magnitude mode on all
parameters. This error reaches 0.1 mas within 800 pc of the Sun and allows an
upper limit for the accuracy of the TGAS parallaxes to be estimated as 0.2 mas.
A careful allowance for such errors is needed to use clump red giants as
""standard candles"". This eliminates all discrepancies between the theoretical
and empirical estimates of the characteristics of these stars and allows us to
obtain the first estimates of the modes of their absolute magnitudes from the

of circumstellar disks provide new insights into their magnetic field. However,
direct constraints are limited to the plane of sky component of the magnetic
field. Observations of Zeeman split spectral lines are a potential approach to
enhance these insights by providing complementary information.
  Aims. We investigate which constraints for magnetic fields in circumstellar
disks can be obtained from Zeeman observations of the $113~\mathrm{GHz}$ CN
lines. Furthermore, we analyze the requirements to perform these observations
and their dependence on selected quantities.
  Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting with the radiative transfer (RT)
code POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016) extended by our Zeeman splitting RT extension
ZRAD (Brauer et al. 2017), which is based on the line RT code Mol3D (Ober et
al. 2015).
  Results. We find that Zeeman observations of the $113~\mathrm{GHz}$ CN lines
provide significant insights into the magnetic field of circumstellar disks.
However, with the capabilities of recent and upcoming instrument/observatories,
even spatially unresolved observations would be challenging. Nevertheless,
these observations are feasible for the most massive disks with a strong
magnetic field and high abundance of CN/H. The most restrictive quantity is the
magnetic field strength, which should be at least in the order of
$\sim1~\mathrm{mG}$. In addition, the inclination of the disk should be around

has been demonstrated across language and data scenarios. New research
regularly introduces architectural and algorithmic improvements that lead to
significant gains over ""vanilla"" NMT implementations. However, these new
techniques are rarely evaluated in the context of previously published
techniques, specifically those that are widely used in state-of-theart
production and shared-task systems. As a result, it is often difficult to
determine whether improvements from research will carry over to systems
deployed for real-world use. In this work, we recommend three specific methods
that are relatively easy to implement and result in much stronger experimental
systems. Beyond reporting significantly higher BLEU scores, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of where improvements originate and what inherent weaknesses
of basic NMT models are being addressed. We then compare the relative gains
afforded by several other techniques proposed in the literature when starting
with vanilla systems versus our stronger baselines, showing that experimental
conclusions may change depending on the baseline chosen. This indicates that
choosing a strong baseline is crucial for reporting reliable experimental
results.

Using type Ia Supernovae% (SNe) , Cepheids and the cosmological parameters from

different directions of the sky. We compare these profiles to other density
maps obtained from luminosity density, in particular Keenan et al. 2013 and the
\TMPP galaxy catalogue. The method independently confirms the existence of
inhomogeneities, could be particularly useful to correctly normalize density
maps from galaxy surveys with respect to the average density of the Universe,
and could clarify the apparent discrepancy between local and large scale
estimations of the Hubble constant. When better observational supernovae data
will be available, the accuracy of the reconstructed density profiles will
improve and will allow to further investigate the existence of structures whose

particularly in regards to neuronal dynamics, where criticality has been argued
to be a fundamental property. Refractory behavior, which limits the
excitability of neurons is thought to be an important dynamical property. We
therefore consider a simple model of excitable nodes which is known to exhibit
a transition to instability at a critical point ($\lambda=1$), and introduce
refractory period into its dynamics. We use mean-field analytical calculations
as well as numerical simulations to calculate the activity dependent branching
ratio that is useful to characterize the behavior of critical systems. We also
define avalanches and calculate probability distribution of their size and
duration. We find that in the presence of refractory period the dynamics
stabilizes while various parameter regimes become accessible. A sub-critical
regime with $\lambda<1.0$, a standard critical behavior with exponents close to
critical branching process for $\lambda=1$, a regime with $1<\lambda<2$ that
exhibits an interesting scaling behavior, and an oscillating regime with
$\lambda>2.0$. We have therefore shown that refractory behavior leads to a wide
range of scaling as well as periodic behavior which are relevant to real
neuronal dynamics.

how the information (entropy) of a set of random variables can change when

theory; entropy power inequalities are special instances of them. The arguably
most elementary kind of information combining is the addition of two binary
random variables (a CNOT gate), and the resulting quantities play an important
role in Belief propagation and Polar coding. We investigate this problem in the
setting where quantum side information is available, which has been recognized
as a hard setting for entropy power inequalities.
  Our main technical result is a non-trivial, and close to optimal, lower bound
on the combined entropy, which can be seen as an almost optimal ""quantum Mrs.
Gerber's Lemma"". Our proof uses three main ingredients: (1) a new bound on the
concavity of von Neumann entropy, which is tight in the regime of low pairwise
state fidelities; (2) the quantitative improvement of strong subadditivity due
to Fawzi-Renner, in which we manage to handle the minimization over recovery
maps; (3) recent duality results on classical-quantum-channels due to Renes et
al. We furthermore present conjectures on the optimal lower and upper bounds
under quantum side information, supported by interesting analytical
observations and strong numerical evidence.
  We finally apply our bounds to Polar coding for binary-input
classical-quantum channels, and show the following three results: (A) Even
non-stationary channels polarize under the polar transform. (B) The blocklength
required to approach the symmetric capacity scales at most sub-exponentially in
the gap to capacity. (C) Under the aforementioned lower bound conjecture, a
blocklength polynomial in the gap suffices.

identifying the unknown speaker using both his/her gender and emotion cues.
Both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models
(SPHMMs) have been used as classifiers in this work. This approach has been
tested on our collected emotional speech database which is composed of six
emotions. The results of this work show that speaker identification performance

gender cues only, emotion cues only, and neither gender nor emotion cues by
7.22%, 4.45%, and 19.56%, respectively. This work also shows that the optimum
speaker identification performance takes place when the classifiers are
completely biased towards suprasegmental models and no impact of acoustic
models in the emotional talking environments. The achieved average speaker
identification performance based on the new proposed approach falls within
2.35% of that obtained in subjective evaluation by human judges.

service is commonly interpreted as a spreading phenomenon throughout the fabric
of society. This process is arguably driven by social influence, social
learning and by external effects like media. Observations of such processes
date back to the seminal studies by Rogers and Bass, and their mathematical
modelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple contagion,
identifies adoption spreading with an epidemic process. The other one, named
complex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds and successfully
explains the emergence of large cascades of adoption resulting in a rapid
spreading often seen in empirical data. The observation of real world adoption
processes has become easier lately due to the availability of large digital
social network and behavioural datasets. This has allowed simultaneous study of
network structures and dynamics of online service adoption, shedding light on
the mechanisms and external effects that influence the temporal evolution of
behavioural or innovation adoption. These advancements have induced the
development of more realistic models of social spreading phenomena, which in
turn have provided remarkably good predictions of various empirical adoption
processes. In this chapter we review recent data-driven studies addressing
real-world service adoption processes. Our studies provide the first detailed
empirical evidence of a heterogeneous threshold distribution in adoption. We
also describe the modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and
data-driven simulations. Our objective is to understand the effects of
identified social mechanisms on service adoption spreading, and to provide
potential new directions and open questions for future research.

speed are crucial factors limiting the possible range of applications for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, we report a novel calibrationless
parallel imaging technique which simultaneously estimates coil profiles and
image content in a relaxed forward model. Our method is robust against a wide
class of data inconsistencies, minimizes imaging artifacts and is comparably
fast combining important advantages of many conceptually different
state-of-the-art parallel imaging approaches. Depending on the experimental
setting, data can be undersampled well below the Nyquist limit. Here, even high
acceleration factors yield excellent imaging results while being robust to
noise and the occurrence of phase singularities in the image domain, as we show
on different data. Moreover, our method successfully reconstructs acquisitions
with insufficient field-of-view. We further compare our approach to ESPIRiT and
SAKE using spin-echo and gradient echo MRI data from the human head and knee.
In addition, we show its applicability to non-Cartesian imaging on radial FLASH
cardiac MRI data. Using theoretical considerations, we show that ENLIVE can be
related to a low-rank formulation of blind multi-channel deconvolution,
explaining why it inherently promotes low-rank solutions.

continuously connected without a phase transition in between remains a
challenging question. We tackle this challenge by constructing an effective
Hamiltonian, describing anyon interaction, that realizes such a continuous
deformation. At any point along the deformation, the model remains a fixed
point model describing a gapped topological order with gapped boundaries. That
the deformation retains the gap is due to the anomaly cancelation between the
boundary and bulk. Such anomaly inflow is quantitatively studied using our

less gas is unbound. Even at the highest resolution, the final separation
attained by simulations with a heavier primary is similar to the size of the

transport through graphene areas which are not covered by contacts. We find
that the extracted spin lifetime might be overestimated in flakes which are
shorter than the spin diffusion length. Moreover, contact-induced spin

Galaxy as well as in dwarf galaxies later accreted onto the Milky Way. However,
to date, there is no unambiguous signature to distinguish accreted GCs. Using
specifically designed $N$-body simulations of GCs evolving in a variety of
time-dependent tidal fields (describing the potential of a dwarf galaxy-Milky
Way merger), we analyze the effects imprinted to the internal kinematics of an
accreted GC. In particular, we look at the evolution of the velocity
anisotropy. Our simulations show that at early phases, the velocity anisotropy
is determined by the tidal field of the dwarf galaxy and subsequently the
clusters will adapt to the new tidal environment, losing any signature of their
original environment in a few relaxation times. At 10 Gyr, GCs exhibit a
variety of velocity anisotropy profiles, namely, isotropic velocity
distribution in the inner regions and either isotropy or radial/tangential
anisotropy in the intermediate and outer regions. Independently of an accreted
origin, the velocity anisotropy primarily depends on the strength of the tidal
field cumulatively experienced by a cluster. Tangentially anisotropic clusters
correspond to systems that have experienced stronger tidal fields and are
characterized by higher tidal filling factor, $r_{50}/r_j\gtrsim0.17$, higher
mass loss $\gtrsim60\%$ and relaxation times $t_{rel}\lesssim10^9$ Gyr.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that the presence of tidal tails can
significantly contaminate the measurements of velocity anisotropy when a
cluster is observed in projection. Our characterization of the velocity
anisotropy profiles in different tidal environments provides a theoretical
benchmark for the interpretation of the unprecedented amount of
three-dimensional kinematic data progressively available for Galactic GCs.

potential was fixed at a mean scalar field giving a 175 GeV Top quark mass.
However, a high value of the strong coupling was required (\alpha=g^2/(4 \pi)
close to 1) to get these values. After reviewing the results of this study, an
idea for extending the work is simply advanced here: to consider the running
strong coupling, in order to decide whether or not, the usual values of the
strong interactions have the chance of justifying the experimentally known
values of the Higgs and Top quark masses. It is underlined that a positive
result of the proposed task will suggests the possibility of basing the SM
breaking of symmetry, on the so called ""second minimum"" of this model. This
could also identify the essential role of QCD in this effect. Results of the

with silicon nanocrystals on a quartz substrate. We analyze the extinction and
photoluminesce spectra of silicon nanocrystals and show that the emitted light
is coupled to the corresponding plasmonic mode. We also demonstrate the
modification of the extinction and photoluminesce spectra under the transition
from surface plasmon-polaritons to waveguide plasmon-polaritons with the
decrease of the gold filling ratio from 1 to 0.35. Finally, we analyze the
contribution of individual silicon nanocrystals to the overall
photoluminescence intensity. We conclude that silicon nanocrystals ensemble can
be broken down into optically bright and optically dark nanocrystals. The
experimental extinction and photoluminescence spectra are in good agreement
with theoretical calculations performed by the Fourier modal method in the
scattering matrix form.

In this study, we resolve spatially and spectrally the absorption and emission
features of a squaraine aggregate by means of confocal microscopy and
absorption/photoluminescence spectroscopy. We observe that the aggregate
affords both a broad absorption spectrum (centred at 670 nm), likely originated
by a dyes configuration with allowed J- and H- arrangements, and a strong and
relatively narrow emission in the near-infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum
(centred at 780 nm), with a remarkable Stokes shift of 110 nm that is among the
largest exhibited by squaraine dyes. These peculiarities would be beneficial
for extending the spectral sensitivity of bot photovoltaic and light-emitting
diodes, and extremely appealing for possible applications of these aggregates
as NIR fluorescent probes in biomedical applications.

emission from a microbunched beam with microbunching wavefront tilt with
respect to the direction of motion. The theory refers to the work [1], which
predicts, in this case, exponential suppression of coherent radiation along the
kicked direction. The observations refer to a recent experiment performed at
the LCLS [2,3], where a microbunched beam was kicked by a bend and sent to a
radiator undulator. The experiment resulted in the emission of strong coherent
radiation that had its maximum along the kicked direction of motion, when the
undulator parameter was detuned to a value larger than the nominal one. We
first analyze the theory in detail, and we confirm the correctness of its
derivation according to the conventional theory of radiation emission from
charged particles. Subsequently, we look for possible peculiarities in the
experiment, which may not be modeled by the theory. We show that only spurious
effects are not accounted for. We conclude that the experiment defies
explanation in terms of the conventional theory of radiation emission.

strained 3D Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te topological insulator (TI) with strong interface
inversion asymmetry and the asymmetric Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te double quantum wells
(DQW). The numerical analysis of the dispersion relation for 3D TI
Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te for the proper Cd ($x$)-content of in the
Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te-compound clearly show that the inversion symmetry breaking
together with the unaxial tensile strain causes splitting each of Dirac nodes
(two belonging to two interfaces) into two in the proximity of $\Gamma$-point.
The similar effects can be obtained for asymmetric Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te DQW with
the proper content of Cd and proper width of the quantum wells. The aim of this
work is to explore the inversion symmetry breaking in 3D TI and 2D DQWs mixed
HgCdTe-systems. It is shown that this symmetry breaking leads to the dependence
of carriers energy vs quasi-momentum similar to that of Weyl fermions.

  Information Fusion","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1706.07536",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is challenging to recognize facial action unit (AU) from spontaneous
facial displays, especially when they are accompanied by speech. The major
reason is that the information is extracted from a single source, i.e., the
visual channel, in the current practice. However, facial activity is highly
correlated with voice in natural human communications.
  Instead of solely improving visual observations, this paper presents a novel
audiovisual fusion framework, which makes the best use of visual and acoustic
cues in recognizing speech-related facial AUs. In particular, a dynamic
Bayesian network (DBN) is employed to explicitly model the semantic and dynamic
physiological relationships between AUs and phonemes as well as measurement
uncertainty. A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been collected to
evaluate the proposed framework, which consists of a ""clean"" subset containing
frontal faces under well controlled circumstances and a challenging subset with
large head movements and occlusions. Experiments on this database have
demonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant improvement in
recognizing speech-related AUs compared to the state-of-the-art visual-based
methods especially for those AUs whose visual observations are impaired during
speech, and more importantly also outperforms feature-level fusion methods by
explicitly modeling and exploiting physiological relationships between AUs and
phonemes.

experimental observations of this phenomenon in multiple physical systems. The
elementary case of 2 mode parametric resonance of order 1 involves the
excitation of a spectral tone of a parametrically driven mode at a sub-harmonic
frequency of the higher directly driven mode. Historically, such examples of
parametric resonance have been predominantly researched in a system of micro-
and nanoelectromechanical resonators. Here, in this paper, we break this
convention by showcasing a collection of experimental signatures in support of
the concept of ""N-mode parametric resonance"" using a number of elementary
microelectromechanical devices. Specifically, we present observations of 2, 3,
(2+3) and (3+3) mode parametric resonances demonstrating co-existence of
different regimes within the same device. In addition, we also present
observations of intrinsic ""Four-Wave Mixing"" of parametric excitations. This
paper presents contributions towards the existence proof for such multimode
parametric resonances which can also be exploited for engineering benefit
within the field of ""micro and nanoelectromechanical resonators"". The
experimental results further point towards the possibility of the ultimate
observation of N-mode parametric resonance in such physical system.

exploited by past missions such as SMART-1, as well as are proposed to benefit
future missions to Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune, and disposal strategies from
Earth's High Eccentric or Libration Point Orbits. This paper revises three
totally different descriptions of the effects of the third body gravitational
perturbation. These are the averaged dynamics of the classical third body
perturbing function, the Opik's close encounter theory and the Keplerian map
approach. The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases
of a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing
extremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks
solutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at
distances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body. The paper
attempts to gain insight into the accuracy of these different perturbative
techniques into each of these scenarios, as compared with the motion in the
Circular Restricted Three Body Problem.
