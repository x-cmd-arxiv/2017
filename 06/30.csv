of super-Eddington X-ray pulsars in binary systems is pointed out. The
transition from the high to low state of these objects is explained by
accretion flow spherization due to the radiation pressure at certain (high)
accretion rates. The transition between the states can be associated with a
gradual change in the accretion rate. The complex behavior of the recently
discovered ultraluminous X-ray pulsars M 82 X-2, NGC 5907 ULX-1, and NGC 7793
P13 is explained by the proposed mechanism. The proposed model also naturally
explains the measured spinup of the neutron star in these pulsars, which is
slower than the expected one by several times.

avoidance require tuning a number of parameters and do not have the ability to
directly benefit from large datasets and continuous use. In this paper, a
dueling architecture based deep double-Q network (D3QN) is proposed for
obstacle avoidance, using only monocular RGB vision. Based on the dueling and
double-Q mechanisms, D3QN can efficiently learn how to avoid obstacles in a
simulator even with very noisy depth information predicted from RGB image.
Extensive experiments show that D3QN enables twofold acceleration on learning
compared with a normal deep Q network and the models trained solely in virtual

inherited from a well-mixed region of a giant molecular cloud polluted by a
variety of supernovae remnants and massive star winds. This paper continues to
explore the former scenario, by calculating three dimensional, adaptive mesh
refinement, hydrodynamical code (FLASH 2.5) models of the self-gravitational,
dynamical collapse of a molecular cloud core that has been struck by a thin
shock front with a speed of 40 km/sec, leading to the injection of shock front
matter into the collapsing cloud through the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor
fingers at the shock-cloud intersection. These models extend the previous work
into the nonisothermal collapse regime using a polytropic approximation to
represent compressional heating in the optically thick protostar. The models
show that the injection efficiencies of shock front material are enhanced
compared to previous models, which were not carried into the nonisothermal
regime and so did not reach such high densities. The new models, combined with
the recent estimates of initial $^{60}$Fe abundances, imply that the supernova

due to valence band degeneracy and spin-orbit coupling, acceptor states can be
far more complex than those of hydrogen atoms, which brings into question the
validity of this approximation. To address this issue, we develop an
acceptor-acceptor Heitler-London model using single-acceptor wave functions of

function of inter-acceptor distance and spin-orbit coupling strength, suggest
that acceptor-acceptor interactions can be qualitatively different from
donor-donor interactions, and should therefore be relevant to the control of
two-qubit interactions in acceptor-based qubit implementations, as well as the

bosons either surrounded or surrounding the light particle for few or many
bosons, respectively. We demonstrate that the first excited states for all
strengths resemble two-body halos of one particle weakly bound to a dense
$N$-body system for $N=3,4$. This structure ceases to exist for $N \geq 5$.

allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime
data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process
is repeated. Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to
runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same
neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.
  In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that
proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits
such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive
policing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not
occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are
quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to
which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between
areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which \emph{reported}
incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and \emph{discovered}
incidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched
as a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while
reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot
entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.

probe of cosmological parameters. The positions of galaxies in comoving
Cartesian space varies under different cosmological parameter choices, inducing
a {\it redshift-dependent scaling} in the galaxy distribution. This geometrical
distortion can be observed as a redshift-dependent rescaling in the measured
$\xi(r_{\bot})$. We test this methodology using a sample of 1.75 billion mock
galaxies at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, drawn from the Horizon Run 4 N-body

evolution when the galaxy sample is analyzed under a cosmology differing from
the true, simulated one. Other contributions, including the gravitational
growth of structure, galaxy bias, and the redshift space distortions, do not
produce large redshift evolution in the shape. We show that one can make use of
this geometrical distortion to constrain the values of cosmological parameters
governing the expansion history of the universe. This method could be
applicable to future large scale structure surveys, especially photometric
surveys such as DES, LSST, to derive tight cosmological constraints. This work

the efficient solution of problems in PSPACE and PP, respectively. Since these
are extremely powerful complexity classes, which are not expected to be
solvable in reality, this can be taken as evidence that these models for CTCs
are pathological. This problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this
models, which also allows for example cloning quantum states, in the case of
D-CTCs, or distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states, in the case of P-CTCs.
In contrast, the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal
structures in a linear way, getting rid of these effects, and raising the
possibility that its computational power is rather tame. In this paper we show
that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of P-CTCs, and
therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of PP. We show,
furthermore, a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities but
nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with only a
constant overhead, showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily hard to
simulate.

spaces, methods providing data-driven context have become indispensable.
Off-screen visualization techniques, therefore, have been extensively
researched for their ability to overcome the inherent trade-off between
overview and detail. The general idea is to project off-screen located objects
back to the available screen real estate. Detached visual cues, such as halos
or arrows, encode information on position and distance, but fall short showing
the topology of off-screen objects. For that reason, state of the art
techniques integrate visual cues into a dedicated border region. As yet, the
dimensions of the navigated space are not reflected properly, which is why we
propose to adapt the intrusion of the border pursuant to the position in space.
Moreover, off-screen objects are projected to the border region using one out
of two projection methods: Radial or Orthographic. We describe a controlled
experiment to investigate the effect of the adaptive border intrusion to the
topology as well as the users' intuition regarding the projection strategy. The
results of our experiment suggest to use the orthographic projection strategy
for unconnected point data in an adaptive border design. We further discuss the
results including the given informal feedback of participants.

main purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a
set of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of
""rational trust modeling"" is introduced by bridging trust management and game
theory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory
(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been
utilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty
of our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust
model assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are
rational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy
based on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are
incentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of
trust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and
solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be
built-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of
rational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will
result in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model
can incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper
parameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish
players in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).
Furthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known
attacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict
behavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.

  Let $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be a domain in $\R^d$. When $\beta$ is large,

that minimize the prediction error on a held out dataset. We argue that error
reduction is only one of several metrics that must be considered when
optimizing random forest parameters for commercial applications. We propose a
novel metric that captures the stability of random forests predictions, which
we argue is key for scenarios that require successive predictions. We motivate
the need for multi-criteria optimization by showing that in practical
applications, simply choosing the parameters that lead to the lowest error can
introduce unnecessary costs and produce predictions that are not stable across
independent runs. To optimize this multi-criteria trade-off, we present a new
framework that efficiently finds a principled balance between these three
considerations using Bayesian optimisation. The pitfalls of optimising forest
parameters purely for error reduction are demonstrated using two publicly
available real world datasets. We show that our framework leads to parameter
settings that are markedly different from the values discovered by error
reduction metrics.

and by recent flare observations in the mid infrared, we set out here to model
and understand the source of the infrared continuum in flares, and to explore
its diagnostic capability for the physical conditions in the flare atmosphere.
We use the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code RADYN to calculate mid-infrared
continuum emission from model atmospheres undergoing sudden deposition of
energy by non-thermal electrons. We identify and characterise the main
continuum thermal emission processes relevant to flare intensity enhancement in
the mid- to far-infrared (2-200 $\mu$m) spectral range as free-free emission on
neutrals and ions. We find that the infrared intensity evolution tracks the
energy input to within a second, albeit with a lingering intensity enhancement,
and provides a very direct indication of the evolution of the atmospheric
ionization. The prediction of highly impulsive emission means that, on these
timescales, the atmospheric hydrodynamics need not be considered in analysing
the mid-IR signatures.

Essentially, we relax the criterion of the Peskun type covariance ordering by
considering two different invariant probabilities, and obtain, in place of a
strict ordering of asymptotic variances, a bound of the asymptotic variance of
IS by that of the direct MCMC. Simple examples show that IS can have
arbitrarily better or worse asymptotic variance than Metropolis-Hastings and
delayed-acceptance (DA) MCMC. Our ordering implies that IS is guaranteed to be
competitive up to a factor depending on the supremum of the (marginal) IS
weight. We elaborate upon the criterion in case of unbiased estimators as part
of an auxiliary variable framework. We show how the criterion implies
asymptotic variance guarantees for IS in terms of pseudo-marginal (PM) and DA
corrections, essentially if the ratio of exact and approximate likelihoods is
bounded. We also show that convergence of the IS chain can be less affected by
unbounded high-variance unbiased estimators than PM and DA chains.

  iterative complex factorization algorithm","Accepted version",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) is able to jointly analyze
genome-wide genetic datasets, but the slow computation via Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) hampered its wide-spread usage. Here we present a novel iterative
method to solve a special class of linear systems, which can increase the speed
of the BVSR model-fitting tenfold. The iterative method hinges on the complex
factorization of the sum of two matrices and the solution path resides in the
complex domain (instead of the real domain). Compared to the Gauss-Seidel
method, the complex factorization converges almost instantaneously and its
error is several magnitude smaller than that of the Gauss-Seidel method. More
importantly, the error is always within the pre-specified precision while the
Gauss-Seidel method is not. For large problems with thousands of covariates,
the complex factorization is 10 -- 100 times faster than either the
Gauss-Seidel method or the direct method via the Cholesky decomposition. In
BVSR, one needs to repetitively solve large penalized regression systems whose
design matrices only change slightly between adjacent MCMC steps. This slight
change in design matrix enables the adaptation of the iterative complex
factorization method. The computational innovation will facilitate the
wide-spread use of BVSR in reanalyzing genome-wide association datasets.

in two key ways: 1) the reported color variability is assessed across optical

over timescales significantly longer than an individual flare or ground-based
observing season. We highlight 3C 279 because of its complex color variability,
which is difficult to reconcile with the simple ""redder when brighter"" behavior
often associated with Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) color variability. We
suggest that the observed OIR color changes depend on a combination of the jet

$\zeta^m_n$, representing a smooth transition from disk-dominated, to a mixed
contribution, to a jet-dominated system, which provides an explanation of the
long-term OIR color variability in the same blazar over time. This suggests a
general scheme that could apply to OIR color variability in other blazars.

10 days; $a$ $\lesssim$ 0.1 AU) cannot form directly via fragmentation of
molecular clouds or protostellar disks, yet their component masses are highly
correlated, suggesting interaction during the pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) phase.
Moreover, the close binary fraction of pre-MS stars is consistent with that of
their MS counterparts in the field ($F_{\rm close}$ = 2.1%). Thus we can infer
that some migration mechanism operates during the early pre-MS phase ($\tau$
$\lesssim$ 5 Myr) that reshapes the primordial separation distribution. We test
the feasibility of this hypothesis by carrying out a population synthesis
calculation which accounts for two formation channels: Kozai-Lidov (KL)
oscillations and dynamical instability in triple systems. Our models
incorporate (1) more realistic initial conditions compared to previous studies,
(2) octupole-level effects in the secular evolution, (3) tidal energy
dissipation via weak-friction equilibrium tides at small eccentricities and via
non-radial dynamical oscillations at large eccentricities, and (4) the larger
tidal radius of a pre-MS primary. Given a 15% triple star fraction, we simulate
a close binary fraction from KL oscillations alone of $F_{\rm close}$ $\approx$
0.4% after $\tau$ = 5 Myr, which increases to $F_{\rm close}$ $\approx$ 0.8% by
$\tau$ = 5 Gyr. Dynamical ejections and disruptions of unstable coplanar
triples in the disk produce solitary binaries with slightly longer periods $P$
$\approx$ 10 - 100 days. The remaining $\approx$60% of close binaries with
outer tertiaries, particularly those in compact coplanar configurations with

Gravitational perturbations from the massive black hole can cause high

gravitational wave emission drives the binary to merge. In this paper, we

with other dynamical mechanisms, such as the dynamical formations and mergers

seen in WISE wide-field imaging at 3.4 $\mu$m and 4.6 $\mu$m. We measure the
deviations of the isophotes from pure ellipses, and quantify the X/P structure
via the radial profile of the Fourier n=6 harmonic (cosine term $B_6$). In
addition to the vertical height and integrated `strength' of the X/P
instability, we report an intrinsic radius of $R_{\Pi;{\rm int}} = 1.67\pm0.27$
kpc, and an orientation angle of $\alpha = {37^\circ}^{+7^\circ}_{-10^\circ}$

structures observed in other galaxies, we make three assumptions: (i) the
peanut is intrinsically symmetric, (ii) the peanut is aligned with the long
Galactic bar, and (iii) their sizes are correlated. Thus the implication for
the Galactic bar is that it is oriented at the same $37^\circ$ angle and has an
expected radius of ~4.2 kpc, but possibly as low as ~3.2 kpc. We further
investigate how the Milky Way's X/P structure compares with other analogues,
and find that the Galaxy is broadly consistent with our recently established
scaling relations, though with a moderately stronger peanut instability than
expected. We additionally perform a photometric decomposition of the Milky

$z=0.192$) is a massive merging galaxy cluster that hosts a radio halo and
multiple relics. In this paper we present deep, high fidelity, low-frequency
images made with the LOw-Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 115.5 and 179 MHz.
These images, with a noise of 140 mJy/beam and a resolution of
$\theta_{\text{beam}}=7.3""\times5.3""$, are an order of magnitude more sensitive
and five times higher resolution than previous low-frequency images of this
cluster. We combined the LOFAR data with the existing GMRT (153, 323, 608 MHz)
and WSRT (1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 2.3 GHz) data to study the spectral properties of the
radio emission from the cluster. Assuming diffusive shock acceleration (DSA),
we found Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M}_{n}=2.7{}_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ and
$\mathcal{M}_{s}=1.9_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$ for the northern and southern shocks. The
derived Mach number for the northern shock requires an acceleration efficiency
of several percent to accelerate electrons from the thermal pool, which is
challenging for DSA. Using the radio data, we characterised the eastern relic
as a shock wave propagating outwards with a Mach number of
$\mathcal{M}_{e}=2.4_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$, which is in agreement with
$\mathcal{M}_{e}^{X}=2.5{}_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ that we derived from Suzaku data. The
eastern shock is likely to be associated with the major cluster merger. The
radio halo was measured with a flux of $346\pm64\,\text{mJy}$ at
$145\,\text{MHz}$. Across the halo, we observed a spectral index that remains
approximately constant ($\alpha^{\text{145 MHz-2.3 GHz}}_{\text{across
\(\sim\)1 Mpc}^2}=-1.01\pm0.10$) after the steepening in the post-shock region

measurements of those properties, and our own measurements of arm and bar
contrasts for a large sample of galaxies, using $3.6 \mathrm{\mu m}$ images
from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). Flocculent
galaxies are clearly distinguished from other spiral arm classes, especially by
their lower stellar mass and surface density. Multi-armed and grand-design
galaxies are similar in most of their fundamental parameters, excluding some
bar properties and the bulge-to-total ratio. Based on these results, we revisit
the sequence of spiral arm classes, and discuss classical bulges as a necessary
condition for standing spiral wave modes in grand-design galaxies. We find a
strong correlation between bulge-to-total ratio and bar contrast, and a weaker
correlation between arm and bar contrasts. Barred and unbarred galaxies exhibit
similar arm contrasts, but the highest arm contrasts are found exclusively in
barred galaxies. Interestingly, the bar contrast, and its increase from
flocculent to grand-design galaxies, is systematically more significant than
that of the arm contrast. We corroborate previous findings concerning a
connection between bars and disc breaks. In particular, in grand-design
galaxies the bar contrast correlates with the normalised disc break radius.
This does not hold for other spiral arm classes or the arm contrast. Our
measurements of arm and bar contrast and radial contrast profiles are publicly
available.

which accretes gas material from a second protoplanetary disc during a close
encounter in an embedded star cluster. The aim is to investigate the capability
of the mass accretion scenario to generate strongly inclined gaseous discs
which could later form misaligned planets. We use smoothed particle
hydrodynamics to study mass transfer and disc inclination for passing stars and
circumstellar discs with different masses. We explore different orbital
configurations to find the parameter space which allows significant disc
inclination generation.
  \citet{Thi2011} suggested that significant disc inclination and disc or
planetary system shrinkage can generally be produced by the accretion of
external gas material with a different angular momentum. We found that this
condition can be fullfilled for a large range of gas mass and angular momentum.
  For all encounters, mass accretion from the secondary disc increases with
decreasing mass of the secondary proto-star. Thus, higher disc inclinations can
be attained for lower secondary stellar masses. Variations of the secondary
disc's orientation relative to the orbital plane can alter the disc evolution
significantly.
  The results taken together show that mass accretion can change the
three-dimensional disc orientation significantly resulting in strongly inclined
discs. In combination with the gravitational interaction between the two
star-disc systems, this scenario is relevant for explaining the formation of
highly inclined discs which could later form misaligned planets.

bias of dark matter haloes. Previous results suggest that the anisotropy of a
halo's environment (i.e, whether it lies in a filament or in a more isotropic
region) can play a significant role in determining the eventual mass and age of
the halo. We statistically isolate this effect using correlations between the
large-scale and small-scale environments of simulated haloes at $z=0$ with
masses between $10^{11.6}\lesssim (m/h^{-1}M_{\odot})\lesssim10^{14.9}$. We
probe the large-scale environment using a novel halo-by-halo estimator of
linear bias. For the small-scale environment, we identify a variable $\alpha_R$
that captures the $\textit{tidal anisotropy}$ in a region of radius
$R=4R_{\textrm{200b}}$ around the halo and correlates strongly with halo bias
at fixed mass. Segregating haloes by $\alpha_R$ reveals two distinct
populations. Haloes in highly isotropic local environments
($\alpha_R\lesssim0.2$) behave as expected from the simplest, spherically
averaged analytical models of structure formation, showing a
$\textit{negative}$ correlation between their concentration and large-scale
bias at $\textit{all}$ masses. In contrast, haloes in anisotropic,
filament-like environments ($\alpha_R\gtrsim0.5$) tend to show a
$\textit{positive}$ correlation between bias and concentration at any mass. Our
multi-scale analysis cleanly demonstrates how the overall assembly bias trend
across halo mass emerges as an average over these different halo populations,
and provides valuable insights towards building analytical models that
correctly incorporate assembly bias. We also discuss potential implications for
the nature and detectability of galaxy assembly bias.

off-diagonal DM coupling to two heavy particles; for scatterings, the coupling
of soft DM to two heavy particles needs to be diagonal, in particular in spin

quantity for several fields of astrophysics. An accurate theoretical prediction
is needed for such purposes. Aims. We intend to provide a solid theoretical
prediction for it, valid for a reference set of standard physical assumptions,
and mostly independent of numerical details. We examine the dependence on
physical assumptions and numerical details, for a wide range of metallicities
and masses, and based on two different stellar evolution codes. We adjust
differences between the codes to treat the physics as identical as possible.
After we have succeeded in reproducing the tip brightness between the codes, we
present a reference set of models based on the most up to date physical inputs,
but neglecting microscopic diffusion, and convert theoretical luminosities to
observed infrared colours suitable for observations of resolved populations of
stars and include analytic fits to facilitate their use. We find that
consistent use of updated nuclear reactions, including an appropriate treatment
of the electron screening effects, and careful time-stepping on the upper red
giant branch are the most important aspects to bring initially discrepant
theoretical values into agreement. Small, but visible differences remain
unexplained for very low metallicities and mass values at and above 1.2 Msun,
corresponding to ages younger than 4 Gyr. The colour transformations introduce
larger uncertainties than the differences between the two stellar evolution
codes. We demonstrate that careful stellar modeling allows an accurate
prediction for the luminosity of the Red Giant Branch tip. Differences to
empirically determined brightnesses may result either from insufficient colour
transformations or from deficits in the constitutional physics. We present the
best-tested theoretical reference values to date.

used to localize robotic grasp configurations directly from sensor data without
estimating object pose. The underlying idea is to treat grasp perception
analogously to object detection in computer vision. These methods take as input
a noisy and partially occluded RGBD image or point cloud and produce as output
pose estimates of viable grasps, without assuming a known CAD model of the
object. Although these methods generalize grasp knowledge to new objects well,
they have not yet been demonstrated to be reliable enough for wide use. Many
grasp detection methods achieve grasp success rates (grasp successes as a
fraction of the total number of grasp attempts) between 75% and 95% for novel
objects presented in isolation or in light clutter. Not only are these success
rates too low for practical grasping applications, but the light clutter
scenarios that are evaluated often do not reflect the realities of real world
grasping. This paper proposes a number of innovations that together result in a
significant improvement in grasp detection performance. The specific
improvement in performance due to each of our contributions is quantitatively
measured either in simulation or on robotic hardware. Ultimately, we report a
series of robotic experiments that average a 93% end-to-end grasp success rate

the point of closest reach. This leads us to a number of other substantial new
results for this class of stable processes. We engage with a new radial

Blumenthal-Getoor-Ray identities for first entry/exit into a ball, cf.
Blumenthal et al. (1961), to the setting of $n$-tuple laws. We identify

modular multilevel converter (MMC). MMC is a converter system with a typical
multi-frequency response due to its significant harmonics in the arm currents,
capacitor voltages, and control signals. These internal harmonic dynamics can
have a great influence on the operation characteristics of MMC. However, the
conventional modeling methods commonly used in two-level voltage-source
converters (VSCs), where only the fundamental-frequency dynamic is considered,
will lead to an inaccurate model that cannot accurately reflect the real
dynamic characteristics of MMC. Therefore, the HSS modeling method, in which
harmonics of state variables, inputs, and outputs are posed separately in a
state-space form, is introduced in this paper to model the MMC in order to
capture all the harmonics and the frequency couplings. The steady-state and
small-signal dynamic HSS models of a three-phase MMC are developed,
respectively. The validity of the developed HSS model of a three-phase MMC has
been verified by the results from both the nonlinear time domain simulation
model in MATLAB/Simulink and the laboratory prototype with 12 submodules per

molecular mechanisms such as protein scaffolding, lipid or protein asymmetry,
cytoskeletal forces, etc. These mechanisms have the net effect of generating
stresses on the bilayer that are translated into distinct final shapes of the
membrane. We propose reversing this input-output relationship by using the
shape of a curved membrane to infer physical quantities like the magnitude of
the applied forces acting on the bilayer. To do this, we calculate the normal
and tangential tractions along the membrane using the known material properties
of the membrane along with its shape. These tractions are a quantitative
measure of the response of the membrane to external forces or sources of
spontaneous curvature. We demonstrate the utility of this approach first by
showing that the magnitude of applied force can be inferred from the shape of
the membrane alone in both simulations and experiments of membrane tubulation.
Next, we show that membrane budding by local differences in spontaneous
curvature is driven purely by the generation of traction in the radial
direction and the emergence of an effective line tension at the boundary of
these regions. Finally, we show that performing this calculation on images of
phase-separated giant vesicles yields a line tension similar to experimentally
determined values.

Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs), does not continue smoothly from the

processes contribute to the short-wavelength emission in these objects. The
most notable spectral feature in the FUV continuum of some CTTSs is a broad
emission approximately centered at 1600~\AA, which has been referred to as the
""1600 A Bump"". The origin of this feature remains unclear. We have assembled
archival FUV spectra of 37 disk-hosting systems observed by the {\it Hubble
Space Telescope}. Clear 1600 A Bump emission is observed above the smooth,
underlying 1100-1800 A continuum spectrum in 19/37 Classical T Tauri disks in
the HST sample, with the detection rate in transition disks (8/8) being much
higher than in primordial or non-transition sources (11/29). We describe a
spectral deconvolution analysis to separate the Bump (spanning 1490~--~1690 A)
from the underlying FUV continuum, finding an average Bump luminosity,
$L$(Bump7 x 10^{29} erg s^{-1}. We find that the 1600 A Bump is characterized

  Contrary to previous studies, we find that this feature is inconsistent with

10-80% of the total fluorescent H2 luminosity for stars with well-defined Bump
features. Energetically, this suggests that the carrier of the 1600 A Bump
emission is powered by Ly-a photons. We argue that the most likely mechanism is
Ly-a-driven dissociation of H2O in the inner disk, r < 2 AU. We demonstrate
that non-thermally populated H2O fragments can qualitatively account for the
observed emission (discrete and continuum), and find that the average

commercial applications to express relations and explore large data sets.
Although conventional or commodity computer architectures, like CPU or GPU, can
compute fairly well dense graph algorithms, they are often inadequate in
processing large sparse graph applications. Memory access patterns, memory
bandwidth requirements and on-chip network communications in these applications
do not fit in the conventional program execution flow. In this work, we propose
and design a new architecture for fast processing of large graph applications.
To leverage the lack of the spatial and temporal localities in these
applications and to support scalable computational models, we design the
architecture around two key concepts. (1) The architecture is a multicore
processor of independently clocked processing elements. These elements
communicate in a self-timed manner and use handshaking to perform
synchronization, communication, and sequencing of operations. By being
asynchronous, the operating speed at each processing element is determined by
actual local latencies rather than global worst-case latencies. We create a
specialized ISA to support these operations. (2) The application compilation
and mapping process uses a graph clustering algorithm to optimize parallel
computing of graph operations and load balancing. Through the clustering
process, we make scalability an inherent property of the architecture where
task-to-element mapping can be done at the graph node level or at node cluster
level. A prototyped version of the architecture outperforms a comparable CPU by
10~20x across all benchmarks and provides 2~5x better power efficiency when
compared to a GPU.

increasing breakdown voltages of Ga2O3 based power devices. Therefore,
transport and capacitance spectroscopy studies have been performed to better
understand the origin of unintentional doping in Ga2O3. Previously unobserved
unintentional donors in commercially available (-201) Ga2O3 substrates have
been electrically characterized via temperature dependent Hall effect
measurements up to 1000 K and found to have a donor energy of 110 meV. The
existence of the unintentional donor is confirmed by temperature dependent
admittance spectroscopy, with an activation energy of 131 meV determined via
that technique, in agreement with Hall effect measurements. With the
concentration of this donor determined to be in the mid to high 10^16 cm^-3
range, elimination of this donor from the drift layer of Ga2O3 power
electronics devices will be key to pushing the limits of device performance.
Indeed, analytical assessment of the specific on-resistance (Ronsp) and
breakdown voltage of Schottky diodes containing the 110 meV donor indicates
that incomplete ionization increases Ronsp and decreases breakdown voltage as
compared to Ga2O3 Schottky diodes containing only the shallow donor. The
reduced performance due to incomplete ionization occurs in addition to the
usual tradeoff between Ronsp and breakdown voltage. To achieve 10 kV operation
in Ga2O3 Schottky diode devices, analysis indicates that the concentration of
110 meV donors must be reduced below 5x10^14 cm^-3 to limit the increase in

classical gases. A fundamental problem in mathematical physics is to rigorously
derive Boltzmann's equation starting from Newton's laws. In the 1970s, Oscar
Lanford provided such a derivation, for the hard sphere interaction, on a small
time interval. One of the subtleties of Lanford's original proof was that the
strength of convergence proven at positive times was much weaker than that
which had to be assumed at the initial time, which is at odds with the idea of
propagation of chaos. Several authors have addressed this situation with
various notions of strong one-sided chaos, which is the true property which is
propagated by the dynamics. We provide a new approach to the problem based on
duality and the evolution of observables; the observables encode the detailed
interaction and allow us to define a new notion of strong one-sided chaos.

The pre-outburst source exhibited a significant near-infrared excess consistent
with a 120 AU shell with 4x10-6 Msun of dust. We infer that the source was
enshrouded by an optically-thick and compact shell of circumstellar material
from an LBV wind, which formed a pseudo-photosphere consistent with S Dor-like
variables in their ""maximum"" phase. Within a year of outburst, the source was
highly variable on 10-30 day timescales. The outburst light curve closely
matches that of the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip, although the observed
velocities are significantly slower than in that event. In Halpha, the outburst
had an excess of blueshifted emission at late times centred around -1500 km/s,
similar to that of double-peaked Type IIn supernovae and the LBV outburst SN
2015bh. From the pre-outburst and post-outburst photometry, we infer that the

equilibrium of a hierarchical complex system with multiple time and length
scales. In this approach, the system is formally treated as being composed of a
small subsystem---representing the region where the measurements are made---in
contact with a set of `nested heat reservoirs' corresponding to the
hierarchical structure of the system. The probability distribution function
(pdf) of the fluctuating temperatures at each reservoir, conditioned on the
temperature of the reservoir above it, is determined from a maximum entropy
principle subject to appropriate constraints that describe the thermal
equilibrium properties of the system. The marginal temperature distribution of
the innermost reservoir is obtained by integrating over the conditional
distributions of all larger scales, and the resulting pdf is written in
analytical form in terms of certain special transcendental functions, known as
the Fox $H$-functions. The distribution of states of the small subsystem is
then computed by averaging the quasi-equilibrium Boltzmann distribution over
the temperature of the innermost reservoir. This distribution can also be
written in terms of $H$-functions. The general family of distributions reported
here recovers, as particular cases, the stationary distributions recently
obtained by Mac\^edo {\it et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~E {\bf 95}, 032315 (2017)] from a

bipartite matching in various online and related models. We first consider a
deterministic adversarial model. The best approximation ratio possible for a
one-pass deterministic online algorithm is $1/2$, which is achieved by any
greedy algorithm. D\""urr et al. recently presented a $2$-pass algorithm called
Category-Advice that achieves approximation ratio $3/5$. We extend their
algorithm to multiple passes. We prove the exact approximation ratio for the
$k$-pass Category-Advice algorithm for all $k \ge 1$, and show that the
approximation ratio converges to the inverse of the golden ratio
$2/(1+\sqrt{5}) \approx 0.618$ as $k$ goes to infinity. The convergence is
extremely fast --- the $5$-pass Category-Advice algorithm is already within
$0.01\%$ of the inverse of the golden ratio.
  We then consider a natural greedy algorithm in the online stochastic IID
model---MinDegree. This algorithm is an online version of a well-known and
extensively studied offline algorithm MinGreedy. We show that MinDegree cannot
achieve an approximation ratio better than $1-1/e$, which is guaranteed by any
consistent greedy algorithm in the known IID model.
  Finally, following the work in Besser and Poloczek, we depart from an
adversarial or stochastic ordering and investigate a natural randomized
algorithm (MinRanking) in the priority model. Although the priority model
allows the algorithm to choose the input ordering in a general but well defined
way, this natural algorithm cannot obtain the approximation of the Ranking

projection). The [C II] tail is comprised predominantly of two distinct
sub-components in velocity, separated from the core by ~100 and 250km/s, with
narrow intrinsic widths of about 80km/s, which we call 'sub-galaxies'. The
sub-galaxies themselves are extended east-west by about 3kpc in individual

field. The [C II] line to continuum ratios are comparable for the main and

comparable to z~5.5 LBGs. We conjecture that the WMH5 system represents the
early formation of a galaxy through the accretion of smaller satellite
galaxies, embedded in a smoother gas distribution, along a possibly filamentary
structure. The results are consistent with current cosmological simulations of
early galaxy formation, and support the idea of very early enrichment with dust

$SU(3)_f$ dark flavor symmetry that is spontaneously broken to $SU(2)_f \times
U(1)_f$. The resonance is the heaviest state in the dark matter flavor
multiplet and the required mass relation is protected by the vacuum structure
and supersymmetry from radiative corrections. The pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Bosons
(PNGB's) from the dark flavor symmetry breaking can be slightly lighter than
one GeV and dominantly decay into two muons just from kinematics, with
subsequent decay into positrons. The PNGB's are produced in resonant dark
matter semi-annihilation, where two dark matter particles annihilate into an
anti-dark matter particle and a PNGB. The dark matter mass in our model is
constrained to be below around 1.9 TeV from fitting thermal relic abundance,
AMS-02 data and CMB constraints. The superpartners of Standard Model (SM)
particles can cascade decay into a light PNGB along with SM particles, yielding
a correlated signal of this model at colliders. One of the interesting
signatures is a resonance of a SM Higgs boson plus two collimated muons, which

rapidly developed with the collective objective of creating lasers $\textit{in

laser gain material. In this work, we study the lasing potential and efficiency
of flavins and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H)
using a dye lasing model based on coupled rate equations. Analytical solutions
for one- and two-photon pumped system were used in multi-parameter studies. We
found that at physiological conditions, lasing can be supported by NAD(P)H with
cavity quality factors of $10^5$. With the further consideration of damage
thresholds, we recommend the use of flavins as they entail lower threshold
requirements. We then identify potential parameters for engineering to make the
lasing of flavins feasible even at their low physiological intracellular
concentrations. We also note the higher threshold requirements and lower
efficiencies of two-photon pumping, but recognize its potential for realizing

fundamental parameter in aeolian processes. The presence of liquid, such as
water on Earth or methane on Titan, may affect the threshold values to a great
extent. Sediment density is also crucial for determining threshold values. Here
we provide quantitative data on density and water content of common wind tunnel
materials that have been used to study conditions on Earth, Titan, Mars, and
Venus. The measured density values for low density materials are higher
compared to literature values, whereas for the high density materials, there is
no such discrepancy. We also find that low density materials have much higher
water content and longer atmospheric equilibration timescales compared to high
density sediments. In the Titan Wind Tunnel, we performed threshold experiments
with the standard walnut shells (125-150 \mu m, 7.2% water by mass) and dried
walnut shells (1.7% water by mass). The threshold results for the two scenarios
are almost the same, which indicates that humidity had a negligible effect on
threshold for walnut shells in this experimental regime. When the water content
is lower than 11.0%, the interparticle forces are dominated by adsorption
forces, whereas at higher values the interparticle forces are dominated by much
larger capillary forces. For materials with low equilibrium water content, like
quartz sand, capillary forces dominate. When the interparticle forces are
dominated by adsorption forces, the threshold does not increase with increasing
relative humidity (RH). Only when the interparticle forces are dominated by
capillary forces does the threshold start to increase with increasing RH/water
content. Since tholins have a low methane content (0.3% at saturation, Curtis
et al., 2008), we believe tholins would behave similarly to quartz sand when
subjected to methane moisture. [abridged abstract]

magnetic field configuration of the flare site was consistent with a breakout

series of high resolution three dimensional smulations of two initial
conditions with eight independent codes. The simulations are initialised with a
narrowband perturbation such that instability growth is due to non-linear
coupling/backscatter from the energetic modes, thus generating the lowest
expected growth rate from a pure RMI. By independently assessing the results
from each algorithm, and computing ensemble averages of multiple algorithms,
the results allow a quantification of key flow properties as well as the
uncertainty due to differing numerical approaches. A new analytical model
predicting the initial layer growth for a multimode narrowband perturbation is
presented, along with two models for the linear and non-linear regime combined.
Overall, the growth rate exponent is determined as $\theta=0.292 \pm 0.009$, in
good agreement with prior studies; however, the exponent is decaying slowly in
time. $\theta$ is shown to be relatively insensitive to the choice of mixing
layer width measurement. The asymptotic integral molecular mixing measures
$\Theta=0.792\pm 0.014$, $\Xi=0.800 \pm 0.014$ and $\Psi=0.782\pm 0.013$ which
are lower than some experimental measurements but within the range of prior
numerical studies. The flow field is shown to be persistently anisotropic for
all algorithms, at the latest time having between 49\% and 66\% higher kinetic
energy in the shock parallel direction compared to perpendicular and does not
show any return to isotropy. The plane averaged volume fraction profiles at
different time instants collapse reasonably well when scaled by the integral
width, implying that the layer can be described by a single length scale and
thus a single $\theta$. Quantitative data given for both ensemble averages and
individual algorithms provide useful benchmark results for future research.

Battery energy storage (BES) has been widely accepted as the most potential
application to cope with the challenge of high penetration of DRE. To cope with
the uncertainties and variability of DRE, a stochastic day-ahead dynamic
optimal power flow (DOPF) and its algorithm are proposed. The overall economy
is achieved by fully considering the DRE, BES, electricity purchasing and
active power losses. The rainflow algorithm-based cycle counting method of BES
is incorporated in the DOPF model to capture the cell degradation, greatly
extending the expected BES lifetime and achieving a better economy. DRE
scenarios are generated to consider the uncertainties and correlations based on
the Copula theory. To solve the DOPF model, we propose a Lagrange
relaxation-based algorithm, which has a significantly reduced complexity with
respect to the existing techniques. For this reason, the proposed algorithm
enables much more scenarios incorporated in the DOPF model and better captures
the DRE uncertainties and correlations. Finally, numerical studies for the
day-ahead DOPF in the IEEE 123-node test feeder are presented to demonstrate
the merits of the proposed method. Results show that the actual BES life
expectancy of the proposed model has increased to 4.89 times compared with the
traditional ones. The problems caused by DRE are greatly alleviated by fully

From a game theoretic perspective, this is a randomized approach to the
well-known Koutsoupias-Papadimitriou model, while it is known as randomized
local search (RLS) in load balancing literature. Up to now, the best bound on

a symmetry. We study a variation of such models in which that symmetry is taken
to be a local U(1), leading naturally to the typical Lagrangian of the inverse

double-quantum-well (DQW) structure are studied. Different from a single
quantum well, band mixing in the DQW generates bonding and antibonding states,
whose wave functions have different spatial symmetry. By applying a
time-dependent electric potential to the two well regions simultaneously,
Floquet sidebands are formed, which constitutes additional quantum tunneling
paths. When one of the Floquet sidebands coincides with the bonding or
antibonding quasibound states within the DQW structure, sharp Fano resonances
are found in the transmission coefficients as well as in the differential shot
noise spectra. While such Fano resonances originate from quantum interference,
their shapes are strikingly different for transport via the bonding state and
via the antibonding state. The Fano resonance via the even-parity bonding state
shows a perfect transmission followed by a total reflection and the Fano
resonance via the odd-parity antibonding state has a reversed symmetry and
shows a total reflection before a perfect transmission.

consider goodness-of-fit testing when the null distribution has a possibly
growing or unbounded number of categories. In the continuous case, we consider
testing a Lipschitz density, with possibly unbounded support, in the
low-smoothness regime where the Lipschitz parameter is not assumed to be
constant. In contrast to existing results, we show that the minimax rate and
critical testing radius in these settings depend strongly, and in a precise
way, on the null distribution being tested and this motivates the study of the
(local) minimax rate as a function of the null distribution. For multinomials
the local minimax rate was recently studied in the work of Valiant and Valiant.
We re-visit and extend their results and develop two modifications to the
chi-squared test whose performance we characterize. For testing Lipschitz
densities, we show that the usual binning tests are inadequate in the
low-smoothness regime and we design a spatially adaptive partitioning scheme
that forms the basis for our locally minimax optimal tests. Furthermore, we
provide the first local minimax lower bounds for this problem which yield a
sharp characterization of the dependence of the critical radius on the null
hypothesis being tested. In the low-smoothness regime we also provide adaptive
tests, that adapt to the unknown smoothness parameter. We illustrate our
results with a variety of simulations that demonstrate the practical utility of

three sparse matrices---one of them is positive definite and need to be further
factorized by using the Cholesky decomposition or similar methods. When the
molecule subjected to study is of serial chain structure, this method can
achieve $O(n)$ computational complexity. However, for molecules with long
branches, Cholesky decomposition about the corresponding positive definite

the calculation in scaling of $O(n^3)$. Although several methods have been used
in factorizing the positive definite sparse matrices, no one could strictly
guarantee for no fill-in for all molecules according to our test, and thus
$O(n)$ efficiency cannot be obtained by using these traditional methods. In
this paper we present a new method that can guarantee for no fill-in in doing

For some time it has been proposed that scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
spectra do not reflect the properties of the superconducting layer in the
CuO$_2$ plane directly beneath the STM tip, but rather a weighted sum of
spatially proximate states determined by the details of the tunneling process.
These ""filter"" ideas have been countered with the argument that similar
conductance patterns have been seen around impurities and charge ordered states
in systems with atomically quite different barrier layers. Here we use a
recently developed Wannier function based method to calculate topographies,
spectra, conductance maps and normalized conductance maps close to impurities.
We find that it is the local planar Cu $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Wannier function,
qualitatively similar for many systems, that controls the form of the tunneling
spectrum and the spatial patterns near perturbations. We explain how, despite
the fact that STM observables depend on the materials-specific details of the
tunneling process and setup parameters, there is an overall universality in the
qualitative features of conductance spectra. In particular, we discuss why STM
results on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ and Ca$_{2-x}$Na$_x$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ are

explain the origin of cool dense plasmas of prominences. Using
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations including anisotropic
nonlinear thermal conduction and optically thin radiative cooling, we
demonstrate that reconnection can lead not only to flux rope formation but also
to radiative condensation under a certain condition. In our model, this
condition is described by the Field length, which is defined as the scale
length for thermal balance between radiative cooling and thermal conduction.
This critical condition depends weakly on the artificial background heating.
The extreme ultraviolet emissions synthesized with our simulation results have

good, a potential buyer might stay away from purchasing the good, hoping to
free ride on others' purchases. A revenue-maximizing seller who sells social

good. The literature on optimal pricing has advanced considerably over the last
decade, but little is known about optimal pricing schemes for selling social

fine-grained reliability per realization exhibits bimodal behavior. Either
performance for a certain vehicular traffic scenario is very reliable or

Investigating other safety-critical point process networks at the meta

magnitude $H_r$~$<$~17.4 mag and heliocentric distance $r$~$<$~5.5~au as an

a geometric albedo of 0.07 \citep{grav12}, the size range of our unbiased

law to the cumulative size distribution and then found the best-fit index ($b$)

of corresponding absolute magnitude distribution ($N(H)~\propto~10^{\alpha H}$)
is 0.37~$\pm$~0.01. This $\alpha$ is consistent with that of the faint end
slope presented by \cite{WB15}. The size distribution obtained from this survey
is slightly different from previous survey's result with a similar size range
\citep*{YN05,YN08,WB15}, which reported a broken power-law or double power-law
slopes in their cumulative size distribution. Our results insists that the
slope of $b$~=~1.84 continues from $H$~=~14.0 to at least $H$~=~17.4. Since
this work contains the largest L4 JT samples and one magnitude deeper than the
study by \cite{WB15}, we believe that our study obtained the robustest size
distribution of small JTs so far. Combining the cataloged L4 JTs and our

adsorbed microparticles depends on interface curvature; particles move to
minimize the excess area of the distortions that they make in the interface.
For particles that are sufficiently small, this area decreases as particles
move along principle axes to sites of high deviatoric curvature. We have
studied this migration for microparticles on a curved host interface with zero
mean curvature created by pinning an oil-water interface around a micropost.
Here, on a similar interface, we demonstrate capillary curvature repulsion,

devices. The energy level alignment (ELA) of frontier molecular levels relative
to the metal Fermi level (EF) is critical to the conductance and functionality
of these devices. However, a clear understanding of the ELA that includes
many-electron self-energy effects is lacking. Here, we investigate the
many-electron effects on the ELA using state-of-the-art, benchmark GW
calculations on prototypical chemisorbed molecules on Au(111), in eleven
different geometries. The GW ELA is in good agreement with photoemission for
monolayers of benzene-diamine on Au(111). We find that in addition to static
image charge screening, the frontier levels in most of these geometries are
renormalized by additional screening from substrate-mediated intermolecular
Coulomb interactions. For weakly chemisorbed systems, such as amines and
pyridines on Au, this additional level renormalization (~1.5 eV) comes solely
from static screened exchange energy, allowing us to suggest computationally
more tractable schemes to predict the ELA at such interfaces. However, for more
strongly chemisorbed thiolate layers, dynamical effects are present. Our ab
initio results constitute an important step towards the understanding and
manipulation of functional molecular/organic systems for both fundamental

inference in observational studies. However, model selection for PS estimation
in high-dimensional data has received little attention. In these settings, PS
models have traditionally been selected based on the goodness-of-fit for the
treatment mechanism itself, without consideration of the causal parameter of
interest. Collaborative minimum loss-based estimation (C-TMLE) is a novel
methodology for causal inference that takes into account information on the
causal parameter of interest when selecting a PS model. This ""collaborative
learning"" considers variable associations with both treatment and outcome when
selecting a PS model in order to minimize a bias-variance trade off in the
estimated treatment effect. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for
collaborative model selection when using the LASSO estimator for PS estimation
in high-dimensional covariate settings. To demonstrate the importance of
selecting the PS model collaboratively, we designed quasi-experiments based on
a real electronic healthcare database, where only the potential outcomes were
manually generated, and the treatment and baseline covariates remained
unchanged. Results showed that the C-TMLE algorithm outperformed other
competing estimators for both point estimation and confidence interval
coverage. In addition, the PS model selected by C-TMLE could be applied to
other PS-based estimators, which also resulted in substantive improvement for
both point estimation and confidence interval coverage. We illustrate the
discussed concepts through an empirical example comparing the effects of
non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with selective COX-2
inhibitors on gastrointestinal complications in a population of Medicare
beneficiaries.

compared with existing models: the source count distributions as a function of
flux density and spatial position (source clustering), extending current
formalisms for the foreground covariance of 2D power spectral modes in 21 cm
EoR experiments. The former we generalise to an arbitrarily broken power-law,
and the latter to an arbitrary isotropically-correlated field. This paper
presents expressions for the modified covariance under these extensions, and
shows that for a more realistic source spatial distribution, extra covariance
arises in the EoR window which was previously unaccounted for. Failure to
include this contribution can yield bias in the final power spectrum and
under-estimate uncertainties, potentially leading to a false detection of
signal. The extent of this effect is uncertain, owing to ignorance of physical
model parameters, but we show that it is dependent on the relative abundance of
faint sources, to the effect that our extension will become more important for
future deep surveys. Finally, we show that under some parameter choices,
ignoring source clustering can lead to false detections on large scales, due to
both the induced bias and an artificial reduction in the estimated measurement
uncertainty.

large number of users in Singapore and neighbouring countries. By combining
this data, population statistics and travel diaries and applying clustering
techniques, we addressed detection of activity locations, as well as spatial
separation and transitions between these locations. Kernel density estimation
performs best to detect activity locations due to the scattered nature of the
twitter data; more activity locations are detected per user than reported in
the travel survey. The descriptive analysis shows that determining home
locations is more difficult than detecting work locations for most planning
zones. Spatial separations between detected activity locations from Twitter
data - as reported in a travel survey and captured by public transport smart
card data - are mostly similarly distributed, but also show relevant
differences for very short and very long distances. This also holds for the
transitions between zones. Whether the differences between Twitter data and
other data sources stem from differences in the population sub-sample,
clustering methodology, or whether social networks are being used significantly
more at specific locations must be determined by further research. Despite
these shortcomings, location-based social network data offers a promising data
source for insights into activity locations and mobility patterns, especially

IT services. A combination of Kibana and Elasticsearch is used for monitoring
in many places such as KEK, CC-IN2P3, CERN, and also non-HEP communities.
Kibana provides a web interface for rich visualization, and Elasticsearch is a
scalable distributed search engine. However, these tools do not support
authentication and authorization features by default. In the case of single
Kibana and Elasticsearch services shared among many users, any user who can
access Kibana can retrieve other's information from Elasticsearch. In
multi-user environment, in order to protect own data from others or share part
of data among a group, fine-grained access control is necessary.
  The CERN cloud service group had provided cloud utilization dashboard to each
user by Elasticsearch and Kibana. They had deployed a homemade Elasticsearch
plugin to restrict data access based on a user authenticated by the CERN Single
Sign On system. It enabled each user to have a separated Kibana dashboard for
cloud usage, and the user could not access to other's one. Based on the
solution, we propose an alternative one which enables user/group based
Elasticsearch access control and Kibana objects separation. It is more flexible
and can be applied to not only the cloud service but also the other various
situations. We confirmed our solution works fine in CC-IN2P3. Moreover, a
pre-production platform for CC-IN2P3 has been under construction.
  We will describe our solution for the secure use of Kibana and Elasticsearch
including integration of Kerberos authentication, development of a Kibana
plugin which allows Kibana objects to be separated based on user/group, and
contribution to Search Guard which is an Elasticsearch plugin enabling
user/group based access control. We will also describe the effect on
performance from using Search Guard.

the central photon energy (given a Fourier-limited Gaussian pulse). Similar
results are found also in helium. Our finding is surprising because it implies

end of the transition from the soft to the hard state, and the decrease of
luminosity in the hard state. During all the observations we detected, at high
frequencies, significant disc variability, responding to variations of the
power law emission with an average time delay of $\sim0.009\pm 0.002$ s. These
new detections of disc thermal reverberation add to those previously obtained
and suggest the lag to be always present in hard and hard-intermediate states.
Our study reveals a net decrease of lag amplitude as a function of luminosity.
We ascribe this trend to variations of the inner flow geometry. A possible
scenario implies a \emph{decrease} of the inner disc truncation radius as the
luminosity increases at the beginning of the outburst, followed by an
\emph{increase} of the inner disc truncation radius as the luminosity decreases
at the end of the outburst. Finally, we found hints of FeK reverberation
($\sim3\sigma$ significance) during the best quality observation of the XMM
monitoring. The lag at the FeK energy has similar amplitude as that of the
thermally reprocessed component, as expected if the same irradiated region of
the disc is responsible for producing both the thermalized and reflected
component. This finding suggests FeK reverberation in BHXRBs to be at the reach
of current detectors provided observations of sufficiently long exposure are

anisotropic electronic structure of SnSe investigated by both angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and quantum transport, in which a unique
""\textit{pudding-mold}"" shaped valence band with quasi-linear energy dispersion
is revealed. We prove that the electrical doping in SnSe is extrinsically
controlled by the formation of SnSe$_{2}$ micro-domains induced by local phase
segregation. Using different growth methods and conditions, we have achieved
wide tuning of hole doping in SnSe, ranging from intrinsic semiconducting
behaviour to typical metal with carrier density of $1.23\times 10^{18}$
cm$^{-3}$ at room temperature. The resulting multi-valley transport in $p$-SnSe
is characterized by non-saturating weak localization along the armchair axis,
due to strong intervalley scattering enhanced by in-plane ferroelectric dipole
field of the puckering lattice. Strikingly, quantum oscillations of
magnetoresistance reveal three-dimensional electronic structure with unusual
interlayer coupling strength in $p$-SnSe, which is correlated to the
interweaving of SnSe individual layers by unique point dislocation defects. Our
results suggest that defect engineering may provide versatile routes in
improving the thermoelectric performance of the SnSe family.

strikingly reveals the complex spiral structure beyond the solar circle, which
is characterized by a mixture of distinct long arcs of HI concentrations and
numerous 'interarm' features. The comparison with more conventional spiral
tracers confirms the nature of those long arc structures as spiral arms. Our
map shows that the HI spiral structure in the outer Galaxy is well described by
a four-arm spiral model (pitch angle of 12 deg) with some deviations, and gives
a new insight into identifying HI features associated with individual arms.

$S$ while supporting fast queries. We present a compressed index based on the
Lempel--Ziv 1977 compression scheme. We obtain the following time-space
trade-offs: For constant-sized alphabets; (i) $O(m + occ \lg\lg n)$ time using
$O(z\lg(n/z)\lg\lg z)$ space, or (ii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon z}{\lg(n/z)})
+ occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z\lg(n/z))$ space. For integer
alphabets polynomially bounded by $n$; (iii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon
z}{\lg(n/z)}) + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z(\lg(n/z) +
\lg\lg z))$ space, or (iv) $O(m + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ time using
$O(z(\lg(n/z) + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are the length of
the input string and query string respectively, $z$ is the number of phrases in
the LZ77 parse of the input string, $occ$ is the number of occurrences of the
query in the input and $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. In
particular, (i) improves the leading term in the query time of the previous
best solution from $O(m\lg m)$ to $O(m)$ at the cost of increasing the space by
a factor $\lg \lg z$. Alternatively, (ii) matches the previous best space
bound, but has a leading term in the query time of $O(m(1+\frac{\lg^{\epsilon}
z}{\lg (n/z)}))$. However, for any polynomial compression ratio, i.e., $z =
O(n^{1-\delta})$, for constant $\delta > 0$, this becomes $O(m)$. Our index
also supports extraction of any substring of length $\ell$ in $O(\ell +
\lg(n/z))$ time. Technically, our results are obtained by novel extensions and
combinations of existing data structures of independent interest, including a
new batched variant of weak prefix search.

addresses the problem of how to control or limit the decisions an agent makes

probabilistic counterpart of CTL*, as the specification language. Because in
general the policy synthesis problem for PCTL* is undecidable, we restrict to
policies whose execution history memory is finitely bounded a priori.

through quantum dot devices with strong electron-electron interactions using
various approximate master equation approaches. The package provides a
framework for calculating stationary particle or energy currents driven by
differences in chemical potentials or temperatures between the leads which are
tunnel coupled to the quantum dots. The electronic structures of the quantum
dots are described by their single-particle states and the Coulomb matrix
elements between the states. When transport is treated perturbatively to lowest
order in the tunneling couplings, the possible approaches are Pauli
(classical), first-order Redfield, and first-order von Neumann master
equations, and a particular form of the Lindblad equation. When all processes
involving two-particle excitations in the leads are of interest, the
second-order von Neumann approach can be applied. All these approaches are
implemented in QmeQ. We here give an overview of the basic structure of the
package, give examples of transport calculations, and outline the range of
applicability of the different approximate approaches.

  data under different speciation concepts",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A birth-death-sampling model gives rise to phylogenetic trees with samples
from the past and the present. Interpreting ""birth"" as branching speciation,
""death"" as extinction, and ""sampling"" as fossil preservation and recovery, this
model -- also referred to as the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model -- gives
rise to phylogenetic trees on extant and fossil samples. The model has been
mathematically analyzed and successfully applied to a range of datasets on
different taxonomic levels, such as penguins, plants, and insects. However, the
current mathematical treatment of this model does not allow for a group of
temporally distinct fossil specimens to be assigned to the same species. In
this paper, we provide a general mathematical FBD modeling framework that
explicitly takes ""stratigraphic ranges"" into account, with a stratigraphic
range being defined as the lineage interval associated with a single species,
ranging through time from the first to the last fossil appearance of the
species. To assign a sequence of fossil samples in the phylogenetic tree to the
same species, i.e., to specify a stratigraphic range, we need to define the
mode of speciation. We provide expressions to account for three common
speciation modes: budding (or asymmetric) speciation, bifurcating (or
symmetric) speciation, and anagenetic speciation. Our equations allow for
flexible joint Bayesian analysis of paleontological and neontological data.
Furthermore, our framework is directly applicable to epidemiology, where a
stratigraphic range is the observed duration of infection of a single patient,
""birth"" via budding is transmission, ""death"" is recovery, and ""sampling"" is
sequencing the pathogen of a patient. Thus, we present a model that allows for
incorporation of multiple observations through time from a single patient.

Results from the application of the machine learning methods show that the

volcanic rocks deriving from back-arc basins (65%). All the other tectonic

to form aggregated structures in the presence of oppositely charged
counterions. Understanding the dependence of the equilibrium phases and the
dynamics of the process of aggregation on parameters such as backbone
flexibility and charge density of such polymers is crucial for insights into
various biological processes which involve biological polyelectrolytes such as
protein, DNA etc., Here, we use large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations to obtain the phase diagram of the aggregated structures of
flexible charged polymers and characterize the morphology of the aggregates as
well as the aggregation dynamics, in the presence of trivalent counterions.
Three different phases are observed depending on the charge density: no
aggregation, a finite bundle phase where multiple small aggregates coexist with
a large aggregate, and a fully phase separated phase. We show that the
flexibility of the polymer backbone causes strong entanglement between charged
polymers leading to additional time scales in the aggregation process. Such
slowing down of the aggregation dynamics results in the exponent,
characterizing the power law decay of the number of aggregates with time, to be
dependent on the charge density of the polymers. These results are contrary to
those obtained for rigid polyelectrolytes, emphasizing the role of backbone
flexibility.

  Transforms",,,,,"math.FA cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is one of the corner stone results in
dimensionality reduction. It says that given $N$, for any set of $N$ vectors $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a mapping $f : X \to \mathbb{R}^m$ such
that $f(X)$ preserves all pairwise distances between vectors in $X$ to within
$(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ if $m = O(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg N)$. Much effort has gone
into developing fast embedding algorithms, with the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss
transform of Ailon and Chazelle being one of the most well-known techniques.
The current fastest algorithm that yields the optimal $m =
O(\varepsilon^{-2}\lg N)$ dimensions has an embedding time of $O(n \lg n +
\varepsilon^{-2} \lg^3 N)$. An exciting approach towards improving this, due to
Hinrichs and Vyb\'iral, is to use a random $m \times n$ Toeplitz matrix for the
embedding. Using Fast Fourier Transform, the embedding of a vector can then be
computed in $O(n \lg m)$ time. The big question is of course whether $m =
O(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg N)$ dimensions suffice for this technique. If so, this
would end a decades long quest to obtain faster and faster
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms. The current best analysis of the embedding of
Hinrichs and Vyb\'iral shows that $m = O(\varepsilon^{-2}\lg^2 N)$ dimensions
suffices. The main result of this paper, is a proof that this analysis
unfortunately cannot be tightened any further, i.e., there exists a set of $N$
vectors requiring $m = \Omega(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg^2 N)$ for the Toeplitz

to investigate how developers, when locating performance bugs, navigate through
the code, understand the program, and communicate the detected issues. Method:
We performed a qualitative user study observing twelve developers trying to fix
documented performance bugs in two open source projects. The developers worked
with a profiling and analysis tool that visually depicts runtime information in
a list representation and embedded into the source code view. Results: We
identified typical navigation strategies developers used for pinpointing the
bug, for instance, following method calls based on runtime consumption. The
integration of visualization and code helped developers to understand the bug.
Sketches visualizing data structures and algorithms turned out to be valuable
for externalizing and communicating the comprehension process for complex bugs.
Conclusion: Fixing a performance bug is a code comprehension and navigation
problem. Flexible navigation features based on executed methods and a close
integration of source code and performance information support the process.

extreme compositional variations in igneous rocks. This process can develop
with different intensities both in space and time, making the interpretation of
compositional patterns in igneous rocks a petrological challenge. As a
time-dependent process, magma mixing has been suggested to preserve information
about the time elapsed between the injection of a new magma into sub-volcanic
magma chambers and eruptions. This allowed the use of magma mixing as an
additional volcanological tool to infer the mixing-to-eruption timescales. In
spite of the potential of magma mixing processes to provide information about
the timing of volcanic eruptions its statistical robustness is not yet
established. This represents a prerequisite to apply reliably this conceptual
model. Here, new chaotic magma mixing experiments were performed at different
times using natural melts. The degree of reproducibility of experimental
results was tested repeating one experiment at the same starting conditions and
comparing the compositional variability. We further tested the robustness of
the statistical analysis by randomly removing from the analysed dataset a
progressively increasing number of samples. Results highlight the robustness of
the method to derive empirical relationships linking the efficiency of chemical
exchanges and mixing time. These empirical relationships remain valid by
removing up to 80% of the analytical determinations. Experimental results were
applied to constrain the homogenization time of chemical heterogeneities in
natural magmatic system during mixing. The calculations show that, when the
mixing dynamics generate millimetre thick filaments, homogenization timescales
of the order of a few minutes are to be expected.

deformed under a group action in the presence of noise. In order to estimate
the template, one often minimizes the variance when the influence of the
transformations have been removed (computation of the Fr{\'e}chet mean in the
quotient space). The consistency bias is defined as the distance (possibly
zero) between the orbit of the template and the orbit of one element which
minimizes the variance. In the first part, we restrict ourselves to isometric
group action, in this case the Hilbertian distance is invariant under the group
action. We establish an asymptotic behavior of the consistency bias which is
linear with respect to the noise level. As a result the inconsistency is
unavoidable as soon as the noise is enough. In practice, template estimation
with a finite sample is often done with an algorithm called ""max-max"". In the
second part, also in the case of isometric group finite, we show the
convergence of this algorithm to an empirical Karcher mean. Our numerical
experiments show that the bias observed in practice can not be attributed to
the small sample size or to a convergence problem but is indeed due to the
previously studied inconsistency. In a third part, we also present some
insights of the case of a non invariant distance with respect to the group
action. We will see that the inconsistency still holds as soon as the noise
level is large enough. Moreover we prove the inconsistency even when a
regularization term is added.

they are endowed with natural companion laws which are in such case most often

generalizes to any symmetrizable system of conservation laws. They are endowed
with nontrivial companion conservation laws, which are immediately satisfied by
classical solutions. Not surprisingly, weak solutions may fail to satisfy
companion laws, which are then often relaxed from equality to inequality and
overtake a role of a physical admissibility condition for weak solutions. We
want to answer the question what is a critical regularity of weak solutions to
a general system of conservation laws to satisfy an associated companion law as
an equality. An archetypal example of such result was derived for the
incompressible Euler system by Constantin et al. ([8]) in the context of the

combination of an axial wavenumber and an azimuthal winding number.
Combinations of these states can be used to construct excitonic wave packets
that spiral down the chain with well-determined linear and angular momenta.
These twisted exciton wave packets can be created and annihilated using laser
pulses, and their angular momentum can be optically modified during transit.
This allows for the creation of opto-excitonic circuits in which information,
encoded in the angular momentum of light, is converted into excitonic wave
packets that can be manipulated, transported, and then re-emitted. A
tight-binding paradigm is used to demonstrate the key ideas. The approach is
then extended to quantify the evolution of twisted exciton wave packets in a
many-body, multi-level time-domain density functional theory setting. In both
settings, numerical methods are developed that allow the site-to-site transfer
of angular momentum to be quantified.

adding a topological term to the action of a supercoset sigma model and then
performing (non-abelian) T-duality on a subalgebra $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}$ of
the superisometry algebra. These models inherit the classical integrability of
the parent one, and they include as special cases the so-called homogeneous
Yang-Baxter sigma models as well as their non-abelian T-duals. Many properties
of DTD models have simple algebraic interpretations. For example we show that
their (non-abelian) T-duals---including certain deformations---are again in the
same class, where $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}$ gets enlarged or shrinks by adding or
removing generators corresponding to the dualised isometries. Moreover, we show
that Weyl invariance of these models is equivalent to $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}$
being unimodular; when this property is not satisfied one can always remove one
generator to obtain a unimodular $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}$, which is equivalent to
(formal) T-duality. We also work out the target space superfields and, as a
by-product, we prove the conjectured transformation law for Ramond-Ramond (RR)
fields under bosonic non-abelian T-duality of supercosets, generalising it to
cases involving also fermionic T-dualities.

using information about their personal call statistics, and also their

this classification problem as a problem of graph labelling, which can be
solved by max-flow min-cut algorithms. Our experiments show that, by using both
user attributes and relationships, the proposed graph labelling approach is
able to achieve a classification accuracy of $\sim 87\%$, which outperforms by
$\sim 7\%$ supervised learning methods using only user attributes. In our
second problem we aim to infer the subscription type of customers of external

low dimensional optical material with direct exciton emission, whose wavelength
is tunable by controlling the number of layers. In addition to this excitonic
emission, recent works revealed the existence of emissions from defect states
and described new methods to manipulate them. Monolayer phosphorene exhibits
emission from localized defect states at wavelengths near 920 nm. Increasing
the number of layers should shift the defect emission to longer wavelengths,
enabling the material to span a broader spectral range. However, defect
emission from few-layer phosphorene has not yet been reported. In this paper,
we demonstrate the existence of a new class of near-infrared emission from
defect states in few-layer phosphorene. Photoluminescence measurements show a
bright emission around 1240 nm with a sublinear growth of emission intensity
when the excitation intensity is linearly increased, confirming the

understand of the origin and ubiquity of power-laws in many path-dependent
complex systems. SRR processes show a wide range of applications that range
from fragmentation processes, language formation to cascading pro- cesses. Here
we argue that they also offer a natural framework to understand stationary
distributions of generic driven non-equilibrium systems that are composed of a
driving and a relaxing process. We show that the statistics of driven
non-equilibrium systems can be derived from the understanding of the nature of
the underlying driving process. For constant driving rates exact power-laws
emerge with exponents that are related to the driving rate. If driving rates
become state-dependent, or if they vary across the life-span of the process,
the functional form of the state-dependence determines the statistics. Constant
driving rates lead to exact power-laws, a linear state-dependence function
yields exponential or Gamma distributions, a quadratic function gives the
normal distribution. Logarithmic and power-law state dependence leads to
log-normal and stretched exponential distribution functions, respectively. Also
Weibull, Gompertz and Tsallis-Pareto distributions arise naturally from simple
state-dependent driving rates. We discuss a simple physical example of
consecutive elastic collisions that exactly represents a SSR process.

(F-RAN) with limited fronthaul capacity, where user association (UA), data
delivery rate (DDR) and signal precoding are jointly optimized. We formulate a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem in which the weighted difference of
network throughput and total power consumption is maximized, subject to the
predefined DDR requirements and the maximum transmit power at each eRRH. To
address this challenging problem, we first apply the l0-norm approximation and
l1-norm minimization techniques to deal with the UA. After this key step, we
arrive at an approximated problem that only involves the joint optimization of
DDR and precoding. By using the alternating descent method, we further
decompose this problem into a convex subproblem for DDR allocation and a
nonconvex subproblem for precoding design. While the former is globally solved
by the interior-point method, the latter is solved by a specifically tailored
successive convex quadratic programming method. Finally, we propose an
iterative algorithm for the original joint optimization that is guaranteed to
converge. Importantly, each iteration of the developed algorithm only involves
solving simple convex problems. Numerical examples demonstrate that the
proposed design significantly improves both throughput and power performances,
especially in practical F-RANs with limited fronthaul capacity. Compared to the
sole precoder design for a given cache placement, our joint design is shown to
improve the throughput by 50% while saving at least half of the total power
consumption in the considered examples.

generated a lively debate during the past two decades. Various candidates

nevertheless impacts have not been examined until now. We investigate the
effect of impacts caused by geometric imperfections of the disk and of the
underlying flat surface, through analysing the dynamics of polygonal disks with
unilateral point contacts. Similarly to earlier works, we determine the rate of
energy absorption under the assumption of a regular pattern of motion analogous
to precession-free motion of a rolling disk. In addition, we demonstrate that
the asymptotic stability of this motion depends on parameters of the impact
model. In the case of instability, the emerging irregular motion is
investigated numerically. We conclude that there exists a range of model
parameters (small radii of gyration or small restitution coefficients) in which
absorption by impacts dominates all preiously investigated mechanisms during
the last phase of motion. Nevertheless the parameter values associated with a
homogenous disk on a hard surface are typically not in this range, hence the
effect of impacts is in that case not dominant.

balancing scheme which simultaneously considers cache size limitation and
proximity in the server redirection process.
  In contrast to the classical power of two choices setup, since the memory
limitation and the proximity constraint cause correlation in the server
selection process, we may not benefit from the power of two choices. However,
we prove that in certain regimes of problem parameters, our scheme results in
the maximum load of order $\Theta(\log\log n)$ (here $n$ is the network size).
This is an exponential improvement compared to the scheme which assigns each
request to the nearest available replica. Interestingly, the extra
communication cost incurred by our proposed scheme, compared to the nearest

the trade-off trend does not depend on the network topology and library

properties, e.g. electronic bandgap, in two-dimensional materials. However,
tuning magnetic proper-ties in these materials is yet to be addressed. Here, we
found a striped antiferromag-netic (sAFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition
undergoing from monolayer to bilayer and thicker CrS2. This transition is
attributed to charge sharing of interlayer S atoms and its resulting charge
transfer from Cr d eg to t2g orbitals. The transferred charge reduces a portion
of Cr4+ to Cr3+, which enhances the double-exchange mechanism favoring FM
rather than sAFM ordering. Doping of electrons shares the same effect with
stacking induced charge sharing. Therefore, charge doping could either
manip-ulate the magnetic ordering between sAFM and FM or tune CrS2 between p-
and n-doped magnetic semiconductors. We also proposed several prototype devices
ena-bling to use external electric field for manipulating magnetic orderings of
CrS2 layers. These results manifest the role of interlayer coupling in
modifying magnetic proper-ties of layered materials

Lewittes' bound preceded the Geil-Matsumoto bound and it only considers the

Geil-Matsumoto bound and so it is weaker. However, for general semigroups the
Geil-Matsumoto bound does not have a closed formula and it may be hard to

The topology of these networks often plays a crucial role in determining the

Consequently, growing a stable network having a certain desired topology is of
interest. Motivated by this, we study the following important problem: given a
certain desired topology, under what conditions would best response link
alteration strategies adopted by strategic agents, uniquely lead to formation
of a stable network having the given topology. This problem is the inverse of
the classical network formation problem where we are concerned with determining
stable topologies, given the conditions on the network parameters. We study
this interesting inverse problem by proposing (1) a recursive model of network
formation and (2) a utility model that captures key determinants of network
formation. Building upon these models, we explore relevant topologies such as
star graph, complete graph, bipartite Turan graph, and multiple stars with
interconnected centers. We derive a set of sufficient conditions under which
these topologies uniquely emerge, study their social welfare properties, and
investigate the effects of deviating from the derived conditions.

applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and

smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other
sensors by just accessing the generic sensor API. In this way, attackers can
exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they can extract or leak users'
sensitive information, transfer malware, or record or steal sensitive
information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a
context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart
devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and
creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of
sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection
mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT) to detect malicious
behavior associated with sensors. We implemented 6thSense on a sensor-rich
Android smart device (i.e., smartphone) and collected data from typical daily
activities of 50 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of
6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be
triggered via a sensor (e.g., light), (2) a malicious App that can leak
information via a sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using
sensors. Our extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an
effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an
accuracy above 96% without compromising the normal functionality of the device.
Moreover, our framework costs minimal overhead.

approximation of the solution of a system of nonlinear parameter-dependent
equations. The proposed strategy relies on a Newton-like iterative solver which
only requires evaluations of the residual of the parameter-dependent equation
and of a preconditioner (such as the differential of the residual) for
instances of the parameters independently. The algorithm provides an
approximation of the set of solutions associated with a possibly large number
of instances of the parameters, with a computational complexity which can be
orders of magnitude lower than when using the same Newton-like solver for all
instances of the parameters. The reduction of complexity requires efficient
strategies for obtaining low-rank approximations of the residual, of the
preconditioner, and of the increment at each iteration of the algorithm. For
the approximation of the residual and the preconditioner, weakly intrusive
variants of the empirical interpolation method are introduced, which require
evaluations of entries of the residual and the preconditioner. Then, an
approximation of the increment is obtained by using a greedy algorithm for
low-rank approximation, and a low-rank approximation of the iterate is finally
obtained by using a truncated singular value decomposition. When the
preconditioner is the differential of the residual, the proposed algorithm is
interpreted as an inexact Newton solver for which a detailed convergence
analysis is provided. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the
method.

parameterization is questionable when it is used beyond the range of the data
to which it was tuned. Using uncertainty analysis, it is shown that a
relativistic Three-Dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger (LS3D) equation model based
on Multiple Scattering Theory (MST) that uses 5 parameterizations---3
fundamental parameterizations to nucleon-nucleon (NN) data and 2 nuclear charge
density parameterizations---predicts NA and AA reaction cross sections as well
as the Tripathi cross section parameterization for reactions in which the
kinetic energy of the projectile in the laboratory frame ($T_{\rm Lab}$) is
greater than 220 MeV/n. The relativistic LS3D model has the additional
advantage of being able to predict highly accurate total and elastic cross
sections. Consequently, it is recommended that the relativistic LS3D model be
used for space radiation applications in which $T_{\rm Lab}>$ 220 MeV/n.

models as non-perturbative and exactly solvable reference systems which are
essential to treat the strong electronic correlations. Through the introduction
of retarded interactions on the impurity, these approximations can be made
two-particle self-consistent. This is of interest for the Hubbard model,
because it allows to suppress the antiferromagnetic phase transition in
two-dimensions in accordance with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and to include the
effects of bosonic fluctuations. For a physically sound description of the
latter, the approximation should be conserving. In this paper we show that the
mutual requirements of two-particle self-consistency and conservation lead to
fundamental problems. For an approximation that is two-particle self-consistent
in the charge- and longitudinal spin channel, the double occupancy of the
lattice and the impurity are no longer consistent when computed from
single-particle properties. For the case of self-consistency in the charge- and
longitudinal as well as transversal spin channels, these requirements are even
mutually exclusive so that no conserving approximation can exist. We illustrate
these findings for a two-particle self-consistent and conserving DMFT
approximation.

high-field (> 10 T) magnets. This article briefly reviews development of Nb3Sn
superconductor and proposes prospects for further improvement. It is shown that
significant improvement of critical current density (Jc) is needed for future
accelerator magnets. After a brief review of the development of Nb3Sn
superconductors, the factors controlling Jc are summarized and correlated with
their microstructure and chemistry. The non-matrix Jc of Nb3Sn conductors is
mainly determined by three factors: the fraction of current-carrying Nb3Sn
phase in the non-matrix area, the upper critical field Bc2, and the flux-line
pinning capacity. Then prospects to improve the three factors are discussed
respectively. An analytic model was developed to show how the ratios of
precursors determine the phase fractions after heat treatment, based on which
it is predicted that the limit of current-carrying Nb3Sn fraction in
subelements is ~65%. Then, since Bc2 is largely determined by the Nb3Sn
stoichiometry, a thermodynamic/kinetic theory was presented to show what
essentially determines the Sn content of Nb3Sn conductors. This theory explains
the influences of Sn sources and Ti addition on stoichiometry and growth rate
of Nb3Sn layers. Next, to improve flux pinning, previous efforts in this
community to introduce additional pinning centers (APC) to Nb3Sn wires are
reviewed, and an internal oxidation technique is described. Finally, prospects
for further improvement of non-matrix Jc of Nb3Sn conductors are discussed, and
it is seen that the only opportunity for further significantly improving Jc
lies in improving the flux pinning.

of the elements of the initial series or lose all of their available capital.
This sequence was simulated multiple times to determine the statistical

possible to discern the probable outcomes of running the system using the

very consistent linear returns. However, there is eventually a critical moment

analyzed over short and long times in local dephasing channels for special

thermal states. The continuous distribution of frequency modes of the bosonic
bath exhibits a spectral gap over low frequencies. The bath energy shows
oscillatory behaviors around the asymptotic value and information is
alternatively lost and gained by the open system. Due to the low-frequency gap,
the damped oscillations become regular over long times and the frequency of the

Sequences of long-time intervals are obtained over which the bath energy

financial time series exhibit short-range correlations. This entails that the
volatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay
at the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the
volatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the
price impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with
that associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.
This reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the
good fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting
Markov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical
results regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of
models for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov
volatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of
fractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes
discussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small

theoretical studies this process has previously been demonstrated to have a

not yet been characterized in the solid state. We use a deuterium UV lamp
filtered by a sapphire window to selectively dissociate O2 within a mixture of
O2:CH4 and observe efficient production of CH3OH via O(1D) insertion. CH3OH
growth curves are fit with a kinetic model, and we observe no temperature
dependence of the reaction rate constant at temperatures below the oxygen
desorption temperature of 25K. Through an analysis of side products we
determine the branching ratio of ice-phase oxygen insertion into CH4: ~65% of
insertions lead to CH3OH with the remainder leading instead to H2CO formation.
There is no evidence for CH3 or OH radical formation, indicating that the
fragmentation is not an important channel and that insertions typically lead to
increased chemical complexity. CH3OH formation from O2 and CH4 diluted in a
CO-dominated ice similarly shows no temperature dependence, consistent with
expectations that insertion proceeds with a small or non-existent barrier.
Oxygen insertion chemistry in ices should therefore be efficient under

play a central role in various biological processes, including chromosome
segregation. A prominent example is the large ParB-DNA complex, which forms an
essential component of the segregation machinery in many bacteria. ChIP-Seq
experiments show that ParB proteins localize around centromere-like parS sites
on the DNA to which ParB binds specifically, and spreads from there over large
sections of the chromosome. Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest
that DNA-bound ParB proteins can interact with each other to condense into a
coherent 3D complex on the DNA. However, the structural organization of this
protein-DNA complex remains unclear, and a predictive quantitative theory for
the distribution of ParB proteins on DNA is lacking. Here, we propose the
Looping and Clustering (LC) model, which employs a statistical physics approach
to describe protein-DNA complexes. The LC model accounts for the extrusion of
DNA loops from a cluster of interacting DNA-bound proteins. Conceptually, the
structure of the protein-DNA complex is determined by a competition between
attractive protein interactions and the configurational and loop entropy of
this protein-DNA cluster. Indeed, we show that the protein interaction strength
determines the ""tightness"" of the loopy protein-DNA complex. With this approach
we consider the genomic organization of such a protein-DNA cluster around a
single high-affinity binding site. Thus, our model provides a theoretical
framework to quantitatively compute the binding profiles of ParB-like proteins

lineage-specific processes. However, few computational researches predict
drug-disease potential relationships based on miRNA data and tissue
specificity. Therefore, based on miRNA data and the tissue specificity of
diseases, we propose a new method named as miTS to predict the potential
treatments for diseases. Firstly, based on miRNAs data, target genes and
information of FDA approved drugs, we evaluate the relationships between miRNAs
and drugs in the tissue-specific PPI network. Then, we construct a tripartite
network: drug-miRNA-disease Finally, we obtain the potential drug-disease
associations based on the tripartite network. In this paper, we take breast
cancer as case study and focus on the top-30 predicted drugs. 25 of them
(83.3%) are found having known connections with breast cancer in CTD benchmark
and the other 5 drugs are potential drugs for breast cancer. We further
evaluate the 5 newly predicted drugs from clinical records, literature mining,
KEGG pathways enrichment analysis and overlapping genes between enriched
pathways. For each of the 5 new drugs, strongly supported evidences can be
found in three or more aspects. In particular, Regorafenib has 15 overlapping
KEGG pathways with breast cancer and their p-values are all very small. In
addition, whether in the literature curation or clinical validation,
Regorafenib has a strong correlation with breast cancer. All the facts show
that Regorafenib is likely to be a truly effective drug, worthy of our further
study. It further follows that our method miTS is effective and practical for
predicting new drug indications.
