object of study particularly in the case when $X$ is a manifold.The study of
free loop spaces is motivated in particular by two main examples. The first is
their relation to geometrically distinct periodic geodesics on a manifold,
originally studied by Gromoll and Meyer in $1969$. More recently the study of
string topology and in particular the Chas-Sullivan loop product has been an
active area of research.
  A complete flag manifold is the quotient of a Lie group by its maximal torus
and is one of the nicer examples of a homogeneous space. Both the cohomology
and Chas-Sullivan product structure are understood for spaces $S^n$,
$\mathbb{C}P^n$ and most simple Lie groups. Hence studying the topology of the
free loops space on homogeneous space is a natural next step.
  In the thesis we compute the differentials in the integral Leray-Serre
spectral sequence associated to the free loops space fibrations in the cases of
$SU(n+1)/T^n$ and $Sp(n)/T^n$. Study in detail the structure of the third page
of the spectral sequence in the case of $SU(n)$ and give the module structure

simulating fluid flows, however its ability to simulate evaporating flow
requires significant improvements. This paper proposes an SPH method for
evaporating multiphase flows. The present SPH method can simulate the heat and
mass transfers across the liquid-gas interfaces. The conservation equations of
mass, momentum and energy were reformulated based on SPH, then were used to
govern the fluid flow and heat transfer in both the liquid and gas phases. The
continuity equation of the vapor species was employed to simulate the vapor
mass fraction in the gas phase. The vapor mass fraction at the interface was
predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron correlation. A new evaporation rate was
derived to predict the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase at
the interface. Because of the mass transfer across the liquid-gas interface,
the mass of an SPH particle was allowed to change. New particle splitting and
merging techniques were developed to avoid large mass difference between SPH
particles of the same phase. The proposed method was tested by simulating three
problems, including the Stefan problem, evaporation of a static drop, and
evaporation of a drop impacting on a hot surface. For the Stefan problem, the
SPH results of the evaporation rate at the interface agreed well with the
analytical solution. For drop evaporation, the SPH result was compared with the
result predicted by a level-set method from literature. In the case of drop
impact on a hot surface, the evolution of the shape of the drop, temperature,

  Both theoretical and numerical properties of the method are analyzed. The
theoretical result guarantees that, under the degree corrected stochastic block

extend beyond conventional temporal interferometry, which leverages the
relative delay between the two arms of an interferometer, to arbitrary degrees

generalized delay, that is, a practically realizable unitary transformation for
which the basis elements are eigenfunctions. Under the proposed model, the
interferometric measurements are shown to be linear in the basis coefficients,
thereby enabling efficient and fast recovery of the desired information. While
the corresponding linear transformation has only a limited number of degrees of
freedom set by the structure of the interferometer giving rise to a highly
constrained sensing structure, we show that the problem of signal recovery from
such measurements can still be carried out compressively. This signifies
significant reduction in sample complexity without introducing any additional
randomization as is typically done in prior work leveraging compressive sensing
techniques. We provide performance guarantees under constrained sensing by
proving that the transformation satisfies sufficient conditions for successful
reconstruction of sparse signals using concentration arguments. We showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach using simulation results, as well as
actual experimental results in the context of optical modal analysis of spatial
beams.

Its protection is essential. Plausible deniability of stored data allows
individuals to deny that their device contains a piece of sensitive

as a cosmic microscope of the lens imperfections. The diverging magnification
of lensing caustics enhances the microlensing effect of substructure present
within the lensing mass. Fine-scale structure can be accessed as a moving
background source brightens and disappears when crossing these caustics. The
recent recognition of a distant lensed star near the Einstein radius of the
galaxy cluster MACSJ1149.5+2223 (Kelly et al. 2017) allows the rare opportunity
to reach subsolar mass microlensing through a super-critical column of cluster

simulations that include stellar microlensing set by the observed intracluster
starlight and also primordial black holes that may be responsible for the
recently observed LIGO events. We explore different scenarios with microlenses
from the intracluster medium and black holes, including primordial ones, and
examine strategies to exploit these unique alignments. We find that the best
constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter in the small-mass regime can
be obtained in regions of the cluster where the intracluster medium plays a
negligible role. This new lensing phenomenon should be widespread and can be
detected within modest-redshift lensed galaxies so that the luminosity distance
is not prohibitive for detecting individual magnified stars. Continuous {\it

rewarded by an unprecedented mass spectrum of compact objects that can
contribute to uncovering the nature of dark matter.

sinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking
is the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the
lithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust
and lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk
composition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building
elements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy.
We present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary
differentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and
show that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances
control a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived,
melt-extracted crusts that sink. Those planets forming with a higher
concentration of Si and Na abundances are less likely to undergo sustained
tectonics compared to the Earth. We find only 1/3 of the range of stellar
compositions observed in the Galaxy is likely to host planets able to sustain
density-driven tectonics compared to the Sun/Earth. Systems outside of this
compositional range are less likely to produce planets able to tectonically
regulate their climate and may be inhospitable to life as we know it.

Recently, vector quantization methods have shown great promise in reducing both
the time and space costs of operating on vectors. We introduce a vector
quantization algorithm that can compress vectors over 12x faster than existing
techniques while also accelerating approximate vector operations such as
distance and dot product computations by up to 10x. Because it can encode over
2GB of vectors per second, it makes vector quantization cheap enough to employ
in many more circumstances. For example, using our technique to compute
approximate dot products in a nested loop can multiply matrices faster than a
state-of-the-art BLAS implementation, even when our algorithm must first
compress the matrices.
  In addition to showing the above speedups, we demonstrate that our approach
can accelerate nearest neighbor search and maximum inner product search by over
100x compared to floating point operations and up to 10x compared to other
vector quantization methods. Our approximate Euclidean distance and dot product
computations are not only faster than those of related algorithms with slower
encodings, but also faster than Hamming distance computations, which have
direct hardware support on the tested platforms. We also assess the errors of
our algorithm's approximate distances and dot products, and find that it is
competitive with existing, slower vector quantization algorithms.

survey offers measurements on sub-degree angular scales (multipoles $650 \leq

the Planck data. Here we build on the recent joint analysis of the SPT-SZ and
Planck data in \citet{hou17} by comparing LCDM parameter estimates using the
temperature power spectrum from both data sets in the SPT-SZ survey region. We
also restrict the multipole range used in parameter fitting to focus on modes
measured well by both SPT and Planck, thereby greatly reducing sample variance
as a driver of parameter differences and creating a stringent test for
systematic errors. We find no evidence of systematic errors from such tests.
When we expand the maximum multipole of SPT data used, we see low-significance
shifts in the angular scale of the sound horizon and the physical baryon and
cold dark matter densities, with a resulting trend to higher Hubble constant.
When we compare SPT and Planck data on the SPT-SZ sky patch to Planck full-sky
data but keep the multipole range restricted, we find differences in the
parameters $n_s$ and $A_se^{-2\tau}$. We perform further checks, investigating
instrumental effects and modeling assumptions, and we find no evidence that the
effects investigated are responsible for any of the parameter shifts. Taken
together, these tests reveal no evidence for systematic errors in SPT or Planck
data in the overlapping sky coverage and multipole range and, at most, weak
evidence for a breakdown of LCDM or systematic errors influencing either the
Planck data outside the SPT-SZ survey area or the SPT data at $\ell >2000$.

balance, and a conduit must be found to channel the energy to the small scales
where it can be dissipated. In turbulence this takes the form of an energy
cascade, whereas one possible mechanism in a balanced flow at large scales is
through the formation of fronts, a common occurrence in geophysical dynamics.
We show in this paper that an iconic configuration in laboratory and numerical
experiments for the study of turbulence, that of the Taylor-Green or von
K\'arm\'an swirling flow, can be suitably adapted to the case of fluids with
large aspect ratios, leading to the creation of an imposed large-scale vertical
shear. To this effect we use direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq
equations without net rotation and with no small-scale modeling, and with this
idealized Taylor-Green set-up. Various grid spacings are used, up to
$2048^2\times 256$ spatial points. The grids are always isotropic, with box
aspect ratios of either $1:4$ or $1:8$. We find that when shear and
stratification are comparable, the imposed shear layer resulting from the
forcing leads to the formation of multiple fronts and filaments which
destabilize and further evolve into a turbulent flow in the bulk, with a
sizable amount of dissipation and mixing, and with a cycle of front creation,
instability, and development of turbulence. The results depend on the vertical
length scales for shear and for stratification, with stronger large-scale
gradients being generated when the two length scales are comparable.

constrain the allowed amplitude of the primordial power spectrum on both the
smallest and the largest ranges of scales, covering over 20 decades from
$1-10^{20}/ \rm{Mpc}$. Despite tight constraints on the allowed fraction of
PBHs at their time of formation near horizon entry in the early universe, the
corresponding constraints on the primordial power spectrum are quite weak,
typically ${\cal P}_\mathcal{R}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ assuming Gaussian
perturbations. Motivated by recent claims that the evaporation of just one PBH
would destabilise the Higgs vacuum and collapse the universe, we calculate the
constraints which follow from assuming there are zero PBHs within the
observable universe. This extends the constraints right down to the horizon
scale at the end of inflation, but does not significantly tighten the existing
power spectrum constraints, even though the constraint on PBH abundance can
decrease by up to 46 orders of magnitude. This shows that no future improvement
in observational constraints can ever lead to a significant tightening in
constraints on inflation (via the power spectrum amplitude). The power spectrum
constraints are weak because an order unity perturbation is required in order
to overcome pressure forces. We therefore consider an early matter dominated
era, during which exponentially more PBHs form for the same initial conditions.
We show this leads to far tighter constraints, which approach ${\cal
P}_\mathcal{R}\lesssim10^{-9}$, albeit over a smaller range of scales and are
very sensitive to when the early matter dominated era ends. Finally, we show
that an extended early matter era is incompatible with the argument that an
evaporating PBH would destroy the universe, unless the power spectrum amplitude
decreases by up to ten orders of magnitude.

requires the existence of high-fidelity communication coverage. However, the
wireless networks along the roads especially in rural areas can range from 4G

perspective, transport during critical illness can make route selection patient
state dependent. Prompt decisions with the relative advantage of a longer more

less secure bandwidth must be made. The trade-off between route selection and
the quality of wireless communication is an important optimization problem

users of Tor or other secure-communication networks. We argue that attacks by
such adversaries are more realistic and more significant threats to those most
relying on Tor's protection than are attacks in prior analyses of Tor security.
Previous research and Tor design decisions have focused on protecting against
adversaries who are equally interested in any user of the network. Our
adversaries selectively target users---e.g., those who visit a particular
website or chat on a particular private channel---and essentially disregard Tor
users other than these. We present a model of such adversaries and investigate
three example cases where particular users might be targeted: a cabal
conducting meetings using MTor, a published Tor multicast protocol; a cabal
meeting on a private IRC channel; and users visiting a particular .onion
website. In general for our adversaries, compromise is much faster and provides
more feedback and possibilities for adaptation than do attacks examined in
prior work. We also discuss selection of websites for targeting of their users
based on the distribution across users of site activity. We describe
adversaries both attempting to learn the size of a cabal meeting online or of a
set of sufficiently active visitors to a targeted site and attempting to
identify guards of each targeted user. We compare the threat of targeting
adversaries versus previously considered adversaries, and we briefly sketch
possible countermeasures for resisting targeting adversaries.

widespread use in many applications. Depending on the condition of saturation,
which is easy to adjust, different dynamical phenomena are observed: continuous
wave emission, stable oscillations, period doubling bifurcations, chaos and, in
some chaotic regimes, extreme events in the form of pulses of extraordinary
intensity. These pulses are also sometimes called ""dissipative optical rogue
waves"". The mechanism of their formation is still unknown. Here, we report the
direct observation of the pulse-to-pulse evolution of the transverse pattern
with an ultrafast camera (up to 60,000 frames per second). A specific pattern
is correlated with the pulse intensity in the periodical regimes. In the
chaotic regimes, the extreme events are correlated with some patterns. The
series of patterns before and after an extreme event are often the same. These
observations demonstrate that extreme events in this system are the consequence
of the deterministic nonlinear interaction of few modes. This information plays
a crucial role in the development of a theoretical model able to describe the
mechanism giving raise to extreme events. The model is expected to lead to the
control of their formation at will, what is of practical interest.

produces light curves with numerous peaks. Using analytical calculations and
numerical simulations, we derive the characteristic width of the network,
caustic-crossing frequencies, and peak magnifications. For the lens parameters

mechanics, as they fail to equilibrate under their own quantum dynamics. Even
basic features of MBL systems such as their stability to thermal inclusions and
the nature of the dynamical transition to thermalizing behavior remain poorly
understood. We study a simple model to address these questions: a two level
system interacting with strength $J$ with $N\gg 1$ localized bits subject to
random fields. On increasing $J$, the system transitions from a MBL to a
delocalized phase on the \emph{vanishing} scale $J_c(N) \sim 1/N$, up to
logarithmic corrections. In the transition region, the single-site eigenstate
entanglement entropies exhibit bi-modal distributions, so that localized bits
are either ""on"" (strongly entangled) or ""off"" (weakly entangled) in
eigenstates. The clusters of ""on"" bits vary significantly between eigenstates
of the \emph{same} sample, which provides evidence for a heterogenous
discontinuous transition out of the localized phase in single-site observables.
We obtain these results by perturbative mapping to bond percolation on the
hypercube at small $J$ and by numerical exact diagonalization of the full
many-body system. Our results imply the MBL phase is unstable in systems with
short-range interactions and quenched randomness in dimensions $d$ that are
high but finite.

Therefore, we conclude that single dish observations do not allow us to
investigate grain growth toward the pre-stellar core L1544 and high sensitivity
interferometer observations are needed. We predict that dust grains can grow to
200 $\mu$m in size toward the central ~300 au of L1544. This will imply a dust
opacity change by a factor of ~2.5 at 1.2 mm, which can be detected using the

cosmic microwave background (CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level,
indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation
depending on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the
tails of the likelihoods. Determining the form of the tails of the local $H_0$
likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully
represent anchor likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova
(SN) populations, and simultaneous fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset
to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical
model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any
distributions being Gaussian, allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the
need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the $\sim$3000-parameter joint
posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$ 1.67)
${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al.

outliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the
distance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model comparison to
assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison
to yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM
given the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against
$\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers
are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI (2016)

excitations for a system of bosons coupled to the electromagnetic field of two
optical cavities. For the specific configuration realized in a recent
experiment at ETH, we show that, in absence of direct intercavity scattering
and for parameters chosen such that the atoms couple symmetrically to both
cavities, the system possesses an approximate $U(1)$ symmetry which holds
asymptotically for vanishing cavity field intensity. It corresponds to the
invariance with respect to redistributing the total intensity $I=I_1+I_2$
between the two cavities. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry gives rise
to a broken continuous translation-invariance for the atoms, creating a
supersolid-like order in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate. In
particular, we show that atom-mediated scattering between the two cavities,
which favors the state with equal light intensities $I_1=I_2$ and reduces the
symmetry to $\mathbf{Z}_2\otimes \mathbf{Z}_2$, gives rise to a finite value
$\sim \sqrt{I}$ of the effective Goldstone mass. For strong atom driving, this
low energy mode is clearly separated from an effective Higgs excitation
associated with changes of the total intensity $I$. In addition, we compute the
spectral distribution of the cavity light field and show that both the Higgs
and Goldstone mode acquire a finite lifetime due to Landau damping at non-zero
temperature.

determine projections of functions onto spaces of polynomials. It has been
shown that, using an optimal distribution of sample locations, the number of
samples required to achieve quasi-optimal approximation in a given polynomial
subspace scales, up to a logarithmic factor, linearly in the dimension of this
space. However, in many applications, the computation of samples includes a
numerical discretization error. Thus, obtaining polynomial approximations with
a single level method can become prohibitively expensive, as it requires a
sufficiently large number of samples, each computed with a sufficiently small

method that utilizes samples computed with different accuracies and is able to
match the accuracy of single-level approximations with reduced computational

  Integrator Dynamics","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.OC math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, distributed convex optimization problem over non-directed
dynamical networks is studied. Here, networked agents with single-integrator
dynamics are supposed to rendezvous at a point that is the solution of a global
convex optimization problem with some local inequality constraints. To this
end, all agents shall cooperate with their neighbors to seek the optimum point
of the networks global objective function. A distributed optimization algorithm
based on the interior-point method is proposed, which combines an optimization
algorithm with a nonlinear consensus protocol to find the optimum value of the
global objective function. We tackle this problem by addressing its
sub-problems, namely a consensus problem and a convex optimization problem.
Firstly, we propose a saturation protocol for the consensus sub-problem. Then
to solve the distributed optimization part, we implement a centralized control
law, which yields the optimum value of the global objective function, in a
distributed fashion with the help of a distributed estimator. Convergence
analysis for the proposed protocol based on the stability theory for
time-varying nonlinear systems is included. A simulation example is given at
the end to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

limit their scalability: straggler delay caused by the variability of
computation times at different worker nodes and communication bottlenecks
caused by shuffling data across many nodes in the network. Recently, it has
been shown that codes can provide significant gains in overcoming these
bottlenecks. In particular, optimal coding schemes for minimizing latency in
distributed computation of linear functions and mitigating the effect of
stragglers was proposed for a wired network, where the workers can
simultaneously transmit messages to a master node without interference. In this
paper, we focus on the problem of coded computation over a wireless
master-worker setup with straggling workers, where only one worker can transmit
the result of its local computation back to the master at a time. We consider 3
asymptotic regimes (determined by how the communication and computation times
are scaled with the number of workers) and precisely characterize the total
run-time of the distributed algorithm and optimum coding strategy in each
regime. In particular, for the regime of practical interest where the
computation and communication times of the distributed computing algorithm are
comparable, we show that the total run-time approaches a simple lower bound
that decouples computation and communication, and demonstrate that coded
schemes are $\Theta(\log(n))$ times faster than uncoded schemes.

simplified to a first order one, with the aid of the two critical

extensively for quantum information applications due to their flexibility,
room-temperature operation and potential for photonic integration. However, the
intrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is a major limitation for
realizing large-scale quantum networks. Active feedforward switching of photons
from multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach that can be used to
build a deterministic source. However, previous implementations of this
approach that utilize spatial and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly
increasing switching losses when scaled to a large number of modes. Here, we
break this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses
remain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order
nonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient
ultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three
frequency modes. We achieve a record generation rate of $4.6\times10^4$
multiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low $g^{2}(0)$ = 0.07, indicating
high single-photon purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a
total loss of just 1.3 dB independent of the number of multiplexed modes, such
that the 4.8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly
overcomes switching loss. Our approach offers a highly promising path to
creating a deterministic photon source that can be integrated on a chip-based
platform.

regime are discussed based on rigorous Bloch-Floquet theory. A geometrical
description in the frequency-wavenumber plane is developed to provide insight
into the possible interactions and their nature. It is shown that the secular
equation has a singularity, which results in a weak/passive second harmonic
generation process. Additionally bandgaps arising from the strong/active
parametric interaction between an incident wave and its space-time harmonic,
result in an inelastic Brillouin like scattering process. Hence when the
incident frequency is inside a forward (backward) bandgap, a Stokes'
(Anti-Stokes') scattered wave bounces back to the source. Although the forward
and backward bandgaps do not generally occur at the same frequency bands, the
insertion loss and gap width are equal. Requiring that both gaps do not
overlap, enforces a lower bound on the modulation speed. It is shown that
although an increase in the modulation index is desirable, as it enhances the
non-reciprocal behaviour, it also limits the range of possible modulation
speeds. The effective complex refractive index is calculated over a wide
frequency range. It is shown that peaks appear in the extinction coefficient,
indicating scattering to Stokes' and Anti-Stokes' waves. Finally, a

detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world. Deep
learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using
camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical
application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state
of the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the
characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing
on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without
additional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to
identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show
that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar
images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections)
and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary
classifier can be used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two
distinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data that are
readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any
camera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of
real world data. We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our
classifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI

tracking dataset with 104 sequences totaling 80,655 labeled pairs of stereo

observed in 1054 A.D. When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has an
anomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapse
SN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves this
discrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054
is an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an order
of magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches were
performed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set a
stringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extreme
brightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employed
spectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomi
satellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limit
for emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the
2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.
By assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-ray
plasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, and
plasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To compare
with the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the Crab
SNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniform
ISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can be
compatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~
0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or a
progenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of
10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.

have composite substructure. The existence of excited quarks is going to be the
noticeable proof for the compositeness of Standard Model fermions. For this
reason, excited quarks have been investigated by phenomenological and
experimental high energy physicists at various collider options for the last
few decades. The Future Circular Collider (FCC) has been recently planned as
particle accelerator to be established at CERN. Beside the $\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV
proton-proton collisions, the FCC includes electron-positron and
electron-proton collision options. Construction of linear $e^- e^+$ colliders
(or dedicated e-linac) tangential to the FCC will afford an opportunity to
handle multi-TeV $ep$ and $\gamma p$ collisions. In this respect, we executed a
simulation of the resonance production of the excited $u$ quark at the FCC
based $\gamma p$ colliders with choosing both the polarized and unpolarized
photon beams. The findings revealed that the chirality structure of the
$q^*$-$q$-$\gamma$ vertex can be determined by the photon beam polarization.
The attainable mass limits of the excited $u$ quark reached the highest values
when the polarized photon beam was chosen. In addition, the ultimate
compositeness scale values can be handled by appropriate choice of the photon
beam polarization.

partonic and hadronic dof and describes the full dynamics of HICs. This allows
to study the $K^*$ and $\bar{K}^*$ meson formation from the QGP and the
in-medium effects related to the modification of their properties during the
propagation in dense and hot matter. We employ relativistic Breit-Wigner
spectral functions for the $K^*,\bar{K}^*$ mesons with self-energies obtained
from a G-matrix approach to study the role of in-medium effects on the $K^*$
and $\bar{K}^*$ meson dynamics in HIC from FAIR/NICA to LHC energies. According
to our analysis most of the final $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s, that can be observed
experimentally, are produced during the late hadronic phase and stem dominantly
from the $K (\bar{K}) + \pi \to K^*(\bar{K}^*)$ formation channel. The amount
of $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s originating from the QGP channel is comparatively small
even at LHC energies and such $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s can hardly be reconstructed
experimentally due to the rescattering of final pions and (anti-)kaons. This
mirrors the results from our previous study on the strange vector-meson
production in HICs at RHIC energies. The influence of the in-medium effects on
the dynamics of the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$ is rather small since they are mostly
produced at low baryon densities. Additional cuts on the shape of the observed
signal and the range of the invariant mass region of the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$ also
affect the final spectra. We demonstrate that the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$ in-medium
effects are more visible at lower beam energy, e.g. FAIR/NICA and BES RHIC
energies, where the production of $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s occurs at larger baryon
densities. Finally, we present the experimental procedures to extract
information on the in-medium masses and widths by fitting final mass spectra at

spin background, concerns the charge excitation. In a two-leg spin ladder with
spin gap, an injected hole can exhibit either a Bloch wave or a density wave by
tuning the ladder anisotropy through a `quantum critical point' (QCP). The
nature of such a QCP has been a subject of recent studies by density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG). In this paper, we reexamine the ground state of
the one doped hole, and show that a two-component structure is present in the
density wave regime in contrast to the single component in the Bloch wave
regime. In the former, the density wave itself is still contributed by a
standing-wave-like component characterized by a quasiparticle spectral weight
$Z$ in a finite-size system. But there is an additional charge incoherent
component emerging, which intrinsically breaks the translational symmetry
associated with the density wave. The partial momentum is carried away by
neutral spin excitations. Such an incoherent part does not manifest in the
single-particle spectral function, directly probed by the angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement, however it is demonstrated in
the momentum distribution function. The Landau's one-to-one correspondence
hypothesis for a Fermi liquid breaks down here. The microscopic origin of this
density wave state as an intrinsic manifestation of the doped Mott physics will
be also discussed.

the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural
network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial
training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting
results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models,
and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of
fairness.

the presence of the hidden message cannot be detected. Beyond the standard
scope of private-key steganography, steganography is also potentially
interesting from other perspectives; for example, the prospect of
steganographic parallels to components in public-key cryptography is
particularly interesting. In this project, I begin with an exploration of
public-key steganography, and I continue by condensing existing work into a
unifying design paradigm that (a) admits provably secret public- and
private-key constructions and (b) provides for a conceptual decoupling of
channel considerations and steganographic goals, ultimately implying both
universal constructions and constructions with channel-specific optimizations.
  This work is by-and-large a survey of applications of this paradigm:
specifically, I use the framework to achieve provably secure distributed
steganography, obtain new public-key steganographic constructions using
alternative assumptions, and give discussion of channel-specific optimizations
allowed by cryptography as a channel and natural language channels and
challenges facing practical deployment of steganographic systems at scale.

assumption that P is not equal to NP has eluded cryptographers due to lack of
results showing average-case hardness, one alternative which has been explored
is reliance on assumptions that solving certain NP-hard optimization problems
within some degree of accuracy is computationally difficult in specific
instance classes. In this work, we explore one such example of this effort
which attempts to provide cryptographic primitives by relying on the planted
clique conjecture. More specifically, we (1) present this construction in
summary, (2) propose a simple cryptanalytic method using only approximation
algorithms, and (3) consider the feasibility of such cryptanalysis in the
context of existing approximation algorithms for the maximum clique problem. We
ultimately find that recent advances in the area of combinatoric approximation
algorithms fatally hinders the prospect of any serious application of existing
candidate constructions based upon the planted clique conjecture.

  The proposed approach is based on local embedding projection of distributed

English translation using Neural Machine Translation. We show that the

problem} and explore a potential solution in the form of what we call
corpus-compressed streaming schemes.
  Inspired by the problem of constrained bandwidth during use of the popular
Spotify application on mobile networks, the Spotify problem applies in any
number of practical domains where devices may be periodically expected to
experience degraded communication or storage capacity. One obvious solution
candidate which comes to mind immediately is standard compression. Though
obviously applicable, standard compression does not in any way exploit all
characteristics of the problem; in particular, standard compression is
oblivious to the fact that a decoder has a period of virtually unrestrained
communication. Towards applying compression in a manner which attempts to
stretch the benefit of periods of higher communication capacity into periods of
restricted capacity, we introduce as a solution the idea of a corpus-compressed
streaming scheme.
  This report begins with a formal definition of a corpus-compressed streaming
scheme. Following a discussion of how such schemes apply to the Spotify
problem, we then give a survey of specific corpus-compressed scheming schemes
guided by an exploration of different measures of description complexity within
the Chomsky hierarchy of languages.

neutron-capture process (i-process) takes place, as their stellar source. On
the other hand, low-mass CO novae, and early R- and J-type carbon stars show
13C and 14N excesses but no s-process enhancements and are thus potential
stellar sources of AB2 grains. Since both early R-type carbon stars and CO

humans from bots, and then studied the activities of the two groups taken
independently, as well as their interplay. We provide a characterization of
both the bots and the users who engaged with them and oppose it to those users
who didn't. Prior interests of disinformation adopters pinpoint to the reasons
of the scarce success of this campaign: the users who engaged with MacronLeaks
are mostly foreigners with a preexisting interest in alt-right topics and
alternative news media, rather than French users with diverse political views.
Concluding, anomalous account usage patterns suggest the possible existence of
a black-market for reusable political disinformation bots.

is investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the
single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The calculated
room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 18.41 $\mathrm{W m^{-1}
K^{-1}}$ and 34.71 $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ along the in- and cross-plane
directions, exhibiting very strong anisotropy. The isotope and size effects on
the lattice thermal conductivity are also considered. It is found that isotope
scattering produces little effect, and phonon has little contribution to the
lattice thermal conductivity, when phonon mean free path(MFP) is larger than
0.15 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ at 300 K. It is noted that average room-temperature
lattice thermal conductivity of MoP is lower than that of representative Weyl
semimetal TaAs, which is due to smaller group velocities and larger
Gr$\mathrm{\ddot{u}}$neisen parameters. Our works provide valuable informations
for the thermal management of MoP-based nano-electronics devices, and motivate
further experimental works to study thermal transport of MoP.

efficient yet effective offspring deep neural networks over generations,
mimicking evolutionary processes such as heredity, random mutation, and natural
selection in a probabilistic manner. In this study, we primarily explore the
imposition of synaptic precision restrictions and its impact on the
evolutionary synthesis of deep neural networks to synthesize more efficient
network architectures tailored for resource-starved scenarios. Experimental
results show significant improvements in synaptic efficiency (~10X decrease for
GoogLeNet-based DetectNet) and inference speed (>5X increase for
GoogLeNet-based DetectNet) while preserving modeling accuracy.

words, codes are given by sets of words which form a basis of a free submonoid
in the free monoid of all words (over a given alphabet) and local Rees

When the molecule moves faster or slower than both species of atoms, the atomic

caused by small scale inhomogeneities of the universe with the use of the
spatial averaged approach of Buchert. Two models are considered here, one of
which assumes that the backreaction term ${\cal Q}_\CD$ and the averaged
spatial Ricci scalar $\average{\CR}$ obey the scaling laws of the volume scale
factor $a_\CD$ at adequately late times, and the other one adopts the ansatz
that the backreaction term ${\cal Q}_\CD$ is a constant in the recent universe.
Thanks to the effective geometry introduced by Larena et. al. in their previous
work, we confront these two backreaction models with latest type Ia supernova
and Hubble parameter observations, coming out with the results that the
constant backreaction model is slightly favoured over the other model, and
within $1\sigma$ confidence interval of the parameter $n$ in the scaling
backreaction model, $\mid{\cal Q}_\CD\mid$ decreases with the increase of the
volume scale factor $a_\CD$ at adequately late times. Also, the numerical
simulation results show that the constant backreaction model predicts a smaller
expansion rate and decelerated expansion rate than the other model does at
redshifts higher than about 1, and both backreaction terms begin to accelerate
the universe at a redshift around 0.6. In addition, by confronting the standard
cosmological model against the same datasets, we find that the effective
geometry tends to push the constraint toward a smaller cosmological constant
term.

  Variation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a Semantic Attribute Modulation (SAM) for language
modeling and style variation. The semantic attribute modulation includes
various document attributes, such as titles, authors, and document categories.
We consider two types of attributes, (title attributes and category
attributes), and a flexible attribute selection scheme by automatically scoring
them via an attribute attention mechanism. The semantic attributes are embedded
into the hidden semantic space as the generation inputs. With the attributes
properly harnessed, our proposed SAM can generate interpretable texts with
regard to the input attributes. Qualitative analysis, including word semantic
analysis and attention values, shows the interpretability of SAM. On several
typical text datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of the
Semantic Attribute Modulated language model with different combinations of
document attributes. Moreover, we present a style variation for the lyric
generation using SAM, which shows a strong connection between the style
variation and the semantic attributes.

maximizing sum rate for multi-cell networks with load coupling, where coupling
relation occurs among cells due to inter-cell interference. This coupling
relation is characterized by the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR)
coupling model with cell load vector and cell power vector as the variables.
Due to the nonlinear SINR coupling model, the optimization problems for
multi-cell networks with load coupling is nonconvex. To solve these nonconvex
problems, we first consider the optimization problems for single-cell networks.
Through variable transformations, the optimization problems can be equivalently
transformed into convex problems. By solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), the
optimal solutions to power minimization and rate maximization problems can be
obtained in closed form. Based on the theoretical findings of optimization
problems for single-cell networks, we develop a distributed time allocation and
power control algorithm with low complexity for sum power minimization in
multi-cell networks. This algorithm is proved to be convergent and globally
optimal by using the properties of standard interference function. For sum rate
optimization in multi-cell networks, we also provide a distributed algorithm
which yields suboptimal solution. Besides, the convergence for this distributed
algorithm is proved. Numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings,
showing the superiority of our solutions compared to the conventional solution
of allocating uniform power for users in the same cell.

the multidimensional surface describing the energy of the system as a function
of the directions of the magnetic moments in the system. The energy is given by
a Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian that includes Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,
anisotropy and external magnetic field. Local minima on this surface correspond
to the ferromagnetic and skyrmion states. Minimum energy paths (MEP) between
the minima are calculated using the geodesic nudged elastic band method. The
maximum energy along an MEP corresponds to a first order saddle point on the
energy surface and gives an estimate of the activation energy for the magnetic
transition, such as creation and annihilation of a skyrmion. The
pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius law for the rate, the so-called attempt
frequency, is estimated within harmonic transition state theory where the
eigenvalues of the Hessian at the saddle point and the local minima are used to
characterize the shape of the energy surface. For some degrees of freedom,
so-called 'zero modes', the energy of the system remains invariant. They need
to be treated separately and give rise to temperature dependence of the attempt
frequency. As an example application of this general theory, the lifetime of a
skyrmion in a track of finite width for a PdFe overlayer on a Ir(111) substrate
is calculated as a function of track width and external magnetic field. Also,
the effect of non-magnetic impurities is studied. Various MEPs for annihilation
inside a track, via the boundary of a track and at an impurity are presented.
The attempt frequency as well as the activation energy has been calculated for

Firstly, to speed up the learning process, two sample-efficient neural networks
algorithms: trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and
episodic natural actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER) are presented.
For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid
catastrophic model changes. For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the
steepest ascent direction in policy space to speed up the convergence. Both
models employ off-policy learning with experience replay to improve
sample-efficiency. Secondly, to mitigate the cold start issue, a corpus of
demonstration data is utilised to pre-train the models prior to on-line
reinforcement learning. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate a
practical approach to learn deep RL-based dialogue policies and demonstrate
their effectiveness in a task-oriented information seeking domain.

temperature (and therefore velocity) dispersion due to the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect from clusters of galaxies. To suppress the
primary CMB and instrumental noise we derive a matched filter and then convolve
it with the ${\it Planck}$ foreground-cleaned `${\tt 2D-ILC\,}$' maps. By using
the Meta Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC), we determine
the normalized ${\it rms}$ dispersion of the temperature fluctuations at the
positions of clusters, finding that this shows excess variance compared with
the noise expectation. We then build an unbiased statistical estimator of the
signal, determining that the normalized mean temperature dispersion of $1526$
clusters is $\langle \left(\Delta T/T \right)^{2} \rangle = (1.64 \pm 0.48)
\times 10^{-11}$. However, comparison with analytic calculations and
simulations suggest that around $0.7\,\sigma$ of this result is due to cluster
lensing rather than the kSZ effect. By correcting this, the temperature
dispersion is measured to be $\langle \left(\Delta T/T \right)^{2} \rangle =
(1.35 \pm 0.48) \times 10^{-11}$, which gives a detection at the $2.8\,\sigma$
level. We further convert uniform-weight temperature dispersion into a
measurement of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, by using estimates of the
optical depth of each cluster (which introduces additional uncertainty into the
estimate). We find that the velocity dispersion is $\langle v^{2} \rangle
=(123\,000 \pm 71\,000)\,({\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{2}$, which is consistent
with findings from other large-scale structure studies, and provides direct
evidence of statistical homogeneity on scales of $600\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our
study shows the promise of using cross-correlations of the kSZ effect with
large-scale structure in order to constrain the growth of structure.

our method to describe gamma-rays from IC443. As a proxy of the IC443 parent
supernova we consider SN1987A. First, we infer the time dependence of injection
efficiency from evolution of the radio spectral index in SN1987A. Then, we use
the inferred injection behavior to fit the gamma-ray spectrum of IC443. We show
that the break in the proton spectrum needed to explain the gamma-ray emission
is a natural consequence of the early variation of the cosmic ray injection,
and that the very-high energy gamma-rays originate from particles which began
acceleration during the first months after the supernova explosion. We conclude
that the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum observed today in SNRs critically
depends on the time variation of the cosmic ray injection process in the
immediate post explosion phases. With the same model, we estimate also the
possibility in the future to detect gamma-rays from SN 1987A.

emotions are directly affected by the patient health status. In neutral talking
environments, speakers can be easily verified, however, in emotional talking
environments, speakers cannot be easily verified as in neutral talking ones.
Consequently, speaker verification systems do not perform well in emotional
talking environments as they do in neutral talking environments. In this work,
a two-stage approach has been employed and evaluated to improve speaker
verification performance in emotional talking environments. This approach
employs speaker emotion cues (text-independent and emotion-dependent speaker
verification problem) based on both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and
Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) as classifiers. The approach is
comprised of two cascaded stages that combines and integrates emotion
recognizer and speaker recognizer into one recognizer. The architecture has
been tested on two different and separate emotional speech databases: our
collected database and Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts database. The
results of this work show that the proposed approach gives promising results
with a significant improvement over previous studies and other approaches such
as emotion-independent speaker verification approach and emotion-dependent
speaker verification approach based completely on HMMs.

mirrors cross such positions, the effective opto-mechanical potential that
arises in the device is (roughly) at a maximum. We show that the motion cross
such potential maxima is not only confused by the presence of noise, but also
favoured by noise itself that induces hoppings. Thus, the measurements of the
times at which the crossings occur can be exploited to identify the properties
of the applied signal. We also show how to circumvent the difficulty of the
extremely long transient that occur in the system analyzing the escape average

suggest that the indirect estimate, through the analysis of the distribution

workload and influence neurophysiological measures. Psychophysiological
responses to submersible operation are not well known. The main aim of this
study was to investigate changes in EEG and ECG components and subjective
mental stress of pilots during submersible operation. Methods: There were 6
experienced submersible pilots who performed a 3 h submersible operation task
composed of 5 subtasks. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)
was recorded before the operation task, after 1.5 h and 2.5 h operation, and
after the task. Subjective ratings of mental stress were also conducted at
these time points. Results: HR and scores on subjective stressed scale
increased during the task compared to baseline (P<0.05). LF/HF ratio at 1.5 h
were higher than those at Baseline (P<0.05) and 2.5 h (P<0.05). Relative theta
power at the Cz site increased (P<0.01) and relative alpha power decreased
(P<0.01) at 2.5 h compared to values at Baseline. Alpha attenuation coefficient
(AAC, ratio of mean alpha power during eyes closed versus eyes open) at 2.5 h

Conclusions: Submersible operation resulted in an increased HR in association
with mental stress, alterations in autonomic activity and EEG changes that
expressed variations in mental workload. Brain arousal level declined during
the later operation period.

databases and data mining. A scalable ANNS algorithm should be both
memory-efficient and fast. Some early graph-based approaches have shown
attractive theoretical guarantees on search time complexity, but they all
suffer from the problem of high indexing time complexity. Recently, some
graph-based methods have been proposed to reduce indexing complexity by
approximating the traditional graphs; these methods have achieved revolutionary
performance on million-scale datasets. Yet, they still can not scale to
billion-node databases. In this paper, to further improve the search-efficiency
and scalability of graph-based methods, we start by introducing four aspects:
(1) ensuring the connectivity of the graph; (2) lowering the average out-degree
of the graph for fast traversal; (3) shortening the search path; and (4)
reducing the index size. Then, we propose a novel graph structure called
Monotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (MRNG) which guarantees very low search
complexity (close to logarithmic time). To further lower the indexing
complexity and make it practical for billion-node ANNS problems, we propose a
novel graph structure named Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) by
approximating the MRNG. The NSG takes the four aspects into account
simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that NSG outperforms all the
existing algorithms significantly. In addition, NSG shows superior performance
in the E-commercial search scenario of Taobao (Alibaba Group) and has been
integrated into their search engine at billion-node scale.

liquid-drop model that is based on Skyrme interactions for bulk energies and
that takes into account modifications of the surface and Coulomb energies at
finite temperatures and densities. The free-energy density is minimized with
respect to the individual equilibrium densities of all heavy nuclei and the
nuclear composition. We find that their optimized equilibrium densities become
smaller and smaller at high temperatures because of the increase of thermal
contributions to bulk free energies and the reduction of surface energies. The
neutron-rich nuclei become unstable and disappear one after another at some
temperatures. The calculations are performed for two sets of model parameters
leading to different values of the slope parameter in the nuclear symmetry
energy. It is found that the larger slope parameter reduces the equilibrium
densities and the melting temperatures. We also compare the new model with some
other approaches and find that the mass fractions of heavy nuclei in the
previous calculations that omit vaporization are underestimated at $T \lesssim
10$MeV and overestimated at $T\gtrsim10$~MeV. The further sophistication of
calculations of nuclear vaporization and of light clusters would be required to
construct the equation of state for explosive astrophysical phenomena.

invariant under reflexion with respect to all axes, from the odd ones, which
identically vanish in the absence of shear. Our results indicate that the
largest deviation from isotropy comes from the odd component of the third
velocity gradient correlation function, especially from the third moment of the
derivative along the normal direction of the streamwise velocity component. At
the Reynolds numbers considered (R_lambda ~ 140), we observe that these second
and third order correlation functions are significantly larger in turbulent
channel flows than in homogeneous shear flow. Overall, our work demonstrates
that a mean shear leads to relatively simple structure of the velocity gradient
tensor. How isotropy is restored in the very large Reynolds limit remains to be
understood.

  process of coherence degradation",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.96.023817",,"nlin.PS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit the mechanisms underlying the process of spectral broadening of
incoherent optical waves propagating in nonlinear media on the basis of
nonequilibrium thermodynamic considerations. A simple analysis reveals that a
prerequisite for the existence of a significant spectral broadening of the
waves is that the linear part of the energy (Hamiltonian) has different
contributions of opposite signs. It turns out that, at variance with the
expected soliton turbulence scenario, an increase of the amount of disorder
(incoherence) in the system does not require the generation of a coherent
soliton structure. We illustrate the idea by considering the propagation of two
wave components in an optical fiber with opposite dispersion coefficients. A
wave turbulence approach of the problem reveals that the increase of kinetic
energy in one component is offset by the negative reduction in the other
component, so that the waves exhibit, as a general rule, a virtually unlimited
spectral broadening. More precisely, a self-similar solution of the kinetic
equations reveals that the spectra of the incoherent waves tend to relax toward
a homogeneous distribution in the wake of a front that propagates in frequency
space with a decelerating velocity. We discuss this catastrophic process of
spectral broadening in the light of different important phenomena, in
particular supercontinuum generation, soliton turbulence, wave condensation,
and the runaway motion of mechanical systems composed of positive and negative
masses.

The zero of the proton EM form factor ratio in vacuum, the electric to magnetic

which reflects the facts that the faster falloff of $G_{Ep}(Q^2)$ as increasing

is enhanced relative to that in vacuum, while for the proton it is quenched,

(HNI) by constructing two simple effective field theories. These two versions
of the model allow inflationary energy scales as small as the electroweak scale
in one of them or as large as the Grand Unification scale in the other,
therefore covering the whole range of possible energy scales. In any case the
inflationary sector of the model is of the form $V(\phi)=V_0 \left(1+a
\cos(\phi/f)\right)$ where $0\leq a<1$ and the end of inflation is triggered by
an independent waterfall field. One interesting characteristic of this model is
that the slow-roll parameter $\epsilon(\phi)$ is a non-monotonic function of
$\phi$ presenting a {\it maximum} close to the inflection point of the
potential. Because the scalar spectrum $\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ of density
fluctuations when written in terms of the potential is inversely proportional
to $\epsilon(\phi)$ we find that $\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ presents a {\it minimum} at
$\phi_{min}$. The origin of the HNI potential can be traced to a symmetry
breaking phenomenon occurring at some energy scale $f$ which gives rise to a
(massless) Goldstone boson. Non-perturbative physics at some temperature $T<f$
might occur which provides a potential (and a small mass) to the originally
massless boson to become the inflaton (a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson). Thus
the inflaton energy scale $\Delta$ is bounded by the symmetry breaking scale,
$\Delta\equiv V_H^{1/4} <f.$ To have such a well defined origin and hierarchy

  arXiv:1703.10256",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nearest neighbor imputation is popular for handling item nonresponse in
survey sampling. In this article, we study the asymptotic properties of the
nearest neighbor imputation estimator for general population parameters,
including population means, proportions and quantiles. For variance estimation,
the conventional bootstrap inference for matching estimators with fixed number
of matches has been shown to be invalid due to the nonsmoothness nature of the
matching estimator. We propose asymptotically valid replication variance
estimation. The key strategy is to construct replicates of the estimator
directly based on linear terms, instead of individual records of variables. A
simulation study confirms that the new procedure provides valid variance
estimation.

strange quark matter (MSQM) distribution and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in
$f(R,T)$ gravity. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained under
bilinear and special form of time varying deceleration parameter (DP). Firstly
we have considered two specific form of bilinear DP with a single parameter of
the form: $q=\frac{\alpha(1-t)}{1+t}$ and $q=-\frac{\alpha t}{1+t}$, which
leads to a function with constant or linear nature with respect to the choice
of constant $\alpha$. Second one is the special form of the DP as
$q=-1+\frac{\beta}{1+a^{\beta}}$. From obtained results, we could say that in
the early universe the magnetic flux has more effects and it gradually reducing
its effects in later. For $t\rightarrow \infty$, we get $p\rightarrow -B_c$ and
$\rho\rightarrow B_c$. So the strange quark matter along with magnetic epoch
gives an idea of accelerated expansion of the universe as per the observations
of the type Ia Supernovae.

rates of the links in a network with the tree topology and all of them are
derived by the maximum likelihood principle. One of the four is developed from
an estimator that was used but neglected because it was suspected to have a
higher variance. All of the estimators are proved to be either unbiased or
asymptotic unbiased. In addition, a set of formulae are derived to compute the
efficiencies and variances of the estimates obtained by the estimators. One of
the formulae shows that if a path is divided into two segments, the variance of
the estimates obtained for the pass rate of a segment is equal to the variance
of the pass rate of the path divided by the square of the pass rate of the
other segment. A number of theorems and corollaries are derived from the
formulae that can be used to evaluate the performance of an estimator. Using
the theorems and corollaries, we find the estimators from the neglected one are
the best estimator for the networks with the tree topology in terms of
efficiency and computation complexity.

of transversal gates, make universal fault-tolerant quantum computation
possible. Magic state distillation, code switching, code concatenation and

the overhead of these approaches is one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale
quantum computation. In this paper, two approaches for universal fault-tolerant
quantum computation, mainly based on code concatenation, are proposed. The
proposed approaches outperform code concatenation in terms of both number of
qubits and code distance and has also significantly less resource overhead than
code switching, magic state distillation and pieceable fault-tolerance at the
cost of reducing the effective distance of the concatenated code for
implementing non-transversal gates.

CCSNe, the MRI is terminated by parasitic instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
type. To determine whether the MRI can amplify initially weak magnetic fields
to dynamically relevant strengths in CCSNe, we performed three-dimensional
simulations of a region close to the surface of a differentially rotating
proto-neutron star in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with two different
numerical codes. We find that under the conditions prevailing in proto-neutron
stars, the MRI can amplify the magnetic field by (only) one order of magnitude.
This severely limits the role of MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying the
magnetic field in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed fields.

and confined water, with or without applied pressure. They result from the
competition of two liquid phases separated by an enthalpy difference depending
on temperature. The classical nucleation equation of these phases is completed
by this quantity existing at all temperatures, a pressure contribution, and an
enthalpy excess. This equation leads to two homogeneous nucleation temperatures
in each liquid phase, the first one being the formation temperature of an
ordered liquid phase below the melting temperature and the second one
corresponding to the overheating temperature. Thermodynamic properties, double
glass transition temperatures, sharp enthalpy and volume changes are predicted
in agreement with experimental results. The first-order transition line between
fragile and strong liquids joins two critical points. Glass phase above its
transition temperature becomes ordered liquid phase disappearing at a
first-order transition temperature at low pressure and at a temperature larger
than the melting temperature at high pressure.

We propose a weight compression method for deep neural networks, which allows
values of +1 or -1 only at predetermined positions of the weights so that
decoding using a table can be conducted easily. For example, the structured
sparse (8,2) coding allows at most two non-zero values among eight weights.
This method not only enables multiplication-free DNN implementations but also
compresses the weight storage by up to x32 compared to floating-point networks.
Weight distribution normalization and gradual pruning techniques are applied to
mitigate the performance degradation. The experiments are conducted with
fully-connected deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
