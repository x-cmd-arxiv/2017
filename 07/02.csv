The effect is small---a clock at sea level lags behind one 1000 m above sea
level by only 9.4 ns/day. Here, we demonstrate that a measurement of this
effect can be done by undergraduate students. Our paper describes an experiment
conducted by undergraduate researchers at Colorado College and the United
States Air Force Academy to measure gravitational time dilation. The
measurement was done by comparing the signals generated by a GPS frequency
standard (sea-level time) to a Cs-beam frequency standard at seven different
altitudes above sea level. We found that our measurements are consistent with
the predictions of general relativity.

relaxation observed in intrinsic electron-glasses. Our approach is guided by
several empirical observations: First and foremost, Anderson localization is a
pre-requisite for observing these nonequilibrium phenomena. Secondly, sluggish
relaxation appears to favor Anderson-insulators with relatively large
Fermi-energies (hence proportionally large disorder). These observations
motivated us to consider a way to measure the underlying disorder in a
realistic Anderson insulator. Optical study using a series of amorphous
indium-oxide (In_{x}O) establish a simple connection between
carrier-concentration and the disorder necessary to approach the
metal-insulator transition from the insulating side. This is used to estimate
the typical magnitude of the quenched potential-fluctuation in the
electron-glass phase of this system. The implications of our findings on the
slow dynamics of Anderson-insulators are discussed. In particular, the reason
for the absence of a memory-dip and the accompanying electron-glass effects in
lightly-doped semiconductors emerges as a natural consequence of their weak
disorder.

indium-oxide films. In this process the resistance of a given sample may
decrease by several orders of magnitude at room-temperatures, while its
amorphous structure is preserved. The main effect of the process is
densification - increased system density. The study includes the evolution of
the system resistivity during and after the thermal-treatment, the changes in
the conductance-noise, and accompanying changes in the optical properties. The
sample resistance is used to monitor the system dynamics during the annealing
period as well as the relaxation that ensues after its termination. These
reveal slow processes that fit well a stretched-exponential law, a behavior
that is commonly observed in structural glasses. There is an intriguing
similarity between these effects and those obtained in high-pressure
densification experiments. Both protocols exhibit the ""slow spring-back""
effect, a familiar response of memory-foams. A heuristic picture based on a
modified Lennard-Jones potential for the effective interparticle interaction is
argued to qualitatively account for these densification-rarefaction phenomena
in amorphous materials whether affected by thermal-treatment or by application
of high-pressure.

series. The study investigates: given the prompt to produce narratives for
electrostatic phenomena during a classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction, (1) what ideas of electrostatics do students attend to in their
narratives?; (2) what role do students narratives play in their understanding
of electrostatics? The participants were a group of high school students
engaged in an open-ended classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction about electrostatics. During the activity, the group was asked to
draw comic strips for electric charges. In addition to individual work,
students shared their work within small groups as well as with the whole group.
Post activity, six students from a small group were interviewed individually
about their work. In this paper I present two cases in which students produced
narratives to express their ideas about electrostatics in different ways. In
each case, I present student work for the comic strip activity (visual
narratives), their oral descriptions of their work (oral narratives) during the

the sense that the first $n$ moments depend on the higher order moments, for

which no a priori information on the probability distribution is available.
Furthermore, we cast the problem of finding the optimal affine MCF as a linear
program, which is tractable. We utilize the affine MCFs to derive a finite
dimensional linear system that approximates the low-order moments. We quantify
the approximation error in terms of the $% l_{\infty }$ induced norm of some
linear system. Our results can be effectively used to approximate the low-order

number of likes of a page has become a de-facto measure of its popularity and
profitability, an underground market of services artificially inflating page
likes, aka like farms, has emerged alongside Facebook's official targeted
advertising platform. Nonetheless, there is little work that systematically
analyzes Facebook pages' promotion methods. Aiming to fill this gap, we present
a honeypot-based comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via
Facebook advertising and from popular like farms. First, we analyze likes based
on demographic, temporal, and social characteristics, and find that some farms
seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their
operations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users'
behavior. Next, we look at fraud detection algorithms currently deployed by
Facebook and show that they do not work well to detect stealthy farms which
spread likes over longer timespans and like popular pages to mimic regular
users. To overcome their limitations, we investigate the feasibility of
timeline-based detection of like farm accounts, focusing on characterizing
content generated by Facebook accounts on their timelines as an indicator of
genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a range of features, grouped
into two main categories: lexical and non-lexical. We find that like farm
accounts tend to re-share content, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and
more often generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users.
Using relevant lexical and non-lexical features, we build a classifier to
detect like farms accounts that achieves precision higher than 99% and 93%

gradient descent (SGD) provides a scalable way to compute parameter estimates
and has gained increasing popularity due to its numerical convenience and
memory efficiency. While the asymptotic properties of SGD-based estimators have
been established decades ago, statistical inference such as interval estimation
remains much unexplored. The traditional resampling method such as the
bootstrap is not computationally feasible since it requires to repeatedly draw
independent samples from the entire dataset. The plug-in method is not
applicable when there are no explicit formulas for the covariance matrix of the
estimator. In this paper, we propose a scalable inferential procedure for
stochastic gradient descent, which, upon the arrival of each observation,
updates the SGD estimate as well as a large number of randomly perturbed SGD
estimates. The proposed method is easy to implement in practice. We establish
its theoretical properties for a general class of models that includes
generalized linear models and quantile regression models as special cases. The
finite-sample performance and numerical utility is evaluated by simulation
studies and two real data applications.

revealing quantumness in the network where each of two sources generates a
bipartite entangled state. In this context one may find interest to
characterize correlations in a network involving independent sources which can
correlate more than two initially uncorrelated multipartite entangled quantum

scenario. Specifically we introduce \textit{trilocal network scenario} where
each of three sources independently generates a tripartite entangled quantum
system thereby exploring the role of source independence assumption to exploit
nonlocality in a network involving multipartite entanglement analogous to
bilocal assumption in a network where only bipartite entanglement was
considered. Interestingly, genuine entanglement content did not turn out to be
an essential requirement for exploiting nonlocality in such a scenario.
Moreover it is interesting to explore whether such a scenario can be
generalized so as to characterize correlations arising in a network involving
$n$ number of $n$ partite systems for any finite value of $n\geq4$ under source

gravitational waves (GWs). As in the case of binary black holes, GWs generated
by BNS consist of inspiral, merger, and post-merger components. Detecting the
latter is important because it encodes information about the nuclear equation
of state (EOS) in a regime that cannot be probed prior to merger. The
post-merger signal, however, can be observed by current detectors only out to~
10 Mpc. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations showing that the dominant
post-merger signal (the 22 mode) from individual events will likely not be
observable even with the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer (CE), assuming
a full year of operation, the latest merger rates, and a detection threshold
with signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For this reason, we propose two methods that
stack the post-merger signal from multiple events to boost the detection
probability. The first method follows a commonly-used practice of multiplying
the Bayes factors of individual events. The second method relies on an
assumption that the mode phase can be determined from the inspiral waveform, so
that coherent mode stacking of the data from different events becomes possible.
Both methods significantly improve the chances of detecting the dominant
post-merger signal, making a detection very likely after a year of observation
with CE for certain EOS. We also show that in terms of detection, coherent
stacking is more efficient in accumulating confidence. Moreover, assuming a 22
mode is detected with CE via stacking, we estimate through a Fisher analysis
that the peak frequency can be measured to a statistical error of ~ 4-20 Hz for
certain equations of state. Such an error corresponds to a NS radius
measurement of ~ 15-56 m, a fractional relative error ~ 4 %, suggesting that
systematic errors from theoretical modeling (~ 100 m) may dominate the error
budget.

technique to obtain information about radiative capture reactions at

the indirect reaction $A(a, s\,\gamma)F$ to obtain information about the
radiative capture reaction $A(x,\,\gamma)F$, where $a=(s\,x)$ and $F=(x\,A)$.
The main advantage of using the indirect reactions is the absence of the
penetrability factor in the channel $x+A$, which suppresses the low-energy
cross sections of the $A(x,\,\gamma)F$ reactions and does not allow to measure
these reactions at astrophysical energies. A general formalism to treat
indirect resonant radiative capture reactions is developed when only a few
intermediate states do contribute and statistical approach cannot be applied.
Angular dependence of the triple differential cross section at fixed scattering
angle of the spectator $s$ is the angular $\gamma-s$ correlation function.
Using indirect resonant radiative capture reactions one can obtain the
information about important astrophysical resonant radiative capture reactions,
like $(p,\,\gamma), \,\,(\alpha,\,\gamma)$ and $(n,\,\gamma)$ on stable and
unstable isotopes. The indirect technique makes accessible low-lying
resonances, which are close to the threshold, and even subthreshold bound
states located at negative energies. In this paper, after developing the
general formalism, we demonstrated the application of the indirect reaction
${}^{12}{\rm C}({}^{6}{\rm Li},d\,\gamma){}^{16}{\rm O}$ proceeding through
$1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ subthreshold bound states and resonances to obtain the
information about the ${}^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\,\gamma){}^{16}{\rm O}$ radiative

of ideas associated on the one hand with [subjective Bayesianism] and on the
other hand with [classical statistics]...lend each other mutual support and
clarification."" By 1972, however, he had largely ""lost faith in the devices"" of
classical statistics. One aspect of those ""devices"" that he found objectionable
is that differences among the ""stopping rules"" that are used to decide when to
end an experiment which are ""noninformative"" from a Bayesian perspective can
affect decisions made using a classical approach. Two experiments that produce
the same data using different stopping rules seem to differ only in the
intentions of the experimenters regarding whether or not they would have
carried on if the data had been different, which seem irrelevant to the
evidential import of the data and thus to facts about what actions the data
warrant.
  I argue that classical and Bayesian ideas about stopping rules do in fact
""lend each other"" the kind of ""mutual support and clarification"" that Savage
had originally hoped to find. They do so in a kind of case that is common in
scientific practice, in which those who design an experiment have different
interests from those who will make decisions in light of its results. I show
that, in cases of this kind, Bayesian principles provide qualified support for
the classical statistical practice of ""penalizing"" ""biased"" stopping rules.
However, they require this practice in a narrower range of circumstances than
classical principles do, and for different reasons. I argue that classical
arguments for this practice are compelling in precisely the class of cases in
which Bayesian principles also require it, and thus that we should regard
Bayesian principles as clarifying classical statistical ideas about stopping
rules rather than the reverse.

considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such
as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and its generalization, the extended-DMD
(EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD
improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of
dictionary of observables that spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the
Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the
solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman
formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying
the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve
convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult
for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ
ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an
iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable
dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing
oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky PDE as examples, we show that our
algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the
problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to
choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy we
require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This
alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the
applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.

low-level recent star formation (specific star formation rate - sSFR) and dust.
In this Letter, we extend our previous work on the origins of $NUV-B$ color
gradients in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z\sim1$ to those at $z\sim2$. We
use a sample of 1335 large (semi-major axis radius $R_{\rm SMA}>0.''18$) SFGs
with extended UV emission out to $2R_{\rm SMA}$ in the mass range $M_{\ast} =
10^{9}-10^{11}M_{\odot}$ at $1.5<z<2.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields.
We show that these SFGs generally have negative $NUV-B$ color gradients (redder
centres), and their color gradients strongly increase with galaxy mass. We also
show that the global rest-frame $FUV-NUV$ color is approximately linear with
$A_{\rm V}$, which is derived by modeling the observed integrated FUV to NIR
spectral energy distributions of the galaxies. Applying this integrated
calibration to our spatially-resolved data, we find a negative dust gradient
(more dust extinguished in the centers), which steadily becomes steeper with
galaxy mass. We further find that the $NUV-B$ color gradients become nearly
zero after correcting for dust gradients regardless of galaxy mass. This
indicates that the sSFR gradients are negligible and dust reddening is likely
the principal cause of negative UV-optical color gradients in these SFGs. Our
findings support that the buildup of the stellar mass in SFGs at the Cosmic
Noon is self-similar inside $2R_{\rm SMA}$.

molecular core. However, close binaries/multiples from disk fragmentation can
also evolve to wide binaries over a few initial crossing times of the stellar
cluster through tidal evolution. Finding an isolated low mass wide binary

would prove that turbulent fragmentation is a viable mechanism for (very) low

wide-separation protostellar binary, showing that each component has a
circumstellar disk. The system is too young to have evolved from a close binary

of the 3-species BEC in an analytical way under the Thomas-Fermi approximation

and crosses over a critical value, a specific type of state-transition will
occur and will cause a jump in the total energy. Due to the jump, the energy of
the lowest symmetric state becomes considerably higher. This leaves a
particular opportunity for the lowest asymmetric state to replace the symmetric
states as the ground state. It was further found that the critical values are
related to the singularity of either the matrix or a sub-matrix of the CGP.
These critical values are not arising from the TFA but inherent in the CGP, and
they can be analytically expressed. Furthermore, a model (in which two kinds of
atoms separated from each other asymmetrically) has been proposed for the
evaluation of the energy of the lowest asymmetric state. With this model the
emergence of the asymmetric ground state is numerically confirmed under the
TFA. The theoretical formalism of this paper is quite general and can be
generalized for BEC with more than three species.

on or above the main-sequence of star formation (in total 82\% of our sample).
Therefore, they do not show signs of star formation quenching, but rather its
enhancement. Our results may suggest that for X-ray detected AGN with FIR
emission if there is an influence of AGN feedback on the star formation in the
green valley the scenario of AGN positive feedback seem to take place, rather
than the negative one.

random sequence, which we call \emph{$1/2$-bases}. We show that the collection
of such sets forms an ideal in the Turing degrees that is generated by its
c.e.\ elements. It is a proper subideal of the $K$-trivial sets. We
characterise $1/2$-bases as the sets computable from both halves of Chaitin's
$\Omega$, and as the sets that obey the cost function $\mathbf c(x,s) =
\sqrt{\Omega_s - \Omega_x}$.
  Generalising these results yields a dense hierarchy of subideals in the
$K$-trivial degrees: For $k< n$, let $B_{k/n}$ be the collection of sets that
are below any $k$ out of $n$ columns of some random sequence. As before, this
is an ideal generated by its c.e.\ elements and the random sequence in the
definition can always be taken to be $\Omega$. Furthermore, the corresponding
cost function characterisation reveals that $B_{k/n}$ is independent of the
particular representation of the rational $k/n$, and that $B_p$ is properly
contained in $B_q$ for rational numbers $p< q$. These results are proved using
a generalisation of the Loomis--Whitney inequality, which bounds the measure of
an open set in terms of the measures of its projections. The generality allows
us to analyse arbitrary families of orthogonal projections. As it turns out,
these do not give us new subideals of the $K$-trivial sets, we can calculate
from the family which $B_p$ it characterises.
  We finish by showing that the the union of $B_p$ for $p<1$ is the collection
of sets which are robustly computable from a random, a class previously studied
by Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Kuyper, and Schupp.

variation of the polar field measured by Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), e.g.,
the strong decrease of the south polar field during 2016-2017 which is not
shown by SDO/HMI and NSO/SOLIS data usually is not well reproduced. We suggest
observational effects, such as the effect of the large gradient of the magnetic

responsible. The northern hemisphere polar field is predicted to increase
during 2017. The southern polar field is predicted to be stable during

in a model with normal errors is considered. For this purpose, a novel
objective prior for the regression function is proposed, defined as the
distribution maximizing entropy subject to a suitable constraint based on the
Fisher information on the regression function. The prior is named I-prior. For
the present model, it is Gaussian with covariance kernel proportional to the
Fisher information, and mean chosen a priori (e.g., 0). The I-prior has the
intuitively appealing property that the more information is available about a
linear functional of the regression function, the larger its prior variance,
and, broadly speaking, the less influential the prior is on the posterior.
Unlike the Jeffreys prior, it can be used in high dimensional settings. The
I-prior methodology can be used as a principled alternative to Tikhonov
regularization, which suffers from well-known theoretical problems which are
briefly reviewed. The regression function is assumed to lie in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) over a low or high dimensional covariate space,
giving a high degree of generality. Analysis of some real data sets and a
small-scale simulation study show competitive performance of the I-prior
methodology, which is implemented in the R-package iprior (Jamil, 2019).

distance of 1.7 kpc. Twice as dense as the Orion Nebula Cluster, orders of
magnitude denser than other nearby star forming regions, and rich in massive
stars, RCW 38 is an ideal place to look for potential differences in brown
dwarf formation efficiency as a function of environment. We present deep, high
resolution adaptive optics data of the central ~0.5x0.5 pc^2 obtained with NACO
at the Very Large Telescope. Through comparison with evolutionary models we
determine masses and extinction for ~480 candidate members, and derive the
first Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the cluster extending into the substellar
regime. Representing the IMF as a set of power laws in the form
dN/dM~M^(-alpha), we derive the slope alpha = 1.60+-0.13 for the mass range 0.5
- 20 MSun which is shallower than the Salpeter slope, but in agreement with
results in several other young massive clusters. At the low-mass side, we find
alpha = 0.71+-0.11 for masses between 0.02 and 0.5 MSun, or alpha = 0.81+-0.08
for masses between 0.02 and 1 MSun. Our result is in agreement with the values
found in other young star-forming regions, revealing no evidence that a
combination of high stellar densities and the presence of numerous massive
stars affect the formation efficiency of brown dwarfs and very-low mass stars.
We estimate that the Milky Way galaxy contains between 25 and 100 billion brown
dwarfs (with masses > 0.03 MSun).

profile) for 2D Navier-Stokes equation on a torus. Such flows, also called bar
states, have been numerically observed as one type of metastable states in the
study of 2D turbulence. For both rectangular and square tori, we prove that the
non-shear part of perturbations near Kolmogorov flow decays in a time scale
much shorter than the viscous time scale. The results are obtained for both the
linearized NS equations with any initial vorticity in L^2, and the nonlinear NS
equation with initial L^2 norm of vorticity of the size of viscosity. In the
proof, we use the Hamiltonian structure of the linearized Euler equation and
RAGE theorem to control the low frequency part of the perturbation. Second, we
consider two classes of shear flows for which a sharp stability criterion is
known. We show the inviscid damping in a time average sense for non-shear
perturbations with initial vorticity in L^2. For the unstable case, the
inviscid damping is proved on the center space. Our proof again uses the
Hamiltonian structure of the linearized Euler equation and an instability index
theory recently developed by Lin and Zeng for Hamiltonian PDEs.

effective approach in studying crack problems within classical elasticity. The
present work is intended to extend this technique in studying crack problems
within couple-stress elasticity, i.e. within a theory accounting for effects of
microstructure. This extension is not an obvious one since rotations and
couple-stresses are involved in the theory employed to analyze the crack
problems. Here, the technique is introduced to study the case of a mode I
crack. Due to the nature of the boundary conditions that arise in couple-stress
elasticity, the crack is modeled by a continuous distribution of climb
dislocations and constrained wedge disclinations (the concept of ""constrained
wedge disclination"" is first introduced in the present work). These
distributions create both standard stresses and couple stresses in the body. In
particular, it is shown that the mode-I case is governed by a system of coupled
singular integral equations with both Cauchy-type and logarithmic kernels. The
numerical solution of this system shows that a cracked solid governed by
couple-stress elasticity behaves in a more rigid way (having increased
stiffness) as compared to a solid governed by classical elasticity. Also, the
stress level at the crack-tip region is appreciably higher than the one
predicted by classical elasticity.

companies listed in the Standard & Poor's $500$ index over the period $1993 -
2014$. Looking alternatively at the individual, then sector-, community- and

well known features of the financial markets such as the dramatic fall of
connectivity following Lehman Brothers' collapse. More importantly, by means of
less traditional metrics, such as sectoral interface or measurements based on
contagion processes, our results document the co-existence of both
fragmentation and integration phases between firms independently from the
sector they belong to, and in doing so, question the relevance of existing
macroprudential surveillance frameworks which have been mostly developed on a

steady-state equilibrium flow contains a shock of the type derived by Roberts
in the tightly wound approximation. We find that boundary conditions are
critical in determining whether the solutions are stable or not. Shocks are
unstable if periodic boundary conditions are imposed. For intermediate
strengths of the spiral potential, the instability disappears if boundary
conditions are imposed such that the upstream flow is left unperturbed as in
the classic analysis of D'yakov and Kontorovich. This reconciles apparently
contradictory findings of previous authors regarding the stability of spiral
shocks. This also shows that the instability is distinct from the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, confirming the findings of Kim et al. We suggest
that instability is a general characteristics of periodic shocks, regardless of
the presence of shear, and provide a physical picture as to why this is the
case. For strong spiral potentials, high post-shock shear makes the system
unstable also to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability regardless of the
boundary conditions. Our analysis is performed in the context of a simplified
problem that, while preserving all the important characteristics of the
original problem, strips it from unnecessary complications, and assumes that
the gas is isothermal, non self-gravitating, non-magnetised.

multitude of collective phenomena. Two archetypal examples are VO2 and NdNiO3,
which undergo a metal-insulator phase-transition (MIT), the origin of which is
still under debate. Here we report the discovery of a memory effect in both
systems, manifest through an increase of resistance at a specific temperature,
which is set by reversing the temperature-ramp from heating to cooling during
the MIT. The characteristics of this ramp-reversal memory effect do not
coincide with any previously reported history or memory effects in manganites,
electron-glass or magnetic systems. From a broad range of experimental
features, supported by theoretical modelling, we find that the main ingredients
for the effect to arise are the spatial phase-separation of metallic and
insulating regions during the MIT and the coupling of lattice strain to the
local critical temperature of the phase transition. We conclude that the
emergent memory effect originates from phase boundaries at the
reversal-temperature leaving `scars` in the underlying lattice structure,
giving rise to a local increase in the transition temperature. The universality
and robustness of the effect shed new light on the MIT in complex oxides.

multiple co-channel multicast groups through transmit beamforming. We
explicitly focus on overloaded scenarios in which the number of transmitting
antennas is insufficient to neutralize all inter-group interference. Such
scenarios are becoming increasingly relevant in the light of growing
low-latency content delivery demands, and also commonly appear in multibeam
satellite systems. We derive performance limits of classical beamforming
strategies using DoF analysis unveiling their limitations; for example, rates
saturate in overloaded scenarios due to inter-group interference. To tackle
interference, we propose a strategy based on degraded beamforming and
successive interference cancellation. While the degraded strategy resolves the
rate-saturation issue, this comes at a price of sacrificing all spatial
multiplexing gains. This motivates the development of a unifying strategy that
combines the benefits of the two previous strategies. We propose a beamforming
strategy based on rate-splitting (RS) which divides the messages intended to
each group into a degraded part and a designated part, and transmits a
superposition of both degraded and designated beamformed streams. The
superiority of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through DoF analysis.
Finally, we solve the RS beamforming design problem and demonstrate significant
performance gains through simulations.

harmonics is also selectable by tuning to the appropriate emission angle with
respect to the ring plane. The nonequilibrium orbital magnetic moment triggered
in a ring tunnels quantum mechanically to smaller and larger rings leading
respectively to high and low-frequency harmonic generation. The frequencies of
the emitted harmonics are tunable by simply changing the waist and/or the
winding number of the optical vortex, without the need to increase the pulse
intensity which can lead to material damage. These findings follow from
full-fledged quantum dynamic simulations for realistic material and laser

of the axion electrodynamics. This proposal is based upon the construction of a
proper study of the SIM$(2)$--VSR gauge-symmetry. It is shown that the VSR
nonlocal effects give a health departure from the usual axion field theory. The
axionic classical dynamics is analysed in full detail, first by a discussion of
its solution in the presence of an external magnetic field. Next, we compute
photon-axion transition in VSR scenario by means of Primakoff interaction,
showing the change of a linearly polarized light to a circular one. Afterwards,
duality symmetry is discussed in the VSR framework.

process of citing documents (focusing on the literature from the recent
decade). It presents theories, which have been proposed for explaining the
citation process, and studies having empirically analyzed this process. The
overview is referred to as conceptual, because it is structured based on core
elements in the citation process: the context of the cited document, processes
from selection to citation of documents, and the context of the citing
document. The core elements are presented in a schematic representation. The
overview can be used to find answers on basic questions about the practice of
citing documents. Besides understanding of the process of citing, it delivers
basic information for the proper application of citations in research
evaluation.

connectivity and rich education content has created a global phenomenon by
which information and communication technology (ICT) has used to remodel
education. E-learning can be explained as the use of available information,
computational and communication technologies to assist learning practice. In
the modern world, education has become more universal, and people are looking
for learning with simplicity and interest. Students are looking for more
interactive and attractive learning style rather than old traditional style.
Using technological learning, we can enhance the education system. We can
deliver quality education to students as well as we can ease and uniform the
process of education by using the modern technologies and methods. In this
paper, we propose a smart class model to manage the entire educational
activities and hence to enhance the quality of education.

networks. In this paper, we study the characterization of mmWave air-to-ground
(AG) channels for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular,
we use ray tracing simulations using Remcom Wireless InSite software to study
the behavior of AG mmWave bands at two different frequencies: 28~GHz and
60~GHz. Received signal strength (RSS) and root mean square delay spread
(RMS-DS) of multipath components (MPCs) are analyzed for different UAV heights
considering four different environments: urban, suburban, rural, and over sea.
It is observed that the RSS mostly follows the two ray propagation model along
the UAV flight path for higher altitudes. This two ray propagation model is
affected by the presence of high rise scatterers in urban scenario. Moreover,
we present details of a universal serial radio peripheral (USRP) based channel
sounder that can be used for AG channel measurements for mmWave (60 GHz) UAV
communications.

event of interest occurs. It has been commonly used to study the effectiveness
of medical treatments or the lifespan of a population. However, survival
analysis can potentially leak confidential information of individuals in the
dataset. The state-of-the-art techniques apply ad-hoc privacy-preserving
mechanisms on publishing results to protect the privacy. These techniques
usually publish sanitized and randomized answers which promise to protect the
privacy of individuals in the dataset but without providing any formal
mechanism on privacy protection. In this paper, we propose private mechanisms
for parametric survival analysis with Weibull distribution. We prove that our
proposed mechanisms achieve differential privacy, a robust and rigorous
definition of privacy-preservation. Our mechanisms exploit the property of
local sensitivity to carefully design a utility function which enables us to
publish parameters of Weibull distribution with high precision. Our
experimental studies show that our mechanisms can publish useful answers and
outperform other differentially private techniques on real datasets.

"1709.05918","A. John Hart","Jamison Go, A. John Hart","Fast Desktop-Scale Extrusion Additive Manufacturing",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Significant improvements to the production rate of additive manufacturing
(AM) technologies are essential to their cost-effectiveness and competitiveness
with traditional processing routes. Moreover, much faster AM processes, in
combination with the geometric versatility of AM, will enable entirely new
workflows for product design and customization. We present the design and
validation of a desktop-scale extrusion AM system that achieves far greater
build rate than benchmarked commercial systems. This system, which we call
FastFFF, is motivated by our recent analysis of the rate-limiting mechanisms to
conventional fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. The FastFFF system
mutually overcomes these limits, using a nut-feed extruder, laser-heated
polymer liquefier, and servo-driven parallel gantry system to achieve high
extrusion force, rapid filament heating, and fast gantry motion, respectively.
The extrusion and heating mechanisms are contained in a compact printhead that
receives a threaded filament and augments conduction heat transfer with a
fiber-coupled diode laser. The prototype system achieves a volumetric build
rate of 127 cm3/hr, which is 7-fold greater than commercial desktop FFF
systems, at comparable resolution; the maximum extrusion rate of the printhead
is ~14-fold greater (282 cm3/hr). The performance limits of the printhead and
motion systems are characterized, and the tradeoffs between build rate and
resolution are assessed and discussed. The combination of high-speed motion and
high deposition rate achieved by the FastFFF technology also poses challenges
and opportunities for toolpath optimization and real-time deposition control.
High-speed desktop printing raises the possibility of new use cases and
business models for AM, where handheld parts are built in minutes rather than
hours.
