non-commutativity of the zero-mode sector of closed string theory. In
particular, we illuminate the relation between T-duality and this intrinsic
non-commutativity and also note that there is a simple closed string product,
equivalent to the splitting-joining interaction of the pants diagram, that
respects this non-commutativity and is covariant with respect to T-duality. We
emphasize the central role played by the symplectic form $\omega$ on the space
of zero modes. Furthermore, we begin an exploration of new non-commutative
string backgrounds. In particular, we show that a constant non-geometric
background field leads to a non-commutative space-time. We also comment on the
non-associativity that consequently arises in the presence of non-trivial flux.
In this formulation, the $H$-flux as well as the `non-geometric' $Q$-, $R$- and
$F$-fluxes are simply the various components of the flux of an almost
symplectic form.

Namely, we generalize the asymptotic result of Robbins and Siegmund regarding
selection from independent Gaussian populations with known constant variance by
their means to the case of selecting a subset of varying size out of a given
set of populations. In addition, we revisit the problem of selecting the
population with the highest mean among independent Gaussian populations with
unknown and possibly different variances. Particularly, we derive the relative
asymptotic efficiency of Dudewicz and Dalal's and Rinott's procedures, showing
that the former can be asymptotically superior by a multiplicative factor which
is larger than one, but this factor may be reduced by proper choice of
parameters. We also use our asymptotic results to suggest that the sample size
in the first stage of the two procedures should be logarithmic in the number of
populations.

The inverse dynamics problem of finding an instantaneous pusher motion that

planner generates a sequence of pushes that steers the object to a goal grasp.
We evaluate the performance of the planner for the case of a parallel-jaw

frame-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's
orbit. The dominant relativistic effect on the path of the signal photons is
Shapiro delay due to static space curvature. We compute these effects for some

by Juno and Cassini, though not by Galileo 5 and 6. Practical measurement would
require disentangling frame-dragging from the Newtonian 'foreground' such as
the gravitational quadrupole which has an impact on both the spacecraft's orbit

and XMP, have been introduced to effectively exploit the path diversity of data
center networks (DCNs). However, these multipath schemes have not been widely
deployed in DCNs. We argue that two key factors among others impeded their
adoption: TCP incast and minimum window syndrome. First, these mechanisms are
ill-suited for workloads with a many-to-one communication pattern, commonly
found in DCNs, causing frequent TCP incast collapses. Second, the syndrome we
discover for the first time, results in 2-5 times lower throughput for
single-path flows than multipath flows, thus severely violating network
fairness.
  To effectively tackle these problems, we propose AMP: an adaptive multipath
congestion control mechanism that quickly detects the onset of these problems
and transforms its multipath flow into a single-path flow. Once these problems
disappear, AMP safely reverses this transformation and continues its data
transmission via multiple paths. Our evaluation results under a diverse set of
scenarios in a fat-tree topology with realistic workloads demonstrate that AMP
is robust to the TCP incast problem and improves network fairness between
multipath and single-path flows significantly with little performance loss.

spectrum bands could present different PU occupancy patterns. In fact, the

heterogeneous. In this paper, we consider heterogeneous wideband spectrum, and
exploit its inherent, block-like structure to design efficient compressive

lepton-induced air showers from detectors at altitude. When a $\tau$ neutrino
($\nu_\tau$) enters the Earth it produces $\tau$ leptons as a result of nuclear
charged current interactions. In some cases, this process results in a $\tau$
lepton exiting the surface of the Earth, which can subsequently decay in the
atmosphere and produce an extensive air shower. These upward-going air showers
can be detected via fluorescence, optical Cherenkov, or geomagnetic radio
emission. Several experiments have been proposed to detect these signals. We
present a comprehensive simulation of the production of $\tau$ leptons by
$\nu_\tau$'s propagating through Earth to aid the design of future experiments.
These simulations for $\nu_\tau$'s and leptons in the energy range from
$10^{15}$ eV to $10^{21}$ eV treat the full range of incidence angles from
Earth-skimming to diametrically-traversing. Propagation of $\nu_\tau$'s and

consistent around the critical point.

At low densities, a substantially larger spin gap is obtained. We provide
evidence that long-range interactions lead to algebraically decaying

been observed in other long-range interacting spin and fermion models, the
correlations in our case have the peculiar property of having a small and
continuously varying exponent. We construct simple analytic models and

of calculus with respect to the standard Lagrange basis functions in one
dimension. These are used to construct tensor product solution spaces which
satisfy the generalized Stokes theorem, as well as the annihilation of the
gradient operator by the curl and the curl by the divergence. This allows for
the exact conservation of first order moments (mass, vorticity), as well as
quadratic moments (energy, potential enstrophy), subject to the truncation
error of the time stepping scheme. The continuity equation is solved in the
strong form, such that mass conservation holds point wise, while the momentum
equation is solved in the weak form such that vorticity is globally conserved.
While mass, vorticity and energy conservation hold for any quadrature rule,
potential enstrophy conservation is dependent on exact spatial integration. The
method possesses a weak form statement of geostrophic balance due to the
compatible nature of the solution spaces and arbitrarily high order spatial
error convergence.

attempt to resolve the black hole information paradox. Here we propose an
alternative scenario that is based on the Kac-Moody charges. We show that the
role of BMS charges can be played by an infinite set of symmetries that emerge
from the space-time foam predicted by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus
on Yang-Mills fields embedded in the gravity described by the Holst
formulation, and argue that the Yang-Mills and gravitational self-duality
conditions in space-time bubbles are related to a new infinite dimensional
global symmetry, hidden in the Lagrangian. Such a symmetry is manifested by the
Kac-Moody algebra, with zero central charges. This implies the existence, in
the space-time foam, of an infinite number of different instantons that are
interconnected by the Kac-Moody symmetry. These modes puncture the horizons of
the building block of the space-time bubbles. On the other hand, the same
Kac-Moody symmetry is retried in non-perturbative regime at the level of the
gravitational quantum loops. The new result carries consequences on the no-hair
theorem and on the study of quantum black holes. In particular, instantonic
moduli of the Kac-Moody charges are quantum hairs encoding the missing black
hole information, subtly compatible with the no hair theorem.

understand the trade-off between the performance and complexity of policies for

expected time-average revenue, the gain, of the service provider for various

service prices, is hard to obtain due to the curse of dimensionality. For
general tandem queueing systems, rather than identifying an optimal dynamic
policy, we show that the best possible static policy that quotes the same price
to all customers is asymptotically optimal when the buffer size at the first
station is sufficiently large. A noteworthy feature of our analysis is that we
identify an easy-to-obtain but asymptotic optimal static policy associated with
a simple optimization problem. We validate our analytic results through
numerical experiments and learn that, surprisingly, the gain under the simple
static policy is close to the optimal gain even when the buffer size at the

Photometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS) bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe) to search for
molecular material. H2 emission is found in most of them (14 out of 15), mostly
associated with rings at their equatorial regions and with their bipolar lobes.
These detections add to the high occurrence of H2 emission among bipolar PNe
reported in previous works, resulting from the large reservoir of molecular
material in these sources and the suitable excitation conditions for H2
emission. The correlation between detailed bipolar morphology and H2 luminosity
is also confirmed: bipolar PNe with broad equatorial rings (R-BPNe) have almost
no continuum emission, are H2 brighter and have larger H2/Brgamma line ratio
than bipolar PNe with pinched equatorial waists (W-BPNe). The origin of this
dichotomy is unclear. The larger size and age of R-BPNe are consistent with
shock excitation of H2, whereas ultraviolet pumping is most likely the
excitation mechanism in the smaller and younger W-BPNe, which would explain
their lower H2 luminosity. Although both types of bipolar PNe seem to proceed
from the same progenitor population, this does not imply that R-BPNe descend
from W-BPNe. Otherwise, we note that some of the H2-weak bipolar PNe harbor
post-common envelope binary systems and symbiotic stars. Finally, we suggest
that the long-living H2 emission from R-BPNe arises from a discrete
distribution of compact knots embedded within the ionized gas at the equatorial
region.

to take place is a practical question that is of interest in many situations.
This time scale is often called the response time. In the groundwater hydrology

both the transient and steady state groundwater flow equations are solved, and
the response time is taken to be amount of time required for the transient
solution to approach the steady solution within some tolerance; and (ii) simple
scaling arguments are adopted. Certain limitations restrict both of these
approaches. Here we outline a third method, based on the theory of mean action
time. We derive the governing boundary value problem for both the mean and
variance of action time for confined flow in two-dimensional heterogeneous
porous media. Importantly, we show that these boundary value problems can be
solved using widely available software. Applying these methods to a test case
reveals the advantages of the theory of mean action time relative to standard

steps. First, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the dispersion curves
of the fundamental Lamb wave modes are utilized to estimate the distance
between an AE source and a sensor. This step uses a modal acoustic emission
approach. Then, an analytical model is proposed that uses the estimated
distances to simulate the edge-reflected waves. Finally, the correlation
between the experimental and the simulated waveforms is used to estimate the
location of AE sources. Hsu-Nielson pencil lead break (PLB) tests were
performed on an aluminum plate to validate this algorithm and promising results
were achieved. Based on these results, the paper reports the statistics of the

achieved significant performance improvement over existing iterative
reconstruction methods in various imaging problems. However, it is still
unclear why these deep learning architectures work for specific inverse
problems. To address these issues, here we show that the long-searched-for
missing link is the convolution framelets for representing a signal by
convolving local and non-local bases. The convolution framelets was originally
developed to generalize the theory of low-rank Hankel matrix approaches for
inverse problems, and this paper further extends the idea so that we can obtain
a deep neural network using multilayer convolution framelets with perfect
reconstruction (PR) under rectilinear linear unit nonlinearity (ReLU). Our
analysis also shows that the popular deep network components such as residual
block, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) do indeed help
to achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented
with high-pass branches to meet the PR condition. Moreover, by changing the
number of filter channels and bias, we can control the shrinkage behaviors of
the neural network. This discovery leads us to propose a novel theory for deep
convolutional framelets neural network. Using numerical experiments with
various inverse problems, we demonstrated that our deep convolution framelets
network shows consistent improvement over existing deep architectures.This
discovery suggests that the success of deep learning is not from a magical
power of a black-box, but rather comes from the power of a novel signal
representation using non-local basis combined with data-driven local basis,
which is indeed a natural extension of classical signal processing theory.

communication for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. The
P300-based BCI speller relies on eliciting and detecting transient
event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) data, in
response to a user attending to rarely occurring target stimuli amongst a
series of non-target stimuli. However, in most P300 speller implementations,
the stimuli to be presented are randomly selected from a limited set of options
and stimulus selection and presentation are not optimized based on previous
user data. In this work, we propose a data-driven method for stimulus selection
based on the expected discrimination gain metric. The data-driven approach
selects stimuli based on previously observed stimulus responses, with the aim
of choosing a set of stimuli that will provide the most information about the
user's intended target character. Our approach incorporates knowledge of
physiological and system constraints imposed due to real-time BCI
implementation. Simulations were performed to compare our stimulus selection
approach to the row-column paradigm, the conventional stimulus selection method
for P300 spellers. Results from the simulations demonstrated that our adaptive
stimulus selection approach has the potential to significantly improve
performance from the conventional method: up to 34% improvement in accuracy and
43% reduction in the mean number of stimulus presentations required to spell a
character in a 72-character grid. In addition, our greedy approach to stimulus
selection provides the flexibility to accommodate design constraints.

In
conventional approaches, higher order tensors are `vectorized` via Tucker

paper introduces a probabilistic vectorial dimensionality reduction model for
tensorial data. The model represents a tensor by employing a linear combination
of same order basis tensors, thus it offers a mechanism to directly reduce a

based on the tensor CandeComp/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and the number of free

than exponentially. A Bayesian inference has been established via the
variational EM approach. A criterion to set the parameters (factor number of CP

requires at least one external field. Since this mechanism is often applied to
a multilayer system including a magnet and a paramagnetic metal, the system can
possess not only the charge current induced by the spin current but also the
charge current induced by the external field. The latter is an unnecessary
accompaniment. Here we show that the tunneling of a magnon pair between chiral
magnets can generate a spin current even without external fields. This
phenomenon originates from a phase difference between magnon pairs of separate,
weakly coupled chiral magnets, and is essentially different from the mechanism
using the angle degree of freedom of the magnon Bose-Einstein condensates. The
pair's tunneling is possible in chiral magnets due to lack of the
Goldstone-type gapless excitations. This phenomenon opens the door to
spintronics not requiring any external field and using the magnon pair
tunneling.

applications in image processing and computer vision. There has been growing
interest in developing efficient algorithms for CDL, mostly relying on the
augmented Lagrangian (AL) method or the variant alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). When their parameters are properly tuned, AL methods have
shown fast convergence in CDL. However, the parameter tuning process is not
trivial due to its data dependence and, in practice, the convergence of AL
methods depends on the AL parameters for nonconvex CDL problems. To moderate
these problems, this paper proposes a new practically feasible and convergent
Block Proximal Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPG-M) for CDL. The
BPG-M-based CDL is investigated with different block updating schemes and
majorization matrix designs, and further accelerated by incorporating some
momentum coefficient formulas and restarting techniques. All of the methods
investigated incorporate a boundary artifacts removal (or, more generally,
sampling) operator in the learning model. Numerical experiments show that,
without needing any parameter tuning process, the proposed BPG-M approach
converges more stably to desirable solutions of lower objective values than the
existing state-of-the-art ADMM algorithm and its memory-efficient variant do.
Compared to the ADMM approaches, the BPG-M method using a multi-block updating
scheme is particularly useful in single-threaded CDL algorithm handling large
datasets, due to its lower memory requirement and no polynomial computational
complexity. Image denoising experiments show that, for relatively strong
additive white Gaussian noise, the filters learned by BPG-M-based CDL
outperform those trained by the ADMM approach.

are evaluated only at the centroid of each integration cell. These integration

enable users to create automation rules (or recipes) of the form, ""If there is
a smoke alarm, then turn off my oven."" These platforms stitch together various
online services including Internet of Things devices, social networks, and
productivity tools by obtaining OAuth tokens on behalf of users. Unfortunately,
these platforms also introduce a long-term security risk: If they are
compromised, the attacker can misuse the OAuth tokens belonging to millions of
users to arbitrarily manipulate their devices and data. In this work, we first
quantify the risk users face in the context of If-This-Then-That (IFTTT). We
perform the first empirical analysis of the OAuth-based authorization model of
IFTTT using semi-automated tools that we built to overcome the challenges of
IFTTT's closed source nature and of online service API inconsistencies. We find
that 75% of IFTTT's channels, an abstraction of online services, use
overprivileged OAuth tokens, increasing risks in the event of a compromise.
Even if the OAuth tokens were to be privileged correctly, IFTTT's compromise
will not prevent their misuse. Motivated by this empirical analysis, we design
and evaluate Decoupled-IFTTT (dIFTTT), the first trigger-action platform where
users do not have to give it highly-privileged access to their online services.
Our design pushes the notion of fine-grained OAuth tokens to its extreme and
ensures that even if the cloud service is controlled by the attacker, it cannot
misuse the OAuth tokens to invoke unauthorized actions. Our evaluation
establishes that dIFTTT poses modest overhead: it adds less than 15ms of
latency to recipe execution time, and reduces throughput by 2.5%.

their corresponding Oracle counterparts, with an emphasis on the asymptotic
properties of these hyperparameter estimators. To this goal, we first derive
and then rewrite the first order optimality conditions of these hyperparameter
estimators, leading to several insights on these hyperparameter estimators.
Then we show that as the number of data goes to infinity, the two SUREs
converge to the best hyperparameter minimizing the corresponding mean square
error, respectively, while the more widely used EB estimator converges to
another best hyperparameter minimizing the expectation of the EB estimation
criterion. This indicates that the two SUREs are asymptotically optimal but the
EB estimator is not. Surprisingly, the convergence rate of two SUREs is slower
than that of the EB estimator, and moreover, unlike the two SUREs, the EB
estimator is independent of the convergence rate of $\Phi^T\Phi/N$ to its
limit, where $\Phi$ is the regression matrix and $N$ is the number of data. A
Monte Carlo simulation is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

retrieval problem. This task aims to search a query person in a large image

cropped pedestrian images. However, this process suffers from two types of
detector errors: excessive background and part missing. Both errors deteriorate
the quality of pedestrian alignment and may compromise pedestrian matching due
to the position and scale variances. To address the misalignment problem, we
propose that alignment can be learned from an identification procedure. We
introduce the pedestrian alignment network (PAN) which allows discriminative
embedding learning and pedestrian alignment without extra annotations. Our key
observation is that when the convolutional neural network (CNN) learns to
discriminate between different identities, the learned feature maps usually
exhibit strong activations on the human body rather than the background. The
proposed network thus takes advantage of this attention mechanism to adaptively
locate and align pedestrians within a bounding box. Visual examples show that
pedestrians are better aligned with PAN. Experiments on three large-scale re-ID
datasets confirm that PAN improves the discriminative ability of the feature
embeddings and yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods.

samples. Treating these pairwise samples as inputs, we build a novel part-based
deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the layered feature
representations by preserving a large adaptive margin. As a result, the final
learned model can effectively find out the matched target to the anchor image
among a number of candidates in the gallery image set by learning
discriminative and stable feature representations. Overcoming the weaknesses of
conventional fixed-margin loss functions, our adaptive margin loss function is
more appropriate for the dynamic feature space. On four benchmark datasets,
PRID2011, Market1501, CUHK01 and 3DPeS, we extensively conduct comparative
evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the
state-of-the-art approaches in person re-identification.

2015 and identified the following characteristics: a degree of circular
polarization (DCP) in the range of 0%-70%, a temporal delay of 0-70 ms between
the two circularly polarized components (i.e., the right- and left-handed
components), and dominant ordinary-mode emission in about 81% of the events.
For most events, the relation between the dominant and delayed components could
be interpreted in the framework of fundamental plasma emission and
depolarization during propagation, though the values of DCP and delay were
distributed across wide ranges. Furthermore, it was found that the DCP and
delay were positively correlated (rank correlation coefficient R = 0.62). As a
possible interpretation of this relationship, we considered a model based on
depolarization due to reflections at sharp density boundaries assuming
fundamental plasma emission. The model calculations of depolarization including
multiple reflections and group delay during propagation in the inhomogeneous
corona showed that the DCP and delay decreased as the number of reflections
increased, which is consistent with the observational results. The dispersive
polarization characteristics could be explained by the different numbers of
reflections causing depolarization.

can be shown by finding certain forbidden uniform minors within the lattice of

have additional structure that significantly restricts the possible locality

criteria for detecting uniform minors from the lattice of cyclic flats of a

analytically as far as possible. For the remaining integrals, numerical
quadrature formulae have to be applied. The eigenvalue problem decouples into a
normal and a tangential problem. The number of well-localised vector fields can
be estimated by a Shannon number which mainly depends on the maximal radial and
angular degree of the basis functions as well as the size of the localisation
region. We show numerical examples of vectorial Slepian functions on the ball,

Several privacy-protection mechanisms based on a prior encryption of the data

but at the cost of hampering the efficiency of the service and limiting the
functionalities that can be applied over the (encrypted) data stored on cloud
premises. Because both efficiency and functionality are crucial advantages of
cloud computing, in this paper we aim at retaining them by proposing a
privacy-protection mechanism that relies on splitting (clear) data, and on the
distributed storage offered by the increasingly popular notion of multi-clouds.
We propose a semantically-grounded data splitting mechanism that is able to
automatically detect pieces of data that may cause privacy risks and split them
on local premises, so that each chunk does not incur in those risks; then,
chunks of clear data are independently stored into the separate locations of a
multi-cloud, so that external entities cannot have access to the whole
confidential data. Because partial data are stored in clear on cloud premises,
outsourced functionalities are seamlessly and efficiently supported by just
broadcasting queries to the different cloud locations. To enforce a robust
privacy notion, our proposal relies on a privacy model that offers a priori
privacy guarantees; to ensure its feasibility, we have designed heuristic
algorithms that minimize the number of cloud storage locations we need; to show
its potential and generality, we have applied it to the least structured and
most challenging data type: plain textual documents.

developed in work (J. Stat. Phys, 2017,167(6), 1519-1545) and geometry based
modification of Helmholtz free energy for Lennard-Jones fluids. Efficiency of
RSDFT is demonstrated in calculation of argon and nitrogen low temperature

are in good agreement with experimental data published in the literature. Also
several models of corrugated materials are developed in the framework of RSDFT.

phase transitions in which the Boltzmann factor for a domain wall is decorated
with a contribution stemming from the point tension originated at its

tension is then identified exactly thanks to two independent analytical
techniques, providing a critical test of the Fisher-Privman theory. We then
illustrate how to build up the network model from its elementary constituents,
the cells and the channels. Moreover, we are able to extract the strength of
the coupling between cells and express them in terms of the length and width
and coarse grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. We then

multivariate heavy-tailed data. A random vector is regularly varying if and

independent of the angular part $\Theta$ as $R$ goes to infinity. The
conditional limiting distribution of $\Theta$ given $R$ is large characterizes
the tail dependence of the random vector and hence its estimation is the
primary goal of applications. A typical strategy is to look at the angular
components of the data for which the radial parts exceed some threshold. While
a large class of methods has been proposed to model the angular distribution
from these exceedances, the choice of threshold has been scarcely discussed in
the literature. In this paper, we describe a procedure for choosing the
threshold by formally testing the independence of $R$ and $\Theta$ using a
measure of dependence called distance covariance. We generalize the limit
theorem for distance covariance to our unique setting and propose an algorithm
which selects the threshold for $R$. This algorithm incorporates a subsampling
scheme that is also applicable to weakly dependent data. Moreover, it avoids

principled parameter selection. The estimator penalizes signal sparsity subject

has a one-factorization, namely a proper edge coloring with $n-1$ colors.

constructions of one-factorizations. Specifically, we know essentially nothing
about the {\em typical} properties of one-factorizations for large $n$.
  Suppose that $\cal C_{\rm n}$ is a graph whose vertex set includes the set of
all order-$n$ one-factorizations and that $\Psi: V(\cal C_{\rm n})\to \mathbb
R$ takes its minimum precisely at the one-factorizations. Given $\cal C_{\rm

by taking a walk on $\cal C_{\rm n}$ that tends to go from a vertex to a
neighbor of smaller $\Psi$. For over 30 years, hill-climbing has been
essentially the only method for generating many large one-factorizations.
However, the validity of such methods was supported so far only by numerical
evidence. Here, we present for the first time hill-climbing algorithms that
provably generate an order-$n$ one-factorization in $\text{polynomial}(n)$

electrons from the target in the vacuum region for Brunel's mechanism to be

  http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.821870",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ionic transport in solid electrolytes can often be approximated as ions
performing a sequence of hops between distinct lattice sites. If these hops are
uncorrelated, quantitative relationships can be derived that connect
microscopic hopping rates to macroscopic transport coefficients. At non-dilute
concentrations the relationships between hopping frequency, diffusion
coefficient, and ionic conductivity deviate from the random walk case, with
this deviation quantified by single-particle and collective correlation
factors, $f$ and $f_\mathrm{I}$. These factors vary between materials, and
depend on the concentration of mobile particles, the nature of the
interactions, and the host lattice geometry. Here we study these correlation
effects for the garnet lattice using lattice-gas Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that for non-interacting particles (volume exclusion only) single-particle
correlation effects are more significant than for any previously studied
three-dimensional lattice. This is attributed to the presence of two-coordinate
lattice sites, which causes correlation effects intermediate between typical
three-dimensional and one-dimensional lattices. Including nearest-neighbour
repulsion and on-site energies produces more complex single-particle
correlations and introduces collective correlations. We predict particularly
strong correlation effects at $x_\mathrm{Li}=3$ (from site energies) and
$x_\mathrm{Li}=6$ (from nearest-neighbour repulsion). Both effects are
consequences of ordering of the mobile particles. Using these simulation data,
we consider tuning the mobile ion stoichiometry to maximise the ionic
conductivity, and show that the ""optimal"" composition is highly sensitive to
the precise nature and strength of the microscopic interactions. Finally, we

subclasses of stationary hard-core particle systems arising as thinnings of
stationary particle processes. These subclasses are defined by natural
maximality criteria. We investigate two specific criteria, one related to the
intensity of the hard-core particle process, the other one being a local
optimality criterion on the level of realizations. In fact, the criteria are
equivalent under suitable moment conditions. We show that stationary hard-core
thinnings satisfying such criteria exist and are frequently distributionally
unique. More precisely, distributional uniqueness holds in subcritical and
barely supercritical regimes of continuum percolation. Additionally, based on
the analysis of a specific example, we argue that fluctuations in grain sizes
can play an important role for establishing distributional uniqueness at high
intensities. Finally, we provide a family of algorithmically constructible
approximations whose volume fractions are arbitrarily close to the maximum.

deduced to obtain a better understanding of each event. A total of 176 SEP
events have been identified as having occurred during the time period of

velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time-shifting analysis (TSA) for
protons, as well as TSA for near-relativistic electrons. Additionally, a brief
statistical analysis has been performed on the VDA and TSA results, as well as
the X-rays and CMEs associated with the proton/electron events, both to test
the viability of the VDA and to investigate possible differences between the
two solar cycles. We find, in confirmation of a number of previous studies,
that VDA results for protons that yield an apparent path length of 1 AU < s <~
3 AU seem to be useful, but those outside this range are probably unreliable,
as evidenced by the anticorrelation between apparent path length and release
time estimated from the X-ray activity. It also appears that even the

length being on average about twice the length of the spiral magnetic field.

differential effects in rotating plasmas. Beyond conventional centrifugation,
rotating plasmas offer in principle additional ways to separate elements based
on mass. Single ion orbits show that ion radial mass separation in a uniform
magnetized plasma column can be achieved by applying a tailored electric
potential profile across the column, or by driving a rotating magnetic field
within the column. Furthermore, magnetic pressure and centrifugal effects can
be combined in a non-uniform geometry to separate ions based on mass along the

a radar and a communication base station (BS) by simultaneously communicating
with downlink users and detecting radar targets. Two operational options are
considered, where we first split the antennas into two groups, one for radar
and the other for communication. Under this deployment, the radar signal is
designed to fall into the null-space of the downlink channel. The communication
beamformer is optimized such that the beampattern obtained matches the radar's
beampattern while satisfying the communication performance requirements. To
reduce the optimizations' constraints, we consider a second operational option,
where all the antennas transmit a joint waveform that is shared by both radar
and communications. In this case, we formulate an appropriate probing
beampattern, while guaranteeing the performance of the downlink communications.
By incorporating the SINR constraints into objective functions as penalty
terms, we further simplify the original beamforming designs to weighted
optimizations, and solve them by efficient manifold algorithms. Numerical
results show that the shared deployment outperforms the separated case
significantly, and the proposed weighted optimizations achieve a similar
performance to the original optimizations, despite their significantly lower
computational complexity.

geometric representations, such as the random walk and random current
representations, are powerful tools to understand spin models. In addition to
techniques intrinsic to spin models, such representations provide access to
rich ideas from percolation theory. In recent years, for two-dimensional spin
models, these ideas have been further combined with ideas from discrete complex
analysis. Spectacular results obtained through these connections include the
proofs that interfaces of the two-dimensional Ising model have conformally
invariant scaling limits given by SLE curves, that the connective constant of
the self-avoiding walk on the hexagonal lattice is given by $\sqrt{2+\sqrt 2}$.
In higher dimensions, the understanding also progresses with the proof that the
phase transition of Potts models is sharp, and that the magnetization of the
three-dimensional Ising model vanishes at the critical point.

tasks, especially for deep RL domains, where a state is represented by

agent to predict over the future transitions and evaluate the frequentness for

deep prediction model to predict future frames given a state-action pair, and a

utilize the counts derived from the seen frames to evaluate the frequentness
for the predicted frames, we tackle the challenge of matching the predicted

In this way, we derive a reliable metric for evaluating the novelty of the
future direction pointed by each action, and hence inform the agent to explore
the least frequent one.

long been used as an indicator of the grammage traversed in the journey of
cosmic ray particles throughout the Galaxy. The basic idea is that primary
particles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant
shocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally
interacting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce
secondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically
$\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of
the main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\delta}$, where $E_{k}$
is the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and
$\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The
same shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the
first place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided
being above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by
spallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get
accelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of
debate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium
taking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the
recent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron
and lithium flux. Both these sets of data seem to confirm that reacceleration
of secondary nuclei indeed plays an important role, thereby affecting the
validity of those scaling rules that are often used in cosmic ray physics.

  The observations reveal several velocity components in the field, with
strongest line emission concentrated to velocity range $\sim [3,5]$ km $\rm

from 1.0 to 2.3 $\times 10^{22}$ $\rm cm^{2}$. We have examined six cold clumps

personalized recommendation based on users' past feedback. In this paper, we
investigate the most common scenario: the user-item (U-I) matrix of implicit
feedback. Even though many recommendation approaches are designed based on
implicit feedback, they attempt to project the U-I matrix into a low-rank
latent space, which is a strict restriction that rarely holds in practice. In
addition, although misclassification costs from imbalanced classes are
significantly different, few methods take the cost of classification error into
account. To address aforementioned issues, we propose a robust framework by
decomposing the U-I matrix into two components: (1) a low-rank matrix that
captures the common preference, and (2) a sparse matrix that detects the
user-specific preference of individuals. A cost-sensitive learning model is
embedded into the framework. Specifically, this model exploits different costs
in the loss function for the observed and unobserved instances. We show that
the resulting non-smooth convex objective can be optimized efficiently by an
accelerated projected gradient method with closed-form solutions. Morever, the
proposed algorithm can be scaled up to large-sized datasets after a relaxation.
The theoretical result shows that even with a small fraction of 1's in the U-I
matrix $M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$, the cost-sensitive error of the proposed
model is upper bounded by $O(\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{mn}})$, where $\alpha$ is a
bias over imbalanced classes. Finally, empirical experiments are extensively
carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
Encouraging experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms several
state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark recommendation datasets.

equation for the PDF directly. In the classical limit where quantum diffusion
is small, we develop an expansion scheme that not only recovers the standard
Gaussian PDF at leading order, but also allows us to calculate the first
non-Gaussian corrections to the usual result. In the opposite limit where
quantum diffusion is large, we find that the PDF is given by an elliptic theta

and height (in Planck mass units) of the region where stochastic effects
dominate. We then apply these results to the calculation of the mass fraction

of Kepler with peculiar infrared colors placing them in the domain of suspected
young stellar objects (YSO). It is likely associated with a powerful X-ray
emitter with X-ray flares. Kepler light curves reveal two distinct types of
activity: frequent flares lasting from less than 30 min to a few hours and a
periodic variability with a period of 0.5463441(7) d. The largest flare
detected increased the flux in the Kepler passband by a factor of 2.8 and
released an estimated 4$\times10^{34}$ erg of energy in the Kepler band.
Segmented periodogram analysis reveals that the amplitude of the periodic
variation was subject to secular changes, dropping from peak values around 20
ppt to below 5 ppt toward the end of the mission, while the phase varied
periodically with an amplitude of 0.15 radians and period 362(3) d. Two
possible interpretations of the phase periodicity are discussed: a migrating
long-lived photospheric spot and a Doppler frequency shift generated by a
solar-mass faint companion, such as a white dwarf.

polar) went into a low-state in 2016, from which it slowly and steadily
recovered without showing dwarf nova outbursts. This requires explanation since
in a low-state, the mass-transfer rate is in principle too low for the disc to
be fully ionized and the disc should be subject to the standard thermal and
viscous instability observed in dwarf novae. We investigate the conditions
under which an accretion disc in an intermediate polar could exhibit a
luminosity drop of 2 magnitudes in the optical band without showing outbursts.
We use our numerical code for the time evolution of accretion discs, including
other light sources from the system (primary, secondary, hot spot). We show
that although it is marginally possible for the accretion disc in the low-state
to stay on the hot stable branch, the required mass-transfer rate in the normal
state would then have to be extremely high, of the order of 10$^{19}$ gs$^{-1}$
or even larger. This would make the system so intrinsically bright that its
distance should be much larger than allowed by all estimates. We show that
observations of FO Aqr are well accounted for by the same mechanism that we
have suggested as explaining the absence of outbursts during low states of VY
Scl stars: during the decay, the magnetospheric radius exceeds the
circularization radius, so that the disc disappears before it enters the
instability strip for dwarf nova outbursts. Our results are unaffected, and
even reinforced, if accretion proceeds both via the accretion disc and directly
via the stream during some intermediate stages; the detailed process through
which the disc disappears still needs investigations.

galaxy NGC 6145, which has a 150 kpc HI filament on one side that is nearly
parallel to its major axis. This filament is made up of several HI clouds and
the diffuse HI gas between them, with no optical counterparts. We compare its
HI distribution with other one-sided HI distributions in the literature, and
find that the overall HI distribution is very different from the typical tidal
and ram-pressure stripped HI shape, and its morphology is inconsistent with
being a pure accretion event. Only about 30% of the total HI gas is anchored on
the stellar disk, while most of HI gas forms the filament in the west. At a
projected distance of 122 kpc, we find a massive elliptical companion (NGC
6146) with extended radio emission, whose axis points to an HI gap in NGC 6145.
The velocity of the HI filament shows an overall light-of- sight motion of 80
to 180 km/s with respect to NGC 6145. Using the long-slit spectra of NGC 6145
along its major stellar axis, we find that some outer regions show enhanced
star formation, while in contrast, almost no star formation activities are
found in its center (less than 2 kpc). Pure accretion, tidal or ram-pressure
stripping is not likely to produce the observed HI filament. An alternative
explanation is the jet-stripping from NGC 6146, although direct evidence for a
jet-cold gas interaction has not been found.

Our paper presents a novel efficient gaze based text input method, which has
the advantage of low cost and robustness. Users can type in words by looking at
an on-screen keyboard and blinking. Rather than estimate gaze angles directly
to track eyes, we introduce a method that divides the human gaze into nine
directions. This method can effectively improve the accuracy of making a
selection by gaze and blinks. We build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
model for 9-direction gaze estimation. On the basis of the 9-direction gaze, we
use a nine-key T9 input method which is widely used in candy bar phones. Bar
phones were very popular in the world decades ago and have cultivated strong
user habits and language models. To train a robust gaze estimator, we created a
large-scale dataset with images of eyes sourced from 25 people. According to
the results from our experiments, our CNN model is able to accurately estimate
different people's gaze under various lighting conditions by different devices.
In considering disable people's needs, we removed the complex calibration

valid for $s$, $p_{1/2}$, and $p_{3/2}$ states of alkali-metal atoms and

increased accuracy is important for the analysis of atomic parity violation
measurements and may enable the accuracy of atomic parity violation

understanding of two-dimensional topological phases of matter. We focus, for
simplicity, on the gapped boundary of three-dimensional topological insulators
in class AII, which are described by a massive Dirac Hamiltonian and
characterized by an half-integer Chern number. The gap is induced by
introducing a magnetic perturbation, such as an external Zeeman field or a
ferromagnet on the surface. The quantum Bures metric acquires a central role in
our discussion and identifies a cigar geometry. We first derive the Chern
number from the cigar geometry and we then show that the quantum metric can be
seen as a solution of two-dimensional non-Abelian BF theory in momentum space.
The gauge connection for this model is associated to the Maxwell algebra, which
takes into account the Lorentz symmetries related to the Dirac theory and the
momentum-space magnetic translations connected to the magnetic perturbation.
The Witten black-hole metric is a solution of this gauge theory and coincides
with the Bures metric. This allows us to calculate the corresponding
momentum-space entanglement entropy that surprisingly carries information about
the real-space conformal field theory describing the defect lines that can be
created on the gapped boundary.

addition of multivalent cations into the electrolyte solution. Cation
adsorption into the pore enhances the screening ability of the pore medium with

galaxies in the local Universe, we study the dependence of star formation on
the morphological T-types for massive galaxies ($\log M_*/M_\odot \geq 10$). We
find that, early-type spirals (Sa-Sbc) and S0s predominate in the green valley,
which is a transition zone between the star forming and quenched regions.
Within the early-type spirals, as we move from Sa to Sbc spirals the fraction
of green valley and quenched galaxies decreases, indicating the important role
of the bulge in the quenching of galaxies. The fraction of early-type spirals
decreases as we enter the green valley from the blue cloud, which coincides
with the increase in the fraction of S0s. This points towards the morphological
transformation of early-type spiral galaxies into S0s which can happen due to
environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping, galaxy harassment, or
tidal interactions. We also find a second population of S0s which are actively
star-forming and are present in all environments. Since morphological T-type,
specific star formation rate (sSFR), and environmental density are all
correlated with each other, we compute the partial correlation coefficient for
each pair of parameters while keeping the third parameter as a control
variable. We find that morphology most strongly correlates with sSFR,
independent of the environment, while the other two correlations
(morphology-density and sSFR-environment) are weaker. Thus, we conclude that,
for massive galaxies in the local Universe, the physical processes that shape
their morphology are also the ones that determine their star-forming state.

offers increased robustness and significant performance advantages over
previously proposed wavefront prediction algorithms. It can be implemented as a
linear pattern matching algorithm, which decomposes in real time the input
(most recent wavefront sensor measurements) into a linear sum of previously
encountered patterns, and uses the coefficients of this linear expansion to
predict the future state. The process is robust against evolving conditions,
unknown spatio-temporal correlations and non-periodic transient events, and
enables multiple sensors (for example accelerometers) to contribute to the
wavefront estimation. We illustrate the EOFs advantages through numerical
simulations, and demonstrate filter convergence within 1 minute on a 1 kHz rate
system. We show that the EOFs approach provides significant gains in high

a residual speckle halo that is spatially and temporally uncorrelated.

set of the tree is a partition of $V(G)$ and contractions of tree vertices
satisfy sparsification requirements that preserve various types of cuts.
Recently, Kawarabayashi and Thorup \cite{Kawarabayashi2015a} presented the
first deterministic near-linear edge-connectivity recognition algorithm. A
crucial step in this algorithm uses the existence of vertex subsets of a simple
graph $G$ whose contractions leave a graph with $\tilde{O}(n/\delta)$ vertices
and $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges ($n := |V(G)|$) such that all non-trivial min-cuts of
$G$ are preserved. We improve this result by eliminating the poly-logarithmic
factors, that is, we show a contraction-based sparsification that leaves
$O(n/\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges and preserves all non-trivial min-cuts.
We complement this result by giving a sparsification that leaves $O(n/\delta)$
vertices and $O(n)$ edges such that all (possibly not minimum) cuts of size
less than $\delta$ are preserved, by using contractions in a second tree
structure. As consequence, we have that every simple graph has $O(n/\delta)$
$\delta$-edge-connected components, and, if it is connected, it has
$O((n/\delta)^2)$ non-trivial min-cuts. All these results are proven to be
asymptotically optimal.
  By using a third tree structure, we give a new lower bound on the number of
\emph{pendant pairs}. The previous best bound was given 1974 by Mader, who
showed that every simple graph contains $\Omega(\delta^2)$ pendant pairs. We
improve this result by showing that every simple graph $G$ with $\delta \geq 5$
or $\lambda \geq 4$ or $\kappa \geq 3$ contains $\Omega(\delta n)$ pendant
pairs. We prove that this bound is asymptotically tight from several
perspectives, and that $\Omega(\delta n)$ pendant pairs can be computed
efficiently.

high-quality items such as reliable news, beautiful movies, prestigious

conditions in which popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by
studying a simple model of cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of

the critical trade-off between quality and popularity. We find a regime of
intermediate exploration cost where an optimal balance exists, such that
choosing what is popular actually promotes high-quality items to the top.
Outside of these limits, however, popularity bias is more likely to hinder
quality. These findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias on
quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled mechanisms for

that combines the upgrade of transmission capacity with a transition in system
structure to improve grid operation. The key to this concept is a particular
hybrid AC/DC transmission grid architecture, which is obtained by uprating
selected AC lines via a conversion to HVDC. We have shown that this system
structure improves optimal power flow (OPF) solvability and that it can reduce
the total generation costs. In this work, we study the benefits of this hybrid
architecture in the context of a deregulated electricity market. We propose an
efficient and accurate nodal pricing method based on locational marginal prices
(LMPs) that utilizes a second-order cone relaxation of the OPF problem.
Applicability of this method requires exactness of the relaxation, which is
difficult to obtain for conventional meshed AC transmission grids. We prove
that the hybrid architecture ensures applicability if the LMPs do not coincide
with certain pathological price profiles, which are shown to be unlikely under
normal operating conditions. Using this nodal pricing method, we demonstrate
that upgrading to the hybrid architecture can not only increase the effective
transmission capacity but also reduce the separation of nodal markets and
improve the utilization of generation.

attribute this strong asymmetry to an overwhelming superiority of hydrogen

demonstrate that this situation can be completely reversed and an RLDRS effect
can occur by decreasing the concentration ratio between hydrogen and
recombination centers. We show that the decrease of recombination rate of holes
(generation rate of protons) with increasing dose rate is responsible for the
positive (negative) dose-rate dependence of RLDRS (ELDRS). We also find an
RLDRS-ELDRS transition for decreasing dose rate, in which the transition point

forces acting on a fish swimming horizontally with constant velocity.
Additionally, the open swimbladder compression with the depth is modelled by
Boyle's law. With these, our model gives an analytical solution relating the
depth with the body tilt angle and the velocity. An interesting result for
steady horizontal swimming is that the body tilt decreases with velocity almost
like $v^{-1}$. Moreover, we give an expression for the maximum tilt angle.
Then, by introducing the assumption of constant swimming power we relate the
swimming velocity with the tilting. Furthermore, we show that the
hydrodynamical influence of a temperature gradient produced by a thermocline
seems to be negligible for the fish tilting. These results are considerably
helpful for more realistic modelling of the \emph{acoustic target strength} of

higher star formation rate and higher gas-phase metallicity as a whole.
However, they have larger size and lower concentration than quiescent galaxies.
Unlike normal SF sample, the targeted sample exhibits a slightly positive

Short-range contributions to the total energy and exchange-correlation

long-range contribution is calculated using an explicit many-body Green's
function method. Such a hybrid results in a nonlocal, dynamic, and
orbital-dependent exchange-correlation functional of a single-particle Green's
function. In particular, we present a range-separated hybrid functional called
srSVWN5-lrGF2 which combines the local-density approximation and the
second-order Green's function theory. We illustrate that similarly to density
functional approximations the new functional is weakly basis-set dependent.
Furthermore, it offers an improved description of the short-range dynamical
correlation. The many-body contribution to the functional allows us to mitigate
the many-electron self-interaction error present in most of density functional
approximations and provides a better description of molecular properties.
Additionally, the new functional can be used to scale down the self-energy and,
therefore, introduce an additional sparsity to the self-energy matrix that in
the future can be exploited in calculations for large molecules or periodic

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1703.04394",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the importance of zero-shot learning, i.e. classifying images where
there is a lack of labeled training data, the number of proposed approaches has
recently increased steadily. We argue that it is time to take a step back and
to analyze the status quo of the area. The purpose of this paper is three-fold.
First, given the fact that there is no agreed upon zero-shot learning
benchmark, we first define a new benchmark by unifying both the evaluation
protocols and data splits of publicly available datasets used for this task.
This is an important contribution as published results are often not comparable
and sometimes even flawed due to, e.g. pre-training on zero-shot test classes.
Moreover, we propose a new zero-shot learning dataset, the Animals with
Attributes 2 (AWA2) dataset which we make publicly available both in terms of
image features and the images themselves. Second, we compare and analyze a
significant number of the state-of-the-art methods in depth, both in the
classic zero-shot setting but also in the more realistic generalized zero-shot
setting. Finally, we discuss in detail the limitations of the current status of
the area which can be taken as a basis for advancing it.

self-loops play important roles in quantum walk based algorithms. However, the
original model that adjusting the effect of self-loops by changing their number
has limitations. For example, the effect of self-loops cannot be adjusted
continuously, for their number must be an integer. In this paper, we proposed a
model of adjustable self-loop on discrete-time quantum walk, whose weight is
controlled by a real parameter in the coin operator. The proposed method not
only generalises the situations where the number of self-loops is an integer,
but also provides a way to adjust the weight of the self-loop continuously. It
enhances the potential of self-loops in applications. For instance, we improve
the success rate of the quantum walk based search on a $20\times20$
two-dimension lattice from $23.6\%$ to $97.2\%$ by the proposed method. And the
success rate of the improved search, which only scales as $O(1/\log{N})$ before
being improved, even increases slightly with the size of the lattice. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an improvement is
achieved on the quantum walk based spatial search.

of a set of B-spline curves. Instead of forming the computational domain by a
simple boundary, planar domains with high genus and more complex boundary
curves are considered. Firstly, some pre-processing operations including
B\'ezier extraction and subdivision are performed on each boundary curve in
order to generate a high-quality planar parameterization; then a robust planar
domain partition framework is proposed to construct high-quality patch-meshing
results with few singularities from the discrete boundary formed by connecting
the end points of the resulting boundary segments. After the topology
information generation of quadrilateral decomposition, the optimal placement of
interior B\'ezier curves corresponding to the interior edges of the
quadrangulation is constructed by a global optimization method to achieve a
patch-partition with high quality. Finally, after the imposition of
C1=G1-continuity constraints on the interface of neighboring B\'ezier patches
with respect to each quad in the quadrangulation, the high-quality B\'ezier
patch parameterization is obtained by a C1-constrained local optimization
method to achieve uniform and orthogonal iso-parametric structures while
keeping the continuity conditions between patches. The efficiency and
robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated by several examples which
are compared to results obtained by the skeleton-based parameterization
approach.

2009ip-like events are characterized by a long-lasting phase of erratic
variability which ends with two luminous outbursts a few weeks apart. The
second outburst is significantly more luminous (about 3 mag) than the first. In
the case of SN 2016bdu, the first outburst (Event A) reached an absolute
magnitude M(r) ~ -15.3 mag, while the second one (Event B) occurred over one
month later and reached M(r) ~ -18 mag. By inspecting archival data, a faint
source at the position of SN 2016bdu is detectable several times in the past
few years. We interpret these detections as signatures of a phase of erratic
variability, similar to that experienced by SN 2009ip between 2008 and
mid-2012, and resembling the currently observed variability of the luminous
blue variable SN 2000ch in NGC 3432. Spectroscopic monitoring of SN 2016bdu
during the second peak initially shows features typical of a SN IIn. One month
after the Event B maximum, the spectra develop broad Balmer lines with P Cygni
profiles and broad metal features. At these late phases, the spectra resemble
those of a typical Type II SN. All members of this SN 2009ip-like group are
remarkably similar to the Type IIn SN 2005gl. For this object, the claim of a
terminal SN explosion is supported by the disappearance of the progenitor star.
The similarity with SN 2005gl suggests that all members of this family may
finally explode as genuine SNe, although the unequivocal detection of
nucleosynthesised elements in their nebular spectra is still missing.

detect the valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection. Because electrons in
the lowest conduction band and the highest valence band of the BPC possess
opposite chirality, the inter-band Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed,
after multiple scattering and interference. We draw this conclusion by both the
scattering matrix analysis and the numerical simulation. The Andreev reflection
as a function of the incident energy of electrons and the local gate voltage at
the BPC is obtained, by which the parameter region for a perfect valley filter
and the direction of valley polarization can be determined. The Andreev
reflection exhibits an oscillatory decay with the length of the BPC, indicating
a negative correlation to valley polarization.

find that the frames are equivalent up to third order. Since the Hubble
slow-roll parameters are related to the potential slow-roll parameters, we
express the observables in terms of the latter which are manifestly invariant.
Nevertheless, the same inflaton excursion leads to different predictions in the
two frames since the definition of the number of e-folds differs. To illustrate
this effect we consider a nonminimal inflationary model and find that the
difference in the predictions grows with the nonminimal coupling and it can
actually be larger than the difference between the first and third order
results for the observables. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of various

important for the analyses of inflationary models in view of the improved

equivalence of proofs: to determine whether two given proofs are equated by any
denotational semantics, ie any categorical interpretation of the logic
compatible with its cut-elimination procedure. This notion can usually be
captured syntactically by a set of rule permutations.
  Very generally, proofnets can be defined as combinatorial objects which
provide canonical representatives of equivalence classes of proofs. In
particular, the existence of proof nets for a logic provides a solution to the
equivalence problem of this logic. In certain fragments of linear logic, it is
possible to give a notion of proofnet with good computational properties,
making it a suitable representation of proofs for studying the cut-elimination
procedure, among other things.
  It has recently been proved that there cannot be such a notion of proofnets
for the multiplicative (with units) fragment of linear logic, due to the
equivalence problem for this logic being Pspace-complete.
  We investigate the multiplicative-additive (without unit) fragment of linear
logic and show it is closely related to binary decision trees: we build a
representation of proofs based on binary decision trees, reducing proof
equivalence to decision tree equivalence, and give a converse encoding of
binary decision trees as proofs. We get as our main result that the complexity
of the proof equivalence problem of the studied fragment is Logspace-complete.

adjoint equation $L^*v=0$ is also solvable, where $p'=p/(p-1)$.
  This result is an analogue of the result established in the elliptic case by
Kenig and Pipher.
  In the parabolic settings in the special case of the heat equation in
slightly smoother domains this has been established by Hofmann and Lewis and
Nystr\""om for scalar parabolic systems. In comparison, our result is abstract
with no assumption on the coefficients beyond the ellipticity condition and is
valid in more general class of domains.

satellite mission, Theia, based on relative astrometry and extreme precision to
study the motion of very faint objects in the Universe. Theia is primarily
designed to study the local dark matter properties, the existence of Earth-like
exoplanets in our nearest star systems and the physics of compact objects.
Furthermore, about 15 $\%$ of the mission time was dedicated to an open
observatory for the wider community to propose complementary science cases.
With its unique metrology system and ""point and stare"" strategy, Theia's
precision would have reached the sub micro-arcsecond level. This is about 1000
times better than ESA/Gaia's accuracy for the brightest objects and represents
a factor 10-30 improvement for the faintest stars (depending on the exact
observational program). In the version submitted to ESA, we proposed an optical
(350-1000nm) on-axis TMA telescope. Due to ESA Technology readiness level, the
camera's focal plane would have been made of CCD detectors but we anticipated
an upgrade with CMOS detectors. Photometric measurements would have been
performed during slew time and stabilisation phases needed for reaching the
required astrometric precision.

measured between two plane electrodes in a longitudinal configuration is linear
within 2% provided the electric field is kept below 100 kV/m. Furthermore,
simulations show that the signal behaves like the amount of generated free
electrons. The slow ionic current measured with plane electrodes in a parallel
configuration is representative of the ionic charge available in the filament,
after several $\mu$s, when the free electrons have recombined. It is linear
within 2% with the amount of ions and is insensitive to misalignment. Finally,
the fast polarization signal in the same configuration deviates from linearity
by up to 80% and can only be considered as a semi-qualitative indication of the
presence of charges, e.g., to characterize the filament length.

describes past work - (a) omittance of an individual's strive for achieving
cognitive coherence, (b) limited integration of important contextual factors -
by utilizing networks of beliefs and incorporating social rank into the

increasingly coherent in terms of organizational culture, yet be composed of
individuals with reduced levels of coherence, (ii) the components of social
conformity - peer-pressure and social rank - are influential at different
aggregation levels.
