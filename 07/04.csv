for finite completability of low-rank matrices or tensors given the

the rank when an arbitrary low-rank completion is given. We characterize these

sampling pattern satisfies certain combinatorial properties, and
probabilistically, i.e., with high probability given that the sampling
probability is above some threshold. Moreover, for both single-view matrix and
CP tensor, we are able to show that the obtained upper bound is exactly equal
to the unknown rank if the lowest-rank completion is given. Furthermore, we
provide numerical experiments for the case of single-view matrix, where we use
nuclear norm minimization to find a low-rank completion of the sampled data and

gravitational wave stochastic background from supermassive black hole binary
populations, considered to be within the grasp of current or near future
observations. However, the stringent upperlimit set by the Parkes PTA (Shannon
et al. 2013, 2015) has been interpreted as excluding at $> 90\%$ confidence the
current paradigm of binary assembly through galaxy mergers and hardening via
stellar interactions, suggesting evolution is accelerated (by stars and/or gas)
or stalled. Using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we consider implications of
this upperlimit for a comprehensive range of astrophysical scenarios, without
invoking stalling nor more exotic physical processes. We find they are fully
consistent with the upperlimit, but (weak) bounds on population parameters can
be inferred. Bayes factors between models vary between $\approx 1.03$ -- $5.81$
and Kullback-Leibler divergences between characteristic amplitude prior and
posterior lie between $0.37$ -- $0.85$. Considering prior astrophysical
information on galaxy merger rates, recent upwards revisions of the black
hole-galaxy bulge mass relation (Kormendy & Ho 2013) are disfavoured at
$1.6\sigma$ against lighter models (e.g. Shankar et al. 2016). We also show, if
no detection is achieved once sensitivity improves by an order of magnitude,
the most optimistic scenario is disfavoured at $3.9\sigma$.

sets of two quadratic polynomials. The identifications are visualized and
understood by pinching ray-equivalence classes of the formal mating. For
postcritically finite polynomials in non-conjugate limbs of the Mandelbrot set,
classical results construct the geometric mating from the formal mating. Here
families of examples are discussed, such that all ray-equivalence classes are
uniformly bounded trees. Thus the topological mating is obtained directly in
geometrically finite and infinite cases. On the other hand, renormalization
provides examples of unbounded cyclic ray connections, such that the
topological mating is not defined on a Hausdorff space.
  There is an alternative construction of mating, when at least one polynomial
is preperiodic: shift the infinite critical value of the other polynomial to a
preperiodic point. Taking homotopic rays, it gives simple examples of shared
matings. Sequences with unbounded multiplicity of sharing, and slowly growing
preperiod and period, are obtained both in the Chebychev family and for
Airplane matings. Using preperiodic polynomials with identifications between
the two critical orbits, an example of mating discontinuity is described as
well.

19.4% of which are spectroscopically confirmed. The SED analysis was
complemented by estimating the gas masses of the SMGs by using the
$\lambda_{\rm obs}=1.3$ mm emission as a tracer of the molecular gas. The
sample median and 16th-84th percentile ranges of the stellar masses, SFRs, dust
temperatures, and dust and gas masses were derived to be $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm

of star-forming galaxies, while 41.9% of the sources lie above the MS by a
factor of >3 (one source lies below the MS). The largest 3 GHz radio sizes are
found among the MS sources. Those SMGs that appear irregular in the rest-frame
UV are predominantly starbursts, while the MS SMGs are mostly disk-like. The
larger radio-emitting sizes of the MS SMGs compared to starbursts is a likely
indication of their more widespread, less intense star formation. The irregular
UV morphologies of the starburst SMGs are likely to echo their merger nature.
Our results suggest that the transition from high-$z$ SMGs to local ellipticals
via compact, quiescent galaxies (cQGs) at $z \sim 2$ might not be universal,
and the latter population might also descend from the so-called blue nuggets.

is undecidable in general, even on classes of implementations where the usual

of HTTP/2.0, response size estimation attacks are generally dismissed with the
argument that pipelining and response multiplexing prevent eavesdroppers from
finding out response sizes. Yet the impact that pipelining and response
multiplexing actually have in estimating HTTP response sizes has not been
adequately investigated. In this paper we set out to help understand the effect
of pipelining and response multiplexing in estimating the size of web objects
on the Internet. We conduct an experiment that collects HTTP response sizes and
TLS record sizes from 10k popular web sites. We gather evidence on and discuss
reasons for the limited amount of pipelining and response multiplexing used on
the Internet today: only 29% of the HTTP2 web objects we observe are pipelined
and only 5% multiplexed. We also provide worst case results under different
attack assumptions and show how effective a simple model for estimating
response sizes from TLS record sizes can be. Our conclusion is that pipelining
and especially response multiplexing can yield, as expected, a perceivable
increase in relative object size estimation error yet the limited extent of
multiplexing observed on the Internet today and the relative simplicity of
attacks to the current pipelining mechanisms hinder their ability to help
prevent web object size estimation.

group dynamical stage for a subsample of Yang catalog. We classify groups
according to their galaxy velocity distribution into Gaussian (G) and
Non-Gaussian (NG). Using two totally independent approaches we have shown that
our measurement of Gaussianity is robust and reliable. Our sample covers Yang's
groups in the redshift range 0.03 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.1 having mass $\geq$
10$^{14} \rm M_{\odot}$. The new method, Hellinger Distance (HD), to determine
whether a group has a velocity distribution Gaussian or Non-Gaussian is very
effective in distinguishing between the two families. NG groups present halo
masses higher than the G ones, confirming previous findings. Examining the
Skewness and Kurtosis of the velocity distribution of G and NG groups, we find
that faint galaxies in NG groups are mainly infalling for the first time into
the groups. We show that considering only faint galaxies in the outskirts,
those in NG groups are older and more metal rich than the ones in G groups.
Also, examining the Projected Phase Space of cluster galaxies we see that
bright and faint galactic systems in G groups are in dynamical equilibrium
which does not seem to be the case in NG groups. These findings suggest that NG

become the state-of-the-art automatic segmentation methods. However, fully
automatic results may still need to be refined to become accurate and robust
enough for clinical use. We propose a deep learning-based interactive
segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to
reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy. We use one CNN
to obtain an initial automatic segmentation, on which user interactions are
added to indicate mis-segmentations. Another CNN takes as input the user
interactions with the initial segmentation and gives a refined result. We
propose to combine user interactions with CNNs through geodesic distance
transforms, and propose a resolution-preserving network that gives a better
dense prediction. In addition, we integrate user interactions as hard
constraints into a back-propagatable Conditional Random Field. We validated the
proposed framework in the context of 2D placenta segmentation from fetal MRI
and 3D brain tumor segmentation from FLAIR images. Experimental results show
our method achieves a large improvement from automatic CNNs, and obtains
comparable and even higher accuracy with fewer user interventions and less time
compared with traditional interactive methods.

authentication process adopts a modified Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol.
The Diffie-Hellman protocol is used with a short authentication string
(SAS)-based key agreement over Wi-Fi Direct out-of-band communication channels.
It protects the communication from any man-in-the-middle security threats. In
particular, the security process is integrated into two LAR routing schemes,
i.e., the request-zone LAR scheme and the distance-based LAR scheme. We conduct
extensive simulations with different network parameters such as the vehicular
node density, the number of the malicious nodes, and the speed of the nodes.
Simulation results show that the proposed routing protocols provide superior
performance in secure data delivery and average total packet delay. Also, the
secure distance-based LAR protocol outperforms the secure request-zone LAR

[1] used the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) to study the
height fluctuations in systems of the KPZ universality class for Brownian
interfaces with arbitrary diffusion constant. They showed that there is a
one-parameter family of long-time distributions, parametrized by the diffusion
constant of the initial random height profile. They also computed these

address this problem analytically and focus on the distribution tails at short

tail holds at arbitrary times and therefore provides a proper asymptotic to the
family of long-time distributions studied in Ref. [1]. We verify this
hypothesis by performing large-scale MC simulations of a TASEP with a
parallel-update rule. The ""fast"" tail, predicted by the OFM, is also expected
to hold at arbitrary times, at sufficiently large heights.

the equivalent of Sachs' constraint-free initial data as projections of
connection components related to null rotations, i.e. the translational part of
the ISO(2) group stabilising the internal null direction soldered to the
hypersurface. A pair of second-class constraints reduces these connection
components to the shear of a null geodesic congruence, thus establishing
equivalence with the second-order formalism, which we show in details at the
level of symplectic potentials. A special feature of the first-order
formulation is that Sachs' propagating equations for the shear, away from the
initial hypersurface, are turned into tertiary constraints; their role is to
preserve the relation between connection and shear under retarded time
evolution. The conversion of wave-like propagating equations into constraints
is possible thanks to an algebraic Bianchi identity; the same one that allows
one to describe the radiative data at future null infinity in terms of a shear
of a (non-geodesic) asymptotic null vector field in the physical spacetime.
Finally, we compute the modification to the spin coefficients and the null
congruence in the presence of torsion.

elucidated. The derivation of a general form of the commonly employed
approximate expression for the R-ratio (which constitutes its truncated
re-expansion at high energies) is delineated, the appearance of the pertinent
$\pi^2$-terms is expounded, and their basic features are examined. It is
demonstrated that the validity range of such approximation is strictly limited
to $\sqrt{s}/\Lambda > \exp(\pi/2) \simeq 4.81$ and that it converges rather
slowly when the energy scale approaches this value. The spectral function
required for the proper calculation of the R-ratio is explicitly derived and
its properties at the higher-loop levels are studied. The developed method of
calculation of the spectral function enables one to obtain the explicit
expression for the latter at an arbitrary loop level. By making use of the

Correlation Indices to defend against CCAs on static control applications.
These proposed indices relate the targets of CCAs with attack goals on the
power grid. Compared to related works, the proposed indices present the
benefits of deployment simplicity and are capable of detecting more
sophisticated attacks, such as measurement attacks. We demonstrate our method
using measurement attacks against Security Constrained Economic Dispatch.

bimodal distributions of luminosity and duration, i.e., extended (with

s), which are likely the central engine activities but not afterglows. The
extended emission has an isotropic energy comparable to the prompt emission,
while the plateau emission has $\sim0.01-1$ times of that energy. A half (50\%)
of our sample has both components, while the other half is consistent with
having both components. This leads us to conjecture that almost all short GRBs

explained by the jets from black holes with fallback ejecta, and could power
macronovae (or kilonovae) like GRB 130603B and GRB 160821B. Based on the

and relativistic physics. Here we introduce its basic quantum aspects. On one
hand, Newton's law of inertia states that every isolated particle has
persistent motion, i.e. constant energy and momentum. On the other hand, the
wave-particle duality associates a space-time recurrence to the elementary
particle energy-momentum. Paraphrasing these two fundamental principles,
Elementary Cycles Theory postulates that every isolated elementary constituent
of nature (every elementary particle) must be characterized by persistent
intrinsic space-time periodicity. Elementary particles are the elementary
reference clocks of Nature. The space-time periodicity is determined by the
kinematical state (energy and momentum), so that interactions imply
modulations, and every system is decomposable in terms of modulated elementary
cycles. Undulatory mechanics is imposed as constraint ""overdetermining""
relativistic mechanics, similarly to Einstein's proposal of unification.
Surprisingly this mathematically proves that the unification of quantum and
relativistic physics is fully achieved by imposing an intrinsically cyclic (or
compact) nature for relativistic space-time coordinates. In particular the
Minkowskian time must be cyclic. The resulting classical mechanics are in fact
fully consistent with relativity and reproduces all the fundamental aspects of
quantum-relativistic mechanics without explicit quantization. This
""overdetermination"" just enforces both the local nature of relativistic
space-time and the wave-particle duality. It also implies a fully
geometrodynamical formulation of gauge interactions which, similarly to gravity
and general relativity, is inferred as modulations of the elementary space-time
clocks. This brings novel elements to address most of the fundamental open
problems of modern physics.

VLT/MUSE archival data in combination with imaging from the Cluster Lensing and

identification of 23 new multiply imaged sources, extending the previous
compilations by a factor of approximately five. In total, we use the positional
measurements of 82 spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 27 families at
z=1.0-6.1 to reconstruct the projected total mass distribution of MACS 1206.
Remarkably, 11 multiple images are found within 50 kpc of the brightest cluster
galaxy, making this an unprecedented set of constraints for the innermost
projected mass distribution of a galaxy cluster. We thus find that, although
dynamically relaxed, the smooth matter component (dark matter plus hot gas) of
MACS 1206 shows a significant asymmetry, which closely follows the asymmetric
distribution of the stellar component (galaxy members and intracluster light).
We determine the value of the innermost logarithmic slope of the projected
total mass density profile and find it to be close to the canonical
Navarro-Frenk-White value. We demonstrate that this quantity is very robust
against different parametrizations of the diffuse mass component; however, this
is not the case when only one central image is used in the mass reconstruction.
We also show that the mass density profile from our new strong lensing model is
in very good agreement with dynamical and X-ray measurements at larger radii,
where they overlap.

and evolution of intermediate-mass stars. But determining this variable has
been a long-standing problem for decades. Detecting the companions (by
spectroscopy or imaging) is a difficult task because of the brightness of the
Cepheids and the close orbit of the components. So most of the Cepheid masses
are derived using stellar evolution or pulsation modeling, but they differ by
10-20%. Measurements of dynamical masses offer the unique opportunity to make
progress in resolving this mass discrepancy. The first problem in studying
binary Cepheids is the high contrast between the components for wavelengths
longer than 0.5 {\mu}m, which make them single-line spectroscopic binaries. In
addition, the close orbit of the companions (< 40 mas) prevents us from
spatially resolving the systems with a single-dish 8m-class telescope. A
technique able to reach high spatial resolution and high- dynamic range is
long-baseline interferometry. We have started a long-term program that aims at
detecting, monitoring and characterizing physical parameters of the Cepheid
companions. The GAIA parallaxes will enable us to combine interferometry with
single-line velocities to provide unique dynamical mass measurements of
Cepheids.

galaxies in the Universe, however their properties remain hard to determine due
to the difficulty of identifying their optical\slash near-infrared
counterparts. One of the key steps to determining the nature of SMGs is
measuring a redshift distribution representative of the whole population. We do
this by applying statistical techniques to a sample of 761 850$\mu$m sources
from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey observations of the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep
Survey (UDS) Field. We detect excess galaxies around $> 98.4$ per cent of the
850$\mu$m positions in the deep UDS catalogue, giving us the first 850$\mu$m
selected sample to have virtually complete optical\slash near-infrared redshift
information. Under the reasonable assumption that the redshifts of the excess
galaxies are representative of the SMGs themselves, we derive a median SMG
redshift of $z = 2.05 \pm 0.03$, with 68 per cent of SMGs residing between
$1.07 < z < 3.06$. We find an average of $1.52\pm 0.09$ excess $K$-band
galaxies within 12 arc sec of an 850$\mu$m position, with an average stellar
mass of $2.2\pm 0.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. While the vast majority of
excess galaxies are star-forming, $8.0 \pm 2.1$ per cent have passive
rest-frame colours, and are therefore unlikely to be detected at sub-millimetre
wavelengths even in deep interferometry. We show that brighter SMGs lie at
higher redshifts, and use our SMG redshift distribution -- along with the
assumption of a universal far-infrared SED -- to estimate that SMGs contribute
around 30 per cent of the cosmic star formation rate density between $0.5 < z <
5.0$.

relation between stellar age and $\Sigma_1$ at $z\sim0$. We use the Zurich
ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with a large
fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the
$\Sigma_1-M_{\star}$ plane, which we refer to as $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline. Colors
of ($B-I$) and ($I-J$) are used to divide QGs into three age categories: young
($<2~\mathrm{Gyr}$), intermediate ($2-4~\mathrm{Gyr}$), and old
($>4~\mathrm{Gyr}$). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline
have higher $\Sigma_1$ than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the
$\Sigma_1$ ridgeline at later epochs arrive with lower $\Sigma_1$, which drives
the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the present-day
zeropoint of the oldest population at $z=0$ with the zeropoint of the quiescent
population 4 Gyr back in time, at $z=0.37$. These zeropoints are identical,
showing that the intrinsic evolution of individual galaxies after they arrive
on the $\Sigma_1$ ridgeline must be negligible, or must evolve parallel to the
ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint
of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition
of newly quenched galaxies with lower $\Sigma_1$ at later times (""progenitor
bias""). While these results refer to the satellite-rich ZENS sample as a whole,
our work suggests a similar age-$\Sigma_1$ trend for central galaxies.

We apply our approach to two highly-reddened Type Ia supernovae for which dust
distance estimates are available in the literature: SN 2006X and SN 2014J. For
the former, we obtain a time-variable $E(B-V)$ and from this derive a distance

with dust at distances larger than 50 and 38 pc for LMC$-$ and MW$-$type dust,
respectively. Values thus extracted are in excellent agreement with previous
estimates for the two supernovae. Our findings suggest that dust responsible
for the extinction towards these supernovae is likely to be located within
interstellar clouds. We also discuss how other properties of reddened Type Ia
supernovae $-$ such as their peculiar extinction and polarization behaviour and
the detection of variable, blue-shifted sodium features in some of these events
$-$ might be compatible with dust and gas at interstellar-scale distances.

other SNe Ia may reflect that the explosions have different progenitors:
blueshifted Na-I D features might be explained by the outflows of
'single-degenerate' systems (binaries of a white dwarf with a non-degenerate
companion). In this work, we search for systematic differences among SNe Ia for
which the Na-I D characteristics have been clearly established in previous
studies. We perform an analysis of the chemical abundances in the outer ejecta
of 13 'spectroscopically normal' SNe Ia (five of which show blueshifted Na
lines), modelling time series of photospheric spectra with a radiative-transfer
code. We find only moderate differences between 'blueshifted-Na',
'redshifted-Na' and 'no-Na' SNe Ia, so that we can neither conclusively confirm
a 'one-scenario' nor a 'two-scenario' theory for normal SNe Ia. Yet, some of
the trends we see should be further studied using larger observed samples:
Models for blueshifted-Na SNe tend to show higher photospheric velocities than
no-Na SNe, corresponding to a higher opacity of the envelope. Consistently,
blueshifted-Na SNe show hints of a somewhat larger iron-group content in the
outer layers with respect to the no-Na subsample (and also to the redshifted-Na
subsample). This agrees with earlier work where it was found that the light
curves of no-Na SNe - often appearing in elliptical galaxies - are narrower,

this process is possible because the photon wave function is modified by the
dielectric layers (""Garibian wave function"") and is no longer an eigenstate of

probability between a quantized axion state and these distorted photon states
provides the microwave production rate. It agrees with previous results based
on solving the classical Maxwell equations for the combined system of axions

production rate is given by our result, independently of the detailed quantum
state of the axion field. Moreover, our result provides a new perspective on
axion-photon conversion in dielectric haloscopes because the rate is based on
an overlap integral between unperturbed axion and photon wave functions, in
analogy to the usual treatment of microwave-cavity haloscopes.

  Evolutionary Deep Networks","9 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Regression or classification? This is perhaps the most basic question faced
when tackling a new supervised learning problem. We present an Evolutionary
Deep Learning (EDL) algorithm that automatically solves this by identifying the
question type with high accuracy, along with a proposed deep architecture.
Typically, a significant amount of human insight and preparation is required
prior to executing machine learning algorithms. For example, when creating deep
neural networks, the number of parameters must be selected in advance and
furthermore, a lot of these choices are made based upon pre-existing knowledge
of the data such as the use of a categorical cross entropy loss function.
Humans are able to study a dataset and decide whether it represents a
classification or a regression problem, and consequently make decisions which
will be applied to the execution of the neural network. We propose the
Automated Problem Identification (API) algorithm, which uses an evolutionary
algorithm interface to TensorFlow to manipulate a deep neural network to decide
if a dataset represents a classification or a regression problem. We test API
on 16 different classification, regression and sentiment analysis datasets with
up to 10,000 features and up to 17,000 unique target values. API achieves an
average accuracy of $96.3\%$ in identifying the problem type without hardcoding
any insights about the general characteristics of regression or classification
problems. For example, API successfully identifies classification problems even
with 1000 target values. Furthermore, the algorithm recommends which loss
function to use and also recommends a neural network architecture. Our work is
therefore a step towards fully automated machine learning.

different story: much of the star formation arises in two dozen clumps with

a Majorana particle, its low-velocity annihilations are dominated by loop
suppressed annihilations into the gauge bosons, rather than by p-wave or
chirally suppressed annihilations into the SM fermions. Because the $Z'$ is
anomalous, these kinds of DM models can be realized only as effective field
theories (EFTs) with a well-defined cutoff, where heavy spectator fermions
restore gauge invariance at high energies. We formulate these EFTs, estimate
their cutoff and properly take into account the effect of the Chern-Simons

that, while for light DM collider and direct detection experiments usually
provide the strongest bounds, the bounds at higher masses are heavily dominated
by indirect detection experiments, due to strong annihilation into $W^+W^-$,
$ZZ$, $Z\gamma$ and possibly into $gg$ and $\gamma\gamma$. We emphasize that
these annihilation channels are generically significant because of the
structure of the EFT, and therefore these models are prone to strong indirect

illustrative purposes, our setup is completely generic and can be used for
analyzing the predictions of any anomalous $Z'$-mediated DM model with

been used to explain the existence of the $N-3$ constants of motion discovered

investigate geometric consequences of this M\""obius group action. The dynamics
of Kuramoto phase models can be further reduced to 2D reduced group orbits,
which have a natural geometry equivalent to the unit disk $\Delta$ with the
hyperbolic metric. We show that in this metric the original Kuramoto phase
model (with order parameter $Z_1$ equal to the centroid of the oscillator
configuration of points on the unit circle) is a gradient flow and the model
with order parameter $iZ_1$ (corresponding to cosine phase coupling) is a
completely integrable Hamiltonian flow. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for general Kuramoto phase models to be gradient or Hamiltonian
flows in this metric. This allows us to identify several new infinite families
of hyperbolic gradient or Hamiltonian Kuramoto oscillator networks which
therefore have simple dynamics with respect to this geometry. We prove that for
the $Z_1$ model, a generic 2D reduced group orbit has a unique fixed point
corresponding to the hyperbolic barycenter of the oscillator configuration, and
therefore the dynamics are equivalent on different generic reduced group

supernovae (SNe Ia) coupled with Cepheid distances to SN Ia host galaxies.
Recent results have shown tension comparing $H_0$ to the value inferred from
CMB observations assuming $\Lambda$CDM, making it important to check for
potential systematic uncertainties in either approach. To date, precise local
$H_0$ measurements have used SN Ia distances based on optical photometry, with
corrections for light curve shape and colour. Here, we analyse SNe Ia as
standard candles in the near-infrared (NIR), where intrinsic variations in the
supernovae and extinction by dust are both reduced relative to the optical.
From a combined fit to 9 nearby calibrator SNe with host Cepheid distances from
Riess et al. (2016) and 27 SNe in the Hubble flow, we estimate the absolute
peak $J$ magnitude $M_J = -18.524\;\pm\;0.041$ mag and $H_0 = 72.8\;\pm\;1.6$
(statistical) $\pm$ 2.7 (systematic) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The 2.2 $\%$
statistical uncertainty demonstrates that the NIR provides a compelling avenue
to measuring SN Ia distances, and for our sample the intrinsic (unmodeled) peak
$J$ magnitude scatter is just $\sim$0.10 mag, even without light curve shape or
colour corrections. Our results do not vary significantly with different sample
selection criteria, though photometric calibration in the NIR may be a dominant
systematic uncertainty. Our findings suggest that tension in the competing
$H_0$ distance ladders is likely not a result of supernova systematics that
could be expected to vary between optical and NIR wavelengths, like dust
extinction. We anticipate further improvements in $H_0$ with a larger
calibrator sample of SNe Ia with Cepheid distances, more Hubble flow SNe Ia
with NIR light curves, and better use of the full NIR photometric data set
beyond simply the peak $J$-band magnitude.

times of particular sports disciplines by a given overall finish time in a
specific triathlon course for the athlete with the known personal best result.
This is a hard task for athletes and sport trainers due to a lot of different
factors that need to be taken into account, e.g., athlete's abilities, health,
mental preparations and even their current sports form. So far, this process
was calculated manually without any specific software tools or using the
artificial intelligence. This paper presents the new solution for modeling
preference time in middle distance triathlons based on particle swarm
optimization algorithm and archive of existing sports results. Initial results
are presented, which suggest the usefulness of proposed approach, while remarks
for future improvements and use are also emphasized.

stability and contraction of dense condensations of gas and dust leading to the
formation of stars and planetary systems. In the present study, the magnetic
field of FeSt 1-457, a cold starless molecular cloud core, was mapped on the
basis of the polarized near-infrared light from 185 background stars after
being dichroically absorbed by dust aligned with the magnetic field in the
core. A distinct ""hourglass-shaped"" magnetic field was identified in the region
of the core, which was interpreted as the first evidence of a magnetic field
structure distorted by mass condensation in a starless core. The steep
curvature of the magnetic field lines obtained in the present study indicates
that the distortion was mainly created during the formation phase of the dense
core. The derived mass-to-magnetic flux ratio indicates that the core is in a
magnetically supercritical state. However, the stability of the core can be
considered to be in a nearly critical state if the additional contributions
from the thermal and turbulent support are included. Further diffusion of the
magnetic field and/or turbulent dissipation would cause the onset of dynamical
collapse of the core. The geometrical relationship between the direction of the
magnetic field lines and the elongation of the core was found to be in good
agreement with the theoretical predictions for the formation of Sun-like stars
under the influence of a magnetic field.

We propose a sampling method based on Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning

evaluate our proposed bound on both a standard grid navigation task and a

feature count-based baseline. We also give examples of how our proposed bound
can be utilized to perform risk-aware policy selection and risk-aware policy
improvement. Because our proposed bound requires several orders of magnitude
fewer demonstrations than existing high-confidence bounds, it is the first
practical method that allows agents that learn from demonstration to express
confidence in the quality of their learned policy.

governed by the coupling between gas and magnetic fields, described by three
non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar).
Previous local simulations incorporating these processes have revealed that the
inner regions of PPDs are largely laminar accompanied by wind-driven accretion.
We conduct 2D axisymmetric, fully global MHD simulations of these regions
($\sim1-20$ AU), taking into account all non-ideal MHD effects, with tabulated
diffusion coefficients and approximate treatment of external ionization and
heating. With net vertical field aligned with disk rotation, the Hall-shear
instability strongly amplifies horizontal magnetic field, making the overall
dynamics dependent on initial field configuration. Following disk formation,
the disk likely relaxes into an inner zone characterized by asymmetric field
configuration across the midplane that smoothly transitions to a more symmetric
outer zone. Angular momentum transport is driven by both MHD winds and laminar
Maxwell stress, with both accretion and decretion flows present at different
heights, and modestly asymmetric winds from the two disk sides. With
anti-aligned field polarity, weakly magnetized disks settle into an asymmetric
field configuration with supersonic accretion flow concentrated at one side of
disk surface, and highly asymmetric winds between the two disk sides. In all
cases, the wind is magneto-thermal in nature characterized by mass loss rate
exceeding the accretion rate. More strongly magnetized disks give more
symmetric field configuration and flow structures. Deeper far-UV penetration
leads to stronger and less stable outflows. Implications for observations and
planet formation are also discussed.

topographic features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. We observe that the
cumulative cliff height distribution across the surface follows a power law
with a slope equal to -1.69 +- 0.02. When this distribution is studied
independently for each region, we find a good correlation between the slope of
the power law and the orbital erosion rate of the surface. For instance, the
northern hemisphere topography is dominated by structures on the 100~m scale
while the southern hemisphere topography, illuminated at perihelion, is
dominated by 10~m scale terrain features. Our study suggest that the current
size of a cliff is controlled not only by material cohesion but by the dominant
erosional process in each region. This observation can be generalized to other
comets, where we argue that primitive nuclei are characterized by the presence
of large cliffs with a cumulative height power index equal to or above -1.5,
while older, eroded cometary surfaces have a power index equal to or below
-2.3. In effect, our model shows that a measure of the topography provides a
quantitative assessment of a comet's erosional history, i.e. its evolutionary
age.

enhance the convergence speed and strengthen feature propagation, skip-layer

measure the average linewidth of spectra with great precision. Unlike the
cross-correlation function (CCF), the ACF can be used without having to rely on
weighted binary masks. It makes the ACF much easier to use. We analyze 7
Cepheids and present a new method to obtain very precise turbulent velocity
curves for 6 of them by using the ACF. We compare our Full Widths at
Half-Maximum (FWHM) curves as a function of the pulsational phase to those of
Nardetto et al. (2006) who used the Fe I 6056.005 {\AA} line only. We note a
significant improvement in the shape of the FWHM curves for all Cepheids by
using the ACF. From the FWHM curves, we measure microturbulence curves for 6
Cepheids by using a Gaussian approximation. Finally, we artificially degrade
the resolution of the spectra and add noise to further assess and highlight the
advantages of the ACF. The FWHM curves obtained with the ACF remain virtually
unchanged up to a degradation by a factor of 10. A degradation by a factor of
20 slightly affected the results but an average linewidth variation remains
easily detectable.

the entropy of the internal adiabat $S_{min}$ below which the accreting

entropy material onto the growing interior. One implication of this would be to
at least temporarily halt the mixing of heavy elements within the planet, which
are deposited by planetesimals accreted during formation. The compositional
gradient this would impose could subsequently disrupt convection during
post-accretion cooling, which would alter the observed cooling curve of the
planet. However even with a homogeneous composition, for which convection
develops as the planet cools, the difference in cooling timescale will change
the inferred mass of directly-imaged gas giants.

central point mass is widely adopted. In this work we generalize the classical
Bondi accretion theory to take into account the effects of the gravitational
potential of the host galaxy, and of radiation pressure in the optically thin
limit. Then, we present the fully analytical solution, in terms of the
Lambert-Euler $W$-function, for isothermal accretion in Jaffe and Hernquist

to the shape of the mass profile of the host galaxy. These results and the
formulae that are provided, mostly important the one for the critical accretion
parameter, allow for a direct evaluation of all flow properties, and are then
useful for the above mentioned studies. As an application, we examine the
departure from the true mass accretion rate of estimates obtained using the gas
properties at various distances from the black hole, under the hypothesis of
classical Bondi accretion. An overestimate is obtained from regions close to
the black hole, and an underestimate outside a few Bondi radii; the exact
position of the transition between the two kinds of departure depends on the

stochastic epidemic model itself, improving over the mean-field type
convergence results of most prior work. There are two primary technical
difficulties addressed in treating this problem: (i) constructing a means of
tractably approximating the evolution of the process, so that the designed
approximation is robust to the modeling error introduced by the applied moment
closure, and (ii) guaranteeing that the designed controller causes the
closed-loop system to drive the SEIV process to extinction quickly. As an
application, we use the developed framework for optimizing the use of

molecular hydrogen in the disc of the Milky Way inside the Solar circle are

divide the Galactic disc into a series of rings, and assume that the gas in
each ring is described by four parameters: its rotation velocity, velocity
dispersion, midplane density and its scale height. We fit these parameters to
the Galactic HI and CO (J=1-0) data by producing artificial HI and CO
line-profiles and comparing them with the observations. Our approach allows us
to fit all parameters to the data simultaneously without assuming a-priori a
radial profile for one of the parameters. We present the distribution and
kinematics of the HI and H2 in both the approaching (QIV) and the receding (QI)
regions of the Galaxy. Our best-fit models reproduces remarkably well the
observed HI and CO longitude-velocity diagrams up to a few degrees of distance
from the midplane. With the exception of the innermost 2.5 kpc, QI and QIV show
very similar kinematics. The rotation curves traced by the HI and H2 follow
closely each other, flattening beyond R=6.5 kpc. Both the HI and the H2 surface
densities show a) a deep depression at 0.5<R<2.5 kpc, analogous to that shown
by some nearby barred galaxies, b) local overdensities that can be interpreted
in terms of spiral arms or ring-like features in the disk. The HI (H2)
properties are fairly constant in the region outside the depression, with
typical velocity dispersion of 8.9+/-1.1 (4.4+/-1.2) km/s, density of
0.43+/-0.11 (0.42+/-0.22) cm-3 and HWHM scale height of 202+/-28 (64+/-12) pc.
We also show that the HI opacity in the LAB data can be accounted for by using
an `effective' spin temperature of about 150 K: assuming an optically thin

indicate that most clusters possess a \Q\ parameter that falls in the range

light ratio and compare with red sequence galaxies from the lower-redshift
WINGS and EDisCS surveys. We find that, while the HCS red sequence is dominated
by elliptical galaxies at all luminosities and stellar masses, the WINGS red
sequence is dominated by elliptical galaxies only at its bright end
($M_V<-21.0$ mag), while S0s become the most frequent class at fainter
luminosities. Disc-dominated galaxies comprise 10-14\% of the red sequence
population in the low (WINGS) and high (HCS) redshift samples, although their
fraction increases up to 40\% at $0.4 < z < 0.8$ (EDisCS). We find a 20\%
increase in the fraction of S0 galaxies from $z \sim 1.5$ to $z \sim 0.05$ on

origin, that is, arise as subquotients of a Gau\ss-Manin connection of a family
of smooth projective varieties defined on an open dense subvariety of $X$. In
this article we study mod $p$ reductions of irreducible rigid connections and
establish results which confirm Simpson's prediction. In particular, for large
$p$, we prove that $p$-curvatures of mod $p$ reductions of irreducible rigid
flat connections are nilpotent, and building on this result, we construct an

invariance in a network when used in conjunction with convolutional layers. We
are motivated by the observation that, even though convolutional networks have
low generalization error, their generalization capability does not extend to
samples which are not represented by the training data. For instance, while
novel appearances of learned concepts pose no problem for the human visual
system, feedforward convolutional networks are generally not successful in such
situations. Motivated by the Gestalt principle of grouping with respect to
similarity, the proposed NSL transforms its input feature map using the feature
vectors at each pixel as a frame of reference, i.e. center of attention, for
its surrounding neighborhood. This transformation is spatially varying, hence
not a convolution. It is differentiable; therefore, networks including the
proposed layer can be trained in an end-to-end manner. We analyze the
invariance of NSL to significant changes in appearance that are not represented
in the training data. We also demonstrate its advantages for digit recognition,
semantic labeling and cell detection problems.

constant throughout its dynamical evolution. This is a consequence of
Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems and appears to contradict the

the thermodynamic entropy should be associated with the Boltzmann entropy,
which for non-equilibrium systems is different from Gibbs entropy. The
Boltzmann entropy accounts for the microstates which are not accessible from a
given initial condition, but are compatible with a given macrostate. In a sense
the Boltzmann entropy is a coarse grained version of the Gibbs entropy and will
not decrease during the dynamical evolution of a macroscopic system. In this
paper we will explore the entropy production for systems with long range
interactions. Unlike for short range systems, in the thermodynamic limit, the
probability density function for these systems decouples into a product of one
particle distribution functions and the coarse grained entropy can be
calculated explicitly. We find that the characteristic time for the entropy

areas via a rich diversity of spatiotemporal patterns. In particular, while the
location of the seizure onset area is usually in-variant across seizures in a
same patient, the source of traveling (2-3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs)
during seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or
remain stationary at the seizure onset area. In addition, although most focal
seizures terminate quasi-synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into
distinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. To provide a unifying
perspective on the observed diversity of spatiotemporal dynamics for seizure
spread and termination, we introduce here the Epileptor neural field model. Two
mechanisms play an essential role. First, while the slow ictal wavefront
propagates as a front in excitable neural media, the faster SWDs propagation
results from coupled-oscillator dynamics. Second, multiple time scales interact
during seizure spread, allowing for low-voltage fast-activity (>10 Hz) to
hamper seizure spread and for SWD propagation to affect the way a seizure
terminates. These dynamics, together with variations in short and long-range
connectivity strength, play a central role on seizure spread, maintenance and
termination. We demonstrate how Epileptor field models incorporating the above
mechanisms predict the previously reported diversity in seizure spread
patterns. Furthermore, we confirm the predictions for synchronous or
asynchronous (clustered) seizure termination in human seizures recorded via
stereotactic EEG. Our new insights into seizure spatiotemporal dynamics may
also contribute to the development of new closed-loop neuromodulation therapies
for focal epilepsy.

orbiting solar-type stars, a fraction of them have been discovered around giant
stars. These planetary systems have revealed different orbital properties when
compared to solar-type stars companions. In particular, radial velocity surveys
have shown that there is a lack of giant planets in close-in orbits around
giant stars, in contrast to the known population of hot-Jupiters orbiting
solar-type stars. The reason of this distinctive feature in the semimajor-axis
distribution has been theorized to be the result of the stellar evolution
and/or due to the effect of a different formation/evolution scenario for
planets around intermediate-mass stars. However, in the past few years, a
handful of transiting short-period planets (P$\lesssim$ 10 days) have been
found around giant stars, thanks to the high precision photometric data
obtained initially by the Kepler mission, and later by its two-wheels extension
K2. These new discoveries, have allowed us for the first time to study the
orbital properties and physical parameters of these intriguing and elusive
sub-stellar companions. In this paper we report on an independent discovery of
a transiting planet in field 10 of the K2 mission, also reported recently by
Grunblatt et al. (2017). The main orbital parameters of EPIC\,228754001\,$b$,
obtained with all the available data for the system, are the following: $P$ =
9.1708 $\pm$ 0.0025 $d$, $e$ = 0.290 $\pm$ 0.049, Mp = 0.495 $\pm$ 0.007 Mjup

subtle distinctions, is a challenging task due to two main issues: lack of
sufficient training data for every class and difficulty in learning
discriminative features for representation. In this paper, to address the two
issues, we propose a two-phase framework for recognizing images from unseen
fine-grained classes, i.e. zero-shot fine-grained classification. In the first
feature learning phase, we finetune deep convolutional neural networks using
hierarchical semantic structure among fine-grained classes to extract
discriminative deep visual features. Meanwhile, a domain adaptation structure
is induced into deep convolutional neural networks to avoid domain shift from
training data to test data. In the second label inference phase, a semantic
directed graph is constructed over attributes of fine-grained classes. Based on
this graph, we develop a label propagation algorithm to infer the labels of
images in the unseen classes. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot learning
models. In addition, the features obtained by our feature learning model also
yield significant gains when they are used by other zero-shot learning models,
which shows the flexility of our model in zero-shot fine-grained
classification.

to a low scatter achieved in the [FeII/H] ratio. The mean of [FeII/H] within $R

dex, than in the outer region, in agreement with our original estimate for a
much larger sample size within $R \approx 9'$. We found that an older dataset
traces the trend to a much larger radial distance, comparable with the cluster
tidal radius, at $\Delta$[Fe/H]$\sim$0.2 dex due to higher metallicity of
distant stars. We conclude the trend is reproduced by independent datasets and
find that it is accompanied with both a notable same-sign trend of oxygen
abundance which can vary by up to $\Delta$[O/Fe]$\sim$0.3 dex within $R \approx

corrections, the Strickland-Romatschke (SR) ansatz, self-consistent shear
corrections from linearized kinetic theory, and the correction from the
relaxation time approach. We test how well the conversion models can

the phase space density for a massless one-component gas undergoing a 0+1D
longitudinal boost-invariant expansion with approximately constant specific
shear viscosity in the range $\sim 0.03 \le \eta/s \le \sim 0.2$.
  In general we find that at early times the SR form is the most accurate,

corrections from kinetic theory perform the best. In addition, we show that the
reconstruction accuracy of additive shear viscous $f = f_{\rm eq} + \delta f$
models dramatically improves if one ensures, through ""exponentiation"", that $f$
is always positive. We also illustrate how even more accurate viscous $\delta
f$ models can be constructed if one includes information about the past

Such time derivatives are readily available in hydrodynamic simulations, though

However, it might also cause a cognitive load to reorient the primary task,
which accounts for the decrease in developers' productivity and increases in
errors. This cognitive load is even greater in cases of cognitively demanding
tasks as the ones typical for RE activities. In this paper, to compare the
reality of task switching in RE with the perception of developers, we conducted
two studies: (i) a case study analysis on 5,076 recorded tasks of 19 developers

show that in ALL of the cases that the disruptiveness of RE interruptions is
statistically different from other software development tasks, RE related tasks
are more vulnerable to interruptions compared to other task types. Moreover, we
found that context switching, the priority of the interrupting task, and the
interruption source and timing are key factors that impact RE interruptions. We

  Distributed Sensor Networks)",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses information-based sensing point selection from a set of
possible sensing locations, which determines a set of measurement points
maximizing the mutual information between the sensor measurements and the
variables of interest. A potential game approach has been applied to addressing
distributed implementation of decision making for cooperative sensor planning.
When a sensor network involves a large number of sensing agents, the local
utility function for a sensing agent is hard to compute, because the local
utility function depends on the other agents' decisions while each sensing
agent is inherently faced with limitations in both its communication and
computational capabilities. Accordingly, a local utility function for each
agent should be approximated to accommodate limitations in information
gathering and processing. We propose an approximation method for a local
utility function using only a portion of the decisions of other agents. The
part of the decisions that each agent considers is called the neighboring set
for the agent. The error induced by the approximation is also analyzed, and to
keep the error small we propose a neighbor selection algorithm that chooses the
neighbor set for each agent in a greedy way. The selection algorithm is based
on the correlation information between one agent's measurement selection and
the other agents' selections. Futhermore, we show that a game with an
approximate local utility function has an $\epsilon$-equilibrium and the set of
the equilibria include the Nash equilibrium of the original potential game. We
demonstrate the validity of our approximation method through two numerical
examples on simplified weather forecasting and multi-target tracking.

such representations commonly focus on several body parts discriminative to the

risk minimization principle in SVM, we revise the traditional deep
representation learning procedure to minimize both the empirical classification
risk and the representation learning risk. The representation learning risk is
evaluated by the proposed part loss, which automatically generates several
parts for an image, and computes the person classification loss on each part
separately. Compared with traditional global classification loss,
simultaneously considering multiple part loss enforces the deep network to
focus on the entire human body and learn discriminative representations for
different parts. Experimental results on three datasets, i.e., Market1501,
CUHK03, VIPeR, show that our representation outperforms the existing deep
representations.

the farthest persistent emitter of very-high-energy (VHE; E $\geq$ 100 GeV)

generally our comprehension of blazar emission models, and how they are related
to the luminosity of the source and the peak frequency. We investigate
different blazar emission models applied to the SED of PKS1424+240. Among
leptonic models, we study a 1-zone SSC model, a 2-zone SSC model, and an EIC
model. We then investigate a blazar hadronic model, and finally a scenario in
which the $\gamma$-ray emission is associated with cascades in the

the minimum rate required for an input process so that the output distribution
approximates a target distribution in either the total variation distance or
the relative entropy. In contrast to previous works, in this paper, we use the
(normalized or unnormalized) R\'enyi divergence (with the R\'enyi parameter in
$[0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$) to measure the level of approximation. We also provide
asymptotic expressions for normalized R\'enyi divergence when the R\'enyi
parameter is larger than or equal to $1$ as well as (lower and upper) bounds
for the case when the same parameter is smaller than $1$. We characterize the
R\'enyi resolvability, which is defined as the minimum rate required to ensure
that the R\'enyi divergence vanishes asymptotically. The R\'enyi
resolvabilities are the same for both the normalized and unnormalized
divergence cases. In addition, when the R\'enyi parameter smaller than~$1$,
consistent with the traditional case where the R\'enyi parameter is equal
to~$1$, the R\'enyi resolvability equals the minimum mutual information over
all input distributions that induce the target output distribution. When the
R\'enyi parameter is larger than $1$ the R\'enyi resolvability is, in general,
larger than the mutual information. The optimal R\'enyi divergence is proven to
vanish at least exponentially fast for both of these two cases, as long as the
code rate is larger than the R\'enyi resolvability. The optimal exponential
rate of decay for i.i.d.\ random codes is also characterized exactly. We apply
these results to the wiretap channel, and completely characterize the optimal
tradeoff between the rates of the secret and non-secret messages when the
leakage measure is given by the (unnormalized) R\'enyi divergence.

investigate QPI at the vacuum-cleaved (001) surface of the Dirac semimetal
ZrSiS. We find that interference patterns around impurities located on the Zr

scattering of different sub-sets of the predominantly Zr 4d-derived band

the usual assumption of generic scattering centers allowing observations of
quasiparticle interference to shed light indiscriminately and isotropically

poses independent of clothing textures, backgrounds, lighting conditions, body
shapes and camera viewpoints. Learning such universal models requires training
images where all factors are varied for every human pose. Capturing such data
is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we develop a framework for synthesizing
the training data. First, we learn representative human poses from a large
corpus of real motion captured human skeleton data. Next, we fit synthetic 3D
humans with different body shapes to each pose and render each from 180 camera
viewpoints while randomly varying the clothing textures, background and
lighting. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to minimize the gap
between synthetic and real image distributions. CNN models are then learned
that transfer human poses to a shared high-level invariant space. The learned
CNN models are then used as invariant feature extractors from real RGB and
depth frames of human action videos and the temporal variations are modelled by
Fourier Temporal Pyramid. Finally, linear SVM is used for classification.
Experiments on three benchmark cross-view human action datasets show that our
algorithm outperforms existing methods by significant margins for RGB only and
RGB-D action recognition.

the Internet of Things (IoT), and with that the need to ingest and analyze data
streams at rates higher than before. Some industrial IoT applications require
ingesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently
ingested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems suited
to multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even
if they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large
number of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we
evaluate a single-node multidimensional data store for high-velocity sensor
data. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the
global index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized
kd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and
range queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage
footprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and
offers ingress rates two orders of magnitude higher than those of Percona
Server, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times
comparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares
favorably in terms of storage footprint. In addition, we evaluate a kd-tree
partitioning based scheme for grouping incoming streamed data records. Compared
to a random scheme, this scheme produces less overlap between groups of
streamed records, but contrary to what we expected, such reduced overlap does
not translate into better query performance. By contrast, the local indices
prove much more beneficial to query performance. We believe the experience
reported in this paper is valuable to practitioners and researchers alike
interested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional
data.

problems. In many practical applications, one needs to draw inference from one
or few large sparse networks. The present paper studies hypothesis testing of
graphs in this high-dimensional regime, where the goal is to test between two
populations of inhomogeneous random graphs defined on the same set of $n$
vertices. The size of each population $m$ is much smaller than $n$, and can
even be a constant as small as 1. The critical question in this context is
whether the problem is solvable for small $m$.
  We answer this question from a minimax testing perspective. Let $P,Q$ be the
population adjacencies of two sparse inhomogeneous random graph models, and $d$
be a suitably defined distance function. Given a population of $m$ graphs from
each model, we derive minimax separation rates for the problem of testing $P=Q$
against $d(P,Q)>\rho$. We observe that if $m$ is small, then the minimax
separation is too large for some popular choices of $d$, including total
variation distance between corresponding distributions. This implies that some
models that are widely separated in $d$ cannot be distinguished for small $m$,
and hence, the testing problem is generally not solvable in these cases.
  We also show that if $m>1$, then the minimax separation is relatively small
if $d$ is the Frobenius norm or operator norm distance between $P$ and $Q$. For
$m=1$, only the latter distance provides small minimax separation. Thus, for
these distances, the problem is solvable for small $m$. We also present
near-optimal two-sample tests in both cases, where tests are adaptive with
respect to sparsity level of the graphs.

Sobolev-type spaces involving Riemann-Liouville (RL) fractional
integrals/derivatives, which is naturally arisen from exact representations of
Chebyshev expansion coefficients, for optimal error estimates of Chebyshev
approximations to functions with limited regularity. The essential pieces of
the puzzle for the error analysis include (i) fractional integration by parts
(under the weakest possible conditions), and (ii) generalised Gegenbauer
functions of fractional degree (GGF-Fs): a new family of special functions with
notable fractional calculus properties. Under this framework, we are able to
estimate the optimal decay rate of Chebyshev expansion coefficients for a large
class of functions with interior and endpoint singularities, which are deemed
suboptimal or complicated to characterize in existing literature. We can then
derive optimal error estimates for spectral expansions and the related
Chebyshev interpolation and quadrature measured in various norms, and also
improve the available results in usual Sobolev spaces of integer regularity
exponentials in several senses. As a by-product, this study results in some
analytically perspicuous formulas particularly on GGF-Fs, which are potentially
useful in spectral algorithms. The idea and analysis techniques can be extended
to general Jacobi spectral approximations.

used for distributed storage. They are defined to be able to correct any

codes, another class of locally repairable codes. It is known that MR codes in

the notion of PMDS codes to allow locality groups of different sizes. We give a

highly judgmental task, with user expertise playing a significant role in
distinguishing between estimated physical and noise modes of a test-piece.
Various methods have been developed to automate this procedure. The common
approach is to identify models with different orders and cluster similar modes
together. However, most proposed methods based on this approach suffer from
high-dimensional optimization problems in either the estimation or clustering
step. To overcome this problem, this study presents an algorithm for autonomous
modal parameter estimation in which the only required optimization is performed
in a three-dimensional space. To this end, a subspace-based identification
method is employed for the estimation and a non-iterative correlation-based
method is used for the clustering. This clustering is at the heart of the
paper. The keys to success are correlation metrics that are able to treat the
problems of spatial eigenvector aliasing and nonunique eigenvectors of
coalescent modes simultaneously. The algorithm commences by the identification
of an excessively high-order model from frequency response function test data.
The high number of modes of this model provide bases for two subspaces: one for
likely physical modes and one for its complement dubbed the subspace of noise
modes. By employing the bootstrap resampling technique, several subsets are
generated from the same basic dataset and for each of them a model is
identified to form a set of models. Then, by correlation analysis, highly
correlated modes of these models which appear repeatedly are clustered together
and the noise modes are collected in a so-called Trashbox cluster. Stray noise
modes attracted to the mode clusters are trimmed away by correlation analysis.
The final step is a fuzzy c-means clustering procedure.

and independent of the average photon-numbers either. The correlation varies
periodically with time in the general entangled-states for the low average
photon-numbers. When the photon number increases to a certain value the
oscillation becomes random and the correlations are suppressed below the Bell
bound indicating the decoherence of the entangled states. In the high
photon-number limit the coherence revivals periodically such that the CHSH
correlation approaches the upper bound value at particular time points

regulatory networks and surrounding environments of the cells are crucial for
function. The self-repressor is a very abundant gene regulatory motif, and is
often believed to have only one cell fate. In this study, we elucidate the
effects of microenvironments mimicking the epigenetic effects on cell fates
through the introduction of inducers capable of binding to a self-repressing
gene product (protein), thus regulating the associated gene. This alters the
effective regulatory binding speed of the self-repressor regulatory protein to
its destination DNA without changing the gene itself. The steady state
observations and real time monitoring of the self-repressor expression dynamics
reveal the emergence of the two cell fates, The simulations are consistent with
the experimental findings. We provide physical and quantitative explanations

rather than a single fate, and their associated switching dynamics emerge from
a change in effective gene regulation strengths. The switching time scale is
quantified. Our results reveal a new mechanism for the emergence of multiple

magnetic patterns of all possible single lattice constant two dimensional
magnetic point group symmetries is studied experimentally, theoretically, and
with numerical simulations. We examine the transport of colloidal particles in
response to modulation loops of the external field. We classify the modulation
loops into topologically distinct classes causing different transport. We show
that the lattice symmetry has a profound influence on the transport modes, the
accessibility of transport networks, and the individual addressability of
paramagnetic versus diamagnetic colloidal particles. We show how the transport
of colloidal particles above a two fold symmetric stripe pattern changes from
universal adiabatic transport at large elevations via a topologically protected
ratchet motion at intermediate elevations toward a non-transport regime at low
elevations. Transport above four fold symmetric patterns is closely related to
the transport above two fold symmetric patterns. There exists a family of three
fold symmetric patterns that vary as a function of the phase of the pattern. We
show how this family can be divided into two topologically distinct classes
supporting different transport modes and being protected by proper and improper
six fold symmetries. Both classes support individual control over the transport
of paramagnetic and diamagnetic particles. We discuss the topological
transition when moving the phase from one class of pattern to the other class.
The similarities and the differences in the lattice symmetry protected
transport of classical over-damped colloidal particles versus the topologically
protected transport in quantum mechanical systems are emphasized

conventional computation, allows for substantial speed-ups e.g. for integer
factorization or database search. However, since physical realizations of
quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in
this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional
machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art
simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based
representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist
solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to
tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states
and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit
redundancies that are actually present. In this work, we revisit the basics of
quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum
operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated
in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation

corresponding Neumann initial-boundary value problem in an $n$-dimensional
bounded smooth domain possesses a unique global classical solution which is
uniformly-in-time bounded regardless of the strength of the cross-diffusion and
the spatial dimension $n$. It is further shown that, even in the presence of
cross-diffusion, the models still admit threshold-type dynamics in terms of the
basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$; that is, the unique disease free
equilibrium is globally stable if $\mathcal R_0<1$, while if $\mathcal R_0>1$,
the disease is uniformly persistent and there is an endemic equilibrium, which
is globally stable in some special cases with weak chemotactic sensitivity. Our
results on the asymptotic profiles of endemic equilibrium illustrate that
restricting the motility of susceptible population may eliminate the infectious
disease entirely for the first model with constant total population but fails
for the second model with varying total population. In particular, this implies
that such cross-diffusion does not contribute to the elimination of the

has been explored in the ac conductivity domain for polycrystalline double
perovskite oxides A2HoRuO6 (AHR; A = Ba, Sr, Ca). The samples show different
structural phases ranging from cubic to monoclinic with decreasing ionic radii.
The degree of distortion in the materials is correlated to the strength of
bonding through the bond valence sum (BVS). The conductivity spectra for all
the samples obey the power law behaviour. The contribution of different
microstructural features to the conduction process is established. Thermal
variation of dc resistivity points towards a gradual crossover from nearest
neighbour to variable range hopping. The activation energies obtained from dc
conductivity, hopping frequency and relaxation frequency show close correlation
between the conduction and relaxation mechanisms. The scaled conductivity
curves for AHR showed the presence of two different conduction processes with
dissimilar activation energies in the grain boundary and grain response
regimes. It is thus concluded that a single scaling parameter is insufficient
to satisfy the time temperature superposition principle universally when two
different thermally activated regions are present simultaneously in the

parameters in the case of restricted or redundant data, based on a hybrid
approach combining a genetic algorithm and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The
proposed methodology consists essentially in a statistically based topological
analysis of the search domain, after this one has been reduced by the analysis
of the parameters ranges. This is used to identify the parameters of a model
representing the behavior of damaged elastic, visco-elastic, plastic and
visco-plastic composite laminates. Optimization of the experimental tests on
tubular samples leads to the selective identification of these parameters.

sphere $S^4_N$ in the semi-classical limit. The space of functions can be
identified with functions on classical $S^4$ taking values in a higher spin
algebra associated to $\mathfrak{so}(5)$. We derive an explicit and complete
classification of the scalars and one-forms on the semi-classical limit of
$S_N^4$. The resulting kinematics is reminiscent of Vasiliev theory. Yang-Mills
matrix models naturally provide an action formulation for higher spin gauge
theory on $S^4$, with 4 irreducible modes for each spin $s\geq 1$. We
diagonalize the quadratic part of the effective action and exactly evaluate the
quadratic part in the spin 2 sector. By identifying the linear perturbation of
the effective metric, we obtain the exact kinetic term for all graviton
candidates. At the classical level, matter $T_{\mu\nu}$ leads to three
different contributions to the linearized metric: one consistent with
linearized GR, one more rapidly decreasing contribution, and one
non-propagating contribution localized at $T_{\mu\nu}$. The latter is too large
to be physically acceptable, unless there is a significant induced quantum
action. This issue should be resolved on generalized fuzzy spaces.

The MAGIC telescopes, triggered by the INTEGRAL alerts, followed-up the flaring

competition between chemical effect of negative (or positive) energy gain by

quantitatively estimate SRO at given temperatures, it is still unclear to
systematically understand trends in SRO for binary alloys in terms of geometric
character, e.g., effective atomic radius for constituents. Since chemical
effect plays significant role on SRO, it has been believed that purely
geometric character cannot quantitatively explain the SRO trends. Despite these
considerations, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on
fcc-based 28 equiatomic binary alloys, we find that while convensional
Goldschmidt or DFT-based atomic radius for constituents have no significant
correlation with SRO, atomic radius for specially selected structure,
constructed purely from information about underlying lattice, can successfully
capture the magnitude of SRO. These facts strongly indicate that purely
geometric information of the system plays central role to determine

are determined. It is demonstrated that these can well reproduce the observed
mid-infrared emission spectra of evolved stars. Stoichiometric and
non-stoichiometric amorphous magnesium-iron silicate films are fabricated by
pulsed laser deposition. Transmittance and ellipsometry measurements are
performed in the wavelength range between 2 and 200 $\mu$m and 1.7 and 33
$\mu$m, respectively. Optical constants are derived from transmittance and
ellipsometric $\Psi$ and $\Delta$ spectra by means of oscillator models. The
optical constants are applied in radiative transfer models for examining
reproducibility of the observed spectral features of circumstellar dust shells
around supergiants. The spectra of four selected supergiants are dominated by
amorphous silicate dust emission in the wavelength range of 9 and 25 $\mu$m. To
obtain a good fit to the observed spectra, we take into account amorphous
corundum and metallic iron particles as additional dust components to account
for dust emission at $\lambda<8 \mu$m and in between the two silicate features.
For each of the objects, a set of model parameters (dust mass, condensation
temperature) is derived by an automated optimization procedure which well
reproduces the observation. Consequently, our model spectra using the new
optical data find that the silicate bands at $\approx 10$ and $\approx 18 \mu$m
depend on the magnesium and iron ratio in the silicate system, and that a good
fit requires a significant iron content of the amorphous silicate dust
component to reproduce the observed peak positions and shape of the silicate
bands.

a vast amount of data. However, it is impossible or almost impossible to
rewrite data with such devices. Thus, scale-out storage using such devices
cannot use standard data-distribution algorithms because they rewrite data for
moving between servers constituting the scale-out storage when the server
configuration is changed. Although using rewritable devices for scale-out
storage, when server capacity is huge, rewriting data is very hard when server
constitution is changed. In this paper, a data-distribution algorithm called
Sequential Checking is proposed, which can be used for scale-out storage
composed of devices that are hardly able to rewrite data. Sequential Checking
1) does not need to move data between servers when the server configuration is
changed, 2) distribute data, the amount of which depends on the server's
volume, 3) select a unique server when datum is written, and 4) select servers
when datum is read (there are few such server(s) in most cases) and find out a
unique server that stores the newest datum from them. These basic
characteristics were confirmed through proofs and simulations. Data can be read
by accessing 1.98 servers on average from a storage comprising 256 servers
under a realistic condition. And it is confirmed by evaluations in real
environment that access time is acceptable. Sequential Checking makes selecting
scale-out storage using tape or optical devices or using huge capacity servers
realistic.

measured on the sky during the commissioning runs that took place between
October 2015 and April 2017 at the 30-meter IRAM (Institut of Millimetric Radio

commissioned, performing in-line with the ambitious expectations. In
particular, NIKA2 exhibits FWHM angular resolutions of around 11 and 17.5
arc-seconds at respectively 260 and 150GHz. The NEFD (Noise Equivalent Flux
Densities) demonstrated on the maps are, at these two respective frequencies,
33 and 8 mJy*sqrt(s). A first successful science verification run has been
achieved in April 2017. The instrument is currently offered to the astronomical

the functional distribution of the trajectories of aging particles performing
anomalous diffusion, we reveal that for the fraction of the occupation time
$T_+/t$ of strong aging particles, $\langle (T^+(t)^2)\rangle=\frac{1}{2}t^2$

Their combination with phase-sensitive (lock-in) detection creates a highly
versatile sensor with a sensitivity that is proportional to the derivative of
the optical magnetic resonance lock-in spectrum, which is in turn dependant on
the lock-in modulation parameters. Here we study the dependence of the lock-in
spectral slope on the modulation of the spin-driving microwave field. Given the
presence of the intrinsic nitrogen hyperfine spin transitions, we
experimentally show that when the ratio between the hyperfine linewidth and
their separation is $\gtrsim 1/4$, square-wave based frequency modulation
generates the steepest slope at modulation depths exceeding the separation of
the hyperfine lines, compared to sine-wave based modulation. We formulate a
model for calculating lock-in spectra which shows excellent agreement with our
experiments, and which shows that an optimum slope is achieved when the
linewidth/separation ratio is $\lesssim 1/4$ and the modulation depth is less
then the resonance linewidth, irrespective of the modulation function used.

for their description, integrating the adhesive and contact mechanical response
with their electrophysiological behavior. From the computational point of view,
the initial and boundary value problem is formulated as a structure-structure

for parallel computations. Numerical tests are conducted on different couples
of myocytes, characterized by different shapes related to their stages of

now in the spotlight, especially due to their intrinsic ability to form binary
black holes (BBH) through dynamical encounters, that potentially coalesce via
gravitational-wave (GW) radiation. In this work, which is a continuation of a
recent study (Paper I), additional models of compact stellar clusters with
initial masses $\lesssim10^5M_\odot$ and also those with small fractions of
primordial binaries ($\lesssim10$%) are evolved for long term, applying the
direct N-body approach, assuming state-of-the-art stellar-wind and
remnant-formation prescriptions. That way, a substantially broader range of
computed models than that in Paper I is achieved. As in Paper I, the
general-relativistic BBH mergers continue to be mostly mediated by triples that
are bound to the clusters rather than happen among the ejected BBHs. In fact,
the number of such in situ BBH mergers, per cluster, tend to increase
significantly with the introduction of a small population of primordial
binaries. Despite the presence of massive primordial binaries, the merging
BBHs, especially the in situ ones, are found to be exclusively dynamically
assembled and hence would be spin-orbit misaligned. The BBHs typically traverse
through both the LISA's and the LIGO's detection bands, being audible to both
instruments. The ""dynamical heating"" of the BHs keeps the
Electron-Capture-Supernova (ECS) neutron stars (NS) from effectively mass
segregating and participating in exchange interactions; the dynamically-active
BHs would also exchange into any NS binary within $\lesssim1$ Gyr. Such young
massive and open clusters have the potential to contribute to the dynamical BBH
merger detection rate to a similar extent as their more massive
globular-cluster counterparts.

replicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown
quantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical
travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been
recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum
networks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous
teleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance
on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or
terrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a
global-scale ""quantum internet"" is to significantly extend the range for
teleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite
platform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points
on the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons'
propagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum
teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to
a low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up
to 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric
turbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a
compact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam
divergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking
(APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in
mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the
classical limit. This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-link
for faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential step

the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, as well as a massive

equation as its first integral. We extract conditions for this integral to
yield three different linearizing transformations, namely point, Sundman and
generalized linearizing transformations. The explicit forms of these
linearizing transformations are given. The exact forms and the general solution
of the nonlinear ODE for these three linearizables cases are also enumerated.
We illustrate the procedure with three different examples.

Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is a central problem in this class. Despite
decades of algorithmic and software development, there is still little
theoretical understanding of the sample complexity of this problem, that is,
number of images required for 3-D reconstruction. Here we consider
multi-reference alignment (MRA), a simple model that captures fundamental
aspects of the statistical and algorithmic challenges arising in cryo-EM and
related problems. In MRA, an unknown signal is subject to two types of
corruption: a latent cyclic shift and the more traditional additive white
noise. The goal is to recover the signal at a certain precision from
independent samples. While at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of
observations needed to recover a generic signal is proportional to
$1/\mathrm{SNR}$, we prove that it rises to a surprising $1/\mathrm{SNR}^3$ in
the low SNR regime. This precise phenomenon was observed empirically more than
twenty years ago for cryo-EM but has remained unexplained to date. Furthermore,
our techniques can easily be extended to the heterogeneous MRA model where the
samples come from a mixture of signals, as is often the case in applications
such as cryo-EM, where molecules may have different conformations. This
provides a first step towards a statistical theory for heterogeneous cryo-EM.

the chaoticity level of the signal, the weak dependence on parameters, correct
evaluation of periodic time series properties and more sensitivity to noise

manner towards the exit. Two neighboring hard rods of lengths ${\ell}_{1}$ and
${\ell}_{2}$ can fuse into a single rod of longer length
${\ell}={\ell}_{1}+{\ell}_{2}$ provided ${\ell} \leq N$. Similarly,
length-conserving fission of a rod of length ${\ell}' \leq N$ results in two
shorter daughter rods. Based on the extremum current hypothesis, we plot the
phase diagram of the model under open boundary conditions utilizing the results
derived for the same model under periodic boundary condition using mean-field
approximation. The density profile and the flux profile of rods are in
excellent agreement with computer simulations. Although the fusion and fission
of the rods are motivated by similar phenomena observed in Intraflagellar
Transport (IFT) in eukaryotic flagella, this exclusion model is too simple to
account for the quantitative experimental data for any specific organism.
Nevertheless, the concepts of `flux profile' and `transition zone' that emerge

important implications for IFT and for other similar transport phenomena in

considering the graphene based superconductor as an entangler device, instead
of normal (2D) BCS superconductor, we show that the Cooper pair splitting
current mediated by Crossed Andreev process is amplified compared to its normal
superconductor counterpart. This amplification is attributed to the strong
suppression of local normal Andreev reflection process (arising from the Cooper
pair splitting) from the graphene based superconductor to lead via the same
quantum dot, in comparison to the usual 2D superconductor. Due to the vanishing
density of states at the Dirac point of undoped graphene, a doped graphene
based superconductor is considered here and it is observed that Cooper pair
splitting current is very insensitive to the doping level in comparison to the
usual 2D superconductor. The transport process of non-local spin entangled
electrons also depends on the type of pairing i.e. whether the electron-hole
pairing is on-site, inter-sublattice or the combination of both. The
inter-sublattice pairing of graphene causes the maximum non-local Cooper pair
splitting current, whereas presence of both pairing reduces the Cooper pair
splitting current.

(SNRs), which are interacting with molecular clouds (MCs), with the model
prediction from widely used escaping scenario and direct interaction scenario.
It is found that the $\gamma$-ray data is inconsistent with the escaping
scenario statistically, as it predicts a diversity of spectral shape which is
not observed. The inconsistency suggests that the free escape boundary adopted
in the escaping model is not a good approximation, which challenges our
understanding of cosmic ray (CR) escaping in SNRs. In addition, we show that
ambient CRs is potentially important for the $\gamma$-ray emission of
illuminated MCs external to W28 and W44. In direct interaction scenario, the
model involving re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs and adiabatic compression
is able to explain the emission from most SNRs. The dispersion shown in the TeV
data is naturally explained by different acceleration time of CR particles in
SNRs. Re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs suggests a transition of seed
particles, which is from thermal injected seed particle in young SNRs to
ambient CRs in old SNRs. The transition needs to be tested by future
multi-wavelength observation. In the end, we propose that radiative SNR without
MC interaction is also able to produce a significant amount of $\gamma$-ray
emission. A good candidate is S147. With accumulated Fermi data and CTA in

modelling harmonic tension based on a distributed representation of chords. The
starting hypothesis is that harmonic tension as perceived by human listeners is
related, among other things, to the expectedness of harmonic units (chords) in
their local harmonic context. We train a word2vec-type neural network to learn
a vector space that captures contextual similarity and expectedness, and define
a quantitative measure of harmonic tension on top of this. To assess the
veridicality of the model, we compare its outputs on a number of well-defined
chord classes and cadential contexts to results from pertinent empirical
studies in music psychology. Statistical analysis shows that the model's
predictions conform very well with empirical evidence obtained from human

Results indicate a high level of similarity between geometry and topology for

three modes which allow for discrimination between stand-alone singlets and

specify different topological environments we have extracted selections of
galaxies from each sample according to different modes of C distribution. We
have found statistically significant associations between evolutionary

agents and agent's degradations to the lowest hierarchy. Following the initial
stage when all agents are at the bottom level in the course of time the system
approaches a stationary state where new hierarchies no longer emerge and the

state the average hierarchy level and the fraction of agents at the lowest

i.e. maximal number of observed hierarchy levels grows logarithmically along

Galaxy has already put a stringent constraint on the initial mass function
(IMF) of PopIII stars, suggesting that PopIII stars have a top-heavy IMF. On
the other hand, some claims that the lack of such stars stems from metal
enrichment of their surface by accretion of heavy elements from interstellar
medium (ISM). We investigate effects of the stellar wind on the metal accretion
onto low-mass PopIII stars because accretion of the local ISM onto the Sun is
prevented by the solar wind even for neutrals. The stellar wind and radiation
of low-mass PopIII stars are modeled based on knowledge of nearby low-mass
stellar systems including our Sun. We find that low-mass PopIII stars traveling
across the Galaxy forms the stellar magnetosphere in most of their life. Once
the magnetosphere is formed, most of neutral interstellar particles are
photoionized before reaching to the stellar surface and are blown away by the
wind. Especially, the accretion abundance of iron will be reduced by a factor
of $< 10^{-12}$ compared with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion. The metal
accretion can enhance iron abundance [Fe/H] only up to $\sim -14$. This
demonstrates that low-mass PopIII stars remain pristine and will be found as
metal free stars and that further searches for them are valuable to constrain
the IMF of PopIII stars.

Large Program aiming at reaching the 450 $\mu$m confusion limit in the
COSMOS-CANDELS region, to study a representative sample of the high-redshift
far-infrared galaxy population that gives rise to the bulk of the far-infrared
background. We present the first-year data from STUDIES. We have reached a 450
$\mu$m noise level of 0.91~mJy for point sources at the map center, covered an
area of 151 arcmin$^2$, and detected 98 and 141 sources at 4.0 and 3.5
$\sigma$, respectively. Our derived counts are best constrained in the 3.5-25
mJy regime using directly detected sources. Below the detection limits, our
fluctuation analysis further constrains the slope of the counts down to 1 mJy.
The resulting counts at 1-25 mJy are consistent with a power law having a slope
of $-2.59$ ($\pm0.10$ for 3.5-25 mJy, and $^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ for 1-3.5 mJy).
There is no evidence of a faint-end termination or turn-over of the counts in
this flux density range. Our counts are also consistent with previous SCUBA-2
blank-field and lensing cluster surveys. The integrated surface brightness from
our counts down to 1 mJy is $90.0\pm17.2$ Jy deg$^{-2}$, which can account for
up to $83^{+15}_{-16}\%$ of the COBE 450 $\mu$m background. We show that
Herschel counts at 350 and 500 $\mu$m are significantly higher than our 450
$\mu$m counts, likely caused by its large beam and source clustering.
High-angular resolution instruments like SCUBA-2 at 450 $\mu$m are therefore
highly beneficial for measuring the luminosity and spatial density of
high-redshift dusty galaxies.

lead the researchers to find new uses for old drugs and to realize the
therapeutic profiles or side effects thereof. However, experimental prediction
of drug-target interactions is expensive and time-consuming. As a result,
computational methods for prediction of new drug-target interactions have
gained much interest in recent times. We present iDTI-ESBoost, a prediction
model for identification of drug-target interactions using evolutionary and
structural features. Our proposed method uses a novel balancing technique and a
boosting technique for the binary classification problem of drug-target
interaction. On four benchmark datasets taken from a gold standard data,
iDTI-ESBoost outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of area under
Receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curve. iDTI-ESBoost also outperforms
the latest and the best-performing method in the literature to-date in terms of
area under precision recall (auPR) curve. This is significant as auPR curves
are argued to be more appropriate as a metric for comparison for imbalanced
datasets, like the one studied in this research. In the sequel, our experiments
establish the effectiveness of the classifier, balancing methods and the novel
features incorporated in iDTI-ESBoost. iDTI-ESBoost is a novel prediction
method that has for the first time exploited the structural features along with
the evolutionary features to predict drug-protein interactions. We believe the
excellent performance of iDTI-ESBoost both in terms of auROC and auPR would
motivate the researchers and practitioners to use it to predict drug-target
interactions. To facilitate that, iDTI-ESBoost is readily available for use at:

can be edge-unfolded without overlap. The proof employs the recent concepts of
angle-monotone and radially monotone curves. The proof is constructive, leading

graph databases. In these areas, it is often required to process queries for
large graphs. Some of the most common graph queries are navigational queries.
The result of query evaluation is a set of implicit relations between nodes of
the graph, i.e. paths in the graph. A natural way to specify these relations is
by specifying paths using formal grammars over the alphabet of edge labels. An
answer to a context-free path query in this approach is usually a set of
triples (A, m, n) such that there is a path from the node m to the node n,
whose labeling is derived from a non-terminal A of the given context-free
grammar. This type of queries is evaluated using the relational query
semantics. Another example of path query semantics is the single-path query
semantics which requires presenting a single path from the node m to the node
n, whose labeling is derived from a non-terminal A for all triples (A, m, n)
evaluated using the relational query semantics. There is a number of algorithms
for query evaluation which use these semantics but all of them perform poorly
on large graphs. One of the most common technique for efficient big data
processing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform
computations, but these algorithms do not allow to use this technique
efficiently. In this paper, we show how the context-free path query evaluation
using these query semantics can be reduced to the calculation of the matrix
transitive closure. Also, we propose an algorithm for context-free path query
evaluation which uses relational query semantics and is based on matrix
operations that make it possible to speed up computations by using a GPU.

source illumination, from modeling to numerical solution, through calibration.
In the classical formulation of photometric stereo, the luminous fluxes are
assumed to be directional, which is very difficult to achieve in practice.
Rather, we use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate the scene to
reconstruct. Such point light sources are very convenient to use, yet they
yield a more complex photometric stereo model which is arduous to solve. We
first derive in a physically sound manner this model, and show how to calibrate
its parameters. Then, we discuss two state-of-the-art numerical solutions. The
first one alternatingly estimates the albedo and the normals, and then
integrates the normals into a depth map. It is shown empirically to be
independent from the initialization, but convergence of this sequential
approach is not established. The second one directly recovers the depth, by
formulating photometric stereo as a system of PDEs which are partially
linearized using image ratios. Although the sequential approach is avoided,
initialization matters a lot and convergence is not established either.
Therefore, we introduce a provably convergent alternating reweighted
least-squares scheme for solving the original system of PDEs, without resorting
to image ratios for linearization. Finally, we extend this study to the case of
RGB images.

a 2-RDM based on response theory. However, the 2-RDMs from response theory are

it has the right symmetry and normalization and it fulfills the $P$-, $Q$- and
$G$-conditions. Next to an algorithm which can be applied to any 2-RDM, we have
also developed a 2-RDM optimization procedure specifically for seniority-zero
2-RDMs. We aim to find the 2-RDM with the right properties that is the closest
(in the sense of the Frobenius norm) to the non-N-representable 2-RDM by
minimizing the square norm of the difference between the initial 2-RDM and the
targeted 2-RDM under the constraint that the trace is normalized and the 2-RDM,
$Q$- and $G$-matrices are positive semidefinite, i.e. their eigenvalues are
non-negative. Our method is suitable for fixing non-N-respresentable 2-RDMs

optimization algorithm we add a small correction to the initial 2-RDM such that
it fulfills the most important N-representability conditions.

Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa theorem in 1965, this problem received significant scientific
attention in the fields of Graph Theory and Algorithm Design. In particular,
this problem is one of the first problems studied in the framework of
Parameterized Complexity. The non-uniform fixed-parameter tractability of Cycle
Packing follows from the Robertson-Seymour theorem, a fact already observed by
Fellows and Langston in the 1980s. In 1994, Bodlaender showed that Cycle
Packing can be solved in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot |V|$ using exponential
space. In case a solution exists, Bodlaender's algorithm also outputs a
solution (in the same time). It has later become common knowledge that Cycle
Packing admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k\log^2k)}\cdot |V|$-time (deterministic)
algorithm using exponential space, which is a consequence of the
Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa theorem. Nowadays, the design of this algorithm is given as an
exercise in textbooks on Parameterized Complexity. Yet, no algorithm that runs
in time $2^{o(k\log^2k)}\cdot |V|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, beating the bound
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k\log^2k)}\cdot |V|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, has been found. In light
of this, it seems natural to ask whether the $2^{\mathcal{O}(k\log^2k)}\cdot
|V|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ bound is essentially optimal. In this paper, we answer
this question negatively by developing a
$2^{\mathcal{O}(\frac{k\log^2k}{\log\log k})}\cdot |V|$-time (deterministic)
algorithm for Cycle Packing. In case a solution exists, our algorithm also
outputs a solution (in the same time). Moreover, apart from beating the bound
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k\log^2k)}\cdot |V|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, our algorithm runs in
time linear in $|V|$, and its space complexity is polynomial in the input size.

scales, and will therefore provide exciting new opportunities for testing
general relativity. The standard method for modelling the structures that these
surveys will observe is to use cosmological perturbation theory for linear
structures on horizon-sized scales, and Newtonian gravity for non-linear
structures on much smaller scales. We propose a two-parameter formalism that
generalizes this approach, thereby allowing interactions between large and
small scales to be studied in a self-consistent and well-defined way. This uses
both post-Newtonian gravity and cosmological perturbation theory, and can be
used to model realistic cosmological scenarios including matter, radiation and
a cosmological constant. We find that the resulting field equations can be
written as a hierarchical set of perturbation equations. At leading-order,
these equations allow us to recover a standard set of Friedmann equations, as
well as a Newton-Poisson equation for the inhomogeneous part of the Newtonian
energy density in an expanding background. For the perturbations in the
large-scale cosmology, however, we find that the field equations are sourced by
both non-linear and mode-mixing terms, due to the existence of small-scale
structures. These extra terms should be expected to give rise to new
gravitational effects, through the mixing of gravitational modes on small and
large scales - effects that are beyond the scope of standard linear
cosmological perturbation theory. We expect our formalism to be useful for
accurately modelling gravitational physics in universes that contain non-linear
structures, and for investigating the effects of non-linear gravity in the era
of ultra-large-scale surveys.

learning technique, Genetic Programming (GP) is not immune to this problem,
which the field has frequently addressed. Recently, Geometric Semantic Genetic
Programming (GSGP), a semantic-aware branch of GP, has shown robustness and
high generalization capability. Researchers believe these characteristics may
be associated with a lower sensibility to noisy data. However, there is no
systematic study on this matter. This paper performs a deep analysis of the
GSGP performance over the presence of noise. Using 15 synthetic datasets where
noise can be controlled, we added different ratios of noise to the data and
compared the results obtained with those of a canonical GP. The results show
that, as we increase the percentage of noisy instances, the generalization
performance degradation is more pronounced in GSGP than GP. However, in
general, GSGP is more robust to noise than GP in the presence of up to 10% of
noise, and presents no statistical difference for values higher than that in
the test bed.

  Two adequate training corpora consisting of text and corresponding speech
files have been set up and cleared of various faults, including inaudible
utterances or incorrect assignments between audio and text data. Those are
tested and compared against each other regarding e.g. flaws in the synthesized
speech, it's naturalness and intelligibility. Thus different voices have been
synthesized, whose quality depends less on the number of training samples used,
but much more on the cleanliness and signal-to-noise ratio of those.
Generalized voice models have been used for synthesis and the results greatly
differ between the two speech corpora.
  Tests regarding the adaptation to different speakers show that a resemblance
to the original speaker is audible throughout all recordings, yet the
synthesized voices sound robotic and unnatural in smaller parts. The spoken
text, however, is usually intelligible, which shows that the models are working
well.
  In a novel approach, speech is synthesized using side information of the
original audio signal, particularly the pitch frequency. Results show an
increase of speech quality and intelligibility in comparison to speech
synthesized solely from text, up to the point of being nearly indistinguishable
from the original.

requires, knowledge of the measurement uncertainty and, that it is in
reasonable relation with the specified tolerances. Hence, the determination of
the measurement uncertainty, which is a complex and also costly task, is of
utmost importance. The measurement uncertainty is usually influenced by several
contributions of various sources. Among those of the machine itself, e.g.,
guideway errors and the influence of the probe and styli play an important
role. Furthermore, several properties of the workpiece, such as its form
deviations and surface roughness, have to be considered. Also the environmental
conditions, i.e., temperature and its gradients, pressure, relative humidity
and others contribute to the overall measurement uncertainty. Currently, there
are different approaches to determine task-specific measurement uncertainties.
This work reports on recent advancements extending the well-established method
of PTB's Virtual Coordinate Measuring Machine (VCMM) to suit present-day needs
in industrial applications. The VCMM utilizes numerical simulations to
determine the task-specific measurement uncertainty incorporating broad

range of values for the free parameters of the model which yield a healthy and
well-behaved scenario. For some values of the free parameters which are
submissive to the energy conditions application, it is possible to predict a
transition from a decelerated period of the expansion of the universe to a
period of acceleration (dark energy era). We also propose further applications
of this particular case of the $f(R,T)$ formalism in order to check its
reliability in other fields, rather than cosmology.

perspective. In a recent work, we considered acknowledgment-based protocols,
where a user gets feedback from the channel only when she attempts
transmission. In this case she will learn whether her transmission was
successful or not. One of the main results of ESA2016 was that no
acknowledgment-based protocol can be in equilibrium. In fact, it seems that
many natural acknowledgment-based protocols fail to prevent users from
unilaterally switching to persistent protocols that always transmit with
probability 1. It is therefore natural to ask how powerful a protocol must be
so that it can beat persistent deviators.
  In this paper we consider age-based protocols, which can be described by a
sequence of probabilities of transmitting in each time step. Those
probabilities are given beforehand and do not change based on the transmission
history. We present a 3-player age-based protocol that can prevent users from
unilaterally deviating to a persistent protocol in order to decrease their
expected transmission time. It is worth noting that the answer to this question
does not follow from the results and proof ideas of ESA2016. Our protocol is
non-trivial, in the sense that, when all players use it, finite expected
transmission time is guaranteed. In fact, we show that this protocol is
preferable to any deadline protocol in which, after some fixed time, attempt
transmission with probability 1 in every subsequent step. An advantage of our
protocol is that it is very simple to describe, and users only need a counter
to keep track of time. Whether there exist $n$-player age-based protocols that
do not use counters and can prevent persistence is left as an open problem for
future research.

their hosts to measure their redshifts. These measurements, however, are
critical to constrain the nature of sGRB progenitors, their redshift
distribution and the $r$-process element enrichment history of the universe.
Here, we present spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB111117A and measure its
redshift to be $z = 2.211$. This makes GRB111117A the most distant
high-confidence short duration GRB detected to date. Our spectroscopic redshift
supersedes a lower, previously estimated photometric redshift value for this
burst. We use the spectroscopic redshift, as well as new imaging data to
constrain the nature of the host galaxy and the physical parameters of the GRB.
The rest-frame X-ray derived hydrogen column density, for example, is the
highest compared to a complete sample of sGRBs and seems to follow the
evolution with redshift as traced by the hosts of long GRBs (lGRBs). The host
lies in the brighter end of the expected sGRB host brightness distribution at
$z = 2.211$, and is actively forming stars. Using the host as a benchmark for
redshift determination, we find that between 43 and 71 per cent of all sGRB
redshifts should be missed due to host faintness for hosts at $z\sim2$. The
high redshift of GRB111117A is evidence against a lognormal delay-time model
for sGRBs through the predicted redshift distribution of sGRBs, which is very
sensitive to high-$z$ sGRBs. From the age of the universe at the time of GRB
explosion, an initial neutron star (NS) separation of $a_0 < 3.2~R_\odot$ is
required in the case where the progenitor system is a circular pair of
inspiralling NSs. This constraint excludes some of the longest sGRB formation
channels for this burst.

Observations have shown that twisted magnetic fields naturally
occur, and indeed are omnipresent in the Sun's atmosphere. It is therefore of
great theoretical interest in solar atmospheric waves research to investigate
the types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes that can propagate along
twisted magnetic flux tubes. Aims. Within the framework of ideal MHD, the main
aim of this work is to investigate small amplitude incompressible wave modes of
twisted magnetic flux tubes with m more or equal 1. The axial magnetic field
strength inside and outside the tube will be allowed to vary, to ensure the
results will not be restricted to only cold plasma equilibria conditions.
Methods. The dispersion equation for these incompressible linear MHD wave modes
was derived analytically by implementing the long wavelength approximation.
Results. It is shown, in the long wavelength limit, that both the frequency and
radial velocity profile of the m = 1 kink mode are completely unaffected by the
choice of internal background magnetic twist. However, fluting modes with m
more or equal 2 are sensitive to the particular radial profile of magnetic
twist chosen. Furthermore, due to background twist, a low frequency cut-off is
introduced for fluting modes that is not present for kink modes. From an
observational point of view, although magnetic twist does not affect the
propagation of long wavelength kink modes, for fluting modes it will either
work for or against the propagation, depending on the direction of wave travel
relative to the sign of the background twist.

density dependent quantum oscillations in thermodynamic and transport
properties of confined and degenerate non-interacting Fermi gases. We provide a
universal, material independent, recipe that explicitly separates oscillatory
quantum regime from stationary classical regime. Our model quite accurately
estimates quantum oscillations depending on confinement and degeneracy. We
construct a phase diagram representing stationary and oscillatory regimes on
degeneracy-confinement space. Analytical expressions of phase transition
interfaces are derived for different dimensions. The critical point on the
phase diagram, which separates entirely stationary and entirely oscillatory
regions, is determined and their aspect ratio dependencies are examined.
Quantum oscillations as well as their periods are analytically expressed for
one-dimensional case. Accuracy of our model is verified through quantum
oscillations in electronic specific heat capacity. We also compare the
predictions of our half-vicinity model, based on bounded sums, with those of
infinite sums, for the oscillatory violation of entropy-heat capacity
equivalence in degenerate limit to show the accuracy of our model. Furthermore,
similarities between functional behaviors of total occupancy variance and
conventional density of states functions at Fermi level are discussed.
