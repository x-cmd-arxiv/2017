oscillations in appearance and disappearance channels. A sample of electron
neutrino candidates at Super-Kamiokande in which a pion decay has been tagged
is added to the four single-ring samples used in previous T2K oscillation
analyses. Through combined analyses of these five samples, simultaneous
measurements of four oscillation parameters, $|\Delta m^2_{32}|$,
$\sin^2(\theta_{23})$, $\sin^2(\theta_{13})$, and $\delta_{CP}$ and of the mass
ordering are made. A set of studies of simulated data indicates that the
sensitivity to the oscillation parameters is not limited by neutrino
interaction model uncertainty. Multiple oscillation analyses are performed, and
frequentist and Bayesian intervals are presented for combinations of the
oscillation parameters with and without the inclusion of reactor constraints on
$\sin^2(\theta_{13})$. When combined with reactor measurements, the hypothesis
of CP conservation ($\delta_{CP}$$=0$ or $\pi$) is excluded at 90% confidence
level. The 90% confidence region for $\delta_{CP}$ is [-2.95,-0.44] ([-1.47,
-1.27]) for normal (inverted) ordering. The central values and 68\% confidence
intervals for the other oscillation parameters for normal (inverted) ordering
are $\Delta m^{2}_{32}=2.54\pm0.08$ ($2.51\pm0.08$) $\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2 /
c^4$ and $\sin^2(\theta_{23}) = 0.55^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ ($0.55^{+0.05}_{-0.08}$),
compatible with maximal mixing. In the Bayesian analysis, the data weakly
prefer normal ordering (Bayes factor 3.7) and the upper octant for
$\sin^2(\theta_{23})$ (Bayes factor 2.4).

to connect inflation to low energy physics, culminating, for instance, in what

the role of the inflaton, and driving successfully inflation, is that it
couples nonminimally with gravity. Nevertheless, cosmological constraints
impose that the nonminimal coupling be large. This causes the loss of
perturbative unitarity in a scale of energy far below the Planck one. Our aim
in this work is to point out that inflaton potential containing a particular
type of trilinear coupling involving the inflaton may circumvent this problem
by realizing Higgs inflation with tiny nonminimal coupling of the inflaton with
gravity. We then develop the idea within a toy model and implement it in the
inverse type-II seesaw mechanism for small neutrinos masses.

ordinary least squares regression, which has some assumptions, also known as
Gauss-Markov assumptions, on the error term showing white noise process of the
regression model. However, in many applications, especially for this example,
these assumptions are not satisfied. Therefore, in this study, a quantile

for cosmic structure formation by Bartelmann et al., we investigate a kinematic
relationship between diffusion and gravitational interactions in cosmic
structure formation. In the first part of this work we explain how the process
of structure formation in KFT can be separated into three processes, particle
diffusion, the accumulation of structure due to initial momentum correlations
and interactions relative to the inertial motion of particles. We study these
processes by examining the time derivative of the non-linear density power
spectrum in the Born approximation. We observe that diffusion and accumulation
are delicately balanced because of the Gaussian form of the initial conditions,
and that the net diffusion, resulting from adding these two counteracting
contributions, approaches the contributions from the interactions in amplitude
over time. This hints at a kinematic relation between diffusion and
interactions in KFT. Indeed, in the second part, we show that the response of
the system to arbitrary gradient forces is directly related to the evolution of
particle diffusion in the form of kinematic fluctuation-dissipation relations
(FDRs). This result is independent of the interaction potential. We show that
this relationship roots in a time-reversal symmetry of the underlying
generating functional. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate how FDRs
originating from purely kinematic arguments can be used in theories far from
equilibrium.

essential in the developments of lasers, quantum optics and other light-matter

radiates into photonic eigenstates in the weak coupling regime and does not
alter the property of the latter. Here, we report a counterintuitive phenomenon
where the radiation field of a dipole in a parity-time symmetric ring resonator
displays the opposite handedness to the eigenstates of the system. This
chiral-reversing radiation takes place at an exception point of the underlying
non-Hermitian system, where the singularity at the exceptional point forces a
phase locking of the coalesced eigenstates when interacting with the dipole
emitter. Such an intriguing phenomenon has been employed to construct vortex
radiation with controllable topological charge from a single quantum dot

100 s. We employ an AMR 2D hydrodynamical code. Our results show that engine
duration strongly influences jet nature. We show that the efficiency of
launching and collimating relativistic outflow increases with engine duration,
until the intermediate engine range where it is the highest, past this point to
long engine range, the trend is slightly reversed; we call this point where
acceleration and collimation are the highest ""sweet spot"" ($\sim$10 -- 30 s).
Moreover, jet energy flux shows that variability is also high in this duration
domain. We argue that not all engine durations can produce the collimated,
relativistic and variable long GRB-jets. Considering a typical progenitor and
engine energy, we conclude that the ideal engine duration to reproduce a long
GRB is $\sim$10 -- 30 s, where the launch of relativistic, collimated and
variable jets is favored. We note that this duration domain makes a good link
with Lazzati et al. (2013), which suggested that the bulk of BATSE's long GRBs

key targets that need to be effectively addressed by fifth generation (5G)
wireless systems. In this context, the concept of physical-layer security
becomes attractive, as it can establish perfect security using only the
characteristics of wireless medium. Nonetheless, to further increase the
spectral efficiency, an emerging concept, termed physical-layer service
integration (PHY-SI), has been recognized as an effective means. Its basic idea
is to combine multiple coexisting services, i.e., multicast/broadcast service
and confidential service, into one integral service for one-time transmission
at the transmitter side. This article first provides a tutorial on typical
PHY-SI models. Furthermore, we propose some state-of-the-art solutions to
improve the overall performance of PHY-SI in certain important communication
scenarios. In particular, we highlight the extension of several concepts
borrowed from conventional single-service communications, such as artificial

techniques are shown to be effective in the design of reliable and robust
PHY-SI schemes. Finally, several potential research directions are identified

our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication

well-defined quantities allowing a study of the motor efficiency. We show that
the optimal working regime occurs for moderate coupling. Finally, we introduce
a model with discrete phase space which captures the essential features of the
continuous model, can be solved in the limit of weak coupling, and exhibits a

serious contaminants to weak lensing. These systematics need to be isolated and
mitigated in order for ongoing and future lensing surveys to reach their full
potential. The IA self-calibration (SC) method was shown in previous studies to
be able to reduce the GI contamination by up to a factor of 10 for the 2-point
and 3-point correlations. The SC method does not require to assume an IA model
in its working and can extract the GI signal from the same photo-z survey
offering the possibility to test and understand structure formation scenarios
and their relationship to IA models. In this paper, we study the effects of the
IA SC mitigation method on the precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter
constraints from future cosmic shear surveys LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We
perform analytical and numerical calculations to estimate the loss of precision
and the residual bias in the best fit cosmological parameters after the
self-calibration is performed. We take into account uncertainties from
photometric redshifts and the galaxy bias. We find that the confidence contours
are slightly inflated from applying the SC method itself while a significant
increase is due to the inclusion of the photo-z uncertainties. The bias of
cosmological parameters is reduced from several-$\sigma$, when IA is not
corrected for, to below 1-$\sigma$ after SC is applied. These numbers are
comparable to those resulting from applying the method of marginalizing over IA
model parameters despite the fact that the two methods operate very
differently. We conclude that implementing the SC for these future cosmic-shear
surveys will not only allow one to efficiently mitigate the GI contaminant but
also help to understand their modeling and link to structure formation.

its most active phase, obtaining over a thousand spectra with exposures from
tens to hundreds of seconds. All the spectra can be fitted with an absorbed
power law model, which most of the time required the presence of a partial
covering. A blue-shifted iron-Kalpha line appears in 10% of the spectra
together with the signature of high column densities, and about 20% of the
spectra seem to show signatures of reflection. None of the spectra showed the
unambiguous presence of soft disk-blackbody emission, while the observed
bolometric flux exceeded the Eddington value in 3% of the spectra. Our results
can be explained assuming that the inner part of the accretion flow is inflated
into a slim disk that both hides the innermost (and brightest) regions of the
flow, and produces a cold, clumpy, high-density outflow that introduces the
high-absorption and fast spectral variability observed. We argue that the black
hole in V404 Cyg might have been accreting erratically or even continuously at
Eddington/Super-Eddington rates - thus sustaining a surrounding slim disk -
while being partly or completely obscured by the inflated disk and its outflow.
Hence, the largest flares produced by the source might not be accretion-driven

was not obviously relevant in the case of wider resonances. Here, we broaden
the scope of the analysis. First, we explicitly generalize the formalism to
encompass resonances of finite width. We then examine how the width of the
resonance modifies bounds on new resonances that are extracted from LHC
searches. Second, we demonstrate, using a wide variety of cases, with different
incoming partons, resonance properties, and decay signatures, that the limits
derived in the NWA yield pertinant, and somewhat conservative (less stringent)

combine a series of 1.5D semi-analytic, steady-state, vertical disc-wind

diffusion mechanisms (Ohm, Hall and ambipolar). We observe that the majority of
mass outflow via disc winds occurs over a radial width of a fraction of an
astronomical unit, with outflow rates attenuating rapidly on either side. We
also find that the mass accretion rate, magnetic field strength and surface
density profile each have significant effects on both the location of the
wind-launching region and the ejection/accretion ratio $\dot{M}_{\rm
out}/\dot{M}_{\rm in}$. Increasing either the accretion rate or the magnetic
field strength corresponds to a shift of the wind-launching region to smaller

the surface density corresponds to launching regions at larger radii with
increased $\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\dot{M}_{\rm in}$. Finally, we discover a class of
disc winds containing an ineffective launching configuration at intermediate

accurately recover stellar masses, with a slight average underestimate of ~0.06
dex and a ~0.15 dex scatter. Recovered half-light radii agree well with
intrinsic half-mass radii when averaged over all viewing angles, with a
systematic offset of ~0.1 dex (with the half-light radii being larger) and a
scatter of ~0.2 dex. When using color gradients to account for mass-to-light
variations, recovered half-mass radii also exceed the intrinsic half-mass radii
by ~0.1 dex. However, if not properly accounted for, aperture effects can bias
size estimates by ~0.1 dex. No differences are found between the mass and size
offsets for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Variations in viewing angle
are responsible for ~25% of the scatter in the recovered masses and sizes. Our
results thus suggest that the intrinsic scatter in the mass-size relation may
have previously been overestimated by ~25%. Moreover, orientation-driven
scatter causes the number density of very massive galaxies to be overestimated
by ~0.5 dex at $M_*\sim10^{11.5}M_{\odot}$.

structure modulus remains significantly lighter than the supersymmetry breaking
scale, and metastability requires only modest amounts of tuning. After

of their host stars have been observed in our solar system, in transiting
exoplanets, and in the orbital planes of debris discs. We present a mechanism
that causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its
movement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism
is based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea
by performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified
gravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to
the relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the
mechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in
the disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a
protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular
momentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to
the force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which
produces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The
tilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the
gaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change
substantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and
observational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming
regions and around winds or supernova ejecta. Our $N$-body model indicates that
the interaction with supernova ejecta is a viable explanation for the observed
spin-orbit misalignment in our solar system.

galaxy's star formation activity results from the adjustment to an increase in
specific black hole mass and, accordingly, an increase in the amount of
heating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies with
intermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of partial
quiescence with intermediate specific star formation rates, implying that both

However, low signal-to-noise prevented a conclusive determination of its
origin. Possible sources include exoplanetary atmospheres, circumstellar gas
disks, and the stellar surface. We use observations from the ""Measurements of

(MUSCLES) Treasury Survey to study H$_2$ fluorescence in M$\;$dwarfs. We detect
fluorescence in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 8/9 planet-hosting and 5/6
non-planet-hosting M$\;$dwarfs. The detection statistics, velocity centroids,
and line widths of the emission suggest a stellar origin. We calculate
H$_2$-to-stellar-ion flux ratios to compare flux levels between stars. For
stars with planets, we find an average ratio of 1.7$\,\pm\,$0.9 using the
fluxes of the brightest H$_2$ feature and two stellar C IV lines. This is
compared to 0.9$\,\pm\,$0.4 for stars without planets, showing that the
planet-hosting M$\;$dwarfs do not have significant excess H$_{2}$ emission.
This claim is supported by the direct FUV imaging of GJ 832, where no
fluorescence is observed at the expected star-planet separation. Additionally,
the 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 4.9$\,\times\,$10$^{-17}$
erg$\;$cm$^{-2}\;$s$^{-1}$ from these observations is two orders of magnitude
below the spectroscopically-observed H$_2$ flux. We constrain the location of
the fluorescing H$_2$ using 1D radiative transfer models and find that it could

cosmological ICs seem to suggest that galaxies on these mass scales have very
little rotational support and are velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) dominated.
Accretion and environmental effects increase the scatter in the galaxy scaling
relations (e.g. size - velocity dispersion) in very good agreement with
observations. Star formation is substantially quenched after accretion. Mass
removal due to tidal forces has several effects: it creates a very flat stellar
velocity dispersion profiles, and it reduces the dark matter content at all
scales (even in the centre), which in turn lowers the stellar velocity on
scales around 0.5 kpc even when the galaxy does not lose stellar mass.
Satellites that start with a cored dark matter profile are more prone to either
be destroyed or to end up in a very dark matter poor galaxy. Finally, we found
that tidal effects always increase the ""cuspyness"" of the dark matter profile,

electric and magnetic fields, is arguably the most important phenomenon of Weyl
semimetals and has been explained as an imbalance between the occupancies of
the gapless, zeroth Landau levels with opposite chiralities. This widely
accepted picture has served as the basis for subsequent studies. Here we report
the breakdown of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals in a strong magnetic
field based on ab initio calculations. A sizable energy gap that depends
sensitively on the direction of the magnetic field may open up due to the
mixing of the zeroth Landau levels associated with the opposite-chirality Weyl
points that are away from each other in the Brillouin zone. Our study provides
a theoretical framework for understanding a wide range of phenomena closely
related to the chiral anomaly in topological semimetals, such as
magnetotransport, thermoelectric responses, and plasmons, to name a few.

It is found that the dependence of the Wigner function on the component of
momentum along the magnetic field is asymmetric and is correlated with the
fermion chirality. Such a dependence is principal for reproducing the correct
chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects. In the lowest Landau level
approximation, the equation for the equal-time Wigner function in a strong
magnetic field is derived. By making use of this equation, it is found that the
longitudinal collective modes in a strong magnetic field are gapped plasmons
whose gap is determined by the magnetic field. Unlike the ordinary magnetic
field, an axial one allows for the dispersion law of the collective excitations
asymmetric in the wave vector. The thermoelectric phenomena for chiral fermions

simulating twenty seven haloes with masses between $5\times 10^8$ and $10^{10}

remain dark. The simulated galaxies match quite well present day observed
scaling relations between stellar mass, size and metallicity, showing that such
relations are in place before accretion. Our galaxies show a large variety of
star formation histories, from extended star formation periods to single
bursts. As in more massive galaxies, large star formation bursts are connected
with major mergers events, which greatly contribute to the overall stellar mass
build up. The intrinsic stochasticity of mergers induces a large scatter in the
stellar mass halo mass relation, up to two orders of magnitude. Despite the
bursty star formation history, on these mass scales baryons are very
ineffective in modifying the dark matter profiles, and galaxies with a stellar
mass below $\approx 10^6 M_\odot$ retain their cuspy central dark matter
distribution, very similar to results from pure N-body simulations.

satellites within galaxy-sized dark-matter haloes with different assembly
histories. We consider two classes of haloes at redshift $z=0$: `stalled'
haloes that assembled at $z>1$ and `accreting' ones that are still forming
nowadays. Previously, we showed that the stalled haloes are embedded within
thick filaments of the cosmic web while the accreting ones lie where multiple
thin filaments converge. We find that satellites in the two classes have both
similar and different properties. Their mass spectra, radial count profiles,
baryonic and stellar content, and the amount of material they shed are
indistinguishable. However, the mass fraction locked in satellites is
substantially larger for the accreting haloes as they experience more mergers
at late times. The largest difference is found in the satellite kinematics.
Substructures fall towards the accreting haloes along quasi-radial trajectories
whereas an important tangential velocity component is developed, before
accretion, while orbiting the filament that surrounds the stalled haloes. Thus,
the velocity anisotropy parameter of the satellites ($\beta$) is positive for
the accreting haloes and negative for the stalled ones. This signature enables
us to tentatively categorize the Milky Way halo as stalled based on a recent
measurement of $\beta$. Half of our haloes contain clusters of satellites with
aligned orbital angular momenta corresponding to flattened structures in space.
These features are not driven by baryonic physics and are only found in haloes
hosting grand-design spiral galaxies, independently of their assembly history.

for harmonic functions on M with respect to a reflective hypersurface of M
follows easily from the above reflection principle. To consider reflection
principles for harmonic and holomorphic maps from general Hermitian symmetric

spaces admitting such recursive real forms include Hermitian manifolds of
constant holomorphic curvatures, the complex hyper-quadrics and their
respective non-compact duals. Let M be an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space

solution exists even if the dissipation parameter has unbounded upper range.
Further, the range of the parameter for which the stable solutions are obtained

good convergence down to a temperature of a fraction of $K$ and in some cases
down to $T=K/10$. In the Kitaev exchange dominated regime, the inverse
susceptibility has a nearly linear temperature dependence over a wide
temperature range. However, we show that already at temperatures $10$-times the

is qualitatively different from sliding along interfaces separating identical

while this bimaterial coupling is a monotonically increasing function of the

perturbations through a friction law, various physical quantities exhibit a
non-monotonic dependence on the bimaterial contrast. In particular, we show
that for a regularized Coulomb friction, the maximal growth rate of unstable

framework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control
of strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman
operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics,
and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics
behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations
of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work,
we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is
beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order
models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a
Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power.
We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic
coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The
resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear
Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is demonstrated that these
eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series
expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the
infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered
eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be
faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped
eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to
nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such
as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant
examples, including 1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a
variety of Hamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for
ocean mixing.

LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ nanowires, measured through the phenomenon of frictional
drag, in which current passing through one nanowire induces a voltage across a
nearby electrically isolated nanowire. Frictional drag mediated by the Coulomb
interaction is predicted to decay exponentially with interwire separation, but
with the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ nanowire system it is found to be nearly
independent of separation. Frictional drag experiments performed with three
parallel wires demonstrates long-range frictional coupling even in the presence
of an electrically grounded central wire. Collectively, these results provides
evidence for a new long-range non-Coulombic electron-electron interaction
unlike anything previously reported for semiconducting systems.

discrepancy could instead be due to systematic bias or uncertainty in the
Cepheid calibration step of the distance ladder measurement by R16. We consider
variations in total-to-selective extinction of Cepheid flux as a function of
line-of-sight, hidden structure in the period-luminosity relationship, and
potentially different intrinsic color distributions of Cepheids as a function
of host galaxy. Considering all potential sources of error, our final
determination of $H_0 = 73.3 \pm 1.7~{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ (not including systematic
errors from the treatment of geometric distances or Type Ia Supernovae) shows
remarkable robustness and agreement with R16. We conclude systematics from the
modeling of Cepheid photometry, including Cepheid selection criteria, cannot
explain the observed tension between Cepheid-variable and CMB-based inferences
of the Hubble constant. Considering a `model-independent' approach to relating
Cepheids in galaxies with known distances to Cepheids in galaxies hosting a
Type Ia supernova and finding agreement with the R16 result, we conclude no
generalization of the model relating anchor and host Cepheid magnitude
measurements can introduce significant bias in the $H_0$ inference.

intergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:
transients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent
with the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw
randomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine
the spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while
steady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all
the currently available observational data. While we reproduce fairly well the
Auger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets, most of the
simulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of TA (at most a few
percent depending on density model tested) show a much stronger anisotropy than
the one observed. We find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and
the anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within $\sim 10$ Mpc, to
account for the flux excess, and a strong extragalactic magnetic field $\sim

sharing has great benefits in data-driven decision making. However, with a wide
variety of sensitive data collected, protecting privacy of individuals,
communities and organizations, is an essential factor in making data ""open"".
The approaches currently adopted by industry in releasing private data are
often ad hoc and prone to a number of attacks, including re-identification
attacks, as they do not provide adequate privacy guarantees. While differential
privacy has attracted significant interest from academia and industry by
providing rigorous and reliable privacy guarantees, the reduced utility and
inflexibility of current differentially private algorithms for data release is
a barrier to their use in real-life. This paper aims to address these two
challenges. First, we propose a novel mechanism to augment the conventional
utility of differential privacy by fusing two Laplace or geometric
distributions together. We derive closed form expressions for entropy, variance
of added noise, and absolute expectation of noise for the proposed piecewise
mixtures. Then the relevant distributions are utilised to theoretically prove
the privacy and accuracy guarantees of the proposed mechanisms. Second, we show
that our proposed mechanisms have greater flexibility, with three parameters to
adjust, giving better utility in bounding noise, and mitigating larger
inaccuracy, in comparison to typical one-parameter differentially private
mechanisms. We then empirically evaluate the performance of piecewise mixture
distributions with extensive simulations and with a real-world dataset for both
linear count queries and histogram queries. The empirical results show an
increase in all utility measures considered, while maintaining privacy, for the
piecewise mixture mechanisms compared to standard Laplace or geometric
mechanisms.

spectroscopy study shows that the induced $C_4$ (2$\times$2) order has
characteristics of plaquette antiferromagnetic order in Fe layer and strongly
suppressed superconductivity. Also, thermal agitation beyond the bulk Fe spin
ordering temperature erases the $C_4$ state. These results suggest a new

For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an
eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random
input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such
questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated
measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to
the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider
related problems of (2) humanly computable ""one-way functions"" and (3) humanly

  The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules
than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons
to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern
computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human
computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more
concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro
number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the
analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as

How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments

framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our
framework, a new type of parameter -- scaling factor is first introduced to
scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual
blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this
optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient
(APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the
corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing
with other structure selection methods that may need thousands of trials or
iterative fine-tuning, our method is trained fully end-to-end in one training
pass without bells and whistles. We evaluate our method, Sparse Structure
Selection with several state-of-the-art CNNs, and demonstrate very promising

choice of an $n-$tuple of lattices in a vector space over a non-archimedean

Mumford's groundbreaking work on the unformisation of curves to higher
dimension. These varieties have a rich combinatorial structure as can be seen
in pioneering work of Cartwright, H\""abich, Sturmfels and Werner. In this
paper, we introduce a new approach to Mustafin varieties in terms of images of
rational maps, which were studied by Li. Applying tropical intersection theory
and tropical convex hull computations, we use this method to give a new
combinatorial description of the irreducible components of the special fibers
of Mustafin varieties. This enables connections to various topics. In
particular, we see that any multiview variety appears as an irreducible
component of the special fiber of some Mustafin variety. Furthermore, we use an
interpretation of Mustafin varieties as a moduli functor introduced by Faltings
to relate them to certain moduli functors, called linked Grassmannians. These
objects are featured in limit linear series theory. The focal point of study
regarding linked Grassmannians are so-called \textit{simple points}. As a
direct consequence of the new combinatorial description of Mustafin varieties,
we prove that the simple points of linked Grassmannians are dense in every
fiber. Finally, we use the connection to linked Grassmannians, to relate the
special fibers of Mustafin varieties to certain local models of unitary Shimura

domain via utilizing the knowledge distilled from a source domain which has a
different but related data distribution. One solution to domain adaptation is
to learn domain invariant feature representations while the learned
representations should also be discriminative in prediction. To learn such
representations, domain adaptation frameworks usually include a domain
invariant representation learning approach to measure and reduce the domain
discrepancy, as well as a discriminator for classification. Inspired by
Wasserstein GAN, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learn domain
invariant feature representations, namely Wasserstein Distance Guided
Representation Learning (WDGRL). WDGRL utilizes a neural network, denoted by
the domain critic, to estimate empirical Wasserstein distance between the
source and target samples and optimizes the feature extractor network to
minimize the estimated Wasserstein distance in an adversarial manner. The
theoretical advantages of Wasserstein distance for domain adaptation lie in its
gradient property and promising generalization bound. Empirical studies on
common sentiment and image classification adaptation datasets demonstrate that
our proposed WDGRL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain invariant

decides the number of oscillators with which it interacts. In addition, with
the use of an appropriate feedback parameter in the coupling strategy, we
articulate how the suppressed oscillation can be resurrected in the systems'

Common methods used to estimate the number of sources include principal
component analysis or information criterion methods, both of which make use of
the eigenvalue distribution of the data, thus avoiding solving the
time-consuming inverse problem. Unfortunately, all these methods are very
sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as examining the sample extreme
eigenvalues does not necessarily reflect the perturbation of the population
ones. To uncover the unknown sources from the very noisy MEG data, we introduce
a framework, referred to as the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of the optimal

the spiked population eigenvalues of the associated transformed data matrix. It
is shown that the ID yields a more reasonable estimate for the number of

planets' water as well as the hydrated C-type asteroids. Here we show that the
inner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets'
formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met
for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases,
the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally
scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a
fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior
to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with
C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the
disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach
sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and
deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on
the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant
planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich
bodies.

is shown that the heat engines have a higher efficiency for the cases $m^2>0$
than for the case $m=0$ when $c_1<0, c_2<0$. Considering a specific example, we
show that the maximum efficiency can reach $0.9219$ while the efficiency for
$m=0$ reads $0.5014$. The existence of graviton mass improves the heat engine
efficiency significantly. The situation is more complicated for the
five-dimensional neutral black holes. Not only the $c_1, c_2, m^2$ exert
influence on the efficiency, but also the constant $c_3$ corresponding to the
third massive potential contributes to the efficiency. When $c_1<0, c_2<0,
c_3<0$, the heat engine efficiency of the cases $m^2>0$ is higher than that of
the case $m=0$. By studying the ratio $\eta/\eta_C$, we also probe how the

noise models, including the malicious noise model and the agnostic (adversarial
label noise) model. Prior to our work, the only concept class for which
efficient malicious learning algorithms were known was the class of
origin-centered halfspaces.
  Specifically, our robust learning algorithm for low-degree PTFs succeeds
under a number of tame distributions -- including the Gaussian distribution
and, more generally, any log-concave distribution with (approximately) known
low-degree moments. For LTFs under the Gaussian distribution, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $O(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$
is the noise rate. At the core of our PAC learning results is an efficient
algorithm to approximate the low-degree Chow-parameters of any bounded function
in the presence of nasty noise. To achieve this, we employ an iterative
spectral method for outlier detection and removal, inspired by recent work in
robust unsupervised learning. Our aforementioned algorithm succeeds for a range
of distributions satisfying mild concentration bounds and moment assumptions.
The correctness of our robust learning algorithm for intersections of

revisit the effects of energy loss by axion emission on the evolution of the

massive, more compact, and hotter than subsequent generations. It is hence
important to extend previous studies restricted to solar metallicity stars. Our
analysis first compares the evolution of solar metallicity 8, 10 and 12
M$_\odot$ stars to previous work. We then calculate the evolution of 8 zero
metallicity stars with and without axion losses and with masses ranging from 20
to 150 M$_\odot$. For the solar metallicity models, we confirm the
disappearance of the blue loop phase for a value of the axion-photon coupling,
$g_{a\gamma}=10^{-10} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Regarding the Pop. III stars, we show
that for $g_{a\gamma}=10^{-10} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$, their evolution is not much
affected by axion losses except within the range of masses 80$-$130 M$_\odot$.
Such stars show significant differences both in their tracks within the
$T_c$-$\rho_c$ diagram and in their central composition (in particular
$^{20}$Ne and $^{24}$Mg). We discuss the origin of these modifications from the

synthesize a new image that retains the high-level structure of a content
image, rendered in the low-level texture of a style image. This is achieved by
constraining the new image to have high-level CNN features similar to the
content image, and lower-level CNN features similar to the style image. However
in the traditional optimization objective, low-level features of the content
image are absent, and the low-level features of the style image dominate the
low-level detail structures of the new image. Hence in the synthesized image,
many details of the content image are lost, and a lot of inconsistent and
unpleasing artifacts appear. As a remedy, we propose to steer image synthesis
with a novel loss function: the Laplacian loss. The Laplacian matrix
(""Laplacian"" in short), produced by a Laplacian operator, is widely used in
computer vision to detect edges and contours. The Laplacian loss measures the
difference of the Laplacians, and correspondingly the difference of the detail
structures, between the content image and a new image. It is flexible and
compatible with the traditional style transfer constraints. By incorporating
the Laplacian loss, we obtain a new optimization objective for neural style
transfer named Lapstyle. Minimizing this objective will produce a stylized
image that better preserves the detail structures of the content image and
eliminates the artifacts. Experiments show that Lapstyle produces more
appealing stylized images with less artifacts, without compromising their
""stylishness"".

  Computation 2018",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This book chapter introduces regression approaches and regression adjustment
for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Regression adjustment adjusts
parameter values after rejection sampling in order to account for the imperfect
match between simulations and observations. Imperfect match between simulations
and observations can be more pronounced when there are many summary statistics,
a phenomenon coined as the curse of dimensionality. Because of this imperfect
match, credibility intervals obtained with regression approaches can be
inflated compared to true credibility intervals. The chapter presents the main
concepts underlying regression adjustment. A theorem that compares theoretical
properties of posterior distributions obtained with and without regression
adjustment is presented. Last, a practical application of regression adjustment
in population genetics shows that regression adjustment shrinks posterior
distributions compared to rejection approaches, which is a solution to avoid
inflated credibility intervals.

rheology in confined channels. The contribution is twofold: (i) a model to
approximate the Navier-Stokes equations with the $\mu(I)$ rheology through an
asymptotic analysis. Under the hypothesis of a one-dimensional flow, this model
takes into account side walls friction; (ii) a multilayer discretization
following Fern\'andez-Nieto et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 798, 2016, pp.
643-681). In this new numerical scheme, we propose an appropriate treatment of
the rheological terms through a hydrostatic reconstruction which allows this
scheme to be well-balanced and therefore to deal with dry areas. Based on
academic tests, we first evaluate the influence of the width of the channel on
the normal profiles of the downslope velocity thanks to the multilayer approach
that is intrinsically able to describe changes from Bagnold to S-shaped (and
vice versa) velocity profiles. We also check the well balance property of the
proposed numerical scheme. We show that approximating side walls friction using
single-layer models may lead to strong errors. Secondly, we compare the
numerical results with experimental data on granular collapses. We show that
the proposed scheme allows us to qualitatively reproduce the deposit in the
case of a rigid bed (i. e. dry area) and that the error made by replacing the
dry area by a small layer of material may be large if this layer is not thin
enough. The proposed model is also able to reproduce the time evolution of the
free surface and of the flow/no-flow interface. In addition, it reproduces the
effect of erosion for granular flows over initially static material lying on
the bed. This is possible when using a variable friction coefficient $\mu(I)$
but not with a constant friction coefficient.

emerged in the moat region of a pivotal delta-type sunspot, especially near its

of satellite spot and adjacent emerging flux encountered the global magnetic

boundary of the photospheric horizontal flow channels.

by using the energy spectra of evaporated light charged particles. But this
method of measurement is not without difficulties both theoretical and
experimental. The presented study aims to disentangle the respective influences
of different factors on the quality of this measurement : the physics, the
detection (a 4? detector array as INDRA) and the experimental procedure. This
analysis demonstrates the possibility of determining from an energy spectrum,
with an accuracy of about 10 %, the true apparent temperature felt by a given
type of particle emitted by a hot nucleus. Three conditions are however
necessary : have a perfect detector of particles, an important statistics and
very few secondary emissions. According to the GEMINI event generator, for hot
nuclei of intermediate mass, only deuterons and tritons could fill these
conditions. This temperature can allow to trace back to the initial temperature
by using an appropriate method. This determination may be better than 15 %.
With a real experimental device, an insufficient angular resolution and
topological distortions caused by the detection can damage spectra to the point
to make very difficult a correct determination of the apparent temperature. The
experimental reconstruction of the frame of the hot nucleus may also be
responsible for this deterioration

that for a specific set of domain-wall-like initial product states it can
instead be diffusive. We theoretically explain the time evolution of such
states by showing that in the limiting regime of weak spatial modulation they
are approximately product states for very long times, and demonstrate that even
in the case of larger spatial modulation the bipartite entanglement entropy
grows only logarithmically in time. In the limiting regime we derive a simple
closed equation governing the dynamics, which in the continuum limit and for
the initial step magnetization profile results in a solution expressed in terms
of Fresnel integrals.

difficult illumination conditions or high dynamic range (HDR) environments. The
main difficulties in these situations come from both the limitations of the

because of the bold assumptions in VO, such as brightness constancy. We address
this problem from a deep learning perspective, for which we first fine-tune a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the purpose of obtaining enhanced
representations of the sequences for VO. Then, we demonstrate how the insertion
of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) allows us to obtain temporally consistent
sequences, as the estimation depends on previous states. However, the use of
very deep networks does not allow the insertion into a real-time VO framework;
therefore, we also propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of reduced size
capable of performing faster. Finally, we validate the enhanced representations
by evaluating the sequences produced by the two architectures in several
state-of-art VO algorithms, such as ORB-SLAM and DSO.

metals are remain largely unexplored. In this work, interactions between
coherent twin boundaries and $\alpha \to \epsilon$ phase transition of iron are
investigated using both non- equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and
nudge elastic band method. Mechanisms of both twin-assisted phase transition
and reverse phase transition are studied and orientation relationships between
BCC and HCP phase are found to be <11-1>BCC || <-12-10>HCP and <1-10>BCC ||
<0001>HCP for both cases. The twin boundary corresponds to after the phase
transition. It is amazing that the reverse transition seems to be able to
""memory"" and recover the initial BCC twins. The memory would partly loss when
plastic slips take place in the HCP phase before the reverse transition. In the
recovered initial BCC twins, three major twin spacing are observed, which are
well explained in terms of energy barriers of the transition from HCP phase to
BCC twin. Besides, variant selection rule of the twin assisted phase transition
is also discussed. The results of present work could be expected to give some

such that standard forward analysis can propagate constraints both forward, and
backward from a goal. Query-answer transformation is effective, but has issues
that we wish to address. For that, we introduce a new backward collecting
semantics, which is suitable for alternating forward and backward abstract

prove unreachability of the goal and how every subsequent run of an analysis
yields a refined model of the system. Experimentally, we observe that combining
forward and backward analyses is important for analysing systems that encode
questions about reachability in C programs. In particular, the combination that
follows our new semantics improves the precision of our own abstract
interpreter, including when compared to a forward analysis of a

delays. Our main goal is to analyze the worst-case deterioration in social cost
of a perturbed Nash flow (i.e., for the perturbed latencies) with respect to an
original Nash flow. We show that for homogeneous players perturbed Nash flows
coincide with approximate Nash flows and derive tight bounds on their

equivalence does not hold. We derive tight bounds on the inefficiency of both
perturbed and approximate Nash flows for arbitrary player sensitivity
distributions. Intuitively, our results suggest that the negative impact of
path deviations (e.g., caused by risk-averse behavior or latency perturbations)
is less severe than approximate stability (e.g., caused by limited
responsiveness or bounded rationality). We also obtain a tight bound on the
inefficiency of perturbed Nash flows for matroid congestion games and
homogeneous populations if the path deviations can be decomposed into edge

properties on causal structures, we propose a general Split-and-Merge
framework, named SADA, to enhance the scalability of a wide class of causation
discovery algorithms. In SADA, the variables are partitioned into subsets, by
finding causal cut on the sparse causal structure over the variables. By
running mainstream causation discovery algorithms as basic causal solvers on
the subproblems, complete causal structure can be reconstructed by combining
the partial results. SADA benefits from the recursive division technique, since
each small subproblem generates more accurate result under the same number of
samples. We theoretically prove that SADA always reduces the scales of problems
without sacrifice on accuracy, under the condition of local causal sparsity and
reliable conditional independence tests. We also present sufficient condition
to accuracy enhancement by SADA, even when the conditional independence tests
are vulnerable. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets
verify the improvements on scalability and accuracy by applying SADA together
with existing causation discovery algorithms.

the bias dependencies found on input and output parameters for both methods,

consistent between the two estimators, an interesting result given the
differences of the methods. We also find important dependences on orientation

noise and pixelization play an important role in the bias dependencies on the
output properties and galaxy orientation. We show some examples of model bias
that produce a bias dependence on the Sersic index n as well as a different
shear bias between galaxies consisting of a single Sersic profile and galaxies
with a disc and a bulge. We also see an important coupling between several
properties on the bias dependences. Because of this, we need to study several

geometric Langlands conjecture by Arinkin and Gaitsgory arises naturally from
the point of view of N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory. We define what it means
in topological quantum field theory to restrict a category of boundary
conditions to the full subcategory of objects compatible with a fixed choice of
vacuum, both in functorial field theory and in the language of factorization
algebras. For B-twisted N = 4 gauge theory with gauge group G, the moduli space
of vacua is equivalent to h*/W , and the nilpotent singular support condition
arises by restricting to the vacuum 0 in h*/W. We then investigate the
categories obtained by restricting to points in larger strata, and conjecture
that these categories are equivalent to the geometric Langlands categories with
gauge symmetry broken to a Levi subgroup, and furthermore that by assembling
such for the groups GL_n for all positive integers n one finds a hidden
factorization structure for the geometric Langlands theory.

shell-model calculations also showed a clear anticorrelation between the
Gamow-Teller strength and the transition rate of the collective quadrupole
excitation from the ground state. We discuss the physics beyond this
observation. It is based on the existence of spin-orbit coupling that is
responsible for the non-zero probabilities of Gamow-Teller transitions in
self-conjugate nuclei (N = Z). The shell-model calculations in the f p-space
demonstrate the effects of the gradual artificial removal of the spin-orbit
coupling that influences Gamow-Teller and quadrupole modes in opposite way. The
realistic spin-orbit splitting moves the cumulative Gamow-Teller strength up
and leads to stronger fragmentation; both trends are discussed in terms of
simple symmetry arguments. Along with this process, the Gamow-Teller operator
excites, in addition to the main line of L = 0 states, states with L = 2 which
should be added, with the interference terms, to account for the total
strength.

generalization of the convection term is then introduced, which allows to limit
the scheme diffusion while ensuring a weaker property: the entropy inequality

BV norms. The explicit upwind variant also satisfies such a weaker property, at
the price of an estimate for the velocity which could be derived from the

fully reprocessed and re-inverted 540km of flight lines of a SkyTEM survey of

not a good decision because they contain important information about the

the estimation of the tail index in case it exists. There are many measures for
the center of the distribution, e.g. mean, mode, median. There are many
measures of the variance, asymmetry, and kurtosis, but there is no easy
characteristic for heavy-tailedness of the observed distribution. Here we
propose such a measure, give some examples and explore some of its properties.
This allows us to introduce a classification of the distributions, with respect
to their heavy-tailedness. The idea is to help and navigate practitioners for

Monte Carlo variance of smoothers, it is typical in these models to use
Rao-Blackwellization: particle approximation is used to sample sequences of
hidden regimes while the Gaussian states are explicitly integrated conditional
on the sequence of regimes and observations, using variants of the Kalman
filter / smoother. The first successful attempt to use Rao-Blackwellization for
smoothing extends the Bryson-Frazier smoother for Gaussian linear state space
models using the generalized two-filter formula together with Kalman filters /
smoothers. More recently, a forward backward decomposition of smoothing
distributions mimicking the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother for the regimes
combined with backward Kalman updates has been introduced. This paper

In this study, we measure the performance of the document classifiers trained

their variants. The results of the empirical comparison show that the commonly
used bag-of-words model has performance comparable to the one obtained by the
emerging continuous-space model of doc2vec. In particular, the low-dimensional
variants of doc2vec generating up to 75 features are among the top-performing
document representation models. The results finally point out that doc2vec

while at $d=1$ it elegantly degenerates to a two-dimensional particle moving in
flat space. It admits a description in terms of pure geometrical
characteristics of the interaction triangle which is defined by the three

Attributed to the inertia of a measuring instrument, it is desirable in
sampling theory to reconstruct a function by its nonuniform samples. In the
present paper, we investigate the problem of constructing the approximation to
all the functions in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ with nonuniform samples by
utilizing dual framelet systems for the Sobolev space pair
$(H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}))$. We first establish the
convergence rates of the framelet series in $(H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),
H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}))$, and then construct the framelet approximation
operator holding for the entire space $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. Using the
approximation operator, any function in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ can be
approximated at the exponential rate with respect to the scale level. We
examine the stability property for the perturbations of the framelet
approximation operator with respect to shift parameters, and obtain an estimate
bound for the perturbation error. Our result shows that under the condition $s
> d/2$, the approximation operator is robust to the shift perturbation. These
results are used to establish the nonuniform sampling approximation for every
function in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. In particular, the new nonuniform sampling
approximation error is robust to the jittering of the samples.

means of sensitivity indices estimate, the contributions of each uncertain
input variable to the model output uncertainty. The so-called Sobol' indices,
which are based on the functional variance analysis, present a difficult
interpretation in the presence of statistical dependence between inputs. The
Shapley effect was recently introduced to overcome this problem as they
allocate the mutual contribution (due to correlation and interaction) of a
group of inputs to each individual input within the group.In this paper, using
several new analytical results, we study the effects of linear correlation
between some Gaussian input variables on Shapley effects, and compare these
effects to classical first-order and total Sobol' indices.This illustrates the
interest, in terms of sensitivity analysis setting and interpretation, of the
Shapley effects in the case of dependent inputs. For the practical issue of
computationally demanding computer models, we show that the substitution of the
original model by a metamodel (here, kriging) makes it possible to estimate
these indices with precision at a reasonable computational cost.

measure supported on a lower-dimensional subset of R^d and a finitely supported
measure. More precisely, the source measure is assumed to be supported on a
simplex soup, i.e. on a union of simplices of arbitrary dimension between 2 and
d. As in [Aurenhammer, Hoffman, Aronov, Algorithmica 20 (1), 1998, 61--76] we
recast this optimal transport problem as the resolution of a non-linear system
where one wants to prescribe the quantity of mass in each cell of the so-called
Laguerre diagram. We prove the convergence with linear speed of a damped
Newton's algorithm to solve this non-linear system. The convergence relies on
two conditions: (i) a genericity condition on the point cloud with respect to
the simplex soup and (ii) a (strong) connectedness condition on the support of
the source measure defined on the simplex soup. Finally, we apply our algorithm
in R^3 to compute optimal transport plans between a measure supported on a
triangulation and a discrete measure. We also detail some applications such as
optimal quantization of a probability density over a surface, remeshing or
rigid point set registration on a mesh.

is uncommon for asteroids larger than ~200 m. We revisited OE84 14 years after
it was first, and last, observed by Pravec et al. (2002) in order to measure
again its spin rate and to search for changes. We have confirmed the rapid
rotation and, by fitting the photometric data from 2001 and 2016 using the
lightcurve inversion technique, we determined a retrograde sense of rotation,
with the spin axis close to the ecliptic south pole; an oblate shape model of
a/b=1.32+-0.04 and b/c=1.8+-0.2; and no change in spin rate between 2001 and
2016. Using these parameters we constrained the body's internal strength, and
found that current estimations of asteroid cohesion (up to ~80 Pa) are
insufficient to maintain an intact rubble pile at the measured spin rate of
OE84. Therefore, we argue that a monolithic asteroid, that can rotate at the
rate of OE84 without shedding mass and without slowing down its spin rate, is
the most plausible for OE84, and we give constraints on its age, since the time
it was liberated from its parent body, between 2-10 million years.

formulated as the following eigenvalue optimization problem: Fix two positive
real numbers $r_1$ and $A$. We consider a disk $B\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ having
radius $r_1$. We want to place an obstacle $P$ of area $A$ within $B$ so as to
maximize or minimize the fundamental Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ for the
Laplacian on $B\setminus P$. That is, we want to study the behavior of the
function $\rho \mapsto \lambda_1(B\setminus\rho(P))$, where $\rho$ runs over
the set of all rigid motions of the plane fixing the center of mass for $P$
such that $\rho(P)\subset B$. In this paper, we consider a non-concentric
obstacle placement problem. The extremal configurations correspond to the cases
where an axis of symmetry of $P$ coincide with an axis of symmetry of $B$. We
also characterize the maximizing and the minimizing configurations in our main

4.1. We give many different generalizations of our result. At the end, we
provide some numerical evidence to validate our main theorem for the case where
the obstacle $P$ has $\mathbb{D}_4$ symmetry. For the $n$ odd case, we identify
some of the extremal configuration for $\lambda_1$. We prove that equation (6)

downward bias that emerges under fat tails. This has important implications for
the ongoing discussion about economic inequality.
  We start by discussing how the nonparametric estimator of the Gini index
undergoes a phase transition in the symmetry structure of its asymptotic
distribution, as the data distribution shifts from the domain of attraction of
a light-tailed distribution to that of a fat-tailed one, especially in the case
of infinite variance. We also show how the nonparametric Gini bias increases
with lower values of $\alpha$. We then prove that maximum likelihood estimation
outperforms nonparametric methods, requiring a much smaller sample size to
reach efficiency.

small sample bias of the nonparametric estimator based on the distance between
the mode and the mean of its asymptotic distribution.

shell (spherical Couette flow) experiment with a radius ratio of $\eta = 1/3$.
Inertial modes are Coriolis-restored linear wave modes which often arise in
rapidly rotating fluids. Recent experimental work has shown that inertial modes
exist in a spherical Couette flow for $\Omega_{i}<\Omega_{o}$, where $\Omega_i$
and $\Omega_o$ is the inner and outer sphere rotation rate. A finite number of
particular inertial modes has previously been found. By scanning the Rossby
number from $-2.5 < Ro = (\Omega_{i}-\Omega_{o})/\Omega_{o} < 0$ at two fixed
$\Omega_{o}$, we report the existence of similar inertial modes. However, the
behavior of the flow described here differs much from previous spherical
Couette experiments. We show that the kinetic energy of the dominant inertial
mode dramatically increases with decreasing Rossby number that eventually leads
to a wave-breaking and an increase of small-scale structures at a critical
Rossby number. Such a transition in a spherical Couette flow has not been
described before. The critical Rossby number scales with the Ekman number as0
$E^{1/5}$. Additionally, the increase of small-scale features beyond the
transition transfers energy to a massively enhanced mean flow around the
tangent cylinder. In this context, we discuss an interaction between the
dominant inertial modes with a geostrophic Rossby mode exciting secondary modes
whose frequencies match the triadic resonance condition.

trans-Neptunian objects in the presence of an external ten-earth-mass
perturber. The secular dynamics is analogous to an ""eccentric Kozai mechanism""
but with both an inner component (the four giant planets) and an outer one (the
eccentric distant perturber). By the means of Poincar\'e sections, the cases of
a non-inclined or inclined outer planet are successively studied, making the
connection with previous works. In the inclined case, the problem is reduced to
two degrees of freedom by assuming a non-precessing argument of perihelion for
the perturbing body.
  The size of the perturbation is typically ruled by the semi-major axis of the
small body: we show that the classic integrable picture is still valid below
about 70 AU, but it is progressively destroyed when we get closer to the
external perturber. In particular, for a>150 AU, large-amplitude orbital flips
become possible, and for a>200 AU, the Kozai libration islands are totally
submerged by the chaotic sea. Numerous resonance relations are highlighted. The
most large and persistent ones are associated to apsidal alignments or
anti-alignments with the orbit of the distant perturber.

investigating processes with two doubly-charged bileptons and two jets at the

momenta of final-states jets and leptons, the model yields a visible signal and
the main Standard Model backgrounds can be suppressed. Compared to previous
studies, our investigation is based on a full Monte Carlo implementation of the

of the key ingredients for the emergence of life. Cyanopolyynes are carbon
chains delimited at their two extremities by an atom of hydrogen and a cyano
group, so that they might be excellent reservoirs of carbon. The simplest
member, HC3N, is ubiquitous in the galactic interstellar medium and found also
in external galaxies. Thus, understanding the growth of cyanopolyynes in
regions forming stars similar to our Sun, and what affects it, is particularly
relevant. In the framework of the IRAM/NOEMA Large Program SOLIS (Seeds Of Life
In Space), we have obtained a map of two cyanopolyynes, HC3N and HC5N, in the
protocluster OMC2-FIR4. Because our Sun is thought to be born in a rich
cluster, OMC2-FIR4 is one of the closest and best known representatives of the
environment in which the Sun may have been born. We find a HC3N/HC5N abundance
ratio across the source in the range ~ 1 - 30, with the smallest values (< 10)
in FIR5 and in the Eastern region of FIR4. The ratios < 10 can be reproduced by
chemical models only if: (1) the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\zeta$ is ~ $4
\times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$; (2) the gaseous elemental ratio C/O is close to
unity; (3) O and C are largely depleted. The large $\zeta$ is comparable to
that measured in FIR4 by previous works and was interpreted as due to a flux of
energetic (> 10 MeV) particles from embedded sources. We suggest that these
sources could lie East of FIR4 and FIR5. A temperature gradient across FIR4,
with T decreasing by about 10 K, could also explain the observed change in the
HC3N/HC5N line ratio, without the need of a cosmic ray ionisation rate
gradient. However, even in this case, a high constant cosmic-ray ionisation
rate (of the order of $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$) is necessary to reproduce the

the space and orientation molecular density in the resolution of the molecular
density functional theory. We consider the common system made of a rigid solute
of arbitrary complexity immersed in a molecular solvent, both represented by
molecules with interacting atomic sites and classical force fields. The
molecular solvent density $\rho(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega})$ around the solute
is a function of the position $\mathbf{r}\equiv(x,y,z)$ and of the three Euler
angles $\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\theta,\phi,\psi)$ describing the solvent
orientation. The standard density functional, equivalent to the HNC closure for
the solute-solvent correlations in the liquid theory, is minimized with respect
to $\rho(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega})$. The up-to-now very expensive angular
convolution products are advantageously replaced by simple products between
projections onto generalized spherical harmonics. The dramatic gain in speed of
resolution enables to explore in a systematic way molecular solutes of up to
nanometric sizes in arbitrary solvents and to calculate their solvation free
energy and associated microscopic solvent structure in at most a few minutes.

(SVLBI) observations supported by a global ground array of radio telescopes.
With an apogee of about 350 000 km, it is offering for the first time the
possibility to perform {\mu}as-resolution imaging in the cm-band. We present
observations at 22 GHz of 3C 273, performed in 2014, designed to reach a
maximum baseline of approximately nine Earth diameters. Reaching an angular
resolution of 0.3 mas, we study a particularly low-activity state of the
source, and estimate the nuclear region brightness temperature, comparing with
the extreme one detected one year before during the RadioAstron early science
period. We also make use of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR survey data, at 43 GHz, to study
the kinematics of the jet in a 1.5-year time window. We find that the nuclear
brightness temperature is two orders of magnitude lower than the exceptionally
high value detected in 2013 with RadioAstron at the same frequency (1.4x10^13
K, source-frame), and even one order of magnitude lower than the equipartition
value. The kinematics analysis at 43 GHz shows that a new component was ejected
2 months after the 2013 epoch, visible also in our 22 GHz map presented here.
Consequently this was located upstream of the core during the brightness
temperature peak. These observations confirm that the previously detected
extreme brightness temperature in 3C 273, exceeding the inverse Compton limit,
is a short-lived phenomenon caused by a temporary departure from equipartition.
Thus, the availability of interferometric baselines capable of providing
{\mu}as angular resolution does not systematically imply measured brightness
temperatures over the known physical limits for astrophysical sources.

although results favored visual descriptors over attribute-based similarity,
both approaches are functional and highly diverse in terms of recommended

comprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs, it is shown that the
$t_{\rm burst}$ distribution in the observer frame consists of a bimodal
feature, suggesting the existence of a new population of ultra-long GRBs. In
this work, we make a series of further studies on $t_{\rm burst}$: we update
the Swift GRB sample up to June 2016; we investigate the properties of $t_{\rm
burst}$ distribution in the rest frame; we redefine $t_{\rm burst}$ by
involving external plateau contributions; we make a multiple parameter analysis
to investigate whether the bursts within the ultra-long population being
statistically different in sense of other features besides the duration
distribution. We find that for all situations, the distribution of $t_{\rm
burst}$ requires two normal distributions in logarithmic space to provide a
good fit, both in observer frame and rest frame. Considering the observational
gap effect would not completely erase the bimodal distribution feature. However
the bursts within the ultra-long population may have no statistically different
in sense of other features besides the duration term. We thus suggest that if
the ultra-long population of GRBs indeed exists, their central engine mechanism

have longer central engine activity timescale.

distortion and are potential sources of continuous gravitational waves (GWs)
for ground-based interferometric detectors. With decades of searches using
available GW detectors, no evidence of a GW signal from any pulsar has been
observed. Progressively stringent upper limits of ellipticity have been placed
on Galactic pulsars. In this work, we use the ellipticity inferred from the
putative millisecond magnetars in short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) to estimate
their detectability by current and future GW detectors. For $\sim 1$ ms
magnetars inferred from the SGRB data, the detection horizon is $\sim 30$ Mpc
and $\sim 600$ Mpc for advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET),
respectively. Using the ellipticity of SGRB millisecond magnetars as
calibration, we estimate the ellipticity and gravitational wave strain of
Galactic pulsars and magnetars assuming that the ellipticity is
magnetic-distortion-induced. We find that the results are consistent with the
null detection results of Galactic pulsars and magnetars with the aLIGO O1. We
further predict that the GW signals from these pulsars/magnetars may not be
detectable by the currently designed aLIGO detector. The ET detector may be
able to detect some relatively low frequency signals ($<50$ Hz) from some of
these pulsars. Limited by its design sensitivity, the eLISA detector seems not

semisimple, the higher genus theory is determined by an R-matrix via the
Givental-Teleman classification of Cohomological Field Theories (CohFTs). We
uniquely specify the required R-matrix by explicit data in degree 0. As a
consequence, we lift the basic triangle of equivalences relating the
equivariant quantum cohomology of the Hilbert scheme and the
Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence for 3-fold theories of local

previously determined analytic continuation of the fundamental solution of the

concerns new CohFTs defined by varying the 3-fold local curve in the moduli

gives a new perspective on their properties, particularly their radio loudness.
The large-scale environment is believed to have an impact on the evolution and
intrinsic properties of galaxies, however, NLS1 sources have not been studied
in this context before. We have a large and diverse sample of 1341 NLS1
galaxies and three separate environment data sets constructed using Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We use various statistical methods to investigate how the
properties of NLS1 galaxies are connected to the large-scale environment, and
compare the large-scale environments of NLS1 galaxies with other active galacic
nuclei (AGN) classes, for example, other jetted AGN and broad-line Seyfert 1
(BLS1) galaxies, to study how they are related. NLS1 galaxies reside in less
dense environments than any of the comparison samples, thus confirming their
young age. The average large-scale environment density and environmental
distribution of NLS1 sources is clearly different compared to BLS1 galaxies,
thus it is improbable that they could be the parent population of NLS1 galaxies
and unified by orientation. Within the NLS1 class there is a trend of
increasing radio loudness with increasing large-scale environment density,
indicating that the large-scale environment affects their intrinsic properties.
Our results suggest that the NLS1 class of sources is not homogeneous, and
furthermore, a considerable fraction of them are misclassified. We further
support a published proposal to replace the traditional classification to
radio-loud, and radio-quiet or radio-silent sources with a division to jetted
and non-jetted sources.

young low surface-gravity L5-L7 dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a
luminosity consistent with a 6-12 MJup, Teff=1300-1600 K and R=1.5 RJup giant

higher surface gravity solutions of log(g)=4.0-5.0 with smaller radii (1.0-1.3

the efficient evaluation of analytical queries over multiple sensor datasets.
The magnitude of such datasets makes exact query answering infeasible, leading
researchers into the development of approximate query answering approaches.
However, existing approximate query answering algorithms are not suited for the
efficient processing of queries over sensor data, as they exhibit at least one
of the following shortcomings: (a) They do not provide deterministic error
guarantees, resorting to weaker probabilistic error guarantees that are in many
cases not acceptable, (b) they allow queries only over a single dataset, thus
not supporting the multitude of queries over multiple datasets that appear in
practice, such as correlation or cross-correlation and (c) they support
relational data in general and thus miss speedup opportunities created by the
special nature of sensor data, which are not random but follow a typically
smooth underlying phenomenon.
  To address these problems, we propose PlatoDB; a system that exploits the
nature of sensor data to compress them and provide efficient processing of
queries over multiple sensor datasets, while providing deterministic error
guarantees. PlatoDB achieves the above through a novel architecture that (a) at
data import time pre-processes each dataset, creating for it an intermediate
hierarchical data structure that provides a hierarchy of summarizations of the
dataset together with appropriate error measures and (b) at query processing
time leverages the pre-computed data structures to compute an approximate
answer and deterministic error guarantees for ad hoc queries even when these
combine multiple datasets.

layer number in the artificial network setting is the analog of time in the

that adding more layers (making the network deeper) is analogous to adding
temporal resolution in a data assimilation framework.
  How one can find a candidate for the global minimum of the cost functions in
the machine learning context using a method from data assimilation is
discussed. Calculations on simple models from each side of the equivalence are
reported.
  Also discussed is a framework in which the time or layer label is taken to be
continuous, providing a differential equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation,
which shows that the problem being solved is a two point boundary value problem
familiar in the discussion of variational methods. The use of continuous layers
is denoted ""deepest learning"". These problems respect a symplectic symmetry in
continuous time/layer phase space. Both Lagrangian versions and Hamiltonian
versions of these problems are presented. Their well-studied implementation in
a discrete time/layer, while respected the symplectic structure, is addressed.
The Hamiltonian version provides a direct rationale for back propagation as a

tracking velocimetry to quantify the fluid flow as well as the motion of

sediment transport, we observe that an increasing fraction of grains are
transported downstream, although the average downstream velocity of the
transported grains remains roughly constant. However, we find that the fraction
of mobilized grains does not vanish sharply at a critical flow rate.
Additionally, the distribution of the fluctuating velocities of non-transported
grains becomes broader with heavier tails, meaning that unambiguously
separating mobile and static grains is not possible. As an alternative
approach, we quantify the statistics of grain velocities by using a mixture
model consisting of two forms for the grain velocities: a decaying-exponential
tail, which represents grains transported downstream, and a peaked distribution
centered at zero velocity, which represents grains that fluctuate due to the
turbulent flow but remain in place. Our results suggest that more sophisticated
statistical measures may be required to quantify grain motion near the onset of
sediment transport, particularly in the presence of turbulence.

cluster models of dye-sensitized solar cells within a single active electron
approach. Initially, three different donor-acceptor $\pi$-conjugated dyes
supported on colloidal titania clusters are compared from the perspective of
their optical and electronic properties. The potential performance of the model
solar cell devices for charge migration processes is predicted from a static
perspective. For this purpose, parameter-free expressions for state-resolved
injection times and currents are established and evaluated for the three
systems. A broadband laser excitation promoting the excited states in the
visible region initiates the electron migration process. The evolution of the
electronic wave packet is analyzed with a density-based toolset including the
electronic yields partitioned for characteristic fragments of the model
complexes and the time-dependent one-electron density for distinctive time
steps in the dynamics. On the one hand, these reveal a microscopic picture for
the mechanistic pathway of the charge migration and on the other hand, they
validate the results from the time-independent analysis concerning the
photovoltaic efficiency.

$\left(A+\Gamma\right)^{\circ}\ne\emptyset$ whenever $\Gamma$ has non-vanishing

energy budget of radiation could exceed that of galactic winds and supernovae
combined, which has driven the development of sophisticated algorithms that
evolve both the radiation field and the hydrodynamical response of gas
simultaneously, in a cosmological context. We probe self-feedback on galactic
scales using the adaptive mesh refinement, radiative transfer, hydrodynamics,
and $N$-body code. Unlike previous studies which assume a homogeneous UV
background, we self-consistently evolve both the radiation field and gas to
constrain the halo baryon fraction during cosmic reionization. We demonstrate
that the characteristic halo mass with mean baryon fraction half the cosmic
mean, $M_{\mathrm{c}}(z)$, shows very little variation as a function of
mass-weighted ionization fraction. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of
metal cooling and the ability to resolve scales small enough for self-shielding
to become efficient leads to a significant drop in $M_{\mathrm{c}}$ when
compared to recent studies. Finally, we develop an Artificial Neural Network
that is capable of predicting the baryon fraction of haloes based on recent
tidal interactions, gas temperature, and mass-weighted ionization fraction.
Such a model can be applied to any reionization history, and trivially
incorporated into semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.

symbols and compositions of symbols are represented by activity patterns
(vectors) in a large population of neurons. Formal models implementing this
idea [Plate 2003], [Kanerva 2009], [Gayler 2003], [Eliasmith 2012] include a
reversible superposition operation for representing with a single vector an
entire set of symbols or an ordered sequence of symbols. If the representation
space is high-dimensional, large sets of symbols can be superposed and
individually retrieved. However, crosstalk noise limits the accuracy of
retrieval and information capacity. To understand information processing in the
brain and to design artificial neural systems for cognitive reasoning, a theory
of this superposition operation is essential. Here, such a theory is presented.
The superposition operations in different existing models are mapped to linear
neural networks with unitary recurrent matrices, in which retrieval accuracy
can be analyzed by a single equation. We show that networks representing
information in superposition can achieve a channel capacity of about half a bit
per neuron, a significant fraction of the total available entropy. Going beyond
existing models, superposition operations with recency effects are proposed
that avoid catastrophic forgetting when representing the history of infinite
data streams. These novel models correspond to recurrent networks with
non-unitary matrices or with nonlinear neurons, and can be analyzed and
optimized with an extension of our theory.

out of the interstellar medium as the velocity offset, Deltav, between the
systemic redshift (zsys) and the center of low-ionization absorption line
systems (LIS). To increase the SN of VUDS spectra, we stacked subsamples. We
measured the systemic redshift from the rest-frame UV spectroscopic data using
the CIII]1908 nebular emission line, and we considered SiII1526 as the highest
signal-to-noise LIS line. We calculated the Lya peak shift with respect to the
zsys, the EW(Lya), and the Lya spatial extension, Ext(Lya-C), from the profiles
in the 2D stacked spectra. The galaxies that are faint in the rest-frame UV
continuum, strong in Lya and CIII], with compact UV morphology, and localized
in an underdense environment are characterized by outflow velocities of the
order of a few hundreds of km/sec. The subsamples with smaller Deltav are
characterized by larger Lya peak shifts, larger Ext(Lya-C), and smaller
EW(Lya). In general we find that EW(Lya) anti-correlates with Ext(Lya-C) and
Lya peak shift. We interpret these trends using a radiative-transfer shell
model. The model predicts that an HI gas with a column density larger than
10^20/cm^2 is able to produce Lya peak shifts larger than >300km/sec. An ISM
with this value of NHI would favour a large amount of scattering events,
especially when the medium is static, so it can explain large values of
Ext(Lya-C) and small EW(Lya). On the contrary, an ISM with a lower NHI, but
large velocity outflows would lead to a Lya spatial profile peaked at the
galaxy center (i.e. low values of Ext(Lya-C)) and to a large EW(Lya), as we see
in our data. Our results and their interpretation via radiative-transfer models
tell us that it is possible to use Lya to study the properties of the HI gas.

acquires a contribution depending logarithmically on the Fermi energy. This
result is in a sharp contrast to the nontilted case, where the Nernst response
is known to be zero in the linear model. The thermal Hall conductivity
similarly acquires Fermi surface contributions, which add to the Fermi level

  Complexity Near Criticality",,,,,"cs.NE physics.soc-ph q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What does the informational complexity of dynamical networked systems tell us
about intrinsic mechanisms and functions of these complex systems? Recent
complexity measures such as integrated information have sought to
operationalize this problem taking a whole-versus-parts perspective, wherein
one explicitly computes the amount of information generated by a network as a
whole over and above that generated by the sum of its parts during state
transitions. While several numerical schemes for estimating network integrated
information exist, it is instructive to pursue an analytic approach that
computes integrated information as a function of network weights. Our
formulation of integrated information uses a Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the multi-variate distribution on the set of network states versus the
corresponding factorized distribution over its parts. Implementing stochastic
Gaussian dynamics, we perform computations for several prototypical network
topologies. Our findings show increased informational complexity near
criticality, which remains consistent across network topologies. Spectral
decomposition of the system's dynamics reveals how informational complexity is
governed by eigenmodes of both, the network's covariance and adjacency
matrices. We find that as the dynamics of the system approach criticality, high
integrated information is exclusively driven by the eigenmode corresponding to
the leading eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, while sub-leading modes get
suppressed. The implication of this result is that it might be favorable for
complex dynamical networked systems such as the human brain or communication
systems to operate near criticality so that efficient information integration
might be achieved.

We investigate the maximum astrometric precision that can be reached on

  Methods. We extend previous work on one-dimensional Gaussian point-spread
functions (PSFs) focusing on moving objects and extending the scope to
two-dimensional array detectors. In this study the PSF of a stationary
point-source celestial body is replaced by its convolution with a linear
motion, thus effectively modeling the spread function of a moving target.
  Results. The expressions of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound deduced by this
method allow us to study in great detail the limit of astrometric precision
that can be reached for moving celestial objects, and to compute an optimal
exposure time according to different observational parameters such as seeing,
detector pixel size, decentering, and elongation of the source caused by its
drift. Comparison to simulated and real data shows that the predictions of our

the cornerstones of robotic manipulation under uncertainty. In a number of
joint research projects our group is developing a robotic perception system
that perceives and models an unprepared kitchen scenario with many objects.
Since no single sensor or measurement provides sufficient information, a
technique is needed to fuse a number of uncertain estimates of the pose, i.e.
estimates with a widely stretched probability density function ($pdf$). The
most frequently used approaches to describe the $pdfs$ are sample based
description and multivariate normal (Gaussian) distributions. Sample based
descriptions in 6D can describe basically any type of $pdfs$, but they require
a large number of samples and there are no analytic formulae to fuse several
$pdfs$. For Gaussian distributions these formulae exist, but the Gaussian
distributions are unimodal and don't model widely spread distributions well. In
this paper we present a framework for probabilistic modeling of 6D poses that
combines the expressive power of the sample based description with the
conciseness and algorithmic power of the Gaussian models. As parameterization
of the 6D poses we select the dual quaternions, i.e. any pose is represented by
two quaternions. The orientation part of a pose is described by a unit
quaternion. The translation part is described by a purely imaginary quaternion.
A basic probability density function over the poses is constructed by selecting
a tangent point on the 3D sphere representing unit quaternions and taking the
Cartesian set product of the tangent space with the 3D space of translations.
In this 6D Euclidean space a 6D Gaussian distribution is defined. Projecting
this Gaussian back to the unit sphere and renormalizing induces a distribution
over 6D poses, called a Projected Gaussian.

adjacency matrix whose inverse is diagonally similar to a nonnegative integral
matrix; the graph defined by the last matrix is then the inverse of the
original graph. In this paper we call such graphs positively invertible and
introduce a new concept of a negatively invertible graph by replacing the
adjective `nonnegative' by `nonpositive in Godsil's definition; the graph
defined by the negative of the resulting matrix is then the negative inverse of
the original graph. We propose new constructions of integrally invertible
graphs (those with non-singular adjacency matrix whose inverse is integral)
based on an operation of `bridging' a pair of integrally invertible graphs over
subsets of their vertices, with sufficient conditions for their positive and
negative invertibility. We also analyze spectral properties of graphs arising
from bridging and derive lower bounds for their least positive eigenvalue. As
an illustration we present a census of graphs with a unique 1-factor on $m\le
6$ vertices and determine their positive and negative invertibility.

  Data",,,,,"math.FA math.AP physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article provides a mathematical analysis of singular (nonsmooth)
artifacts added to reconstructions by filtered backprojection (FBP) type
algorithms for X-ray CT with arbitrary incomplete data. We prove that these
singular artifacts arise from points at the boundary of the data set. Our
results show that, depending on the geometry of this boundary, two types of
artifacts can arise: object-dependent and object-independent artifacts.
Object-dependent artifacts are generated by singularities of the object being
scanned and these artifacts can extend along lines. They generalize the streak
artifacts observed in limited-angle tomography. Object-independent artifacts,
on the other hand, are essentially independent of the object and take one of
two forms: streaks on lines if the boundary of the data set is not smooth at a
point and curved artifacts if the boundary is smooth locally. We prove that
these streak and curve artifacts are the only singular artifacts that can occur
for FBP in the continuous case. In addition to the geometric description of
artifacts, the article provides characterizations of their strength in Sobolev
scale in certain cases. The results of this article apply to the well-known
incomplete data problems, including limited-angle and region-of-interest
tomography, as well as to unconventional X-ray CT imaging setups that arise in
new practical applications. Reconstructions from simulated and real data are
analyzed to illustrate our theorems, including the reconstruction that
motivated this work---a synchrotron data set in which artifacts appear on lines
that have no relation to the object.

  using multivariate and multimodal time series",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sleep stage classification constitutes an important preliminary exam in the
diagnosis of sleep disorders. It is traditionally performed by a sleep expert
who assigns to each 30s of signal a sleep stage, based on the visual inspection
of signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrooculograms (EOG),
electrocardiograms (ECG) and electromyograms (EMG). We introduce here the first
deep learning approach for sleep stage classification that learns end-to-end
without computing spectrograms or extracting hand-crafted features, that
exploits all multivariate and multimodal Polysomnography (PSG) signals (EEG,
EMG and EOG), and that can exploit the temporal context of each 30s window of
data. For each modality the first layer learns linear spatial filters that
exploit the array of sensors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and the
last layer feeds the learnt representation to a softmax classifier. Our model
is compared to alternative automatic approaches based on convolutional networks
or decisions trees. Results obtained on 61 publicly available PSG records with
up to 20 EEG channels demonstrate that our network architecture yields
state-of-the-art performance. Our study reveals a number of insights on the
spatio-temporal distribution of the signal of interest: a good trade-off for
optimal classification performance measured with balanced accuracy is to use 6
EEG with 2 EOG (left and right) and 3 EMG chin channels. Also exploiting one
minute of data before and after each data segment offers the strongest
improvement when a limited number of channels is available. As sleep experts,
our system exploits the multivariate and multimodal nature of PSG signals in
order to deliver state-of-the-art classification performance with a small
computational cost.

understand these massive and dynamically changing datasets. However, previous

geographical movement or are unable to handle today's massive data. In this
paper, we develop MovePattern, a novel framework to 1) efficiently construct a
concise multi-level view of movements using a scalable and spatially-aware
MapReduce-based approach and 2) present a fast and highly interactive webbased
environment which engages vector-based visualization to include on-the-fly
customization and the ability to enhance analytical functions by storing
metadata for both places and movements. We evaluate the framework using the
movements of Twitter users captured from geo-tagged tweets. The experiments
confirmed that our framework is able to aggregate close to 180 million
movements in a few minutes. In addition, we run series of stress tests on the
front-end of the framework to ensure that simultaneous user queries do not lead
to long latency in the user response.

(even with leading edge touch-screen technology). As in the most part of the
world, in Latvia also conventional ""Qwerty"" keyboard is used. Though for
Latvian it is much worse than for English, especially due to enormous load to
little fingers. It causes repetitive strain injuries and affects productivity
of workers with extensive keyboard usage, especially for data input operators,
call centers, inquiry office workers, etc. Improving computer keyboard layout
decrease stress to hands and fingers thus minimizing exhaustion and injuries.
With analysis of English and Latvian public domain novels and modern texts,
letter appearance an sequence distribution for Latvian language was found.
Qualities of alternative layouts for English (Dvorak, Colemak, Hallinstad) were
investigated and open source carpalx simulation tool was adjusted according to
the findings. Then carpalx was used to check more than 25 million keyboard
layouts, measuring finger/hand effort, stroke typing convenience etc., to find
the best one. It was proved that existing ""\v{S}usildatec"" (classic Latvian
Ergonomic standard) keyboard is only slightly better than ""Qwerty"" for Latvian,
though it is much worse for English. After computer simulation, several best
layouts were tried practically for more than 6 months and most convenient one
was promoted as a new ""Latvian Modern"" keyboard. Its typing effort is less than
for ""\v{S}usildatec"", load is distributed according to finger strength, and
typing strokes are alternating better between hands and fingers. Comparing to
""Qwerty"" keyboard new layout is better not only for Latvian but for English
also. Keyboard drivers are developed for Microsoft Windows and Linux operating
systems and are freely available in the web under permissive license.

the basic combinational logic modules such as adders, multiplexers, encoders,
Barrel shifters (B-shifters), and comparators and does not use any lookup
table. This method in fact combines the iterative properties of singular value
decomposition method and CORDIC method in one single iteration. The introduced
architecture is a systolic architecture that uses two different types of
processors, diagonal and non-diagonal processors. The diagonal processor
calculates, transmits and applies the horizontal and vertical rotations, while
the non-diagonal processor uses a fully combinational architecture to receive,
and apply the rotations. The diagonal processor uses priority encoders, Barrel
shifters, and comparators to calculate the rotation angles. Both processors use
a series of adders to apply the rotation angles. The design presented in this
work provides $2.83\sim649$ times better energy per matrix performance compared
to the state of the art designs. This performance achieved without the
employment of pipelining; a better performance advantage is expected to be
achieved employing pipelining.
