the classical Steiner problem in a covering space setting and we give some
explicit examples. Moreover we introduce the notion of calibration in families:
the idea is to divide the set of competitors in a suitable way, defining an
appropriate (and weaker) notion of calibration. Then, calibrating the candidate
minimizers in each family and comparing their perimeter, it is possible to find
the minimizers of the minimization problem. Thanks to this procedure we prove
the minimality of the Steiner configurations spanning the vertices of a regular
hexagon and of a regular pentagon.

implement the motion of an ideal flow, in which the vorticity is approximated
by a sum of point vortices, so that the Euler equations read as a system of

plane, thanks to the explicit representation formulas of Biot and Savart. In an
exterior domain, we also replace the impermeable boundary by a collection of

smooth exterior domain, one of the main mathematical difficulties being that
the Biot--Savart kernel defines a singular integral operator when restricted to
a curve (here, the boundary of the domain). We also introduce an alternative

interacting systems are driven to a crossover region, but from opposite
directions as a convergence of itinerancy and Mottness.In the weak interaction
region, particles are nearly itinerant,and inter-particle collisions are
enhanced by $N$, resulting in the amplification of interaction effects. In
contrast, in the strong coupling region, increasing $N$ softens the
Mott-insulating background through the enhanced virtual hopping processes.The
crossover region exhibits nearly $N$-independent physical quantities, including
the relative bandwidth, Fermi distribution, and the spin structure factor.The
difference between even-$N$ and odd-$N$ systems is most prominent at small
$N$'s with strong interactions, since the odd case allows local real hopping
with an energy scale much larger than the virtual one.The above effects can be
experimentally tested in ultracold atom experiments with alkaline-earth (-like)

to fill the values of some cells using values stored in other cells. For
instance, such data completion tasks arise in the context of missing value

struggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming
expertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data
completion tasks using programming-by-example (PBE) and a very lightweight
sketching approach. Given a formula sketch (e.g., AVG($?_1$, $?_2$)) and a few
input-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to
automate the desired data completion task. Towards this goal, we propose a
domain-specific language (DSL) that combines spatial and relational reasoning
over tabular data and a novel synthesis algorithm that can generate DSL
programs that are consistent with the input-output examples. The key technical
novelty of our approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based
on finite tree automata (FTA). The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads
to a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that
are consistent with the examples. We have implemented the proposed approach in
a tool called DACE and evaluate it on 84 benchmarks taken from online help

off-the-shelf methods from the computer-science field of machine learning to
create a ""discovery engine"" for data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
The applied problem we seek to solve is that economists invest vast resources
into carrying out RCTs, including the collection of a rich set of candidate
outcome measures. But given concerns about inference in the presence of
multiple testing, economists usually wind up exploring just a small subset of
the hypotheses that the available data could be used to test. This prevents us
from extracting as much information as possible from each RCT, which in turn
impairs our ability to develop new theories or strengthen the design of policy
interventions. Our proposed solution combines the basic intuition of reverse
regression, where the dependent variable of interest now becomes treatment
assignment itself, with methods from machine learning that use the data
themselves to flexibly identify whether there is any function of the outcomes
that predicts (or has signal about) treatment group status. This leads to
correctly-sized tests with appropriate $p$-values, which also have the
important virtue of being easy to implement in practice. One open challenge
that remains with our work is how to meaningfully interpret the signal that
these methods find.

relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on
shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these

potentially limits performance. In this work, we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer
convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art
results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly
parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with
8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is
particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree -- which are
common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and
YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer
from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being
present in the test set -- however, the extent of this issue has so far not
been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model
can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that
models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations
cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly
used datasets -- deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform
experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously
proposed models and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal

that it is possible to satisfy all present constraints on the PBH abundance,

non-observation of gravitational wave background allows us to derive
constraints on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, which are stronger than any
other current constraint in the PBH mass range $0.5-30M_\odot$. We show that
the predicted gravitational wave background can be observed by the coming runs

primordial origin. As the PBH mergers convert matter into radiation, they may
have interesting cosmological implications, for example, in the context of
relieving the tension between the high and low redshift measurements of the

the quantum Levi-Civita connection for a general quantum symmetric metric,

Ricci flow of surfaces with singularities of cone type. A second objective,
emerged from the techniques we use, is the study of families of Ricci flow
solitons in dimension 2 and 3. The Ricci flow is an evolution equation for
Riemannian manifolds, introduced by R. Hamilton in 1982. It is from the
achievements made by G. Perelman with this technique in 2002 when the Ricci
flow has been established in a discipline itself, generating a great interest
in the community. This thesis contains four original results. First result is a
complete classification of solitons in smooth and cone surfaces. This
classification completes the preceding results found by Hamilton, Chow and Wu
and others, and we obtain explicit descriptions of all solitons in dimension 2.
Second result is a Geometrization of cone surfaces by Ricci flow. This result,
which uses the aforementioned first result, extends the theory of Hamilton to
the singular case. This is the most comprehensive result in the thesis, for
which we use and develop analysis and PDE techniques, as well as comparison
geometry techniques. Third result is the existence of a Ricci flow that removes
cone singularities. This clearly exposes the non-uniqueness of solutions to the
flow , in analogy to the Ricci flow with cusps of P. Topping. The fourth result
is the construction of a new expanding gradient Ricci soliton in dimension 3.
Just as we do with solitons on cone surfaces, we give an explicit construction
using techniques of phase portraits. We also prove that this is the only
soliton with its topology and its lower bound of the curvature, and besides
this is a critical case amongst all expanding solitons in dimension 3 with
curvature bounded below.

and provides surprisingly compact expressions for both counterdiabatic
Hamiltonians and fast-forward potentials. We illustrate our method with
numerical simulations of a model system, and we compare our shortcuts with
previously obtained results. We also consider the semiclassical connections
between our quantum and classical shortcuts. Our method, like the fast-forward
approach developed by previous authors, is susceptible to singularities when
applied to excited states of quantum systems; we propose a simple, intuitive
criterion for determining whether these singularities will arise, for a given
excited state.

modulation of the coupling between a fixed frequency qubit and resonator. The
coupling modulation is achieved with a tunable coupler design, in which the
qubit and the resonator are connected in parallel to a superconducting quantum
interference device. This allows for quasi-static tuning of the qubit-cavity
coupling strength from 12 MHz to more than 300 MHz. Additionally, the coupling
can be dynamically modulated, allowing for single photon exchange in 6 ns.
Qubit coherence times exceeding 20 $\mu$s are maintained over the majority of
the range of tuning, limited primarily by the Purcell effect. The parametric
stabilization technique realized using the tunable coupler involves engineering
the qubit bath through a combination of photon non-conserving sideband
interactions realized by flux modulation, and direct qubit Rabi driving. We
demonstrate that the qubit can be stabilized to arbitrary states on the Bloch
sphere with a worst-case fidelity exceeding 80 %.

disks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to

analyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus
star forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine

and to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations
directly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890
micron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out
of 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical
properties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,
and we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar
parameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux
(a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the
disk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at
similar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature
and scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are
generally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.
Considering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to
tentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous
spreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be
ruled out.

For this purpose, we used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in

which are suitable tracers of disk, envelope, and outflow dynamics at a spatial
resolution of $\sim 30$ AU. We report a bipolar outflow that was launched at
symmetric positions with respect to the disk ($\sim$80~AU in radius), but was
concentrated at a distance of 90--130~AU from the disk center. The two outflow
lobes had a conical shape and the gas inside was accelerating. The large offset
of the launching position coincided with the landing site of the infall
material from the extended spiral structure (seen in dust) onto the disk. This
indicates that bipolar outflows are efficiently launched within a narrow region
outside the disk edge. We also identify a sharp transition in the gas
kinematics across the tip of the spiral structure, which pinpoints the location

find that the circularly polarized light-induced anisotropies have similar

latter induces spin canting out-of-plane with nonzero scalar spin chirality.

elastic properties can be built from a single material, varying gradually the
bulk porosity of the material or its geometrical structure. However, if such a

criticality. The critical exponent $\nu$ can be extracted from our proposed
dynamical procedure, which can then be used directly in experiments to
determine whether the Harris-Chayes-bound holds for the MBL transition. These

has presented astronomers the unique opportunity to survey mass/magnitude
complete samples of galaxies at \emph{Cosmic Noon}, a time period where
$\sim80\%$ of the observed baryonic mass is generated and galaxies are actively
star-forming and evolving rapidly. This thesis takes advantage of the recently
commissioned MOSFIRE spectrograph on Keck, to conduct a survey (ZFIRE) of
galaxies at $1.5<z<2.5$ to measure accurate spectroscopic redshifts and basic
galaxy properties derived from multiple emission lines.
  The majority of the thesis work involved survey planning, observing, data
reduction, and catalogue preparation of the ZFIRE survey and is described in
detail in this thesis. Using the ZFIRE spectroscopic redshifts, I show why
spectroscopy is instrumental to determine fundamental galaxy properties via SED
fitting techniques and to probe gravitationally bound structures in the early
universe. The thesis further presents basic properties of the ZFIRE data
products publicly released for the benefit of the astronomy community.
  The high mass-completeness of the ZFIRE spectroscopic data at $z\sim2$ makes
it ideal to study fundamental galaxy properties such as, star formation rates,
metallicities, inter-stellar medium properties, galaxy kinematics, and the
stellar initial mass functions in unbiased star-forming galaxies. This thesis
focuses on one such aspect, the IMF.

possible scenarios, showing in particular how the presence of a shrinking hot
spot in this source is hardly reconcilable with internal crustal cooling and
favors the untwisting bundle model for this outburst. Moreover, we also show
how the emission from a single uniform hot spot is incompatible with the
observed pulsed fraction evolution for any pair of viewing angles, suggesting
an anisotropic emission pattern.

star with an orbital period of P~3.47 days. We identified the initial transit
signal in KELT-North survey data. Archival and follow-up photometry, the Gaia
parallax, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imaging
were used to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and characterize the
system. From global modeling we infer that the host star HD 185603 is a
rapidly-rotating (VsinI~120 km/s) A2V star with an effective temperature of
$T_{eff}$=8730K, mass of $M_{star}=1.76M_{sun}$, radius of
$R_{star}=1.561R_{sun}$, surface gravity of logg=4.292, and age of <600 Myr.
The planetary companion has a radius of $1.735^{+0.070}_{-0.075}~R_{J}$, a
semimajor axis of $a=0.0542^{+0.0014}_{-0.0021}$AU, and a linear ephemeris of
$BJD_{TDB}=2457503.120049 \pm 0.000190 + E(3.4741070\pm0.0000019)$. We place a
$3\sigma$ upper limit of ~3.5 $M_{J}$ on the mass of the planet. The Doppler
tomographic measurement indicates that the planetary orbit is well aligned with
the projected spin-axis of the star ($\lambda= 3.4\pm {2.1}$ degrees). The
inclination of the star is constrained to be $24.4<I_*<155.6$ degrees, implying
a true (three-dimensional) spin-orbit alignment of $1.3<\psi<69.8$ degrees. The
planet receives an insolation flux of $\sim 8\times 10^9~{\rm
erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, implying an equilibrium temperature of of ~ 2250 K,
assuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. Due to the high stellar
$T_{eff}$, the planet also receives an ultraviolet (wavelengths $d\le 91.2$~nm)
insolation flux of $\sim 9.1\times 10^4~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, which may
lead to significant ablation of the planetary atmosphere. Together with
WASP-33, Kepler-13 A, HAT-P-57, KELT-17, and KELT-9, KELT-20 is the sixth A
star host of a transiting giant planet, and the third-brightest host (in V) of
a transiting planet.

the variance of volume fraction fluctuations for randomly placed windows of
fixed size. In particular, fluctuations are determined by the average number of
particles within a distance $h$ from the boundary of the window. We first
compute special expectations and bounds in $d$ dimensions, and then illustrate
the range of behavior of $h$ versus window size $L$ by analyzing three
different types of simulated two-dimensional pixel pattern - where particle
positions are stored as a binary digital image in which pixels have value
zero/one if empty/contain a particle. The first are random binomial patterns,
where pixels are randomly flipped from zero to one with probability equal to
area fraction. These have long-ranged density fluctuations, and simulations
confirm the exact result $h=L/2$. Next we consider vacancy patterns, where a
fraction $f$ of particles on a lattice are randomly removed. These also display
long-range density fluctuations, but with $h=(L/2)(f/d)$ for small $f$. For a
hyperuniform system with no long-range density fluctuations, we consider
Einstein patterns where each particle is independently displaced from a lattice
site by a Gaussian-distributed amount. For these, at large $L$, $h$ approaches
a constant equal to about half the root-mean-square displacement in each
dimension. Then we turn to grayscale pixel patterns that represent simulated
arrangements of polydisperse particles, where the volume of a particle is
encoded in the value of its central pixel. And we discuss the continuum limit
of point patterns, where pixel size vanishes. In general, we thus propose to
quantify particle configurations not just by the scaling of the density
fluctuation spectrum but rather by the real-space spectrum of $h(L)$ versus
$L$. We call this approach Hyperuniformity Disorder Length Spectroscopy.

for analyzing volume fraction fluctuations for a set of measuring windows. This
length permits a direct connection to the nature of disorder in the spatial
configuration of the particles, and provides a way to diagnose the degree of
hyperuniformity in terms of the scaling of $h$ and its value in comparison with
established bounds. Here, this approach is generalized for extended particles,
which are larger than the image resolution and can lie partially inside and
partially outside the measuring windows. The starting point is an expression
for the volume fraction variance in terms of four distinct volumes: that of the
particle, the measuring window, the mean-squared overlap between particle and
region, and the region over which particles have non-zero overlap with the
measuring window. After establishing limiting behaviors, computational methods
are developed for both continuum and pixelated particles. Exact results are
presented for particles of special shape, and for measuring windows of special
shape. Comparison is made for other particle shapes, using simulated Poisson
patterns. And the effects of polydisersity and image errors are discussed. For
small measuring windows, both particle shape and spatial arrangement affect the
form of the variance. For large regions, the variance scaling depends only on
arrangement but particle shape sets the numerical proportionality. The combined
understanding permit the measured variance to be translated to the spectrum of
hyperuniformity lengths versus region size, as the quantifier of spatial
arrangement. This program is demonstrated for a system of non-overlapping
particles at a series of increasing packing fractions as well as for an
Einstein pattern of particles with several different extended shapes.

of a physical and associated numerical model for the Compton scatter process.
Using this model, we propose a variational approach recovering these two
material properties. In addition to the typical data-fidelity terms, the
optimization functional includes regularization for both the mass density and
photoelectric coefficients. We consider a novel edge-preserving method in the
case of mass density. To aid in the recovery of the photoelectric information,
we draw on our recent method in \cite{r15} and employ a non-local
regularization scheme that builds on the fact that mass density is more stably
imaged. Simulation results demonstrate clear advantages associated with the use
of both scattered photon data and energy resolved information in mapping the
two material properties of interest. Specifically, comparing images obtained
using only conventional attenuation data with those where we employ only
Compton scatter photons and images formed from the combination of the two,
shows that taking advantage of both types of data for reconstruction provides
far more accurate results.

incorporates raw pixelated semantic measurements into the map representation.
The proposed technique uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) multi-class classification
for map inference and is the natural extension of GP occupancy maps from binary
to multi-class form. The technique exploits the continuous property of GPs and,
as a result, the map can be inferred with any resolution. In addition, the
proposed GP Semantic Map (GPSM) learns the structural and semantic correlation
from measurements rather than resorting to assumptions, and can flexibly learn
the spatial correlation as well as any additional non-spatial correlation
between map points. We extend the OctoMap to Semantic OctoMap representation
and compare with the GPSM mapping performance using NYU Depth V2 dataset.
Evaluations of the proposed technique on multiple partially labeled RGBD scans
and labels from noisy image segmentation show that the GP semantic map can
handle sparse measurements, missing labels in the point cloud, as well as noise
corrupted labels.

algorithms that decide termination and non-termination of programs or decide
inductive/coinductive soundness of formulae is a challenging task. For example,
the existing state-of-the-art algorithms can only semi-decide coinductive
soundness of queries in logic programming for regular formulae. Another, less
famous, but equally fundamental and important undecidable property is
productivity. If a derivation is infinite and coinductively sound, we may ask
whether the computed answer it determines actually computes an infinite
formula. If it does, the infinite computation is productive. This intuition was
first expressed under the name of computations at infinity in the 80s. In
modern days of the Internet and stream processing, its importance lies in
connection to infinite data structure processing.
  Recently, an algorithm was presented that semi-decides a weaker property --
of productivity of logic programs. A logic program is productive if it can give
rise to productive derivations. In this paper we strengthen these recent
results. We propose a method that semi-decides productivity of individual
derivations for regular formulae. Thus we at last give an algorithmic
counterpart to the notion of productivity of derivations in logic programming.
This is the first algorithmic solution to the problem since it was raised more
than 30 years ago. We also present an implementation of this algorithm.

investigate soft X-ray absorption as an indicator for the detection of
associated HI absorption, as part of preparation for the First Large Absorption
Survey in HI (FLASH) to be undertaken with the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We present the results of our pilot study using the
Boolardy Engineering Test Array, a precursor to ASKAP, to search for new
absorption detections in radio sources brighter than 1 Jy that also feature
soft X-ray absorption. Based on this pilot survey, we detected HI absorption
towards the radio source PKS 1657-298 at a redshift of z = 0.42. This source
also features the highest X-ray absorption ratio of our pilot sample by a
factor of 3, which is consistent with our general findings that X-ray
absorption predicates the presence of dense neutral gas. By comparing the X-ray
properties of AGN with and without detection of HI absorption at radio
wavelengths, we find that X-ray hardness ratio and HI absorption optical depth
are correlated at a statistical significance of 4.71{\sigma}. We conclude by
considering the impact of these findings on future radio and X-ray absorption
studies.

Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a
specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem,
since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms
of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can
be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on
performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from
becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming. To address the
performance bottleneck in deriving an algorithm from a specification, I propose
information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy
is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide
information about a query most directly. Within this framework, opportunities
to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that
information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be
articulated and a system designed to achieve them. In a preliminary empirical
study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program, the evaluation strategy
adapts successfully to evaluate a query efficiently.

subgrid-scale (SGS) dissipation is applied proportionally to the degree of
local spectral broadening, hence mitigated or deactivated in regions dominated
by large-scale and/or laminar vortical motion. The proposed Coherent vorticity
preserving (CvP) LES methodology is based on the evaluation of the ratio of the
test-filtered to resolved (or grid-filtered) enstrophy $\sigma$. Values of
$\sigma$ close to 1 indicate low sub-test-filter turbulent activity, justifying
local deactivation of the SGS dissipation. The intensity of the SGS dissipation
is progressively increased for $\sigma < 1$ which corresponds to a small-scale
spectral broadening. The SGS dissipation is then fully activated in developed
turbulence characterized by $\sigma \le \sigma_{eq}$, where the value
$\sigma_{eq}$ is derived assuming a Kolmogorov spectrum. The proposed approach
can be applied to any eddy-viscosity model, is algorithmically simple and
computationally inexpensive. LES of Taylor-Green vortex breakdown demonstrates
that the CvP methodology improves the performance of traditional, non-dynamic
dissipative SGS models, capturing the peak of total turbulent kinetic energy
dissipation during transition. Similar accuracy is obtained by adopting
Germano's dynamic procedure albeit at more than twice the computational
overhead. A CvP-LES of a pair of unstable periodic helical vortices is shown to
predict accurately the experimentally observed growth rate using coarse
resolutions. The ability of the CvP methodology to dynamically sort the
coherent, large-scale motion from the smaller, broadband scales during
transition is demonstrated via flow visualizations. LES of compressible channel
are carried out and show a good match with a reference DNS.

surprisingly even down to dimension $d = 6$ which is below the upper critical

behavior consisting of critical and Griffiths-McCoy singularities. The
divergence of the equal-time structure factor allows us to locate the critical
coupling where the correlation length diverges, implying the onset of a
thermodynamic phase transition. We find that the spin-glass susceptibility as
well as various power-moments of the local susceptibility become singular in
the paramagnetic phase $\textit{before}$ the critical point. Griffiths-McCoy
singularities are very strong in two-dimensions but decrease rapidly as the

Accounting for possible selection effects due to black hole (BH) mass, redshift
completeness, strong AGN presence, bulge colors, and surface brightness can
reduce the apparent overrepresentation of TDEs in E+A host galaxies by a factor
of ~4 (from ~$\times$100-190 to ~$\times$25-48), but cannot fully explain the
preference. We find that TDE host galaxies have atypical photometric properties
compared to similar, ""typical"" galaxies. In particular, TDE host galaxies tend
to live in or near the ""green valley"" between star-forming and passive
galaxies, and have bluer bulge colors ($\Delta (g-r) \approx 0.3$ mag), lower
half-light surface brightnesses (by ~1 mag/arcsec$^2$), higher Sersic indices
($\Delta n_{\rm g} \approx 3$), and higher bulge-to-total-light ratios ($\Delta
B/T \approx 0.5$) than galaxies with matched BH masses. We find that TDE host
galaxies appear more centrally concentrated and that all have high galaxy
Sersic indices and $B/T$ fractions---on average in the top 10% of galaxies of
the same BH mass---suggesting a higher nuclear stellar density. We identify a
region in Sersic index and BH mass parameter space that contains ~2% of our
reference catalog galaxies but $\ge\!60\%$ of TDE host galaxies. The unique
photometric properties of TDE host galaxies may be useful for selecting
candidate TDEs for spectroscopic follow-up observations in large transient

quantities, such as the static spin susceptibility and nearest-neighbor spin
correlation function, are characterized in the one- and two-dimensional limits
as a benchmark. When the dimensionality is tuned between these limits, the
magnetic properties, while evolving smoothly from one to two dimensions,
drastically change regardless of the doping level. This suggests that the spin
excitations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, even in the heavily doped
case, cannot be explained using the spinon picture known from one dimension.
The DQMC calculations are complemented by cluster perturbation theory studies
to form a more complete picture of how the crossover occurs as a function of
doping and how doped holes impact magnetic order.

the HOMO level almost unchanged. Conversely, enhancing the strength of the
donor unit for the same acceptor unit raises the HOMO level, while maintaining
the LUMO level. We identified strong correlations between the frontier orbital
energy levels and the degree of orbital localization, which depends on the

observations. The high-resolution echelle spectrograph of the Vacuum Tower
Telescope is supported by a state-of-the-art laser frequency comb to calibrate
the solar spectrum on an absolute wavelength scale. In this article, we
describe the scientific instrument and focus on the upgrades in the last two
years to turn the prototype into a turn-key system. The pursued goal was to
improve the short-term and long-term stability of the systems, and enable a
user-friendly and more versatile operation of the instrument. The first upgrade
involved the modernization of the frequency comb. The Fabry-Perot cavities were
adjusted to filter to a repetition frequency of 8GHz. A technologically matured
photonic crystal fiber was implemented for spectral broadening. The second,
quite recent upgrade was performed on the optics feeding the sunlight into a
single-mode fiber connected to the spectrograph. A motorized translation stage
was deployed to allow the automated selection of three different fields-of-view
with diameters of 1"", 3"", and 10"" for the analysis of the solar spectrum. The
successful upgrades allow for long-term observations of up to several hours per
day with a stable spectral accuracy of 1 m/s limited by the spectrograph.
Stable, user-friendly operation of the instrument is supported. The selection
of the pre-aligned fiber to change the field of view can now be done within
seconds. LARS offers the possibility to observe absolute wavelength positions
of spectral lines and Doppler velocities in the solar atmosphere. First results
demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument for solar science. The accurate
measurement of the solar convection, p-modes, and atmospheric waves will
enhance our knowledge of the solar atmosphere and its physical conditions to
improve current atmospheric models.

to the generalized traveling wave method for this type of dissipation.

accelerated in supernova remnants (SNRs). However, no observational evidence of
the presence of particles of PeV energies in SNRs has yet been found. The young
historical SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) appears as one of the best candidates to
study acceleration processes. Between December 2014 and October 2016 we
observed Cas A with the MAGIC telescopes, accumulating 158 hours of
good-quality data. We derived the spectrum of the source from 100 GeV to 10
TeV. We also analysed $\sim$8 years of $Fermi$-LAT to obtain the spectral shape
between 60 MeV and 500 GeV. The spectra measured by the LAT and MAGIC
telescopes are compatible within the errors and show a clear turn off (4.6
$\sigma$) at the highest energies, which can be described with an exponential
cut-off at $E_c = 3.5\left(^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\right)_{\textit{stat}}
\left(^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\right)_{\textit{sys}}$ TeV. The gamma-ray emission from 60
MeV to 10 TeV can be attributed to a population of high-energy protons with
spectral index $\sim$2.2 and energy cut-off at $\sim$10 TeV. This result
indicates that Cas A is not contributing to the high energy ($\sim$PeV)
cosmic-ray sea in a significant manner at the present moment. A one-zone
leptonic model fails to reproduce by itself the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distribution. Besides, if a non-negligible fraction of the flux seen by
MAGIC is produced by leptons, the radiation should be emitted in a region with
a low magnetic field (B$\lessapprox$100$\mu$G) like in the reverse shock.)

recently, the possible co-existence of a first family composed of ""normal""
neutron stars with a second family of strange quark stars has been proposed as
a solution of problems related to the maximum mass and to the minimal radius of
these compact stellar objects. In this paper we study the mass distribution of
compact objects formed in binary systems and the relative fractions of quark
and neutron stars in different subpopulations. We incorporate the strange quark
star formation model provided by the two-families scenario and we perform a
large-scale population synthesis study in order to obtain the population
characteristics. In our model, below a critical gravitational mass
$M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta M$ only normal (hadron) neutron stars exist. Then in
the mass range $(M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta M) \leqslant M \leqslant
M_\mathrm{max}^H$ strange quark stars and neutron stars coexist. Finally, above
$M_\mathrm{max}^H$ all compact objects are strange quark stars. We argue that
$M_\mathrm{max}^H$ is in the range $\sim 1.5-1.6 M_\odot$. According to our
results, the main channel for strange quark star formation in binary systems is
accretion from a secondary companion on a neutron star.This opens the
possibility of having explosive GRB-like phenomena not related to supernovae
and not due to the merger of two neutron stars. The enhancement in the number
of compact objects in the co-existence mass range $(M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta M)
\leqslant M \leqslant M_\mathrm{max}^H$ is not very pronounced. The number of
double strange quark star's systems is rather small with only a tiny fraction
which merge within a Hubble time. This drastically limits the flux of
strangelets produced by the merger, which turns out to be compatible with all
limits stemming from Earth and lunar experiments.

  Next, we observe that the model becomes exactly solvable when the disorder
variables are located on edges of the complete graph and follow a totally

Large $N$ asymptotics can be taken in this setting, for instance, for the free

written in terms of matter fields alone, a composite gauge boson or bosons must
be formed dynamically. The theorem results from the fact that the Noether
current vanishes in such theories. The proof is carried out by use of the
charge-field algebra at equal time in the Heisenberg picture together with the
well-established analyticity of the form factor of the current. While there is
no need of diagram calculation for the proof, we demonstrate in the leading 1/N
expansion of the existing models what the theorem means in diagrams and how the
composite gauge boson emerges.

divided into two distinct camps, supporting interventions that address either
individual-based or group-based fairness. Rather than privilege a single
definition, we seek to resolve both within the particular domain of employment
discrimination. To this end, we construct a dual labor market model composed of
a Temporary Labor Market, in which firm strategies are constrained to ensure
group-level fairness, and a Permanent Labor Market, in which individual worker
fairness is guaranteed. We show that such restrictions on hiring practices
induces an equilibrium that Pareto-dominates those arising from strategies that
employ statistical discrimination or a ""group-blind"" criterion. Individual
worker reputations produce externalities for collective reputation, generating
a feedback loop termed a ""self-fulfilling prophecy."" Our model produces its own
feedback loop, raising the collective reputation of an initially disadvantaged
group via a fairness intervention that need not be permanent. Moreover, we show
that, contrary to popular assumption, the asymmetric equilibria resulting from
hiring practices that disregard group-fairness may be immovable without
targeted intervention. The enduring nature of such equilibria that are both
inequitable and Pareto inefficient suggest that fairness interventions are of
critical importance in moving the labor market to be more socially just and
efficient.

BD scheme requires channel knowledge at the transmitter, we propose to use
downlink spreading along with DM, which does not require channel knowledge

scheme is employed in order to separate the data streams of different users. As
a space time block code, we use the Alamouti code that can be encoded/decoded

when the key length smaller than the length of plaintext entered, the key will
be generated by a process, so the next key character will be different from the
previous key character. In This study also applied the technique of Three-pass
protocol, a technique which message sender does not need to send the key,
because each using its own key for the message encryption and decryption
process, so the security of a message would be more difficult to solved.

are under debate. To disentangle the polarization mechanisms, we observe the
protoplanetary disk around HL Tau at 3.1 mm with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which had polarization detected with
CARMA at 1.3 mm. We successfully detect the ring-like azimuthal polarized
emission at 3.1 mm. This indicates that dust grains are aligned with the major
axis being in the azimuthal direction, which is consistent with the theory of
radiative alignment of elongated dust grains, where the major axis of dust
grains is perpendicular to the radiation flux. Furthermore, the morphology of
the polarization vectors at 3.1 mm is completely different from those at 1.3
mm. We interpret that the polarization at 3.1 mm to be dominated by the grain
alignment with the radiative flux producing azimuthal polarization vectors,
while the self-scattering dominates at 1.3 mm and produces the polarization
vectors parallel to the minor axis of the disk. By modeling the total
polarization fraction with a single grain population model, the maximum grain
size is constrained to be $100{\rm~\mu m}$, which is smaller than the previous
predictions based on the spectral index between ALMA at 3 mm and VLA at 7 mm.

Adversarial Networks is proposed to generate suitable and secure covers for
steganography. The proposed architecture has one generative network, and two
discriminative networks. The generative network mainly evaluates the visual
quality of the generated images for steganography, and the discriminative
networks are utilized to assess their suitableness for information hiding.
Different from the existing work which adopts Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks, we utilize another form of generative adversarial
networks. By using this new form of generative adversarial networks,
significant improvements are made on the convergence speed, the training
stability and the image quality. Furthermore, a sophisticated steganalysis
network is reconstructed for the discriminative network, and the network can
better evaluate the performance of the generated images. Numerous experiments
are conducted on the publicly available datasets to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and
treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to
population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks
generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than
competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest). RIDDLE yielded
significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were
considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), and area under the curve for
receiver operating characteristic plots (all $p < 10^{-6}$). We made specific
efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify, quantify,
and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity. We
used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic
comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity. The fact
that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could
reflect (1) a skewed distribution of blue- and white-collar professions across
racial and ethnic groups, (2) uneven accessibility and subjective importance of
prophylactic health, (3) possible variation in lifestyle, such as dietary

relieve traffic congestion. A key problem for these platforms is to come up
with a revenue-optimal (or GMV-optimal) pricing scheme and an induced vehicle
dispatching policy that incorporate geographic and temporal information. In
this paper, we aim to tackle this problem via an economic approach.
  Modeled naively, the underlying optimization problem may be non-convex and
thus hard to compute. To this end, we use a so-called ""ironing"" technique to
convert the problem into an equivalent convex optimization one via a clean
Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, where the states are the driver
distributions and the decision variables are the prices for each pair of
locations. Our main finding is an efficient algorithm that computes the exact

the optimal solution of the MDP by a primal-dual analysis of a corresponding
convex program. We also conduct empirical evaluations of our solution through
real data of a major ride-sharing platform and show its advantages over fixed
pricing schemes as well as several prevalent surge-based pricing schemes.

dynamical instabilities are common and affect both the orbits and planet
structures, where the compact orbits and typically low densities make physical
collisions likely outcomes. Since the structure of many of these planets is
such that the mass is dominated by a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by
a tenuous gas envelope, the sticky-sphere approximation, used in dynamical
integrators, may be a poor model for these collisions. We perform five sets of
collision calculations, including detailed hydrodynamics, sampling mass ratios
and core mass fractions typical in Kepler Multis. In our primary set of
calculations, we use Kepler-36 as a nominal remnant system, as the two planets
have a small dynamical separation and an extreme density ratio. We use an
N-body code, Mercury 6.2, to integrate initially unstable systems and study the
resultant collisions in detail. We use these collisions, focusing on grazing
collisions, in combination with realistic planet models created using gas
profiles from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics and core profiles
using equations of state from Seager et al. (2007), to perform hydrodynamic
calculations, finding scatterings, mergers, and even a potential planet-planet
binary. We dynamically integrate the remnant systems, examine the stability,
and estimate the final densities, finding the remnant densities are sensitive
to the core masses, and collisions result in generally more stable systems. We
provide prescriptions for predicting the outcomes and modeling the changes in
mass and orbits following collisions for general use in dynamical integrators.

were run in the CDMSlite mode to gather data sets with sensitivity specifically
for WIMPs with masses ${<}$10 GeV/$c^2$. In this mode, a higher detector-bias
voltage is applied to amplify the phonon signals produced by drifting charges.
This paper presents studies of the experimental noise and its effect on the
achievable energy threshold, which is demonstrated to be as low as 56
eV$_{\text{ee}}$ (electron equivalent energy). The detector-biasing
configuration is described in detail, with analysis corrections for voltage
variations to the level of a few percent. Detailed studies of the
electric-field geometry, and the resulting successful development of a fiducial
parameter, eliminate poorly measured events, yielding an energy resolution
ranging from ${\sim}$9 eV$_{\text{ee}}$ at 0 keV to 101 eV$_{\text{ee}}$ at

uncertainties relevant to the WIMP-search limits, specifically examining how
they are affected by variations in the most probable WIMP velocity and the
Galactic escape velocity. These variations become more important for WIMP
masses below 10 GeV/$c^2$. Finally, new limits on spin-dependent low-mass
WIMP-nucleon interactions are derived, with new parameter space excluded for

energy excess preventing the two-body resonance, leading thus to a Borromean

This demonstrates the assumption that three-body resonances can generalize to
any Rydberg atom. As such resonance represents an effective three-body

quantum simulations and quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.

observable about a quantum mechanical system. We introduce quantum tomography
to collider physics with the illustration of the angular distribution of lepton
pairs. The tomographic method bypasses much of the field-theoretic formalism to
concentrate on what can be observed with experimental data, and how to
characterize the data. We provide a practical, experimentally-driven guide to
model-independent analysis using density matrices at every step. Comparison
with traditional methods of analyzing angular correlations of inclusive
reactions finds many advantages in the tomographic method, which include
manifest Lorentz covariance, direct incorporation of positivity constraints,
exhaustively complete polarization information, and new invariants free from
frame conventions. For example, experimental data can determine the
$entanglement$ $entropy$ of the production process, which is a
model-independent invariant that measures the degree of coherence of the
subprocess. We give reproducible numerical examples and provide a supplemental
standalone computer code that implements the procedure. We also highlight a
property of $complex$ $positivity$ that guarantees in a least-squares type fit
that a local minimum of a $\chi^{2}$ statistic will be a global minimum: There
are no isolated local minima. This property with an automated implementation of
positivity promises to mitigate issues relating to multiple minima and
convention-dependence that have been problematic in previous work on angular
distributions.

of efficient disaster prevention. Generally these systems consist of a network
of seismic detectors that send real time data to a central server. The server
elaborates the data and attempts to recognize the first signs of an earthquake.
The current problem with this approach is that it is subject to false alarms. A
critical trade-off exists between sensitivity of the system and error rate. To
overcame this problems, an artificial neural network based intelligent learning
systems can be used. However, conventional supervised ANN systems are difficult
to train, CPU intensive and prone to false alarms. To surpass these problems,
here we attempt to use a next-generation unsupervised cortical algorithm HTM.
This novel approach does not learn particular waveforms, but adapts to
continuously fed data reaching the ability to discriminate between normality
(seismic sensor background noise in no-earthquake conditions) and anomaly
(sensor response to a jitter or an earthquake). Main goal of this study is test
the ability of the HTM algorithm to be used to signal earthquakes automatically
in a feasible disaster prevention system. We describe the methodology used and
give the first qualitative assessments of the recognition ability of the

performing a thorough and systematic classification of the initial conditions
of the orbits. More precisely, the initial conditions of the orbits are
classified into four categories: (i) non-escaping regular orbits; (ii) trapped
chaotic orbits; (iii) escaping orbits; and (iv) collision orbits. In order to
obtain a more general and complete view of the orbital structure of the
dynamical system our exploration takes place in both planar (2D) and the
spatial (3D) version of the Hill problem. For the 2D system we numerically
integrate large sets of initial conditions in several types of planes, while
for the system with three degrees of freedom, three-dimensional distributions
of initial conditions of orbits are examined. For distinguishing between
ordered and chaotic bounded motion the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method is
used. We managed to locate the several bounded basins, as well as the basins of
escape and collision and also to relate them with the corresponding escape and
collision time of the orbits. Our numerical calculations indicate that the
overall orbital dynamics of the Hamiltonian system is a complicated but highly
interested problem. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further
understanding of the orbital properties of the classical Hill problem.

locally to a non-local field is considered. We show that in the case where two
observers are purely timelike related -- so that an exchange of on-shell
massless quanta cannot occur -- signaling is still possible because of a
violation of Huygens' principle. In particular, we show that the signaling is
exponentially suppressed by the non-locality scale. Furthermore, we consider
the case in which the two observers are light-like related and show that the
non-local modification to the local result is polynomially suppressed in the
non-locality scale. This may have implications for phenomenological tests of
non-local theories.

  Speedup-Function-Based Analysis",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a large-scale computing cluster, the job completions can be substantially
delayed due to two sources of variability, namely, variability in the job size
and that in the machine service capacity. To tackle this issue, existing works
have proposed various scheduling algorithms which exploit redundancy wherein a
job runs on multiple servers until the first completes. In this paper, we
explore the impact of variability in the machine service capacity and adopt a
rigorous analytical approach to design scheduling algorithms using redundancy
and checkpointing. We design several online scheduling algorithms which can
dynamically vary the number of redundant copies for jobs. We also provide new
theoretical performance bounds for these algorithms in terms of the overall job
flowtime by introducing the notion of a speedup function, based on which a
novel potential function can be defined to enable the corresponding competitive
ratio analysis. In particular, by adopting the online primal-dual fitting
approach, we prove that our SRPT+R Algorithm in a non-multitasking cluster is
$(1+\epsilon)$-speed, $\ O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$-competitive. We also show that
our proposed Fair+R and LAPS+R($\beta$) Algorithms for a multitasking cluster
are $(4+\epsilon)$-speed, $\ O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$-competitive and {($2 +
2\beta + 2\epsilon)$-speed $O(\frac{1}{\beta \epsilon})$-competitive}
respectively. We demonstrate via extensive simulations that our proposed
algorithms can significantly reduce job flowtime under both the
non-multitasking and multitasking modes.

  Inequalities",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A class of information inequalities, called Shannon-type inequalities (STIs),
can be proven via a computer software called ITIP. In previous work, we have
shown how this technique can be utilized to Fourier-Motzkin elimination
algorithm for Information Theoretic Inequalities. Here, we provide an algorithm
for extracting \emph{analytic} proofs of information inequalities. Shannon-type
inequalities are proven by solving an optimization problem. We will show how to
extract a \emph{formal} proof of numerically solved information inequality.
Such proof may become useful when an inequality is implied by several
constraints due to the PMF, and the proof is not apparent easily. More
complicated are cases where an inequality holds due to both constraints from
the PMF and due to other constraints that arise from the statistical model.
Such cases include information theoretic capacity regions, rate-distortion
functions and lossless compression rates. We begin with formal definition of
Shannon-type information inequalities. We then review the optimal solution of
the optimization problem and how to extract a proof that is readable to the
user.

collimate the particles emitted from an effusive source. Their high velocity
limits the interaction time with the cooling laser. Therefore forces beyond the
limits of the scattering force are desirable. The bichromatic force is a
promising candidate for this purpose which is demonstrated here for the first
time on metastable argon-40. The precollimated atoms are detected in one
dimension and the acquired Doppler shift is detected by absorption
spectroscopy. With the experimentally accessible parameters, it was possible to
measure a force three times stronger than the scattering force. Systematic
studies on its dependence on Rabi frequency, phase difference and detuning to
atomic resonance are comparedto the solution of the optical Bloch equations. We
anticipate predictions for a possible application in Atom Trap Trace Analysis
of argon-39 and other noble gas experiments, where a high flux of metastable
atoms is needed.

in phase throughout the observation by applying antenna based phase corrections
derived from visibilities that were obtained in parallel with the phased array
beam data, and which were flagged and calibrated in real time using a model for
the continuum emission in the target field. We find that, as expected, the
signal to noise ratio (SNR) does not degrade with time. In contrast
observations in which the phasing is done only at the start of the observation
show a clear degradation of the SNR with time. We find that this degradation is
well fit by a function of the form SNR(t) =a + b*exp(-(t/t0)^5/3), which
corresponds to the case where the phase drifts are caused by Kolmogorov type
turbulence in the ionosphere. We also present general formulae (i.e. including
the effects of correlated sky noise, imperfect phasing and self noise) for the
SNR and synthesized beam size for phased arrays (as well as corresponding
formulae for incoherent arrays). These would be useful in planning observations

binary trees on three leaves) provides essential information about tree-like
relations that are shown by any supertree that displays all triples in $R$. In
this contribution, we are concerned with representative triple sets, that is,
subsets $R'$ of $R$ with $\textrm{cl}(R') = \textrm{cl}(R)$. In this case, $R'$
still contains all information on the tree structure implied by $R$, although
$R'$ might be significantly smaller. We show that representative triple sets
that are minimal w.r.t.\ inclusion form the basis of a matroid. This in turn
implies that minimal representative triple sets also have minimum cardinality.
In particular, the matroid structure can be used to show that minimum
representative triple sets can be computed in polynomial time with a simple
greedy approach. For a given triple set $R$ that ""identifies"" a tree, we
provide an exact value for the cardinality of its minimum representative triple
sets. In addition, we utilize the latter results to provide a novel and
efficient method to compute the closure $\textrm{cl}(R)$ of a consistent triple
set $R$ that improves the time complexity $\mathcal{O}(|R||L_R|^4)$ of the
currently fastest known method proposed by Bryant and Steel (1995). In
particular, if a minimum representative triple set for $R$ is given, it can be
shown that the time complexity to compute $\textrm{cl}(R)$ can be improved by a
factor up to $|R||L_R|$. As it turns out, collections of quartets (unrooted
binary trees on four leaves) do not provide a matroid structure, in general.

determine if the input is a natural speech with specific conditions. In this
MTL framework, the MSE optimization improves the stability of GAN, and at the

Listening tests show that the multi-task architecture can generate more natural

width that generates a spatial vortex potential with bistable states. This
intrinsic vortex potential can be tuned by an externally applied magnetic field
and tilted by a bias current. The two-state system is accurately modeled by a
one-dimensional sine-Gordon like equation by means of which one can numerically
calculate both the magnetic field needed to set the vortex in a given state as
well as the vortex depinning currents. Experimental data taken at 4.2K on
high-quality Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb CAJTJs with an individual trapped fluxon advocate
the presence of a robust and finely tunable double-well potential for which
reliable manipulation of the vortex state has been classically demonstrated.
The vortex is prepared in a given potential by means of an externally applied
magnetic field, while the state readout is accomplished by measuring the
vortex-depinning current in a small magnetic field. Our proof of principle
experiment convincingly demonstrates that the proposed vortex qubit based on
CAJTJs is robust and workable.

future average channel gains of mobile users, which change in the timescale of
seconds and are reported predictable within a minute-long time window. To
demonstrate the potential of improving EE by jointly optimizing resource
allocation for both services by harnessing both future average channel gains
and current instantaneous channel gains, we optimize a two-timescale policy
with perfect prediction, by taking orthogonal frequency division multiple
access system serving RT and video-on-demand (VoD) users as an example.
Considering that fine-grained prediction for every user is with high cost, we
propose a heuristic policy that only needs to predict the median of average
channel gains of VoD users. Simulation results show that the optimal policy
outperforms relevant counterparts, indicating the necessity of the joint
optimization for both services and for two timescales. Besides, the heuristic
policy performs closely to the optimal policy with perfect prediction while
becomes superior with large prediction errors. This suggests that the EE gain
over non-predictive policies can be captured with coarse-grained prediction.

orbital, and charge degrees of freedom for the Kondo effect in a triangular
triple quantum dot (TTQD). Here, one of the three QDs is coupled to a metallic
lead through electron tunneling, and a local electric polarization is induced
by the Kondo effect. The ASO interaction is introduced in the other two coupled
QDs on the opposite side of the lead. Generally, the ASO coupling effect is
very weak and not easily detectable, but it essentially causes spin and charge
reconfigurations in the TTQD through the Kondo effect. Using an extended
Anderson model for the TTQD Kondo system, we elucidate that the ASO coupling
gives rise to a considerable reduction of the emergent electric polarization,
as a consequence of the parity mixing of molecular orbitals in the triangular
loop as well as the spin-up and spin-down coupling of local electrons. The
latter leads to a local diamagnetic susceptibility owing to the ASO coupled
spins. We also show that the Kondo-induced electric polarization can be
controlled by the ASO coupling as well as by the magnetic flux penetrating

existence (or nonexistence) of phase-shift discrete solitons, which correspond
to four-sites vortex solutions in the standard two-dimensional dNLS model

choice of lengths of the inter-site interactions, the vortex configurations
considered present a degeneracy which causes the standard continuation
techniques to be non-applicable. In the present one-dimensional case, the
existence of a conserved quantity for the soliton profile (the so-called
density current), together with a perturbative construction, leads to the
nonexistence of any phase-shift discrete soliton which is at least $C^2$ with
respect to the small coupling $\epsilon$, in the limit of vanishing $\epsilon$.
If we assume the solution to be only $C^0$ in the same limit of $\epsilon$,
nonexistence is instead proved by studying the bifurcation equation of a
Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, expanded to suitably high orders. Specifically, we
produce a nonexistence criterion whose efficiency we reveal in the cases of

one of the couplings (responsible for the existence of the bound state) is
determined via the standard secular equation. It is found that in such an
arrangement the model is exactly solvable at all of the finite counts J of the
couplings. For illustration, the explicit closed bound-state formulae are
presented up to J=7.

rotation periods. Such a spread originates from distributions of masses and
initial rotation periods. However, multiplicity can also play a significant
role. We investigate the role played by physical companions in shortening the
primordial disc lifetime. We have compiled the most extensive list of low-mass
members of the young 25-Myr beta Pictoris association. We have measured the
rotation periods of about all members and used updated UVWXYZ components to
assess their membership. We built the rotation period distribution
distinguishing between bona fide members and candidate members and according to
their multiplicity status. We found that single stars and components of
multiple systems in wide orbits (>80 AU) have rotation periods that exhibit a
well defined sequence arising from mass distribution. All components of
multiple systems in close orbits (<80 AU) have rotation periods significantly
shorter than their equal-mass single counterparts. A comparison with the
younger 13 Myr h Per cluster and with the older 40-Myr open clusters/stellar
associations NGC2547, IC2391, Argus, and IC2602 and the 130-Myr Pleiades shows
that whereas the evolution of F-G stars is well reproduced by angular momentum
evolution models, this is not the case for the slow K and early-M stars.
Finally, we found that the amplitude of their light curves is correlated
neither with rotation nor with mass. Once single stars and wide components of
multiple systems are separated from close components of multiple systems, the
rotation period distributions exhibit a well defined dependence on mass that
allows to make a meaningful comparison with similar distributions of either
younger or older associations/clusters. Such cleaned distributions allow to use
the stellar rotation period as age indicator, meaningfully for F and G type
stars.

electrocaloric response can conceptually be separated in two contributions: a
transitional part, stemming from the discontinuous jump in entropy at the first
order phase transition, and a configurational part, due to the continuous
change of polarization and entropy within each phase. This latter part
increases with the strength of the applied field, but for small fields it is
very small. In contrast, we find a large temperature change of $\sim 1$ K
resulting from the transition entropy, which is essentially independent of the
field strength. However, due to the coexistence region close to the first order
phase transition, this large electrocaloric response depends on the thermal
history of the sample and is generally not reversible. We show that this
irreversibility can be overcome by using larger fields.

Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First,
there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage
hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in
the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property
that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about
sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which
can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic
regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes
solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number
of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the
global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the
previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions
with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we
introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized
horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the
largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous
counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the
original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit

features of oscillation death states, linear stability theory fails to analyze
the stability of such states analytically, so we quantify all the states by
basin stability measurement which is an universal nonlocal nonlinear concept
and it interplays with the volume of basins of attractions. We also observe
multi-clustered oscillation death states in a random network and measure them
using basin stability framework. To explore such phenomena we choose a network

  Optimization","Full version of ICALP'17 paper",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the following variant of the set cover problem. We are given a
universe $U=\{1,...,n\}$ and a collection of subsets $\mathcal{C} =
\{S_1,...,S_m\}$ where $S_i \subseteq U$. For every element $u \in U$ we need
to find a set $\phi(u) \in \mathcal C$ such that $u\in \phi(u)$. Once we
construct and fix the mapping $\phi:U \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ a subset $X
\subseteq U$ of the universe is revealed, and we need to cover all elements
from $X$ with exactly $\phi(X):=\cup_{u\in X} \phi(u)$. The goal is to find a
mapping such that the cover $\phi(X)$ is as cheap as possible.
  This is an example of a universal problem where the solution has to be
created before the actual instance to deal with is revealed. Such problems
appear naturally in some settings when we need to optimize under uncertainty
and it may be actually too expensive to begin finding a good solution once the
input starts being revealed.
  A rich body of work was devoted to investigate the approximability of such
problems under the regime of worst case analysis or when the input instance is
drawn randomly from some probability distribution. Here one typically compares
the quality of the produced solution with the optimal offline solution.
  In this paper we consider a different viewpoint: What if we would compare our
approximate universal solution against an optimal universal solution that obeys
the same rules as we do? We show that under this viewpoint it is possible to
achieve improved approximation algorithms for the stochastic version of
universal set cover. Our result is based on rounding a proper configuration IP
that captures the optimal universal solution, and using tools from submodular
optimization. The same basic approach leads to improved approximation
algorithms also for other related problems.

Here, we present the first demonstration of a radiation-pressure driven
optomechanical system locking to an inertial drive, with actuation provided by
an integrated electrical interface. We use the injection signal to suppress
drift in the optomechanical oscillation frequency, strongly reducing phase
noise by over 55 dBc/Hz at 2 Hz offset. We further employ the injection tone to
tune the oscillation frequency by more than 2 million times its narrowed
linewidth. In addition, we uncover previously unreported synchronization
dynamics, enabled by the independence of the inertial drive from the optical
drive field. Finally, we show that our approach may enable control of the
optomechanical gain competition between different mechanical modes of a single
resonator. The electrical interface allows enhanced scalability for future
applications involving arrays of injection-locked precision sensors.

  Estimation of Density-Derivative-Ratios",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modes and ridges of the probability density function behind observed data are
useful geometric features. Mode-seeking clustering assigns cluster labels by
associating data samples with the nearest modes, and estimation of density
ridges enables us to find lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. A key
technical challenge both in mode-seeking clustering and density ridge
estimation is accurate estimation of the ratios of the first- and second-order
density derivatives to the density. A naive approach takes a three-step
approach of first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives,
and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be
unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good
density derivative estimator, and division by the estimated density could
significantly magnify the estimation error. To cope with these problems, we
propose a novel estimator for the \emph{density-derivative-ratios}. The
proposed estimator does not involve density estimation, but rather
\emph{directly} approximates the ratios of density derivatives of any order.
Moreover, we establish a convergence rate of the proposed estimator. Based on
the proposed estimator, novel methods both for mode-seeking clustering and
density ridge estimation are developed, and the respective convergence rates to
the mode and ridge of the underlying density are also established. Finally, we
experimentally demonstrate that the developed methods significantly outperform
existing methods, particularly for relatively high-dimensional data.

pinning the static friction does not grow with the GNR length, but oscillates
around a fairly constant mean value. These friction oscillations are explained
in terms of the GNR-Au(111) lattice mismatch: at certain GNR lengths close to

compensation and superlubric sliding; whereas close to half odd-integer periods

unique opportunity to study the distribution of spectroscopic multiple systems
among different populations of the Galaxy. We aim at detecting
binarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the
cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates.
We develop a method based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives
to detect multiple peaks and determine their radial velocities, even when the
peaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection of extrema (DOE)
code have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize
detection. This code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line
spectroscopic binaries (SBn, n>1). We apply this method on the fourth GES
internal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342 SB2, 11 SB3 and even
one SB4), including only 9 SB2 known in the literature. This implies that about
98% of these SBn candidates are new (because of their faint visual magnitude
that can reach V=19). Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals
that the most probable candidates have indeed a composite spectrum. Among SB2
candidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously unknown
binaries: 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and 19013257-0027338
in Berkeley 81. A detailed analysis of the unique SB4 (four peaks in the CCF)
reveals that HD 74438 in the open cluster IC 2391 is a physically bound stellar
quadruple system. The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters are reviewed
in detail to discard false detections. We warn against the use of atmospheric
parameters for these system components rather than by SB-specific pipelines.
Our implementation of an automatic detection of spectroscopic binaries within
the GES has allowed an efficient discovery of many new multiple systems.

of an Internet Service Provider. Although Edge-ICN requires nothing beyond an
SDN-based network supporting the OpenFlow protocol, with ICN-aware nodes only
at the edges of the network, it still offers the same benefits as a clean-slate
ICN architecture but without the deployment hassles. Moreover, by proxying
legacy traffic and transparently forwarding it through the Edge-ICN nodes, all
existing applications can operate smoothly, while offering significant
advantages to applications such as native support for scalable anycast,
multicast, and multi-source forwarding. In this context, we show how the
proposed functionality at the edge of the network can specifically benefit
CoAP-based IoT applications. Our measurements show that Edge-ICN induces on
average the same control plane overhead for name resolution as a centralized
approach, while also enabling IoT applications to build on anycast, multicast,
and multi-source forwarding primitives.

  International Society for Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB 2017)",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal mediation analysis aims to estimate the natural direct and indirect
effects under clearly specified assumptions. Traditional mediation analysis
based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) relies on the absence of unmeasured
causes of the putative mediator and outcome. When this assumption cannot be
justified, Instrumental Variables (IV) estimators can be used in order to
produce an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the mediator-outcome link.
However, provided that valid instruments exist, bias removal comes at the cost
of variance inflation for standard IV procedures such as Two-Stage Least
Squares (TSLS). A Semi-Parametric Stein-Like (SPSL) estimator has been proposed
in the literature that strikes a natural trade-off between the unbiasedness of
the TSLS procedure and the relatively small variance of the OLS estimator.
Moreover, the SPSL has the advantage that its shrinkage parameter can be
directly estimated from the data. In this paper, we demonstrate how this
Stein-like estimator can be implemented in the context of the estimation of
natural direct and natural indirect effects of treatments in randomized
controlled trials. The performance of the competing methods is studied in a
simulation study, in which both the strength of hidden confounding and the
strength of the instruments are independently varied. These considerations are
motivated by a trial in mental health evaluating the impact of a primary
care-based intervention to reduce depression in the elderly.

determined with a set of nonlinear parametric programing using the membership

functions, more information is provided for use by management, and because the
redundant system is extended to the fuzzy environment, general repairable

useful for designers and practitioners. Also beside standby, active redundancy
systems are used in many cases so this article has many practical instances.
Different from other studies, our model provides, a good estimated value based
on uncertain environments, a comparison discussion of using fuzzy theory and
conventional method and also a comparison between parallel (active redundancy)

membership function intervals cannot be inverted explicitly, system management

the charge transfer and association rate is found to be at least~10$^{3}$ times
smaller than the Langevin collision rate. These results confirm the excellent

zone in the wake and break up the trailing vortices into smaller ones. This
affects the time-average recirculation pattern on the suction side. The volume
of the separation region is 7% smaller in the wake of the fractal blades. The
lower torque of the fractal impeller is equivalent to a decreased transport of
angular momentum; this difference stems from the reduced turbulent transport
induced by the smaller trailing vortices. The major difference in the turbulent
dissipation is seen in the vicinity of trailing vortices, due to fluctuations
of velocity gradients at relatively low frequencies.

First, HHT decomposes a chromatic signal into ""monochromatic"" signals that are
the so-called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using an Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) [6]. After applying the Hilbert Transform to each IMF, the
instantaneous frequencies of the ""monochromatic"" signals can be obtained. The
HHT has the advantage to analyze non-stationary and nonlinear signals such as
human-joint-motions over FFT or Wavelet transform.
  In the present paper, we propose a new framework to analyze and extract some
new features from a famous Japanese threesome pop singer group called
""Perfume"", and compare it with Waltz and Salsa dance. Using the EMD, their
dance motions can be decomposed into motion (choreographic) primitives or IMFs.
Therefore we can scale, combine, subtract, exchange, and modify those IMFs, and
can blend them into new dance motions self-consistently. Our analysis and
framework can lead to a motion editing and blending method to create a new
dance motion from different dance motions.

probabilistic inference to interpret and respond to sensory input and that
trial-to-trial variability in neural activity plays an important role. The
neural sampling hypothesis interprets stochastic neural activity as sampling
from an underlying probability distribution and has been shown to be compatible
with biologically observed firing patterns. In many studies, uncorrelated noise
is used as a source of stochasticity, discounting the fact that cortical
neurons may share a significant portion of their presynaptic partners, which
impacts their computation. This is relevant in biology and for implementations
of neural networks where bandwidth constraints limit the amount of independent
noise. When receiving correlated noise, the resulting correlations cannot be
directly countered by changes in synaptic weights $W$. We show that this is
contingent on the chosen coding: when changing the state space from
$z\in\{0,1\}$ to $z'\in\{-1,1\}$, correlated noise has the exact same effect as
changes in $W'$. The translation of the problem to the $\{-1,1\}$ space allows
to find a weight configuration that compensates for the induced correlations.
For an artificial embedding of sampling networks, this allows a straightforward
transfer between platforms with different bandwidth constraints. The existence
of the mapping is important for learning. Since in the $\{-1,1\}$-coding the
correlated noise can be compensated by parameter changes and the probability
distribution can be kept invariant when changing the coding, the distribution
will be found in the $\{0,1\}$-coding as well during learning, as demonstrated
in simulations. Conclusively, sampling spiking networks are impervious to noise
correlations when trained. If such computation happens in cortex, network
plasticity does not need to take account of shared noise inputs.

proofs of correctness. In this work, we focus on the correctness of
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), a class of algorithm that provides
strong eventual consistency guarantees for replicated data. We develop a
modular and reusable framework in the Isabelle/HOL interactive proof assistant
for verifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms. We avoid correctness issues
that have dogged previous mechanised proofs in this area by including a network
model in our formalisation, and proving that our theorems hold in all possible
network behaviours. Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that
accurately reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we
identify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order relations, which
provides a formal definition of strong eventual consistency. We then obtain the
first machine-checked correctness theorems for three concrete CRDTs: the
Replicated Growable Array, the Observed-Remove Set, and an Increment-Decrement
Counter. We find that our framework is highly reusable, developing proofs of
correctness for the latter two CRDTs in a few hours and with relatively little
CRDT-specific code.

thermodynamics is considered to be the logical premise to justify that
information is physical - through Landauer's principle -, thereby also linking
information and thermodynamics. This approach towards information has been
instrumental to understand thermodynamics of logical and physical processes,
both in the classical and quantum domain. In the present work, we formulate
thermodynamics as an exclusive consequence of information conservation. The
framework can be applied to the most general situations, beyond the traditional
assumptions in thermodynamics: we allow systems and thermal baths to be
quantum, of arbitrary sizes and possessing inter-system correlations.
  Here, systems and baths are not treated differently, rather both are
considered on an equal footing. This leads us to introduce a
""temperature""-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We rely on the fact
that, for a fixed amount of information, measured by the von Neumann entropy,
any system can be transformed to a state with the same entropy that possesses
minimal energy. This state, known as a completely passive state, acquires
Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical form with an intrinsic temperature. We introduce the
notions of bound and free energy and use them to quantify heat and work,
respectively. Guided by the principle of information conservation, we develop
universal notions of equilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's principle and
universal fundamental laws of thermodynamics. We demonstrate that the maximum
efficiency of a quantum engine with a finite bath is in general lower than that
of an ideal Carnot engine. We introduce a resource theoretic framework for our
intrinsic temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem
of work extraction and state transformations. Finally, the framework is
extended to multiple conserved quantities.

have been widely investigated in theory, and Sb monolayer (antimonene) of them
has recently been synthesized. In this work, phonon transport of SbAs monolayer
is investigated from a combination of first-principles calculations and the
linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It is found that the lattice thermal
conductivity of SbAs monolayer is lower than ones of both As and Sb monolayers,
and the corresponding sheet thermal conductance is 28.8 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ at
room temperature. Calculated results show that group velocities of SbAs
monolayer are between ones of As and Sb onolayers, but phonon lifetimes of SbAs
are smaller than ones of both As and Sb monolayers. Hence, low lattice thermal
conductivity in SbAs monolayer is attributed to very small phonon lifetimes.
Unexpectedly, the ZA branch has very little contribution to the total thermal
conductivity, only 2.4\%, which is obviously different from ones of As and Sb
monolayers with very large contribution. This can be explained by very small
phonon lifetimes for ZA branch of SbAs monolayer. The large charge transfer
from Sb to As atoms leads strongly polarized covalent bond, being different
from As or Sb monolayer. The strongly polarized covalent bond of SbAs monolayer
can induce stronger phonon anharmonicity than As or Sb monolayer, leading to
lower lattice thermal conductivity. It is found that isotope scattering
produces neglectful effect, and the lattice thermal conductivity with the
characteristic length smaller than 30 nm can reach a decrease of about 47\%.
These results may offer perspectives on tuning lattice thermal conductivity by
mixture of multi-elements for applications of thermal management and
thermoelectricity, and motivate further experimental efforts to synthesize

Induction Motor (IM) as the inverter load, and wide DC bus voltage variations,
the inverter must operate in both over-modulation and linear modulation region.
Main objective of the modified SHE is to reduce harmonic torques through
finding the best switching angles. In this paper, optimization is based on
optimizing phasor equations in which harmonic torques are calculated. The
procedure of this method is that, first, the ratio of the same torque harmonics
is estimated, secondly, by using that estimation, the ratio of voltage
harmonics that generates homogeneous torques is calculated. For the estimation
and the calculation of the ratios motor parameter, mechanical speed of the
rotor, the applied frequency, and the concept of slip are used. The advantage
of this approach is highlighted when mechanical load and DC bus voltage
variations are taken into consideration. Simulation results are presented under
a wide range of working conditions in an induction motor to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

performances in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing.
These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when
exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight
matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that
involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches
reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this

the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is
trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on
classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve
competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model
architecture is orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed
approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling

  The objective function is non-convex and the associated optimization problem
typically requires a large number of objective function evaluations. We propose
an optimization approach that calculates `interpolatory' reduced order models,

  In our approach, we use parametric model reduction (PMOR) based on the
Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm, which ensures good approximations relative
to the $\mathcal{H}_2$ system norm, aligning well with the underlying damping
design objectives. For the parameter sampling that occurs within each PMOR
cycle, we consider approaches with predetermined sampling and approaches using
adaptive sampling, and each of these approaches may be combined with three
possible strategies for internal reduction. In order to preserve important
system properties, we maintain second-order structure, which through the use of
modal coordinates, allows for very efficient implementation.

investigation of the quantum distillation process within the Fermi--Hubbard

dynamical, spatial separation of singlons and doublons in the sudden expansion

atoms from a trapping potential. Remarkably, quantum distillation can lead to a
contraction of the doublon cloud, resulting in an increased density of the
doublons in the core region compared to the initial state. As a main result, we
show that this phenomenon is not limited to chains that were previously
studied. Interestingly, there are additional dynamical processes on the two-leg
ladder such as density oscillations and selftrapping of defects that lead to a
less efficient distillation process. An investigation of the time evolution
starting from product states provides an explanation for this behaviour.
Initial product states are also considered, since in optical lattice
experiments such states are often used as the initial setup. We propose

algorithm can solve an NP-hard problem, when it is aided by an oracle that can
be queried for the answers to bounded-size subproblems. One of the main open
problems in this direction is whether k-Path admits a polynomial Turing kernel:
can a polynomial-time algorithm determine whether an undirected graph has a
simple path of length k, using an oracle that answers queries of size poly(k)?
  We show this can be done when the input graph avoids a fixed graph H as a
topological minor, thereby significantly generalizing an earlier result for
bounded-degree and $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs. Moreover, we show that k-Path
even admits a polynomial Turing kernel when the input graph is not
H-topological-minor-free itself, but contains a known vertex modulator of size
bounded polynomially in the parameter, whose deletion makes it so. To obtain
our results, we build on the graph minors decomposition to show that any
H-topological-minor-free graph that does not contain a k-path, has a separation
that can safely be reduced after communication with the oracle.

homology which was introduced by B\""okstedt--Hsiang--Madsen in 1993 as an
approximation to algebraic $K$-theory. There is a trace map from algebraic
$K$-theory to topological cyclic homology, and a theorem of
Dundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy asserts that this induces an equivalence of
relative theories for nilpotent immersions, which gives a way for computing
$K$-theory in various situations. The construction of topological cyclic
homology is based on genuine equivariant homotopy theory, the use of explicit
point-set models, and the elaborate notion of a cyclotomic spectrum.
  The goal of this paper is to revisit this theory using only
homotopy-invariant notions. In particular, we give a new construction of
topological cyclic homology. This is based on a new definition of the
$\infty$-category of cyclotomic spectra: We define a cyclotomic spectrum to be
a spectrum $X$ with $S^1$-action (in the most naive sense) together with
$S^1$-equivariant maps $\varphi_p: X\to X^{tC_p}$ for all primes $p$. Here
$X^{tC_p}=\mathrm{cofib}(\mathrm{Nm}: X_{hC_p}\to X^{hC_p})$ is the Tate
construction. On bounded below spectra, we prove that this agrees with previous
definitions. As a consequence, we obtain a new and simple formula for
topological cyclic homology.
  In order to construct the maps $\varphi_p: X\to X^{tC_p}$ in the example of
topological Hochschild homology we introduce and study Tate diagonals for
spectra and Frobenius homomorphisms of commutative ring spectra. In particular
we prove a version of the Segal conjecture for the Tate diagonals and relate
these Frobenius homomorphisms to power operations.

This phenomenon is absent in the Standard Cosmological Model, which has a flat
and fixed spatial curvature (small perturbations are considered in the Standard
Cosmological Model but their global average vanishes, leading to spatial
flatness at all times). This paper shows that with the nonlinear growth of
cosmic structures the global average deviates from zero. The analysis is based
on the {\em silent universes} (a wide class of inhomogeneous cosmological
solutions of the Einstein equations). The initial conditions are set in the
early universe as perturbations around the $\Lambda$CDM model with $\Omega_m =
0.31$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.69$, and $H_0 = 67.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. As the
growth of structures becomes nonlinear, the model deviates from the
$\Lambda$CDM model, and at the present instant if averaged over a domain ${\cal
D}$ with volume $V = (2150\,{\rm Mpc})^3$ (at these scales the cosmic variance
is negligibly small) gives: $\Omega_m^{\cal D} = 0.22$, $\Omega_\Lambda^{\cal
D} = 0.61$, $\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} = 0.15$ (in the FLRW limit $\Omega_{\cal
R}^{\cal D} \to \Omega_k$), and $\langle H \rangle_{\cal D} = 72.2$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$. Given the fact that low-redshift observations favor higher values
of the Hubble constant and lower values of matter density, compared to the CMB
constraints, the emergence of the spatial curvature in the low-redshift
universe could be a possible solution to these discrepancies.

action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception
is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error
between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \emph{generative}
(probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that
modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations
encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties
of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the
sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception.
In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory
that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of
active inference have typically examined a ""perception-oriented"" view of this
theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of
their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an ""action-oriented""

examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present

alternating projections can be incorporated into a Newton-Raphson algorithm to
dramatically reduce the computational costs. The algorithm is especially useful
in situations, where generalized linear models with k-way fixed effects based
on dummy variables are computationally demanding or even infeasible due to time
or memory limitations. In a simulation study and an empirical application we
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.

role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is a key input for
predicting the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and
is used to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle
physics. There is a 3.9 standard deviation discrepancy between $\tau_n$
measured by counting the decay rate of free neutrons in a beam (887.7 $\pm$ 2.2
s) and by counting surviving ultracold neutrons stored for different storage
times in a material trap (878.5$\pm$0.8 s). The experiment described here
eliminates loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating
polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap
using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not
interact with material trap walls and neutrons in quasi-stable orbits rapidly
exit the trap. As a result of this approach and the use of a new in situ
neutron detector, the lifetime reported here (877.7 $\pm$ 0.7 (stat) +0.4/-0.2

corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.

which restricts the use of many indefinite kernels. To consider those
non-positive definite kernels, in this paper, we aim to build an indefinite
kernel learning framework for kernel logistic regression. The proposed
indefinite kernel logistic regression (IKLR) model is analysed in the
Reproducing Kernel Kre\u{\i}n Spaces (RKKS) and then becomes non-convex. Using
the positive decomposition of a non-positive definite kernel, the derived IKLR
model can be decomposed into the difference of two convex functions.
Accordingly, a concave-convex procedure is introduced to solve the non-convex
optimization problem. Since the concave-convex procedure has to solve a
sub-problem in each iteration, we propose a concave-inexact-convex procedure
(CCICP) algorithm with an inexact solving scheme to accelerate the solving
process. Besides, we propose a stochastic variant of CCICP to efficiently
obtain a proximal solution, which achieves the similar purpose with the inexact
solving scheme in CCICP. The convergence analyses of the above two variants of
concave-convex procedure are conducted. By doing so, our method works
effectively not only under a deterministic setting but also under a stochastic
setting. Experimental results on several benchmarks suggest that the proposed
IKLR model performs favorably against the standard (positive-definite) kernel
logistic regression and other competitive indefinite learning based algorithms.

activity-induced signal in radial velocity (RV) measurements is through
simultaneous high-precision photometric and RV observations. This is of prime
importance to mitigate the RV signal induced by stellar activity and therefore
unveil the presence of low-mass exoplanets. The K2 Campaign 7 and 8
field-of-views were located in the southern hemisphere, and provided a unique
opportunity to gather unprecedented simultaneous high precision photometric
observation with K2 and high-precision RV measurements with the HARPS
spectrograph to study the relationship between photometric variability and RV
jitter. We observed nine stars with different levels of activity; from quiet to
very active. We probe the presence of any meaningful relation between measured
RV jitter and the simultaneous photometric variation, and also other activity
indicators (e.g. BIS, FWHM, $logR'_{HK}$, and F8), by evaluating the strength
and significance of the correlation between RVs and each indicator. We found
that for the case of very active stars, strong and significant correlations
exist between almost all the observables and measured RVs; however, for lower
activity levels the correlations become random. Except for the F8 which its
strong correlation with RV jitter persists over a wide range of stellar
activity level, and thus our result suggests that F8 might be a powerful proxy
for activity induced RV jitter. Moreover, we examine the capability of two
state-of-the-art modeling techniques, namely the FF' method and SOAP2.0, in
accurately predicting the RV jitter amplitude using the simultaneous
photometric observation. We found that for the very active stars both
techniques can reasonably well predict the amplitude of the RV jitter, however,
at lower activity levels the FF' method underpredicts the RV jitter amplitude.

constitutive models for them have been proposed or tested. Most of these are
effectively ""fabric evolution models"" (FEMs) based on a stress rule connecting
the bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and a closed
time-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes
from short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,
so a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)
of the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed
time-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian
hard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations
for the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for
FEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)
constrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural
anisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively
consider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no
closed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute
this to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during
large parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.
Specifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes
two-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we
observe distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has
oblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane. This structure
likely precludes any adequate closure at second-rank level. Instead, our
numerical data suggest that closures involving the coupled evolution of both a
fabric tensor and a fourth-rank tensor might be reasonably accurate.

to study the nonlinear regime. The stable clustering ansatz remains a key
ingredient to our understanding of gravitational clustering in the highly
nonlinear regime. We study certain aspects of violation of the stable
clustering ansatz in the gravity dual of Large Scale Structure (LSS). We extend
the recent studies of gravitational clustering using AdS gravity dual to take
into account possible departure from the stable clustering ansatz and to
arbitrary dimensions. Next, we extend the recently introduced consistency
relations to arbitrary dimensions. We use the consistency relations to test the
commonly used models of gravitational clustering including the halo models and
hierarchical ans\""atze. In particular we establish a tower of consistency
relations for the hierarchical amplitudes: $Q, R_a, R_b, S_a,S_b,S_c$ etc. as a
functions of the scaled peculiar velocity $h$. We also study the variants of
popular halo models in this context. In contrast to recent claims, none of
these models, in their simplest incarnation, seem to satisfy the consistency
relations in the soft limit.

systems constitutes a new frontier for many-body physics. A generic feature of
dissipative phase transitions is a vanishing gap in the Liouvillian spectrum,
which leads to long-lived deviations from the steady-state as the system is
driven towards the transition. Here, we show that photon correlation
measurements can be used to characterize the corresponding critical slowing
down of nonequilibrium dynamics. We focus on the extensively studied phenomenon
of optical bistability in GaAs cavity-polaritons, which can be described as a
first-order dissipative phase transition. Increasing the excitation strength
towards the bistable range results in an increasing photon-bunching signal
along with a decay time that is prolonged by more than nine orders of magnitude
as compared to that of low density polaritons. In the limit of strong polariton
interactions leading to pronounced quantum fluctuations, the mean-field
bistability threshold is washed out. Nevertheless, the scaling of the
Liouvillian gap closing as thermodynamic limit is approached provides a
signature of the emerging dissipative phase transition. Our results establish
photon correlation measurements as an invaluable tool for studying dynamical
properties of dissipative phase transitions without requiring phase-sensitive
interferometric measurements.

made possible the inference of the dynamics of single molecules in living

cell. The trajectories of particles in the cells, computed with tracking
algorithms, can be modelled with diffusion processes. Three types of diffusion
are considered : (i) free diffusion; (ii) subdiffusion or (iii) superdiffusion.
The Mean Square Displacement (MSD) is generally used to determine the different
types of dynamics of the particles in living cells (Qian, Sheetz and Elson
1991). We propose here a non-parametric three-decision test as an alternative
to the MSD method. The rejection of the null hypothesis -- free diffusion -- is
accompanied by claims of the direction of the alternative (subdiffusion or a
superdiffusion). We study the asymptotic behaviour of the test statistic under
the null hypothesis, and under parametric alternatives which are currently
considered in the biophysics literature, (Monnier et al,2012) for example. In
addition, we adapt the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) to fit with
the three-decision test setting, in order to apply the test procedure to a
collection of independent trajectories. The performance of our procedure is
much better than the MSD method as confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments. The
method is demonstrated on real data sets corresponding to protein dynamics
observed in fluorescence microscopy.

color-magnitude diagram fitting techniques of a sample of Local Group (LG)
dwarfs to obtain stellar masses, metallicities, and star-formation rates (SFR)
to analyze the mass-metallicity relation as a function of the ages of their
stellar populations. The accurate SFHs allow a time resolution of about 2 Gyr
at the oldest ages for a total redshift range of 0<~z<~3. The mass-metallicity
relation retrieved for the sample of LG dwarfs was compared with a large
dataset of literature data obtained in a wide redshift range. Neither of the
two independent datasets shows a clear evolution of the mass-metallicity
relation slope with redshift. However, when the star-formation rate is added as
an additional parameter in the relation, it shows a dependence on the redshift
in the sense that the coefficient of the mass decreases with increasing
redshift, while the coefficient for the SFR is almost constant with time. This
result suggests an increasing contribution with time of the galaxy stellar mass
to the metalliticy of the stars that formed most recently, but it also shows
that the SFR can play a fundamental role in shaping the mass-metallicity
relation.

$\gamma$ and its dual $\delta$. The main results are the following three.
  (1) For a $C^\infty$ convex integrand $\gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+$, its dual
convex integrand $\delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is of class $C^\infty$ if and
only if $\gamma$ is a strictly convex integrand.
  (2) Let $\gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+$ be a $C^\infty$ strictly convex
integrand. Then, $\gamma$ is stable if and only if its dual convex integrand
$\delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is stable.
  (3) Let $\gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+$ be a $C^\infty$ strictly convex
integrand. Suppose that $\gamma$ is stable. Then, for any $i$ $(0\le i\le n)$,
a point $\theta_0\in S^n$ is a non-degenerate critical point of $\gamma$ with
Morse index $i$ if and only if its antipodal point $-\theta_0\in S^n$ is a
non-degenerate critical point of the dual convex integrand $\delta$ with Morse
index $(n-i)$.

and running costs possibly discontinuous across a two-scale oscillatory
interface. Typically, the amplitude of the oscillations is of the order of
$\epsilon$ while the period is of the order of $\epsilon$ 2. As $\epsilon$

asymptotic behavior of the value function as $\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0. We
prove that the value function tends to the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi
equations in the two half-planes limited by $\Gamma$, with an effective
transmission condition on $\Gamma$ keeping track of the oscillations.

range measurements. This is based on the assumption that one can find
overlapping cliques spanning the network. That is, for each sensor, one can
identify geometric neighbors for which all inter-sensor ranges are known. Such
cliques can be efficiently localized using multidimensional scaling. However,
since each clique is localized in some local coordinate system, we are required
to register them in a global coordinate system. In other words, our approach is
based on transforming the localization problem into a problem of registration.
In this context, the main contributions are as follows. First, we describe an
efficient method for partitioning the network into overlapping cliques. Second,
we study the problem of registering the localized cliques, and formulate a
necessary rigidity condition for uniquely recovering the global sensor
coordinates. In particular, we present a method for efficiently testing
rigidity, and a proposal for augmenting the partitioned network to enforce
rigidity. A recently proposed semidefinite relaxation of global registration is
used for registering the cliques. We present simulation results on random and
structured sensor networks to demonstrate that the proposed method compares
favourably with state-of-the-art methods in terms of run-time, accuracy, and
scalability.

the US. A critical challenge of WSI is to perform accurate focusing in high
speed. Traditional systems create a focus map prior to scanning. For each focus
point on the map, sample needs to be static in the x-y plane and axial scanning
is needed to maximize the contrast. Here we report a novel focus map surveying
method for WSI. The reported method requires no axial scanning, no additional
camera and lens, works for stained and transparent samples, and allows
continuous sample motion in the surveying process. It can be used for both
brightfield and fluorescence WSI. By using a 20X, 0.75 NA objective lens, we
demonstrate a mean focusing error of ~0.08 microns in the static mode and ~0.17
microns in the continuous motion mode. The reported method may provide a
turnkey solution for most existing WSI systems for its simplicity, robustness,
accuracy, and high-speed. It may also standardize the imaging performance of
WSI systems for digital pathology and find other applications in high-content
microscopy such as DNA sequencing and time-lapse live-cell imaging.

photons. This allows key concepts including the spacing between photons, and
photon momentum to be introduced. This in-turn allows an intuitive
understanding of the uncertainty principle. We present optical interference in
the context of individual photons, using actual videos showing the development
of images one at a time This enables simple laser interference experiments to
be interpreted through the statistical arrival of photons. The wave aspects of
quantum phenomenon are interpreted in terms of the wavelike nature of the
arrival probabilities.

  Network","17 pages, 21 figures, accepted for publication in the International
  Journal of Astrobiology",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two fundamental problems for extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) attempting
to establish interstellar communication are timing and energy consumption.
Humanity's study of exoplanets via their transit across the host star
highlights a means of solving both problems. An ETI 'A' can communicate with
ETI 'B' if B is observing transiting planets in A's star system, either by
building structures to produce artificial transits observable by B, or by
emitting signals at B during transit, at significantly lower energy consumption
than typical electromagnetic transmission schemes.
  This can produce a network of interconnected civilisations, establishing
contact via observing each other's transits. Assuming that civilisations reside
in a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation
simulations of the establishment and growth of this network, and analyse its
properties in the context of graph theory.
  I find that at any instant, only a few civilisations are correctly aligned to
communicate via transits. However, we should expect the true network to be
cumulative, where a ""handshake"" connection at any time guarantees connection in
the future via e.g. electromagnetic signals. In all our simulations, the
cumulative network connects all civilisations together in a complete network.
If civilisations share knowledge of their network connections, the network can
be fully complete on timescales of order a hundred thousand years. Once
established, this network can connect any two civilisations either directly, or
via intermediate civilisations, with a path much less than the dimensions of
the GHZ.
