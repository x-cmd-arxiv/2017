spectrograph on the 8-m Subaru Telescope. An extreme adaptive optics system is
combined with pupil apodiziation optics to efficiently inject light directly
into a single-mode fiber, which feeds a compact cross-dispersed spectrograph
based on array waveguide grating technology. The instrument currently offers a
throughput of 5% from sky-to-detector which we outline could easily be upgraded
to ~13% (assuming a coupling efficiency of 50%). The isolated spectrograph
throughput from the single-mode fiber to detector was 42% at 1550 nm. The
coupling efficiency into the single-mode fiber was limited by the achievable
Strehl ratio on a given night. A coupling efficiency of 47% has been achieved
with ~60% Strehl ratio on-sky to date. Improvements to the adaptive optics
system will enable 90% Strehl ratio and a coupling of up to 67% eventually.
This work demonstrates that the unique combination of advanced technologies
enables the realization of a compact and highly efficient spectrograph, setting
a precedent for future instrument design on very-large and extremely-large
telescopes.

widely used in the last decades to construct numerical models of accretion
flows onto black holes. Such discs are prone to a global non-axisymmetric
hydrodynamic instability, known as Papaloizou-Pringle instability (PPI), which
can redistribute angular momentum and also lead to an emission of gravitational
waves. It is, however, not clear yet how the development of the PPI is affected
by the presence of a magnetic field and by the concurrent development of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). We present a numerical analysis using
three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of the interplay between the PPI and the
MRI considering, for the first time, an analytical magnetized equilibrium
solution as initial condition. In the purely hydrodynamic case, the PPI selects
as expected the large-scale $m=1$ azimuthal mode as the fastest growing and
non-linearly dominant mode. However, when the torus is threaded by a weak
toroidal magnetic field, the development of the MRI leads to the suppression of
large-scale modes and redistributes power across smaller scales. If the system
starts with a significantly excited $m=1$ mode, the PPI can be dominant in a
transient phase, before being ultimately quenched by the MRI. Such dynamics may
well be important in compact star mergers and tidal disruption events.

services to improve patient quality and safety outcomes. Care delivery is
complex, with interacting and interdependent components that challenge
traditional statistical analytic techniques, in particular when modeling a time
series of outcomes data that might be ""interrupted"" by a change in a particular
method of health care delivery. Interrupted time series (ITS) is a robust
quasi-experimental design with the ability to infer the effectiveness of an
intervention that accounts for data dependency. Current standardized methods
for analyzing ITS data do not model changes in variation and correlation
following the intervention. This is a key limitation since it is plausible for
data variability and dependency to change because of the intervention.
Moreover, present methodology either assumes a pre-specified interruption time
point with an instantaneous effect or removes data for which the effect of
intervention is not fully realized. In this paper, we describe and develop a
novel `Robust-ITS' model that overcomes these omissions and limitations. The
Robust-ITS model formally performs inference on: (a) identifying the change
point; (b) differences in pre- and post-intervention correlation; (c)
differences in the outcome variance pre- and post-intervention; and (d)
differences in the mean pre- and post-intervention. We illustrate the proposed
method by analyzing patient satisfaction data from a hospital that implemented
and evaluated a new nursing care delivery model as the intervention of
interest. The Robust-ITS model is implemented in a R Shiny toolbox which is

reconnection in astrophysical environments. By preventing the formation of
highly elongated reconnection layers, it is crucial in enabling the rapid
energy conversion rates that are characteristic of many astrophysical
phenomena. Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current
sheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.
Here, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in
resistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method
relies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties
of the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the
plasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of
the linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted
and fast reconnection can occur. The scaling laws of the plasmoid instability
are \emph{not} simple power laws, and depend on the Lundquist number ($S$), the
magnetic Prandtl number ($P_m$), the noise of the system ($\psi_0$), the
characteristic rate of current sheet evolution ($1/\tau$), as well as the
thinning process. We also demonstrate that previous scalings are inapplicable
to the vast majority of the astrophysical systems. We explore the implications
of the new scaling relations in astrophysical systems such as the solar corona
and the interstellar medium. In both these systems, we show that our scaling
laws yield values for the growth rate, wavenumber, and aspect ratio that are
much smaller than the Sweet-Parker based scalings.

to Lundquist number $S$ in a Sweet-Parker current sheet, $\gamma_{max}\sim
S^{1/4}$, indicates that at high $S$, the current sheet will break apart before
it approaches the Sweet-Parker width. Therefore, a proper description for the
onset of the plasmoid instability must incorporate the evolving process of the
current sheet. We carry out a series of two-dimensional simulations and develop
diagnostics to separate fluctuations from an evolving background. It is found
that the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate
is sufficiently large ($\gamma_{max}\tau_{A}>O(1)$) to overcome convective
losses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids
become comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode. At this point
the current sheet is disrupted and the instability enters the early nonlinear
regime. The growth rate suddenly decreases, but the fluctuation amplitude
continues to grow until it reaches nonlinear saturation. We identify important
time scales of the instability development, as well as scalings for the linear
growth rate, current sheet width, and dominant wavenumber at current sheet
disruption. These scalings depend on not only the Lundquist number, but also
the initial noise amplitude. A phenomenological model that reproduces scalings
from simulation results is proposed. The model incorporates the effect of
reconnection outflow, which is crucial for yielding a critical Lundquist number
$S_{c}$ below which disruption does not occur. The critical Lundquist number
$S_{c}$ is not a constant value but has a weak dependence on the noise
amplitude.

A-coefficients are also calculated for transitions between all of the bound and

together with elastic tunneling widths to define effective radiative
association rate constants which include both direct and indirect (inverse

kinetic models which represent limiting cases for astrophysical environments.
The first case scenario assumes an equilibrium distribution of quasi-bound

  16 pages, LaTeX, 3 PDF figures",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ontology-based query answering (OBQA) asks whether a Boolean conjunctive
query is satisfied by all models of a logical theory consisting of a relational
database paired with an ontology. The introduction of existential rules (i.e.,
Datalog rules extended with existential quantifiers in rule-heads) as a means
to specify the ontology gave birth to Datalog+/-, a framework that has received
increasing attention in the last decade, with focus also on decidability and
finite controllability to support effective reasoning. Five basic decidable
fragments have been singled out: linear, weakly-acyclic, guarded, sticky, and
shy. Moreover, for all these fragments, except shy, the important property of
finite controllability has been proved, ensuring that a query is satisfied by
all models of the theory iff it is satisfied by all its finite models. In this
paper we complete the picture by demonstrating that finite controllability of
OBQA holds also for shy ontologies, and it therefore applies to all basic
decidable Datalog+/- classes. To make the demonstration, we devise a general
technique to facilitate the process of (dis)proving finite controllability of
an arbitrary ontological fragment. This paper is under consideration for
acceptance in TPLP.

  Settings",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sharing and working on sensitive data in distributed settings from healthcare
to finance is a major challenge due to security and privacy concerns. Secure
multiparty computation (SMC) is a viable panacea for this, allowing distributed
parties to make computations while the parties learn nothing about their data,
but the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed
settings, it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about
individuals to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) can be utilized to
address this; however, achieving SMC with DP is not a trivial task, either. In
this paper, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Distributed Differentially
Private (SM-DDP) protocol to achieve secure and private computations in a
multiparty environment. Specifically, with our protocol, we simultaneously
achieve SMC and DP in distributed settings focusing on linear regression on
horizontally distributed data. That is, parties do not see each others' data
and further, can not infer information about individuals from the final
constructed statistical model. Any statistical model function that allows
independent calculation of local statistics can be computed through our
protocol. The protocol implements homomorphic encryption for SMC and functional
mechanism for DP to achieve the desired security and privacy guarantees. In
this work, we first introduce the theoretical foundation for the SM-DDP
protocol and then evaluate its efficacy and performance on two different
datasets. Our results show that one can achieve individual-level privacy
through the proposed protocol with distributed DP, which is independently
applied by each party in a distributed fashion. Moreover, our results also show
that the SM-DDP protocol incurs minimal computational overhead, is scalable,
and provides security and privacy guarantees.

Our main goal is to describe the structure of optimal trees in $\mathcal{T}_n$
and $\mathcal{C}_n$, the families of all trees and caterpillars, respectively,
of order $n$. We begin by establishing a powerful tool called the Gluing Lemma,
which is used to prove several of our main results. In particular, we show that
if $T$ is an optimal tree in $\mathcal{T}_n$ or $\mathcal{C}_n$ for $n\geq 4$,
then every leaf of $T$ is adjacent to a vertex of degree at least $3$. We also
use the Gluing Lemma to answer an open question of Jamison, and to provide a
conceptually simple proof of Jamison's result that the path $P_n$ has minimum
mean subtree order among all trees of order $n$. We prove that if $T$ is
optimal in $\mathcal{T}_n$, then the number of leaves in $T$ is
$\mathrm{O}(\log_2 n)$, and that if $T$ is optimal in $\mathcal{C}_n$, then the
number of leaves in $T$ is $\mathrm{\Theta}(\log_2 n)$. Along the way, we
describe the asymptotic structure of optimal trees in several narrower families
of trees.

decision making framework. We adapt the fairness framework of ""treating similar

arm and two arms are `similar' if they have a similar quality distribution.
First, we adopt a {\em smoothness constraint} that if two arms have a similar
quality distribution then the probability of selecting each arm should be
similar. In addition, we define the {\em fairness regret}, which corresponds to
the degree to which an algorithm is not calibrated, where perfect calibration
requires that the probability of selecting an arm is equal to the probability
with which the arm has the best quality realization. We show that a variation
on Thompson sampling satisfies smooth fairness for total variation distance,
and give an $\tilde{O}((kT)^{2/3})$ bound on fairness regret. This complements
prior work, which protects an on-average better arm from being less favored. We
also explain how to extend our algorithm to the dueling bandit setting.

the Hubbard bands and the Mott gap. Two mechanisms of localization which
suppresses transport in the array are investigated: The first arises from the
electron-ion core attraction and is significant at low filling; the second is
due to the sharp oscillation in the tunnel coupling caused by the intervalley
interference of the donor electron's wavefunction. This disorder in the tunnel
coupling leads to a steep exponential decay of conductance with channel length
in one-dimensional arrays, but its effect is less prominent in two-dimensional

video-record speeches for 5 prompts in 10 days and exchange comments and
performance-ratings with their peers. We ask (i) whether the participants'
ratings are affected by their interaction patterns with peers, and (ii) whether
there is any gradual buildup of speaking skills in the communities towards
homogeneity. To analyze the data, we employ tools from the emerging field of
Graph Signal Processing (GSP). GSP enjoys a distinction from Social Network
Analysis in that the latter is concerned primarily with the connection
structures of graphs, while the former studies signals on top of graphs. We
study the performance ratings of the participants as graph signals atop
underlying interaction topologies. Total variation analysis of the graph
signals show that the participants' rating differences decrease with time
(slope=-0.04, p<0.01), while average ratings increase (slope=0.07,
p<0.05)--thereby gradually building up the ratings towards community-wide
homogeneity. We provide evidence for peer-influence through a prediction
formulation. Our consensus-based prediction model outperforms baseline
network-agnostic regression models by about 23% in predicting performance
ratings. This, in turn, shows that participants' ratings are affected by their
peers' ratings and the associated interaction patterns, corroborating previous
findings. Then, we formulate a consensus-based diffusion model that captures

whether the glass is more compacted or less dense than the corresponding

pressures indicates that local packing is the dominant variable governing the
glassy dynamics. One consequence is that pressure densification yields a
reduction in the glass transition temperature. The fact that pressure
densification yields different glass structures is at odds with a model for

continuously valued and/or high-dimensional problems. These problems are
challenging and most planning algorithms instead solve simplified
approximations. Popular approximations include graphs and random samples, as
respectively used by informed graph-based searches and anytime sampling-based
planners. Informed graph-based searches, such as A*, traditionally use
heuristics to search a priori graphs in order of potential solution quality.
This makes their search efficient but leaves their performance dependent on the
chosen approximation. If its resolution is too low then they may not find a
(suitable) solution but if it is too high then they may take a prohibitively
long time to do so. Anytime sampling-based planners, such as RRT*,
traditionally use random sampling to approximate the problem domain
incrementally. This allows them to increase resolution until a suitable
solution is found but makes their search dependent on the order of
approximation. Arbitrary sequences of random samples approximate the problem
domain in every direction simultaneously and but may be prohibitively
inefficient at containing a solution. This paper unifies and extends these two
approaches to develop Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed, anytime
sampling-based planner. BIT* solves continuous path planning problems
efficiently by using sampling and heuristics to alternately approximate and
search the problem domain. Its search is ordered by potential solution quality,
as in A*, and its approximation improves indefinitely with additional
computational time, as in RRT*. It is shown analytically to be almost-surely
asymptotically optimal and experimentally to outperform existing sampling-based
planners, especially on high-dimensional planning problems.

The algorithm is the result of observing that the optimal policy and state

  We introduce variational formulations for the topological entropy of
holonomic measures and the topological pressure of IFSw's with weights given by
a potential. A definition of equilibrium state is then natural and we prove its
existence for any continuous potential. We show, in this setting, a uniqueness

is dominated by hadronic mechanisms, and has been named the ""TeV excess"". We
show that TeV emission from pulsars naturally explains this excess. In
particular, recent observations have detected ""TeV halos"" surrounding pulsars
that are either nearby or particularly luminous. Here, we show that the full
population of Milky Way pulsars will produce diffuse TeV emission concentrated

to exceed the hadronic gamma-ray flux at energies above ~500 GeV. Moreover, the
spectrum and intensity of TeV halo emission naturally matches the TeV excess.
If this scenario is common to all galaxies, it will decrease the contribution
of star-forming galaxies to the IceCube neutrino flux. Finally, we show that

profiles, we use an emulator specifically built to interpolate the halo mass
function and the stacked lensing profile for an arbitrary set of halo mass and

that a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest richness bins
($20\le \lambda \lesssim 30$) in order to reproduce the measurements. Without
such a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing profiles tends to
overestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination

microlensing to the light curves. This belief is incorrect -- gravitational
microlensing also produces changes in the actual time delays on the ~day(s)
light-crossing time scale of the emission region. This is due to a combination
of the inclination of the disk relative to the line of sight and the
differential magnification of the temperature fluctuations producing the
variability. We demonstrate this both mathematically and with direct
calculations using microlensing magnification patterns. Measuring these delay
fluctuations can provide a physical scale for microlensing observations,
removing the need for priors on either the microlens masses or the component
velocities. That time delays in lensed quasars are themselves time variable
likely explains why repeated delay measurements of individual lensed quasars
appear to vary by more than their estimated uncertainties. This effect is also
an important new systematic problem for attempts to use time delays in lensed
quasars for cosmology or to detect substructures (satellites) in lens galaxies.

masses $\approx 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at z = 6. We find that the final distribution
of [Eu/H] vs. [Fe/H] is relatively insensitive to the energy by which the
r-process material is ejected into the interstellar medium, but strongly
sensitive to the environment in which the NSM event occurs. In one halo the NSM
event takes place at the center of the stellar distribution, leading to
high-levels of r-process enrichment such as seen in a local UFD, Reticulum II
(Ret II). In a second halo, the NSM event takes place outside of the densest
part of the galaxy, leading to a more extended r-process distribution. The
subsequent star formation occurs in an interstellar medium with shallow levels
of r-process enrichment which results in stars with low levels of [Eu/H]
compared to Ret II stars even when the maximum possible r-process mass is
assumed to be ejected. This suggests that the natal kicks of neutron stars may
also play an important role in determining the r-process abundances in UFD
galaxies, a topic that warrants further theoretical investigation.

low frequencies ($\nu < 300$ GHz) with amplitudes up to $\Delta
I_{\nu}/B_{\nu}(T_{\rm CMB})\sim 10^{-8}$-$10^{-7}$, i.e., at the $\sim 0.1$
percent level of FIRAS upper limits. Shorter wavelength fine-structure
transitions (OI 63 $\mu$m, FeII 26 $\mu$m, and SiII 35 $\mu$m) typically sample
the reionization epoch at higher observing frequencies ($\nu > 400$ GHz). This
corresponds to the Wien tail of the CMB spectrum and the distortion level
induced by those lines may be as high as $\Delta I_{\nu}/B_{\nu}(T_{\rm

more relevant at higher frequencies: while practically negligible at $\nu=145

of the anisotropy power measured at $l \sim 5000$ and $\nu=220 $GHz by the ACT

anisotropy maps from different lines (e.g., OI 145 $\mu$m and CII 158 $\mu$m)
at the same redshift show a very high degree ($>0.8$) of spatial correlation,
allowing for the use of observations at different frequencies to unveil the
same snapshot of the reionization epoch. Finally, our simulations demonstrate
that line-emission anisotropies extracted in narrow frequency/redshift shells
are practically uncorrelated in frequency space, thus enabling standard methods
for removal of foregrounds that vary smoothly in frequency, just as in HI 21 cm

combinatorics in chaotic Newtonian dynamics. We study the chaotic four-body
problem in Newtonian gravity assuming finite-sized particles, and we focus on
interactions that produce direct collisions between any two stars. Our
long-term goal is to construct an equation that gives the probability of a
given collision event occurring over the course of the interaction, as a
function of the total encounter energy and angular momentum as well as the
numbers and properties of the particles. In previous papers, we varied the
number of interacting particles and the distribution of particle radii, for all
equal mass particles. Here, we focus on the effects of different combinations
of particle masses.
  We develop an analytic formalism for calculating the time-scales for
different collision scenarios to occur. Our analytic time-scales reproduce the
simulated time-scales when gravitational focusing is included. We present a
method for calculating the relative rates for different types of collisions to
occur, assuming two different limits for the particle orbits; radial and
tangential. These limits yield relative collision probabilities that bracket
the probabilities we obtain directly from numerical scattering experiments, and
are designed to reveal important information about the (time-averaged)
trajectories of the particles as a function of the interaction parameters.
Finally, we present a Collision Rate Diagram (CRD), which directly compares the
predictions of our analytic rates to the simulations and quantifies the quality
of the agreement. The CRD will facilitate refining our analytic collision rates
in future work, as we expand in to the remaining parameter space.

two coalescing black holes (BHs) with masses of ~36Msun and ~29Msun. Several
scenarios have been proposed to put this detection into an astrophysical
context. The evolution of an isolated massive binary system is among commonly
considered models. Various groups have performed detailed binary-evolution
calculations that lead to BH merger events. However, the question remains open
as to whether binary systems with the predicted properties really exist. The
aim of this paper is to help observers to close this gap by providing spectral
characteristics of massive binary BH progenitors during a phase where at least
one of the companions is still non-degenerate. Stellar evolution models predict
fundamental stellar parameters. Using these as input for our stellar atmosphere
code (PoWR), we compute a set of models for selected evolutionary stages of
massive merging BH progenitors at different metallicities. The synthetic
spectra obtained from our atmosphere calculations reveal that progenitors of
massive BH merger events start their lives as O2-3V stars that evolve to
early-type blue supergiants before they undergo core-collapse during the
Wolf-Rayet phase. When the primary has collapsed, the remaining system will
appear as a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary. We provide feedback parameters,
broad band magnitudes, and spectral templates that should help to identify such
binaries in the future. Comparisons of empirically determined mass-loss rates
with those assumed by evolution calculations reveal significant differences.
The consideration of the empirical mass-loss rates in evolution calculations
will possibly entail a shift of the maximum in the predicted binary-BH merger
rate to higher metallicities, that is, more candidates should be expected in
our cosmic neighborhood than previously assumed.

that produce them. It has been suggested that stellar feedback drives galactic
outflows out of star-forming regions, creating low density channels through
which ionizing photons escape into the inter-galactic medium. We compare the
galactic outflow properties of confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) leaking galaxies
to a control sample of nearby star-forming galaxies to explore whether the
outflows from leakers are extreme as compared to the control sample. We use
data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to
measure the equivalent widths and velocities of Si II and Si III absorption
lines, tracing neutral and ionized galactic outflows. We find that the Si II
and Si III equivalent widths of the LyC leakers reside on the low-end of the
trend established by the control sample. The leakers' velocities are not
statistically different than the control sample, but their absorption line
profiles have a different asymmetry: their central velocities are closer to
their maximum velocities. The outflow kinematics and equivalent widths are
consistent with the scaling relations between outflow properties and host
galaxy properties -- most notably metallicity -- defined by the control sample.
Additionally, we use the Ly\alpha\ profiles to show that the Si II equivalent
width scales with the Ly\alpha\ peak velocity separation. We determine that the
low equivalent widths of the leakers are likely driven by low metallicities and
low H I column densities, consistent with a density-bounded ionization region,
although we cannot rule out significant variations in covering fraction. While
we do not find that the LyC leakers have extreme outflow velocities, the low
maximum-to-central velocity ratios demonstrate the importance of the
acceleration and density profiles for LyC and Ly\alpha\ escape. [abridged]

the $D \bar D^*$ scattering phase-shifts in the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ channel and
their contribution to the level density in the continuum from which the
abundance in a hot medium can be determined. We show that in a purely molecular
picture the bound state contribution cancels the continuum providing a
vanishing occupation number density at finite temperature and the $X(3872)$
does not count below the Quark-Gluon Plasma crossover happening at $T \sim
150$MeV. In contrast, within a coupled-channels approach, for a non vanishing
$c \bar c$ content the cancellation does not occur due to the onset of the
$X(3940)$ which effectively counts as an elementary particle for temperatures
above $T \gtrsim 250$MeV. Thus, a direct inclusion of the $X(3872)$ in the

of the corresponding $p_T$ distribution due to a finite energy resolution.

and is at the heart and foundation of every software development process. This
makes RE the most data and communication-intensive activity compared to other

interruptions inevitable in RE activities. While task switching often allows us
to perform tasks effectively, it imposes a cognitive load and can be
detrimental to the primary task, particularly in complex tasks as the ones
typical for RE activities. Visualization mechanisms enhanced with analytical
methods and interaction techniques help software developers obtain a better
cognitive understanding of the complexity of RE decisions, leading to timelier
and higher quality decisions. In this paper, we propose to apply interactive

the analytical reasoning process of task switching. This framework consists of
both data analysis and visualization layers. The visual layers offer
interactive knowledge visualization components for managing task interruption
decisions at different stages of an interruption (i.e. before, during, and
after). The analytical layers provide narrative knowledge about the

Current approaches assume that task-relevant target-domain data is available

zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from
task-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation
which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the
target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest
solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained
with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and
target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN
RGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in
classification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training
data. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene
classification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations
with task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is
the first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no

computer vision data, but should be extensible to other domains.

reduced by more than one order of magnitude in mT out-of-plane magnetic fields.
When these resonators are additionally coupled inductively instead of

structured variability --- including X-ray flares --- but it is challenging to

in the X-ray and infrared, where variations are often simultaneous, and because
long time series at sub-millimeter and radio wavelengths are limited. Previous
work on sub-mm and radio variability hints at a lag between X-ray flares and
their candidate sub-millimeter or radio counterparts, with the long wavelength
data lagging the X-ray. However, there is only one published time lag between
an X-ray flare and a possible radio counterpart. Here we report 9
contemporaneous X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A*. We detect significant
radio variability peaking $\gtrsim$176 minutes after the brightest X-ray flare
ever detected from Sgr A*. We also report other potentially associated X-ray
and radio variability, with the radio peaks appearing $\lesssim$80 minutes
after these weaker X-ray flares. Taken at face value, these results suggest
that stronger X-ray flares lead to longer time lags in the radio. However, we
also test the possibility that the variability at X-ray and radio wavelengths
is not temporally correlated. We cross-correlate data from mismatched X-ray and
radio epochs and obtain comparable correlations to the matched data. Hence, we
find no overall statistical evidence that X-ray flares and radio variability

an estimate of their bulk density. The transit dilution by the companion star
requires the planet radii to be revised upward, even if the planet orbits the
primary star; as a consequence, the planetary bulk density decreases. We find
that, if planets orbited a faint companion star, they would be more
volatile-rich, and in several cases their densities would become
unrealistically low, requiring large, inflated atmospheres or unusually large
mass fractions in a H/He envelope. In addition, for planets detected in radial
velocity data, the primary star has to be the host. We can exclude 14 planets
from orbiting the companion star; the remaining 15 planets in seven planetary
systems could orbit either the primary or the secondary star, and for five of
these planets the decrease in density would be substantial even if they orbited
the primary, since the companion is of almost equal brightness as the primary.
Substantial follow-up work is required in order to accurately determine the
radii of transiting planets. Of particular interest are small, rocky planets
that may be habitable; a lower mean density might imply a more volatile-rich
composition. Reliable radii, masses, and thus bulk densities will allow us to
identify which small planets are truly Earth-like.

Mufasa produces conformity in observed properties such as colour, sSFR, and HI
content; i.e neighbouring galaxies have similar properties. We see analogous
trends in other properties such as in environment, stellar age, H$_2$ content,
and metallicity. We introduce quantifying conformity using $S(R)$, measuring
the relative difference in upper and lower quartile properties of the
neighbours. We show that low-mass and non-quenched haloes have weak conformity
($S(R)\leq 0.5$) extending to large projected radii $R$ in all properties,
while high-mass and quenched haloes have strong conformity ($S(R)\sim 1$) that
diminishes rapidly with $R$ and disappears at $R\geq 1$ Mpc. $S(R)$ is
strongest for environment in low-mass haloes, and sSFR (or colour) in high-mass
haloes, and is dominated by one-halo conformity with the exception of HI in
small haloes. Metallicity shows a curious anti-conformity in massive haloes.
Tracking the evolution of conformity for $z=0$ galaxies back in time shows that
conformity broadly emerges as a late-time ($z\leq 1$) phenomenon. However, for
fixed halo mass bins, conformity is fairly constant with redshift out to $z\geq
2$. These trends are consistent with the idea that strong conformity only
emerges once haloes grow above Mufasa's quenching mass scale of $\sim
10^{12}M_\odot$. A quantitative measure of conformity in various properties,
along with its evolution, thus represents a new and stringent test of the

independent of the response, conditioned on X (missing at random). In recent
years, many authors have moved from the mean to the median, and more generally,
doubly protected estimators of the quantiles have been proposed, assuming a
parametric regression model for the relationship between X and Y and a
parametric form for the propensity score. In this work, we present doubly
protected estimators for the quantiles that are also robust, in the sense that
they are resistant to the presence of outliers in the sample. We also
flexibilize the model for the relationship between X and Y . Thus we present
robust doubly protected estimators for the quantiles of the response in the
presence of missing observations, postulating a semiparametric regression model
for the relationship between the response and the covariates and a parametric
model for the propensity score.

remedy this situation by using dynamic information from the full system to
renormalize the MZ reduced models. In addition to being stabilized, the

clear what constitutes a constraint propagator, a key component employed in any
DPLL-based solver. In this paper, we address this problem by formulating the
notion of unfounded sets for nondisjunctive hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, based
on which we propose and study two new well-founded operators. We show that by
employing a well-founded operator as a constraint propagator, a sound and

with the operator based on the alternating fixpoint construction by Knorr et al
[2011] and show that, when applied to arbitrary partial partitions, the new
well-founded operators not only propagate more truth values but also circumvent
the non-converging behavior of the latter. In addition, we study the
possibility of simplifying a given hybrid MKNF knowledge base by employing a
well-founded operator, and show that, out of the two operators proposed in this
paper, the weaker one can be applied for this purpose and the stronger one
cannot. These observations are useful in implementing a grounder for hybrid
MKNF knowledge bases, which can be applied before the computation of MKNF
models.

theoretical study on the relaxation time of a spin-torque oscillator from one

Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation both analytically and numerically, it is shown
that the oscillator relaxes to the self-oscillation state exponentially within
a few nanoseconds, except when magnetization is close to a critical point. The
relaxation rate, which is an inverse of relaxation time, is proportional to the
current. On the other hand, a critical slowing down appears near the critical
point, where relaxation is inversely proportional to time, and the relaxation
time becomes on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. These conclusions are
primarily obtained for a spin-torque oscillator consisting of a perpendicularly

the periphery to the central brain reconfigure the densely packed information

knowledge of the reduced states in a given bipartition of a multipartite

Hamiltonians, are applied. Simply one-mode metaplectic evolutions, such
rotations, squeezing and shear transformations, in addition to a single

We supplement these observations with ground based observations of 12CO J=1-0

molecular gas in the nucleus and centre regions has a cool component
(T_kin~10-20 K) with a moderate but poorly constrained density (n(H2)~10^3-10^6
cm^-3), as well as significant molecular gas in a warmer (T_kin~300-3000 K),
lower density (n(H2)~10^1.6-10^2.5 cm^-3) component. We compare our CO line
ratios and calculated densities along with ratios of CO to total infrared
luminosity to a grid of photon dominated region (PDR) models and find that the
cold molecular gas likely resides in PDRs with a field strength of G_o~10^2.
The warm component likely requires an additional source of mechanical heating,
from supernovae and stellar winds or possibly shocks produced in the strong
spiral density wave. When compared to similar two-component models of other
star-forming galaxies published as part of the Very Nearby Galaxies Survey (Arp
220, M82 and NGC 4038/39), M51 has the lowest density for the warm component,
while having a warm gas mass fraction that is comparable to those of Arp 220

challenging predictive data analysis efforts in order to improve the life of
patients living with drug-resistant epilepsy and tonic seizures. Many
outstanding works have been reporting great results in providing a sensible
indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural-stimulation) control
over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However,
many works put heavily handcraft feature extraction and/or carefully tailored
feature engineering to each patient to achieve very high sensitivity and low
false prediction rate for a particular dataset. This limits the benefit of
their approaches if a different dataset is used. In this paper we apply
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on different intracranial and scalp
electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and proposed a generalized retrospective
and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT) on 30-second EEG windows with 50% overlapping to extract
information in both frequency and time domains. A standardization step is then
applied on STFT components across the whole frequency range to prevent high
frequencies features being influenced by those at lower frequencies. A
convolutional neural network model is used for both feature extraction and
classification to separate preictal segments from interictal ones. The proposed
approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, 82.3% and false prediction rate
(FPR) of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, 0.22/h on Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG (iEEG)
dataset, Children's Hospital of Boston-MIT scalp EEG (sEEG) dataset, and Kaggle
American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge's dataset, respectively.
Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random
predictor for most of patients in all three datasets.

of them are pointing to any expected X-gamma or radio sources: no one in

to galactic plane. Moreover there have not been any record (among a dozen of

coloring problem and the phase transitions they undergo when the density of
constraints is varied. Hypergraph coloring is a constraint satisfaction problem
where each constraint includes $K$ variables that must be assigned one out of
$q$ colors in such a way that there are no monochromatic constraints, i.e.
there are at least two distinct colors in the set of variables belonging to
every constraint. This problem generalizes naturally coloring of random graphs
($K=2$) and bicoloring of random hypergraphs ($q=2$), both of which were
extensively studied in past works. The study of random hypergraph coloring
gives us access to a case where both the size $q$ of the domain of the
variables and the arity $K$ of the constraints can be varied at will. Our work
provides explicit values and predictions for a number of phase transitions that
were discovered in other constraint satisfaction problems but never evaluated
before in hypergraph coloring. Among other cases we revisit the hypergraph
bicoloring problem ($q=2$) where we find that for $K=3$ and $K=4$ the
colorability threshold is not given by the one-step-replica-symmetry-breaking
analysis as the latter is unstable towards more levels of replica symmetry
breaking. We also unveil and discuss the coexistence of two different 1RSB
solutions in the case of $q=2$, $K \ge 4$. Finally we present asymptotic
expansions for the density of constraints at which various phase transitions
occur, in the limit where $q$ and/or $K$ diverge.

including the tree erasure and Horton pruning. The main result is invariance of
a finite critical binary Galton-Watson tree with exponential edge lengths with
respect to the generalized dynamical pruning for an arbitrary admissible
pruning function. The second part of the paper examines the continuum 1-D
ballistic annihilation model $A+A \rightarrow \emptyset$ for a constant
particle density and initial velocity that alternates between the values of
$\pm$1. The model evolution is equivalent to a generalized dynamical pruning of
the shock tree that represents dynamics of sinks (points of particle
annihilation), with the pruning function equal to the total tree length. The
shock tree is isometric to the level set tree of the model potential (integral
of velocity). This equivalence allows us to construct a complete probabilistic
description of the annihilation dynamics for the initial velocity that
alternates between the values of $\pm$1 at the epochs of a stationary Poisson
process. Finally, we discuss several real tree representations of the ballistic
annihilation model, closely connected to the shock wave tree.

on GPUs. These algorithms are typically blocking, so they require fair

scheduling, and GPU schedulers are unfair in practice. Current approaches avoid
this issue by exploiting scheduling quirks of today's GPUs in a manner that
does not allow the GPU to be shared with other workloads (such as graphics
rendering tasks). We propose cooperative kernels, an extension to the
traditional GPU programming model geared towards writing blocking algorithms.
Workgroups of a cooperative kernel are fairly scheduled, and multitasking is
supported via a small set of language extensions through which the kernel and
scheduler cooperate. We describe a prototype implementation of a cooperative
kernel framework implemented in OpenCL 2.0 and evaluate our approach by porting
a set of blocking GPU applications to cooperative kernels and examining their
performance under multitasking. Our prototype exploits no vendor-specific

wireless channels, which are broadcast in nature. This paper exploits this
unique feature to design an efficient repair mechanism, called broadcast
repair, for wireless distributed storage systems in the presence of
multiple-node failures. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission,
we advocate a new measure on repair performance called repair-transmission
bandwidth. In contrast to repair bandwidth, which measures the average number
of packets downloaded by a newcomer to replace a failed node,
repair-transmission bandwidth measures the average number of packets
transmitted by helper nodes per failed node. A fundamental study on the storage
capacity of wireless distributed storage systems with broadcast repair is
conducted by modeling the storage system as a multicast network and analyzing
the minimum cut of the corresponding information flow graph. The fundamental
tradeoff between storage efficiency and repair-transmission bandwidth is also
obtained for functional repair. The performance of broadcast repair is compared
both analytically and numerically with that of cooperative repair, the basic
repair method for wired distributed storage systems with multiple-node
failures. While cooperative repair is based on the idea of allowing newcomers
to exchange packets, broadcast repair is based on the idea of allowing a helper
to broadcast packets to all newcomers simultaneously. We show that broadcast
repair outperforms cooperative repair, offering a better tradeoff between

a reference sample selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the
redshift-space monopole moment. In contrast to previous studies, which found
no/weak HI-mass dependence, we find both the clustering amplitude on scales
above a few Mpc and the bias factors to increase significantly with increasing
HI mass for subsamples with HI mass thresholds above $10^9M_{\odot}$. For HI
mass thresholds below $10^9M_{\odot}$, while the measurements have large

concept of Gaussian nature of CMB and strong non-Gaussian nature of
astrophysical polarized foregrounds using WMAP nine year published polarization
maps. We excise regions of the sky that define position of the known point
sources, regions that are strongly contaminated by either the detector noise or
by the diffuse foregrounds or both, and then perform foreground minimizations
over the surviving sky regions that constitute approximately $50\%$ of the full
sky area. We critically evaluate performance of foreground minimizations in
several ways and show that our foreground minimization method removes
significant foregrounds from input maps. The cleaned Stokes \{Q, U\}
polarization maps have less EE and BB power from relevant sky region compared
to WMAP foreground-reduced Stokes \{Q, U\} polarization maps at different
multipole ranges. We validate our methodology by performing detailed Monte
Carlo simulations. The main driving machinery of our method is an
internal-linear-combination (ILC) approach, however, unlike simple variance
minimization performed in usual ILC method, the core of the method being
dependent on the theoretically well motivated concept of Gaussianity of CMB
polarization a direct connection is established between observations and models
of inflation. Additionally, the method, like the usual ILC method, is
independent on modeling uncertainties of polarized foregrounds. It will be
useful to apply our method in future generation low-noise CMB polarization
experiments.

lifting of CDCL to program analysis called Abstract Conflict Driven Learning
for Programs (ACDLP). ACDLP alternates between model search, which performs
over-approximate deduction with constraint propagation, and conflict analysis,
which performs under-approximate abduction with heuristic choice. We
instantiate the model search and conflict analysis algorithms to an abstract
domain of template polyhedra, strictly generalizing CDCL from the Boolean
lattice to a richer lattice structure. Our template polyhedra can express
intervals, octagons and restricted polyhedral constraints over program
variables. We have imple- mented ACDLP for automatic bounded safety
verification of C programs. We evaluate the performance of our analyser by
comparing with CBMC, which uses CDCL, and Astree, a commercial abstract
interpretation tool. We observe two orders of magnitude reduction in the number
of decisions, propagations, and conflicts as well as a 1.5x speedup in runtime

outliers. Robust process regression models based on t-process or other
heavy-tailed processes have been developed to address the problem. However, due
to the nature of the current definition for heavy-tailed processes, the unknown
process regression function and the random errors are always defined jointly
and thus dependently. This definition, mainly owing to the dependence
assumption involved, is not justified in many practical problems and thus
limits the application of those robust approaches. It also results in a
limitation of the theory of robust analysis. In this paper, we propose a new
robust process regression model enabling independent random errors. An
efficient estimation procedure is developed. Statistical properties, such as
unbiasness and information consistency, are provided. Numerical studies show
that the proposed method is robust against outliers and has a better
performance in prediction compared with the existing models. We illustrate that
the estimated random-effects are useful in detecting outlying curves.

biases have been identified in the Galaxy Zoo data. Here we report on a newly
discovered selection effect: astronomers interested in studying spiral galaxies
may select a set of spiral galaxies based upon a threshold in spirality (the
fraction of Galaxy Zoo humans who report seeing spiral structure). SpArcFiRe is
an automated tool that decomposes a spiral galaxy into its constituent spiral
arms, providing objective, quantitative data on their structure. SpArcFiRe
measures the pitch angle of spiral arms. We have observed that when selecting a
set of spiral galaxies based on a threshold on spirality, the pitch angle of
spiral arms appear increase with redshift. We hypothesize that this is a
selection effect: tightly-wound spiral arms become less visible as images
degrade with increasing redshift, leading to fewer such galaxies being included
in the sample at higher redshifts. We corroborate this hypothesis by
artificially degrading images of nearby galaxies, then using a machine learning
algorithm trained on Galaxy Zoo data to provide a spirality for each
artificially degraded image. It correctly predicts that spirality decreases as
image quality degrades. Thus, the mean pitch angle of those galaxies remaining
above the spirality threshold is higher than those eliminated by the selection
effect. This demonstrates that users who select samples of galaxies using a
threshold of Galaxy Zoo votes must carefully consider the possibility of
selection effects on morphological measures, even if the measure itself is
believed to be objective and unbiased. Finally, we also perform an empirical
sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that SpArcFiRe's output changes in a smooth
and predictable fashion to changes in its internal algorithmic parameters.

fluxes as good as 3% in 0.3-35{\mu}m wavebands and about 1% in the visible

Some stars have extremely stable fluxes and can be used as long term flux
calibration sources. Stellar brightness is several orders of magnitude lower
than most ground objects while the stars do not usually appear in remote
sensing cameras, which makes the stars inappropriate for being calibration
sources. The calibration method using stars discussed in this paper is through
a mini-camera attached to remote sensing satellite. The mini-camera works at
similar wavebands as the remote sensing cameras and it can observe the stars
and the ground objects alternatively. High signal-to-noise ratio is achieved
for the relatively faint stars through longer exposure time. Simultaneous
precise cross-calibration is obtained as the mini-camera and remote sensing
cameras look at the ground objects at the same time. The fluxes from the stars
used as calibration standards are transferred to the remote sensing cameras
through this procedure. Analysis shows that a 2% accurate calibration is

tenants and applications generating a spectrum of datacenter traffic. Delay
sensitive applications and applications with specific Service Level Agreements
(SLAs), generate deadline constrained flows, while other applications initiate
flows that are desired to be delivered as early as possible. As a result,
datacenter traffic is a mix of two types of flows: deadline and regular. There
are several scheduling policies for either traffic type with focus on
minimizing completion times or deadline miss rate. In this report, we apply
several scheduling policies to mix traffic scenario while varying the ratio of
regular to deadline traffic. We consider FCFS (First Come First Serve), SRPT
(Shortest Remaining Processing Time) and Fair Sharing as deadline agnostic
approaches and a combination of Earliest Deadline First (EDF) with either FCFS
or SRPT as deadline-aware schemes. In addition, for the latter, we consider
both cases of prioritizing deadline traffic (Deadline First) and prioritizing
regular traffic (Deadline Last). We study both light-tailed and heavy-tailed
flow size distributions and measure mean, median and tail flow completion times
(FCT) for regular flows along with Deadline Miss Rate (DMR) and average
lateness for deadline flows. We also consider two operation regimes of
lightly-loaded (low utilization) and heavily-loaded (high utilization). We find
that performance of deadline-aware schemes is highly dependent on fraction of
deadline traffic. With light-tailed flow sizes, we find that FCFS performs
better in terms of tail times and average lateness while SRPT performs better
in average times and deadline miss rate. For heavy-tailed flow sizes, except
for tail times, SRPT performs better in all other metrics.

using dedicated inter-datacenter networks. An important application of these
networks is data replication which is done for purposes such as increased
resiliency via making backup copies, getting data closer to users for reduced
delay and WAN bandwidth usage, and global load balancing. These replications
usually lead to network transfers with deadlines that determine the time prior
to which all datacenters should have a copy of the data. Inter-datacenter
networks have limited capacity and need be utilized efficiently to maximize
performance. In this report, we focus on applications that transfer multiple
copies of objects from one datacenter to several datacenters given deadline
constraints. Existing solutions are either deadline agnostic, or only consider
point-to-point transfers. We propose DDCCast, a simple yet effective deadline
aware point to multipoint technique based on DCCast and using ALAP traffic
allocation. DDCCast performs careful admission control using temporal planning,
uses rate-allocation and rate-limiting to avoid congestion and sends traffic
over forwarding trees that are carefully selected to reduce bandwidth usage and
maximize deadline meet rate. We perform experiments confirming DDCCast's
potential to reduce total bandwidth usage by up to $45\%$ while admitting up to
$25\%$ more traffic into the network compared to existing solutions that
guarantee deadlines.

  http://thequantumtimes.org/2017/07/is-qbism-the-future-of-quantum-physics/",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this book is to explain Quantum Bayesianism ('QBism') to
""people without easy access to mathematical formulas and equations"" (4-5).
Qbism is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that ""doesn't meddle with the
technical aspects of the theory [but instead] reinterprets the fundamental
terms of the theory and gives them new meaning"" (3). The most important
motivation for QBism, enthusiastically stated on the book's cover, is that
QBism provides ""a way past quantum theory's paradoxes and puzzles"" such that
much of the weirdness associated with quantum theory ""dissolves under the lens
of QBism"".
  Could a non-technical book that almost fits in your pocket really succeed in
resolving the notorious paradoxes of quantum theory? I believe the answer is:
not in this case. There are three primary reasons. Firstly, the argument that
QBism solves quantum paradoxes is not convincing. Secondly, it proves difficult
to pin down exactly what QBism says. Thirdly, as a scientific theory QBism
seems explanatorily inert, which is maybe why the topic of scientific
explanation is not broached. Sections 2-4 below discuss each of these problems
in turn. However, there is still a wealth of insights that make this book a
worthwhile read, and I shall begin with those.

  Robotic Manipulators","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.AP cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Characterization of the uncertainty in robotic manipulators is the focus of
this paper. Based on the random matrix theory (RMT), we propose uncertainty
characterization schemes in which the uncertainty is modeled at the macro
(system) level. This is different from the traditional approaches that model
the uncertainty in the parametric space of micro (state) level. We show that
perturbing the system matrices rather than the state of the system provides
unique advantages especially for robotic manipulators. First, it requires only
limited statistical information that becomes effective when dealing with
complex systems where detailed information on their variability is not
available. Second, the RMT-based models are aware of the system state and
configuration that are significant factors affecting the level of uncertainty
in system behavior. In this study, in addition to the motion uncertainty
analysis that was first proposed in our earlier work, we also develop an
RMT-based model for the quantification of the static wrench uncertainty in
multi-agent cooperative systems. This model is aimed to be an alternative to
the elaborate parametric formulation when only rough bounds are available on
the system parameters. We discuss that how RMT-based model becomes advantageous
when the complexity of the system increases. We perform experimental studies on
a KUKA youBot arm to demonstrate the superiority of the RMT-based motion
uncertainty models. We show that how these models outperform the traditional
models built upon Gaussianity assumption in capturing real-system uncertainty
and providing accurate bounds on the state estimation errors. In addition, to
experimentally support our wrench uncertainty quantification model, we study
the behavior of a cooperative system of mobile robots. It is shown that one can
rely on less demanding RMT-based formulation and yet meets the acceptable
accuracy.

comparisons between agents are limited by an underlying network structure. We
generalize the classical fairness notions of envy-freeness and proportionality
to this graphical setting. Given a simple undirected graph G, an allocation is
envy-free on G if no agent envies any of her neighbor's share, and is
proportional on G if every agent values her own share no less than the average
among her neighbors, with respect to her own measure. These generalizations
open new research directions in developing simple and efficient algorithms that
can produce fair allocations under specific graph structures.
  On the algorithmic frontier, we first propose a moving-knife algorithm that
outputs an envy-free allocation on trees. The algorithm is significantly
simpler than the discrete and bounded envy-free algorithm recently designed by
Aziz and Mackenzie for complete graphs. Next, we give a discrete and bounded
algorithm for computing a proportional allocation on descendant graphs, a class
of graphs by taking a rooted tree and connecting all its ancestor-descendant
pairs.

collapse along the filament, which feeds a sink particle located at the

considering the practical mobility constraints of commercial drones, we design
drone mobility algorithms to improve the spectral efficiency of DroneCells. As
the optimal problem is NP-hard, we propose a range of practically realizable
heuristics with varying complexity and performance. Simulations show that,
using the existing consumer drones, the proposed algorithms can readily improve
spectral efficiency by 34\% and the 5-percentile packet throughput by 50\%
compared to the scenario, where drones hover over fixed locations. More
significant gains can be expected with more agile drones in the future. A
surprising outcome is that the drones need to fly only at minimal speeds to
achieve these gains, avoiding any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. We
further demonstrate that the optimal solution provides only modest improvements
over the best heuristic algorithm, which employs Game Theory to make mobility
decisions for drone BSs.

by using loss functions. However, different loss functions often generate
different ranking results for forecasts, which complicates the task of
comparisons. In this paper, we develop statistical tests for comparing
performances of forecasting expectiles and quantiles of a random variable under
consistent loss functions. The test statistics are constructed with the
extremal consistent loss functions of Ehm et.al. (2016). The null hypothesis of
the tests is that a benchmark forecast at least performs equally well as a
competing one under all extremal consistent loss functions. It can be shown
that if such a null holds, the benchmark will also perform at least equally
well as the competitor under all consistent loss functions. Thus under the
null, when different consistent loss functions are used, the result that the
competitor does not outperform the benchmark will not be altered. We establish
asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics and propose to use the
re-centered bootstrap to construct their empirical distributions. Through
simulations, we show the proposed test statistics perform reasonably well. We
then apply the proposed method on (1) re-examining abilities of some often-used
predictors on forecasting risk premium of the S&P500 index; (2) comparing
performances of experts' forecasts on annual growth of U.S. real gross domestic

AES-K method enables density of states to be effectively reconstructed by using
the replica-exchange Monte Carlo method and the multiple histogram method.
Applying the ES-K and AES-K methods to type Ia supernova data, we confirmed the
conventional understanding in astronomy when an appropriate K is given
beforehand. However, we found the difficulty to determine K from the data.
Using virtual measurement and analysis, we argue that this is caused by data
shortage.

finite-state system, are controlled uniformly: the controller applies the same
action to every agent. The framework is largely inspired by the control of a
biological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the controller may only
change the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem
for such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of
the controller , the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a
target state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic
finite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is
encoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and
the second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game
with m agents is called the m-population game. This gives rise to a
parameterized control problem (where control refers to 2 player games), namely
the population control problem: can Controller control the m-population game
for all $m $\in$ N$ whatever Agents does? In this paper, we prove that the
population control problem is decidable, and it is a EXPTIME-complete problem.
As far as we know, this is one of the first results on parameterized control.
Our algorithm, not based on cutoff techniques, produces winning strategies
which are symbolic, that is, they do not need to count precisely how the
population is spread between states. We also show that if there is no winning
strategy, then there is a population size M such that Controller wins the
m-population game if and only if $m $\le$ M$. Surprisingly, M can be doubly
exponential in the number of states of the NFA, with tight upper and lower

HD166734 is an eccentric eclipsing binary system composed of two
supergiant O-type stars, orbiting with a 34.5-day period. In this rare
configuration for such stars, the two objects mainly evolve independently,
following single-star evolution so far. This system provides a chance to study
the individual parameters of two supergiant massive stars and to derive their
real masses. Methods. An intensive monitoring was dedicated to HD166734.We
analyzed mid- and high-resolution optical spectra to constrain the orbital
parameters of this system. We also studied its light curve for the first time,
obtained in the VRI filters. Finally, we disentangled the spectra of the two
stars and modeled them with the CMFGEN atmosphere code in order to determine
the individual physical parameters. Results. HD166734 is a O7.5If+O9I(f)
binary. We confirm its orbital period but we revise the other orbital
parameters. In comparison to what we found in the literature, the system is
more eccentric and, now, the hottest and the most luminous component is also
the most massive one. The light curve exhibits only one eclipse and its
analysis indicates an inclination of 63.0{\deg} $\pm$ 2.7{\deg}. The
photometric analysis provides us with a good estimation of the luminosities of
the stars, and therefore their exact positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. The evolutionary and the spectroscopic masses show good agreement with
the dynamical masses of 39.5 Msun for the primary and 33.5 Msun for the
secondary, within the uncertainties. The two components are both enriched in
helium and in nitrogen and depleted in carbon. In addition, the primary also
shows a depletion in oxygen. Their surface abundances are however not different
from those derived from single supergiant stars, yielding, for both components,
an evolution similar to that of single stars.

The presence of an f line in the He-like triplets further supports a wind-wind
collision as the main source of the X-rays in HD166734. While temperature and
absorption do not vary significantly along the orbit, the X-ray emission
strength varies by one order of magnitude, with a long minimum state
(Delta(phi)~0.1) occurring after a steep decrease. The flux at minimum is
compatible with the intrinsic emission of the O-stars in the system, suggesting
a possible disappearance of colliding wind emission. While this minimum cannot
be explained by eclipse or occultation effects, a shock collapse may occur at
periastron in view of the wind properties. Afterwards, the recovery is long,
with an X-ray flux proportional to the separation d (in hard band) or to d^2
(in soft band). This is incompatible with an adiabatic nature for the collision
(which would instead lead to ""F_X propto 1/d""), but could be reconciled with a
radiative character of the collision, though predicted temperatures are lower

the global asymmetry of the light curve remain unexplained, however.

Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the
on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of
nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked
enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle
level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence,
the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases
in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum $q=\pi/|{\pmb a}_1|$
grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin
fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of
the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a
constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole
continuum is shifted to higher energies---due to the renormalization of the
Fermi velocity---Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear
spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the
Brillouin zone.

measure of fluctuation are found to be intimately correlated in many physical
systems. Unlike the fluctuation dissipation theorem in linear response theory,
the correlation is often strongly non-linear. To understand this complex
dependence, we consider the classical Brownian diffusion in this work. Under
certain rational assumption, i.e. in the bi-component fluid mixture, the mass
of the Brownian particle $M$ is far greater than that of the bath molecule $m$,
we can adopt the weakly couple limit. Only considering the first-order
approximation of the mass ratio $m/M$, we obtain a linear motion equation in
the reference frame of the observer as a Brownian particle. Based on this
equivalent equation, we get the Hamiltonian at equilibrium. Finally, using
canonical ensemble method, we define a new entropy that is similar to the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Further, we present an analytic expression of the
relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the entropy $S$ in the
thermal equilibrium, that is to say, $D =\frac{\hbar}{eM} \exp{[S/(k_Bd)]}$,
where $d$ is the dimension of the space, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, $\hbar $

to enable a formal Bayesian multi-agent decision analysis to be distributed and

to deliver only certain summaries of the variables under their jurisdiction to

publicly available high-quality templates covering a wide range of possible

present such a set of templates, publicly available, for download at

lightcones at high and low resolution, and several derived statistical
quantities for 45 models spanning our choice of 3D parameter space. These data
are the result of fully coupled radiative hydrodynamic high resolution
($1024^3$) simulations performed with the LICORICE code. Both X-ray and Lyman
line transfer is performed to account for heating and Wouthuysen-Field coupling
fluctuations. We also present a first exploitation of the data using the power
spectrum and the Pixel Distribution Function (PDF) as functions of redshifts,
computed from lightcone data. We analyse how these two quantities behave when
varying the model parameters while taking into account the thermal noise
expected of a typical SKA survey. Finally, we show that the power spectrum and
the PDF have different -- and to some extent complementary -- abilities to
distinguish between different models. This opens the door to formulating an
optimal sampling of the parameter space, dependant on the chosen diagnostics.

near-field heat transfer (NFHT) of two graphene sheets in parallel-plate

nonequilibrium Green's function method. A Caroli formula for heat flux is
proposed and numerically verified. We show our near-field-to-black-body heat
flux ratios generally exhibit $1/d^{\alpha}$ dependence, with an effective
exponent $\alpha \approx 2.2$, at long distances exceeding 100 nm and up to one
micron; in the opposite $d\rightarrow 0$ limit, the values converge to a range
within an order of magnitude. We justify this feature by noting it is owing to
the breakdown of local conductivity theory, which predicts a $1/d$ dependence.
Furthermore, from the numerical result, we find in addition to thermal
wavelength, $\lambda_{th}$, a shorter distance scale $\sim$ 10 - 100 nm,
comparable to the graphene thermal length ($\hbar v_{F}/k_{B} T$) or Fermi
wavelength ($k_{F}^{-1}$), marks the transition point between the short- and
long-distance transfer behaviors; within that point, relatively large variation
of heat flux in response to doping level becomes a typical characteristic. The
emergence of such large variation is tied to relative NFHT contributions from
the intra- and inter-band transitions. Beyond that point, scaling of thermal
flux $\propto 1/d^{\alpha}$ can be generally observed.

less likely to produce more massive hadrons for a given quark content,
therefore reducing ratios such as K*/K and $\rho_0/\pi$ in high-multiplicity pp
collisions. In addition, we have also studied the effects of allowing string

thermal particles in addition to the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism of sterile

stars whose pulsation content is difficult to interpret. This is the case of
intermediate-mass classical pulsating stars (i.e. gamma Dor, delta Scuti,
hybrids) for which current theories do not properly predict the observed

relations from Data Mining techniques for these stars. We searched for those
hidden relations in a sample of delta Scuti and hybrid stars observed by CoRoT

pairs of observables were found. However, two statistically significant
correlations emerged from multivariable correlations in the observed seismic
data, which describe the total number of observed frequencies and the largest
one, respectively. Moreover, three different sets of stars were found to
cluster according to their frequency density distribution. Such sets are in

gamma-ray emission of the Coma cluster, a cluster that hosts the prototype of
giant radio halos. In this paper we extend previous studies and use a formalism
that combines particle reacceleration by turbulence and the generation of
secondary particles in the intracluster medium to constrain relativistic
protons and their role for the origin of the radio halo. We conclude that a
pure hadronic origin of the radio halo is clearly disfavoured as it would
require magnetic fields that are too strong. For instance $B_0 > 21 \mu$G is
found in the cluster center assuming that the magnetic energy density scales
with thermal density, to be compared with $B_0 \sim 4-5 \mu$G as inferred from
Rotation Measures (RM) under the same assumption. However secondary particles
can still generate the observed radio emission if they are reaccelerated. For
the first time the deep gamma-ray limits allow us to derive meaningful
constraints if the halo is generated during phases of reacceleration of
relativistic protons and their secondaries by cluster-scale turbulence. In this
paper we explore a relevant range of parameter-space of reacceleration models.
Within this parameter space a fraction of model configurations is already ruled
out by current gamma-ray limits, including the cases that assume weak magnetic
fields in the cluster core, $B \leq 2-3 \mu$G. Interestingly, we also find that
the flux predicted by a large fraction of model configurations that assume a
magnetic field consistent with RM is not far from the limits. This suggests
that a detection of gamma rays from the cluster might be possible in the near
future, provided that the electrons generating the radio halo are secondaries
reaccelerated and the magnetic field in the cluster is consistent with that
inferred from RM.

and radiative lifetime of neutral excitons confined in CdSe colloidal
nanoplatelets (NPLs). The excitonic properties are largely governed by the
electron-hole in-plane correlation, which in NPLs is enhanced by the
quasi-two-dimensional motion and the dielectric mismatch with the organic
environment. In NPLs with lateral size $L \gtrsim 20$ nm the exciton behavior
is essentially that in a quantum well, with superradiance leading to exciton
lifetimes of 1 ps or less, only limited by the NPL area. However, for $L < 20$
nm excitons enter an intermediate confinement regime, hence departing from the
quantum well behavior. In heterostructured NPLs, different response is observed
for core/shell and core/crown configurations. In the former, the strong
vertical confinement limits separation of electrons and holes even for type-II
band alignment. The exciton behavior is then similar to that in core-only NPL,
albeit with weakened dielectric effects. In the latter, charge separation is
also inefficient if band alignment is quasi-type-II (e.g. in CdSe/CdS), because
electron-hole interaction drives both carriers into the core. However, it
becomes very efficient for type-II alignment, for which we predict exciton
lifetimes reaching $\mu s$.

encode lambda terms in terms of 0-1-strings using the de Bruijn representation
along with a weighting scheme. Later, Grygiel and Lescanne conjectured that the
number of binary lambda terms with $m$ free indices and of size $n$ (encoded as
binary words of length $n$ and according to Tromp's weights) is $o(n^{-3/2}
\tau^{-n})$ for $\tau \approx 1.963448\ldots$. We generalize the proposed
notion of size and show that for several classes of lambda terms, including
binary lambda terms with $m$ free indices, the number of terms of size $n$ is
$\Theta{n^{-3/2} \rho^{-n}}$ with some class dependent constant $\rho$, which
in particular disproves the above mentioned conjecture.
  The methodology used is setting up the generating functions for the classes
of lambda terms. These are infinitely nested radicals which are investigated
then by a singularity analysis.
  We show further how some properties of random lambda terms can be analyzed
and present a way to sample lambda terms uniformly at random in a very
efficient way. This allows to generate terms of size more than one million

presented in the literature so far.

Furthermore, one might wish to subsample networks to reduce their size for

sampling method may affect the network structure and thus caution is necessary
to generalize results based on samples. In this paper, we study four sampling
strategies applied to a variety of real-life temporal networks. We quantify the

the most striking successes in deep hashing have mostly involved discriminative

binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval and
classification in an unsupervised way? We resolve these problems by introducing
an intermediate variable and a loss function steering the learning process,
which is based on the neighborhood structure in the original space.
Experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and Oxford-17)
demonstrate that our DDH significantly outperforms existing hashing methods by

evolving network using methods developed for static networks.
  The first finds the community structure of the aggregated network; however,
this approach discards most temporal information, and may lead to inappropriate
descriptions, as very different dynamic data can give rise to the identical
static graphs.
  The opposite approach closely follows the evolutions and builds networks for
successive time slices by selecting the relevant nodes and edges, the
mesoscopic structure of each of these slices is found independently and the
structures are connected to obtain a temporal description. By using an optimal
structural description at each time slice, this method avoids the inertia of
the aggregated approach. The inherent fuzziness of the communities leads to
noise and artifacts.
  Here, we present an approach that distinguishes real trends and noise in the
mesoscopic description of data using the continuity of social evolutions. To be
follow the dynamics, we compute partitions for each time slice, but to avoid
transients generated by noise, we modify the community description at time t
using the structures found at times t-1 and t+1. We show the relevance of our
method on the analysis of a scientific network showing the birth of a new
subfield, wavelet analysis.

accuracy and efficiency. The points in this tradeoff space are determined,
among other factors, by different data types but also evaluation orders. To put
it simply, the shorter a precision's bit-length, the larger the roundoff error
will be, but the faster the program will run. Similarly, the fewer arithmetic
operations the program performs, the faster it will run; however, the effect on
the roundoff error is less clear-cut. Manually optimizing the efficiency of
finite-precision programs while ensuring that results remain accurate enough is
challenging. The unintuitive and discrete nature of finite-precision makes
estimation of roundoff errors difficult; furthermore the space of possible data
types and evaluation orders is prohibitively large. We present the first fully
automated and sound technique and tool for optimizing the performance of
floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic kernels. Our technique combines
rewriting and mixed-precision tuning. Rewriting searches through different
evaluation orders to find one which minimizes the roundoff error at no
additional runtime cost. Mixed-precision tuning assigns different finite
precisions to different variables and operations and thus provides
finer-grained control than uniform precision. We show that when these two

relative to the value's magnitude, are thus preferable. While today's tools do

continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), the typically large populations of
species cause combinatorially large state spaces. This makes the analysis very
difficult in practice and represents the major bottleneck for the applicability
of minimization techniques based, for instance, on lumpability. In this paper
we present syntactic Markovian bisimulation (SMB), a notion of bisimulation
developed in the Larsen-Skou style of probabilistic bisimulation, defined over
the structure of a CRN rather than over its underlying CTMC. SMB identifies a
lumpable partition of the CTMC state space a priori, in the sense that it is an
equivalence relation over species implying that two CTMC states are lumpable
when they are invariant with respect to the total population of species within
the same equivalence class. We develop an efficient partition-refinement
algorithm which computes the largest SMB of a CRN in polynomial time in the
number of species and reactions. We also provide an algorithm for obtaining a
quotient network from an SMB that induces the lumped CTMC directly, thus
avoiding the generation of the state space of the original CRN altogether. In
practice, we show that SMB allows significant reductions in a number of models
from the literature. Finally, we study SMB with respect to the deterministic
semantics of CRNs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where each
equation gives the time-course evolution of the concentration of a species. SMB
implies forward CRN bisimulation, a recently developed behavioral notion of
equivalence for the ODE semantics, in an analogous sense: it yields a smaller
ODE system that keeps track of the sums of the solutions for equivalent
species.

that none of the known JFCs require tensile strength larger than 10-25 Pa to
remain stable against rotational instabilities. We find evidence for an
increasing linear phase function coefficient with increasing geometric albedo.

stress peak at the yield point and then reaches a constant steady state. The
stress overshoot has a non-monotonic dependence with Peclet number, Pe, and
volume fraction, {\phi}, determined by the available free volume and a
competition between structural relaxation and shear advection. Examination of
the structural properties under shear revealed an increasing anisotropic radial
distribution function, g(r), mostly in the velocity - gradient (xy) plane,
which decreases after the stress peak with considerable anisotropy remaining in
the steady-state. Low rates minimally distort the structure, while high rates
show distortion with signatures of transient elongation. As a mechanism of
storing energy, particles are trapped within a cage distorted more than
Brownian relaxation allows, while at larger strains, stresses are relaxed as
particles are forced out of the cage due to advection. Even in the steady
state, intermediate super diffusion is observed at high rates and is a
signature of the continuous breaking and reformation of cages under shear.

observatories for far infra-red, submillimeter wave (THz), and millimeter wave
astronomy. With increasing array size, it is increasingly important to control
stray radiation inside the detector chips themselves, the surface wave. We
demonstrate this effect with focal plane arrays of 880 lens-antenna coupled
Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). Presented here are near field
measurements of the MKID optical response versus the position on the array of a
reimaged optical source. We demonstrate that the optical response of a detector
in these arrays saturates off-pixel at the $\sim-30$ dB level compared to the
peak pixel response. The result is that the power detected from a point source
at the pixel position is almost identical to the stray response integrated over
the chip area. With such a contribution, it would be impossible to measure
extended sources, while the point source sensitivity is degraded due to an
increase of the stray loading. However, we show that by incorporating an
on-chip stray light absorber, the surface wave contribution is reduced by a
factor $>$10. With the on-chip stray light absorber the point source response
is close to simulations down to the $\sim-35$ dB level, the simulation based on
an ideal Gaussian illumination of the optics. In addition, as a crosscheck we
show that the extended source response of a single pixel in the array with the
absorbing grid is in agreement with the integral of the point source
measurements.

databases with colluding servers and adversaries is studied. Specifically, the
database comprises $K$ files, which are replicatively stored among $N$ servers.
A user wants to retrieve one file from the database by communicating with the
$N$ servers, without revealing the identity of the desired file to any server.
Furthermore, the user shall learn nothing about the other $K-1$ files. Any $T$
out of $N$ servers may collude, that is, they may communicate their
interactions with the user to guess the identity of the requested file. An
adversary in the system can tap in on or even try to corrupt the communication.
Three types of adversaries are considered: a Byzantine adversary who can
overwrite the transmission of any $B$ servers to the user; a passive
eavesdropper who can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any
$E$ servers; and a combination of both -- an adversary who can tap in on a set
of any $E$ nodes, and overwrite the transmission of a set of any $B$ nodes. The
problems of SPIR with colluding servers and the three types of adversaries are
named T-BSPIR, T-ESPIR and T-BESPIR respectively. The capacity of the problem
is defined as the maximum number of information bits of the desired file
retrieved per downloaded bit. We show that the information-theoretical capacity
of T-BSPIR equals $1-\frac{2B+T}{N}$, if the servers share common randomness
(unavailable at the user) with amount at least $\frac{2B+T}{N-2B-T}$ times the
file size. Otherwise, the capacity equals zero. The capacity of T-ESPIR is
proved to equal $1-\frac{\max(T,E)}{N}$, with common randomness at least
$\frac{\max(T,E)}{N-\max(T,E)}$ times the file size. Finally, the capacity of
T-BESPIR is proved to be $1-\frac{2B+\max(T,E)}{N}$, with common randomness at
least $\frac{2B+\max(T,E)}{N-2B-\max(T,E)}$ times the file size.

become of increased importance. At such small scales, viscous forces dominate
and inertial effects are often negligible. Considering Stokes flow, a numerical
method based on a boundary integral formulation is presented for simulating 3D
drops covered by an insoluble surfactant. The method is able to simulate drops
with different viscosities and close interactions, automatically controlling
the time step size and maintaining high accuracy also when substantial drop
deformation appears. To achieve this, the drop surfaces as well as the
surfactant concentration on each surface are represented by spherical harmonics
expansions. A novel reparameterization method is introduced to ensure a
high-quality representation of the drops also under deformation, specialized
quadrature methods for singular and nearly singular integrals that appear in

predict the click-through rate of a query-advertisement pair. Specially, the
proposed architectures only consider the textual content appearing in a
query-advertisement pair as input, and produce as output a click-through rate

we show that language representation can be learnt from scratch at character

demonstrate that both approaches significantly outperform a baseline model

principle, it can be adapted in a more general setting. As concrete examples,
we choose two applications. First, we incorporate REDO in optimal quantum
control algorithms and report a speed-up of several folds over a wide range of
system size. Secondly, we propose REDO for numerical simulations of quantum
dynamics. In particular, we study exotic quantum freezing with noisy drive

GF($2$), an $L$-dimensional circular-shift linear code of degree $\delta$
restricts its local encoding kernels to be the summation of at most $\delta$
cyclic permutation matrices of size $L$. We show that on a general network, for
a certain block length $L$, every scalar linear solution over GF($2^{L-1}$) can
induce an $L$-dimensional circular-shift linear solution with 1-bit redundancy
per-edge transmission. Consequently, specific to a multicast network, such a
circular-shift linear solution of an arbitrary degree $\delta$ can be
efficiently constructed, which has an interesting complexity tradeoff between
encoding and decoding with different choices of $\delta$. By further proving
that circular-shift LNC is insufficient to achieve the exact capacity of
certain multicast networks, we show the optimality of the efficiently

imply that with increasing $L$, a randomly constructed circular-shift linear

temperature behaviour of lattice gauge theories. They are much simpler to
simulate than the original lattice model and are affected by a milder sign
problem, but it is not clear to which extent they really capture the rich
spectrum of the original theories. We propose here a simple way to address this
issue based on the so called second moment correlation length $\xi_{2nd}$. The
ratio $\xi/\xi_{2nd}$ between the exponential correlation length and the second
moment one is equal to 1 if only a single mass is present in the spectrum, and
it becomes larger and larger as the complexity of the spectrum increases. Since
both $\xi$ and $\xi_{2nd}$ are easy to measure on the lattice, this is a cheap
and efficient way to keep track of the spectrum of the theory. As an example of
the information one can obtain with this tool we study the behaviour of
$\xi/\xi_{2nd}$ in the confining phase of the ($D=3+1$) $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge
theory and show that it is compatible with 1 near the deconfinement transition,
but it increases dramatically as the temperature decreases. We also show that
this increase can be well understood in the framework of an effective string
description of the Polyakov loop correlator. This non-trivial behaviour should
be reproduced by the Polyakov loop effective action; thus, it represents a
stringent and challenging test of existing proposals and it may be used to
fine-tune the couplings and to identify the range of validity of the
approximations involved in their construction.

erosion. So far it has not been possible to infer the occurrence frequency of
stellar CMEs from observations. Based on their close relation with flares on
the Sun, we develop an empirical model combining solar flare-CME relationships
with stellar flare rates to estimate the CME activity of young Sun-like and
late-type main-sequence stars. By comparison of the obtained CME mass-loss
rates with observations of total mass-loss rates, we find that our modeled
rates may exceed those from observations by orders of magnitude for the most
active stars. This reveals a possible limit to the extrapolation of such models
to the youngest stars. We find that the most uncertain component in the model
is the flare-CME association rate adopted from the Sun, which does not properly
account for the likely stronger coronal confinement in active stars. Simple
estimates of this effect reveal a possible suppression of CME rates by several
orders of magnitude for young stars, indicating that this issue should be
addressed in more detail in the future.

rapid, then the dynamical effect of torques that are fixed relative to the
grain body can be greatly reduced. To date, detailed studies of Barnett
relaxation have been confined to grains exhibiting dynamic symmetry. In 2003,
Weingartner argued that internal relaxation cannot induce flips in any grains,
whether they exhibit dynamic symmetry or not. In this work, we develop
approximate expressions for the dissipation rate and diffusion coefficient for
Barnett relaxation. We revisit the issue of internally induced thermal
flipping, finding that it cannot occur for grains with dynamic symmetry but

binary system HAT-P-4, by studying abundance vs condensation temperature Tc
trends. The star HAT-P-4 hosts a planet detected by transits while its stellar
companion does not have any detected planet. We also study the Lithium content,
which could shed light on the problem of Li depletion in exoplanet host stars.
Conclusions. The exoplanet host star HAT-P-4 is found to be ~0.1 dex more metal
rich than its companion, which is one of the highest differences in metallicity
observed in similar systems. This could have important implications for
chemical tagging studies, disentangling groups of stars with a common origin.
We rule out a possible peculiar composition for each star as lambda Boo, delta
Scuti or a Blue Straggler. The star HAT-P-4 is enhanced in refractory elements
relative to volatile when compared to its stellar companion. Notably, the
Lithium abundance in HAT-P-4 is greater than in its companion by ~0.3 dex,
which is contrary to the model that explains the Lithium depletion by the
presence of planets. We propose a scenario where, at the time of planet
formation, the star HAT-P-4 locked the inner refractory material in
planetesimals and rocky planets, and formed the outer gas giant planet at a
greater distance. The refractories were then accreted onto the star, possibly
due to the migration of the giant planet. This explains the higher metallicity,
the higher Lithium content, and the negative Tc trend detected. A similar
scenario was recently proposed for the solar twin star HIP 68468, which is in
some aspects similar to HAT-P-4. We estimate a mass of at least Mrock ~ 10
Mearth locked in refractory material in order to reproduce the observed Tc
trends and metallicity.

the planned visits, leading to incomplete response sequences. When the
probability of non-response, conditional on the available covariates and the
observed responses, still depends on unobserved outcomes, the dropout mechanism
is said to be non ignorable. A common objective is to build a reliable
association structure to account for dependence between the longitudinal and
the dropout processes. Starting from the existing literature, we introduce a
random coefficient based dropout model where the association between outcomes
is modeled through discrete latent effects. These effects are outcome-specific
and account for heterogeneity in the univariate profiles. Dependence between
profiles is introduced by using a bi-dimensional representation for the
corresponding distribution. In this way, we define a flexible latent class
structure which allows to efficiently describe both dependence within the two
margins of interest and dependence between them. By using this representation
we show that, unlike standard (unidimensional) finite mixture models, the non
ignorable dropout model properly nests its ignorable counterpart. We detail the
proposed modeling approach by analyzing data from a longitudinal study on the
dynamics of cognitive functioning in the elderly. Further, the effects of
assumptions about non ignorability of the dropout process on model parameter
estimates are (locally) investigated using the index of (local) sensitivity to
non-ignorability.

due to Browkin (2015) who, in case $3$ is a primitive root modulo $q,$
conjectured that the only values assumed by $D_q(n)$ are powers of $2$ and of

establishing a conjecture of Salajan. For a fixed prime $q$ their approach is
easily generalized, but requires some innovations in order to deal with all

primes play a special role in this.

describing numerous cascading phenomena, such as neural firing or social
contagion, threshold models have never been explicitly addressed on weighted
networks. We fill this gap by studying a dynamical threshold model over
synthetic and real weighted networks with numerical and analytical tools. We
show that the time of cascade emergence depends non-monotonously on weight
heterogeneities, which accelerate or decelerate the dynamics, and lead to
non-trivial parameter spaces for various networks and weight distributions. Our
methodology applies to arbitrary binary state processes and link properties,
and may prove instrumental in understanding the role of edge heterogeneities in

ask whether the accumulation of knowledge and capabilities related to a

productive efficiency. To this end, we analyzed both the balance sheets and the
patenting activity of about 70 thousand firms that have filed at least one
patent over the period 2004-2013. From this database it is possible to define a
measure of the firms' coherent diversification, based on the network of
technological fields, and relate it to the firms' perfomance in terms of labor
productivity. Such a measure favors companies with a diversification structure
comprising blocks of closely related fields over firms with the same breadth of

coherent diversification of firms is quantitatively related to their economic
performance and captures relevant information about their productive structure.

size and coherent diversification. This approach can be used to investigate
possible synergies within firms and to recommend viable partners for merging

neutral He atoms and He+ ions operate everywhere between the heliopause and a
distant source region in the local interstellar cloud, where the neutral and
charged components are in thermal equilibrium. We simulated several test cases
of the plasma flow within the outer heliosheath and investigated the signal
generation for plasma flows both in the absence and in the presence of the
interstellar magnetic field. We found that a signal in the portion of IBEX data
identified as due to the Warm Breeze does not arise when a homogeneous plasma
flow in front of the heliopause is assumed, but it appears immediately when any
reasonable disturbance in its flow due to the presence of the heliosphere is
assumed. We obtained a good qualitative agreement between the data selected for
comparison and the simulations for a model flow with the velocity vector of the
unperturbed gas and the direction and intensity of magnetic field adopted from
recent determinations. We conclude that direct-sampling observations of neutral
He atoms at 1~AU from the Sun are a sensitive tool for investigating the flow
of interstellar matter in the outer heliosheath, that the Warm Breeze is indeed
the secondary population of interstellar helium, as it was hypothesized
earlier, and that the WB signal is consistent with the heliosphere distorted
from axial symmetry by the interstellar magnetic field.

proposed where joint compression and denoising can be done using a VQ-based
multi-layer network. While it learns to compress the images from a training
set, the compression performance is very well generalized on images from a test
set. Moreover, when fed with noisy versions of the test set, since it has
priors from clean images, the network also efficiently denoises the test images
during the reconstruction. The proposed framework is a regularized version of
the Residual Quantization (RQ) where at each stage, the quantization error from
the previous stage is further quantized. Instead of codebook learning from the
k-means which over-trains for high-dimensional vectors, we show that only
generating the codewords from a random, but properly regularized distribution
suffices to compress the images globally and without the need to resort to
patch-based division of images. The experiments are done on the
\textit{CroppedYale-B} set of facial images and the method is compared with the
JPEG-2000 codec for compression and BM3D for denoising, showing promising
results.

role in the definition of intellectual landscapes. We introduce four indicators
in order to map the structural role played by core sources into connecting
different areas of the intellectual landscape of citing publications (i.e.
communities in the bibliographic coupling network). All indicators factor out
the influence of degree distributions by internalizing a null configuration
model. By considering several datasets focused on history, we show that two
distinct structural actions are performed by the core literature: a global one,
by connecting otherwise separated communities in the landscape, or a local one,
by rising connectivity within communities. In our study, the global action is
mainly performed by small sets of scholarly monographs, reference works and
primary sources, while the rest of the core, and especially most journal
articles, acts mostly locally.

highly heterogeneous and weak gels. Shearing the gel to even lower strain
amplitudes creates a less heterogonous stronger solid. These three regimes of
shearing are connected to the microscopic shear-induced structural
heterogeneity. A comparison with steady shear flow reveals that the latter does
not produce structural heterogeneities as large as oscillatory shear. Therefore
oscillatory shear is a much more efficient way of tuning the mechanical
properties of colloidal gels. Moreover, colloidal gels presheared at large

introduce singular functions which are constructed in terms of nuclei of strain

singular functions. As a consequence of the characterization, we are able to
regain the existing upper bound on the blow-up rate of the gradient, namely,
$\epsilon^{-1/2}$ where $\epsilon$ is the distance between two inclusions. We
then show that it is in fact an optimal bound by showing that there are cases

the Lam\'{e} system with hard inclusions. The singular functions introduced in

decomposition of a complex is a collection of regions indexing the complex's

reconstruct the star of its vertices, i.e., the cells incident in the region's
vertices. Stellar decompositions are general in that they can compactly
represent and efficiently traverse arbitrary complexes with a manifold or
non-manifold domain. They are scalable to complexes in high dimension and of
large size, and they enable users to easily construct tailored
application-dependent data structures using a fraction of the memory required
by a corresponding global topological data structure on the complex. As a
concrete realization of this model for spatially embedded complexes, we
introduce the Stellar tree, which combines a nested spatial tree with a simple
tuning parameter to control the number of vertices in a region. Stellar trees
exploit the complex's spatial locality by reordering vertex and cell indices

focusing case, it presents a chess board pattern, with a difference of $\pi$
between neighboring sites. We show that the lowest lying perturbative
excitations can be described as perturbations of the phase and that
finite-sized structures can act as tunable metawaveguides for them. The tuning
is made by varying the intensity of the light that, because of the

the effect of a risk factor on an outcome. With fine-mapped genetic data, there
may be hundreds of genetic variants in a single gene region any of which could
be used to assess this causal relationship. However, using too many genetic
variants in the analysis can lead to spurious estimates and inflated Type 1
error rates. But if only a few genetic variants are used, then the majority of
the data is ignored and estimates are highly sensitive to the particular choice
of variants. We propose an approach based on summarized data only (genetic
association and correlation estimates) that uses principal components analysis
to form instruments. This approach has desirable theoretical properties: it
takes the totality of data into account and does not suffer from numerical
instabilities. It also has good properties in simulation studies: it is not
particularly sensitive to varying the genetic variants included in the analysis
or the genetic correlation matrix, and it does not have greatly inflated Type 1
error rates. Overall, the method gives estimates that are not so precise as
those from variable selection approaches (such as using a conditional analysis
or pruning approach to select variants), but are more robust to seemingly
arbitrary choices in the variable selection step. Methods are illustrated by an
example using genetic associations with testosterone for 320 genetic variants
to assess the effect of sex hormone-related pathways on coronary artery disease
risk, in which variable selection approaches give inconsistent inferences.

properties based on surface modification. The bond structure of pristine PDMS
films and plasma treated PDMS films differ in a particular region of silicate
bonds. We have studied the surface physical properties of pristine PDMS films
and plasma treated PDMS films through optical technique. It is already known
that plasma treated PDMS films forms very thin SiO2 layer on its surface. Due
to difference in coefficient of thermal expansion of the surface SiO2 and the
remaining bulk layer, the SiO2 layer develops cracks. These formations are
explored to characterize PDMS surface by observing intensity of scattered light
while the films are stretched. Pristine PDMS films do not show such optical
scattering. Further the intensity measurements were repeated over period of
time to monitor surface properties with time. It was observed that plasma
treated PDMS film; the scattered light intensity is linearly dependent on the
applied force for stretching. After a substantial time, scattering intensity is
reduced to the value which is almost equal to that of pristine PDMS surface. It
is proposed that basic light scattering through plasma treated PDMS occurs due
to the decrease in the width of the cracks when the PDMS film is stretched. The
change in the scattering property of plasma treated PDMS surface over time
could be attributed to healing of cracks by the migration of polymer chain
molecules from the bulk to the surface. It is also reported that with reference
to various bonds present on surface plasma treated PDMS surface regains its
original properties as that of pristine PDMS with time. Therefore the optical
technique could be employed to study surface characteristics of PDMS surface as
an alternative approach to conventional spectroscopic techniques.

telescopes, scatter at small incident angles, and deposit energy on the

extreme cases, damaging the X-ray detector. A correct modelization of the
physics process responsible for the grazing angle scattering processes is
mandatory to evaluate the impact of such events on the performance of future
X-ray telescopes as the ESA ATHENA mission. For the first time the Remizovich
model, in the approximation of no energy losses, is implemented top of the
Geant4 release 10.2. Both the new scattering physics and the built-in Coulomb
scattering are used to reproduce the latest experimental results on grazing
angle proton scattering. At 250 keV multiple scattering delivers large proton
angles and it is not consistent with the observation. Among the tested models,
the single scattering seems to better reproduce the scattering efficiency at
the three energies but energy loss obtained at small scattering angles is
significantly lower than the experimental values. In general, the energy losses
obtained in the experiment are higher than what obtained by the simulation. The
experimental data are not completely representative of the soft proton
scattering experienced by current X-ray telescopes because of the lack of
measurements at low energies (< 200 keV) and small reflection angles, so we are
not able to address any of the tested models as the one that can certainly
reproduce the scattering behavior of low energy protons expected for the ATHENA
mission. We can, however, discard multiple scattering as the model able to
reproduce soft proton funneling, and affirm that Coulomb single scattering can
represent, until further measurements, the best approximation of the proton

in an interference-limited communication scenario. We are motivated by the
observation that in a cellular network, a relay node placed at the cell edge
observes a combination of intended signal and inter-cell interference that is
correlated with the received signal at a nearby destination, so a relaying link
can effectively allow the antennas at the relay and at the destination to be
pooled together for both signal enhancement and interference mitigation. We
model this scenario by a MIMO Gaussian relay channel with a digital
relay-to-destination link of finite capacity, and with correlated noise across
the relay and destination antennas. Assuming a compress-and-forward strategy
with Gaussian input distribution and quantization noise, we propose a
coordinate ascent algorithm for obtaining a stationary point of the non-convex
joint optimization of the transmit and quantization covariance matrices. For
fixed input distribution, the globally optimum quantization noise covariance
matrix can be found in closed-form using a transformation of the relay's
observation that simultaneously diagonalizes two conditional covariance
matrices by congruence. For fixed quantization, the globally optimum transmit
covariance matrix can be found via convex optimization. This paper further
shows that such an optimized achievable rate is within a constant additive gap
of the MIMO relay channel capacity. The optimal structure of the quantization
noise covariance enables a characterization of the slope of the achievable rate
as a function of the relay-to-destination link capacity. Moreover, this paper
shows that the improvement in spatial degrees of freedom by MIMO relaying in
the presence of noise correlation is related to the aforementioned slope via a
connection to the deterministic relay channel.

the low frequency (LF) QPOs in Fourier power spectra. We demonstrate that the

signal from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) is likely to be limited by
systematic effects associated with removing foreground sources from target
fields. In this paper we develop a model for the compact foreground sources in
one of the target fields of the MWA's EoR key science experiment: the `EoR1'
field. The model is based on both the MWA's GLEAM survey and GMRT 150 MHz data
from the TGSS survey, the latter providing higher angular resolution and better
astrometric accuracy for compact sources than is available from the MWA alone.
The model contains 5049 sources, some of which have complicated morphology in
MWA data, Fornax A being the most complex. The higher resolution data show that
13% of sources that appear point-like to the MWA have complicated morphology
such as double and quad structure, with a typical separation of 33~arcsec. We
derive an analytic expression for the error introduced into the EoR
two-dimensional power spectrum due to peeling close double sources as single
point sources and show that for the measured source properties, the error in
the power spectrum is confined to high $k_\bot$ modes that do not affect the
overall result for the large-scale cosmological signal of interest. The
brightest ten mis-modelled sources in the field contribute 90% of the power
bias in the data, suggesting that it is most critical to improve the models of
the brightest sources. With this hybrid model we reprocess data from the EoR1
field and show a maximum of 8% improved calibration accuracy and a factor of
two reduction in residual power in $k$-space from peeling these sources.
Implications for future EoR experiments including the SKA are discussed in
relation to the improvements obtained.

unconstrained in-field conditions, intrinsic and extrinsic variations in the

beyond the ability of conventional image processing techniques. This calls for
further robust computer vision approaches to address in-field variations. This
paper studies the in-field counting problem of maize tassels. To our knowledge,
this is the first time that a plant-related counting problem is considered

type I radio storms associated with the strong magnetic field of active
regions. The measured brightness temperature of the type I storms can be up to
$10^{10}$ K for continuum emission, and can exceed $10^{11}$ K for type I

propose the model with the imbalanced turbulence of kinetic-scale Alfv\'en
waves producing an asymmetric quasilinear plateau on the upward half of the
electron velocity distribution. The Landau damping of resonant Langmuir waves
is suppressed and their amplitudes grow spontaneously above the thermal level.
The estimated saturation level of Langmuir waves is high enough to generate
observed type I radio emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. Harmonic
emission does not appear in our model because the backward-propagating Langmuir
waves undergo a strong Landau damping. Our model predicts $100\%$ polarization

valence band structure of the solid, can explain the appearance of GUE
statistics if the magnetic field is not oriented in one of the symmetry planes
of the cubic lattice. However, it cannot explain the experimental observation
of GUE statistics for all orientations of the field. In this paper we
investigate the effect of quasi-particle interactions or especially the
exciton-phonon interaction on the level statistics of magnetoexcitons and show
that the motional Stark field induced by the exciton-phonon interaction leads
to the occurrence of GUE statistics for arbitrary orientations of the magnetic

all antiunitary symmetries can be explained only by considering both the
exciton-phonon interaction and the cubic crystal lattice.

for materials with arbitrary frequency-dependent dielectric functions. The
method is able to calculate the complex wave vector for a given frequency by
solving the eigenvalue problem with a non-Hermitian operator. The analogy with
$\cal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians reveals that the operator corresponds to the
momentum as a physical quantity and the singularities at the band edges are
related to the branch points and responses for the features on the band edges.
The method is realized using plane wave expansion technique for two-dimensional
periodical structure in the case of TE- and TM-polarization. We illustrate the
applicability of the method by calculation of the photonic band diagrams of an
infinite two-dimension square lattice composed of dielectric cylinders using
the measured frequency dependent dielectric functions of different materials
(amorphous hydrogenated carbon, silicon, and chalcogenide glass). We show that
the method allows to distinguish unambiguously between Bragg and Mie gaps in
the spectra.

detection of a random source in a dense sensor network. When the sensors are
densely deployed, observations at adjacent sensors are highly correlated while
those corresponding to distant sensors are less correlated. Thus, the
covariance matrix of the concatenated observation vector of all the sensors at
any given time can be sparse where the sparse structure depends on the network
topology and the correlation model. Exploiting the sparsity structure of the
covariance matrix, we develop a robust nonparametric detector to detect the
presence of the random event using a compressed version of the data collected
at the distributed nodes. We employ the multiple access channel (MAC) model
with distributed random projections for sensors to transmit observations so
that a compressed version of the observations is available at the fusion
center. Detection is performed by constructing a decision statistic based on
the covariance information of uncompressed data which is estimated using
compressed data. The proposed approach does not require any knowledge of the
noise parameter to set the threshold, and is also robust when the distributed
random projection matrices become sparse.
