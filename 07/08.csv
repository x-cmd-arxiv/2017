optical tissue contrast with high ultrasound resolution. Direct reconstruction
methods such as filtered backprojection, time reversal and least squares suffer
from curved line artefacts and blurring, especially in case of limited angles
or strong noise. In recent years, there has been great interest in regularised
iterative methods. These methods employ prior knowledge on the image to provide
higher quality reconstructions. However, easy comparisons between regularisers
and their properties are limited, since many tomography implementations heavily
rely on the specific regulariser chosen. To overcome this bottleneck, we
present a modular reconstruction framework for photoacoustic tomography. It
enables easy comparisons between regularisers with different properties, e.g.
nonlinear, higher-order or directional. We solve the underlying minimisation
problem with an efficient first-order primal-dual algorithm. Convergence rates
are optimised by choosing an operator dependent preconditioning strategy. Our
reconstruction methods are tested on challenging 2D synthetic and experimental
data sets. They outperform direct reconstruction approaches for strong noise
levels and limited angle measurements, offering immediate benefits in terms of
acquisition time and quality. This work provides a basic platform for the
investigation of future advanced regularisation methods in photoacoustic
tomography.

regulates the delivery of insulin for the control of Type I diabetes. Our AP
controller operates in a fully automated fashion, without requiring any manual

obstacle to achieving closed-loop insulin control is the uncertainty in those
aspects of a patient's daily behavior that significantly affect blood glucose,
especially in relation to meals and physical activity. To handle such
uncertainties, we develop a data-driven robust model-predictive control
framework, where we capture a wide range of individual meal and exercise
patterns using uncertainty sets learned from historical data. These sets are
then used in the controller and state estimator to achieve automated, precise,
and personalized insulin therapy. We provide an extensive in silico evaluation
of our robust AP design, demonstrating the potential of this approach, without
explicit meal announcements, to support high carbohydrate disturbances and to
regulate glucose levels in large clusters of virtual patients learned from
population-wide survey data.

Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect in detecting hot baryons out to the galaxy

clusters to more distant objects, we developed a parametric method that models
the spectral energy distribution and spatial anisotropies of both the Galactic
thermal dust and the Cosmic Microwave Background, that are mixed-up with the
cluster SZ and dust signals. Taking advantage of the best angular resolution of
the High Frequency Instrument channels (5 arcmin) and using X-ray priors in the
innermost cluster regions that are not resolved with Planck, this modelling
allowed us to analyze a sample of 61 nearby members of the Planck catalog of SZ
sources ($0 < z < 0.5$, $\tilde{z} = 0.15$) using the full mission data, as
well as to examine a distant sample of 23 clusters ($0.5 < z < 1$, $\tilde{z} =
0.56$) that have been recently followed-up with XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations. We find that (i) the average shape of the mass-scaled pressure
profiles agrees with results obtained by the Planck collaboration in the nearby
cluster sample, and that (ii) no sign of evolution is discernible between
averaged pressure profiles of the low- and high-redshift cluster samples. In
line with theoretical predictions for these halo masses and redshift ranges,
the dispersion of individual profiles relative to a self-similar shape stays
well below 10 % inside $r_{500}$ but increases in the cluster outskirts.

over a broad range of redshifts. By exploiting the non-Gaussian imprints of
lensing in the polarization of the CMB, the CORE mission can produce a clean
map of the lensing deflections over nearly the full-sky. The number of high-S/N
modes in this map will exceed current CMB lensing maps by a factor of 40, and
the measurement will be sample-variance limited on all scales where linear
theory is valid. Here, we summarise this mission product and discuss the
science that it will enable. For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will be
determined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point
information with contemporaneous BAO measurements, three times smaller than the
minimum total mass allowed by neutrino oscillations. In the search for B-mode
polarization from primordial gravitational waves with CORE, lens-induced
B-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the
gravitational wave power spectrum amplitude. With lensing reconstructed by
CORE, one can ""delens"" the observed polarization internally, reducing the
lensing B-mode power by 60%. This improves to 70% by combining lensing and CIB
measurements from CORE, reducing the error on the gravitational wave amplitude
by 2.5 compared to no delensing (in the null hypothesis). Lensing measurements
from CORE will allow calibration of the halo masses of the 40000 galaxy
clusters that it will find, with constraints dominated by the clean
polarization-based estimators. CORE can accurately remove Galactic emission
from CMB maps with its 19 frequency channels. We present initial findings that
show that residual Galactic foreground contamination will not be a significant

VLA4A shows compact dust emission suggestive of a disk < 50 au, and is the hot

from VLA4B and reveal the jet variable velocity structure. This jet exhibits ~
3"" wiggling consistent with orbital motion around a yet undetected ~ 20-30 au
companion to VLA4B, or jet precession. Jet wiggling combined with velocity
variability can explain the large apparent angular momentum in CO bullets. We
also uncover a synchronicity between CO jet bullets and knots in the HH7-11
chain demonstrating that they trace two distinct jets. Their ~ 300 yr twin
outburst period may be triggered by close perihelion approach of VLA4A in an
eccentric orbit around VLA4B. A third jet is tentatively seen at PA ~ 0

external triggering by close binary interactions, a scenario also invoked for

$\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ paradigm with testable predictions at the level of its
self-accelerating solutions for the expansion history, as well as large-scale
structure formation. Here, we place constraints on the full parameter space of
these models using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) (including
lensing), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect. We pay special attention to the ISW effect for which we use the
cross-spectra, $C_\ell^{\rm T g}$, of CMB temperature maps and foreground
galaxies from the WISE survey. The sign of $C_\ell^{\rm T g}$ is set by the
time evolution of the lensing potential in the redshift range of the galaxy
sample: it is positive if the potential decays (like in $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$),
negative if it deepens. We constrain three subsets of Galileon gravity
separately known as the Cubic, Quartic and Quintic Galileons. The cubic
Galileon model predicts a negative $C_\ell^{\rm T g}$ and exhibits a
$7.8\sigma$ tension with the data, which effectively rules it out. For the
quartic and quintic models the ISW data also rule out a significant region of
the parameter space but permit regions where the goodness-of-fit is comparable
to $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$. The data prefers a non zero sum of the neutrino masses
($\sum m_\nu\approx 0.5$eV) with $ \sim \! 5\sigma$ significance in these
models. The best-fitting models have values of $H_0$ consistent with local
determinations, thereby avoiding the tension that exists in $\Lambda {\rm
CDM}$. We also identify and discuss a $\sim \! 2\sigma$ tension that Galileon
gravity exhibits with recent BAO measurements. Our analysis shows overall that
Galileon cosmologies cannot be ruled out by current data but future lensing,
BAO and ISW data hold strong potential to do so.

publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of
improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for
research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within
the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for
key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes
articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its
rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality,
documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article
contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software,
references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point
of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts.
Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and
authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not
reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles
remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or
withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS
gives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin
collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services.

biological cells, star polymers, dendrimes, and microgels, depend on the
applied stresses as the particles are extremely soft. In high-density
suspensions these particles deform as stressed by their neighbors, which
implies that the interparticle interaction becomes of many-body type.
Investigating a two-dimensional model of cell tissue, where the single particle
shear modulus is related to the cell adhesion strength, here we show that the
particle deformability affects the melting scenario. On increasing the
temperature, stiff particles undergo a first-order solid/liquid transition,
while soft ones undergo a continuous solid/hexatic transition followed by a
discontinuous hexatic/liquid transition. At zero temperature the melting
transition driven by the decrease of the adhesion strength occurs through two
continuous transitions as in the Kosterlitz, Thouless, Halperin, Nelson, and
Young scenario. Thus, there is a range of adhesion strength values where the
hexatic phase is stable at zero temperature, which suggests that the
intermediate phase of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition could be hexatic
type.

attractive alternative to traditional pipelined approaches. However, end-to-end
methods tend to either be slow to train, exhibit little or no generalisability,
or lack the ability to accomplish long-horizon or multi-stage tasks. In this
paper, we show how two simple techniques can lead to end-to-end (image to
velocity) execution of a multi-stage task, which is analogous to a simple
tidying routine, without having seen a single real image. This involves
locating, reaching for, and grasping a cube, then locating a basket and
dropping the cube inside. To achieve this, robot trajectories are computed in a
simulator, to collect a series of control velocities which accomplish the task.
Then, a CNN is trained to map observed images to velocities, using domain
randomisation to enable generalisation to real world images. Results show that
we are able to successfully accomplish the task in the real world with the
ability to generalise to novel environments, including those with dynamic
lighting conditions, distractor objects, and moving objects, including the
basket itself. We believe our approach to be simple, highly scalable, and
capable of learning long-horizon tasks that have until now not been shown with
the state-of-the-art in end-to-end robot control.

  As an improvement upon our previous work (arXiv:1608.04896, to appear in J.
Convex Anal.), we show that under either a constraint of fixed perimeter or
area, the maximiser within the class of exteriors of simply connected planar
sets is always the exterior of a disk, without the need of convexity
assumption. Moreover, we generalise the result to disconnected compact planar
sets. Namely, we prove that under a constraint of fixed average value of the
perimeter over all the connected components, the maximiser within the class of
disconnected compact planar sets, consisting of finitely many simply connected
components, is again a disk.
  In higher dimensions, we prove a completely new result that the lowest point
in the spectrum is maximised by the exterior of a ball among all sets exterior
to bounded convex sets satisfying a constraint on the integral of a dimensional
power of the mean curvature of their boundaries. Furthermore, it follows that
the critical coupling at which the lowest point in the spectrum becomes a
discrete eigenvalue emerging from the essential spectrum is minimised under the
same constraint by the critical coupling for the exterior of a ball.

equation can be further reduced to an Abel equation. Two interesting regular
solutions correspond to a stationary traversable wormhole (whose only

Luminous core-S\'ersic galaxies contain depleted cores---with sizes (R_b)

binaries. We fit a (double nucleus) + (spheroid) + (intermediate-scale
component) + (stellar halo) model to the HST surface brightness profile of IC
1101, finding the largest core size measured in any galaxy to date. This core
is an order of magnitude larger than those typically measured for core-S\'ersic
galaxies. We find that the spheroid's V-band absolute magnitude (M_V) of -23.8
mag (~ 25% of the total galaxy light, i.e., including the stellar halo) is
faint for the large R_b, such that the observed core is 1.02 dex ~ 3.4 sigma_s
(rms scatter) larger than that estimated from the R_ b -M_V relation. The
suspected scouring process has produced a large stellar mass deficit (M_def) ~
4.9 X 10^11 M_sun, i.e., a luminosity deficit ~ 28% of the spheroid's
luminosity prior to the depletion. Using IC 1101's black hole mass (M_BH)
estimated from the M_BH-$\sigma$, M_BH-L and M_BH-M_* relations, we measure an
excessive and unrealistically high number of dry major mergers for IC 1101

38-101. The large core, high mass deficit and oversized M_def/M_ BH ratio of IC
1101 suggest that the depleted core was scoured by overmassive SMBH binaries
with a final coalesced mass M_BH ~ (4 -10) X 10^10 M_sun, i.e., ~ (1.7- 3.2) X
sigma_s larger than the black hole masses estimated using the spheroid's

representations of algebraic $Z^d$-actions of the harmonic models. Both models
are determined by so-called simple sandpile polynomials. We extend this result
to arbitrary sandpile polynomials. Moreover, we show that any sandpile model

Both objects have been monitored with AO for the past decade (2003 - 2014) and
are comparatively close to the black hole ($a_{\rm{min}} \sim$200-300 AU) on
very eccentric orbits ($e_{\rm{G1}}\sim$0.99; $e_{\rm{G2}}\sim$0.96). While G2
has been tracked before and during periapse passage ($T_{0} \sim$ 2014.2), G1
has been followed since soon after emerging from periapse ($T_{0} \sim$
2001.3). Our observations of G1 double the previously reported observational
time baseline, which improves its orbital parameter determinations. G1's
orbital trajectory appears to be in the same plane as that of G2, but with a
significantly different argument of periapse ($\Delta\omega$ = 21$\pm$4
degrees). This suggests that G1 is an independent object and not part of a gas
stream containing G2 as has been proposed. Furthermore, we show for the first
time that: (1) G1 is extended in the epochs closest to periapse along the
direction of orbital motion and (2) G1 becomes significantly smaller over time,
(450 AU in 2004 to less than 170 AU in 2009). Based on these observations, G1
appears to be the second example of an object tidally interacting with a SMBH.
G1's existence 14 years after periapse, along with its compactness in epochs
further from the time of periapse, suggest that this source is stellar in
nature.

correcting for beam smearing effects, the median intrinsic velocity dispersion
for the final sample is sigma_0 = 43.2 +/- 0.8 km/s with a rotational velocity

redshift MUSE sample (z~0.5). While there is, at most, a weak trend between
velocity dispersion and stellar mass, at fixed mass there is a strong increase
with redshift. At all redshifts, galaxies appear to follow the same weak trend
of increasing velocity dispersion with star formation rate. Our results are
consistent with an evolution of galaxy dynamics driven by disks that are more
gas rich, and increasingly gravitationally unstable, as a function of
increasing redshift. Finally, we test two analytic models that predict
turbulence is driven by either gravitational instabilities or stellar feedback.
Both provide an adequate description of the data, and further observations are

The model consists of an extension of the Standard Model with one electroweak
singlet fermion and one pair of vector like doublet fermions with
renormalizable couplings to the Higgs. A strong first order phase transition is
radiatively induced by the singlet-doublet fermions, while the origin of the
baryon asymmetry is due to asymmetric reflection of the same set of fermions on
the expanding electroweak bubble wall. The singlet-doublet fermions are
stabilized at the electroweak scale by chiral symmetries and the Higgs
potential is stabilized by threshold corrections coming from a multi-TeV
ultraviolet completion which does not play any significant role in the phase
transition. We work in terms of background symmetry invariants and perform an
analytic semiclassical calculation of the baryon asymmetry, showing that the
model may effectively generate the observed baryon asymmetry for percent level
values of the unique invariant CP violating phase of the singlet-doublet

electroweak precision limits, and for one typical benchmark scenario we also
recast existing collider constraints, showing that the model is consistent with

appearance changes over time. Recently, adaptive correlation filters have been
successfully applied to object tracking. However, tracking algorithms relying
on highly adaptive correlation filters are prone to drift due to noisy updates.
Moreover, as these algorithms do not maintain long-term memory of target
appearance, they cannot recover from tracking failures caused by heavy
occlusion or target disappearance in the camera view. In this paper, we propose
to learn multiple adaptive correlation filters with both long-term and
short-term memory of target appearance for robust object tracking. First, we
learn a kernelized correlation filter with an aggressive learning rate for
locating target objects precisely. We take into account the appropriate size of
surrounding context and the feature representations. Second, we learn a
correlation filter over a feature pyramid centered at the estimated target
position for predicting scale changes. Third, we learn a complementary
correlation filter with a conservative learning rate to maintain long-term
memory of target appearance. We use the output responses of this long-term
filter to determine if tracking failure occurs. In the case of tracking
failures, we apply an incrementally learned detector to recover the target
position in a sliding window fashion. Extensive experimental results on
large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency,
accuracy, and robustness.

elementary and composite fermionic ADM, utilizes relativistic mean field

corresponding to (1) non-relativistic and (2) relativistic constituents in a

nuggets are large compared to the force range. We provide analytical
descriptions for nuggets in each regime. Through numerical calculations, we are
able to confirm our analytic descriptions and also obtain smooth transitions

${\cal O}(1)$ fraction of the constituent's mass, significantly larger than
expectations in the non-relativistic case. In a companion paper, we apply our

junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover,
recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an
activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that
activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate
oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction
plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that gap junction
plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining
a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and
synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust
communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms:
transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct

long-range pairing amplitude decays more slowly than the hopping, we discover
new topological phases where propagating Majorana fermions at each edge pair

localized at both edges at the same time. The inclusion of long-range effects
is potentially applicable to recent experiments with magnetic impurities and

analysis of weak lensing data which is the principal probe in many future
generations of cosmological surveys like LSST, Euclid etc.. Modeling or
parameterizing these effects is essential in order to extract valuable
constraints on cosmological parameters. In a recent paper, Eifler et al. (2015)
suggested a reduction technique for baryonic effects by conducting a principal
component analysis (PCA) and removing the largest baryonic eigenmodes from the
data. In this article, we conducted the investigation further and addressed two
critical aspects. Firstly, we performed the analysis by separating the
simulations into training and test sets, computing a minimal set of principle
components from the training set and examining the fits on the test set. We
found that using only four parameters, corresponding to the four largest
eigenmodes of the training set, the test sets can be fitted thoroughly with an
RMS $\sim 0.0011$. Secondly, we explored the significance of outliers, the most
exotic/extreme baryonic scenarios, in this method. We found that excluding the
outliers from the training set results in a relatively bad fit and degraded the
RMS by nearly a factor of 3. Therefore, for a direct employment of this method
to the tomographic analysis of the weak lensing data, the principle components
should be derived from a training set that comprises adequately exotic but
reasonable models such that the reality is included inside the parameter domain
sampled by the training set. The baryonic effects can be parameterized as the
coefficients of these principle components and should be marginalized over the
cosmological parameter space.

separations have been reported in recent literature. Nevertheless, the
definitive detection of even a single such object remains elusive. If at least
one of the black holes is accreting, the light emitted from its accretion disc
will be lensed by the other black hole for binary orbital inclinations near to
the line of sight. This binary self-lensing could provide a unique signature of
compact MBHB systems. We show that, for MBHBs with masses in the range 10^6 -
10^10 solar masses and with orbital periods less than ~10 yr, strong lensing
events should occur in one to 10s of percent of MBHB systems that are monitored
for an entire orbit. Lensing events will last from days for the less massive,
shorter period MBHBs up to a year for the most massive ~10 year orbital period
MBHBs. At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line of sight, lensing
must occur and will be accompanied by periodicity due to the relativistic
Doppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux of the
Doppler modulation would be a smoking gun signature of self-lensing and can be
used to constrain binary parameters. For MBHBs with separation >100
Schwarzschild radii, we show that finite-sized source effects could serve as a
probe of MBH accretion disc structure. Finally, we stress that our lensing
probability estimate implies that ~10 of the known MBHB candidates identified
through quasar periodicity should exhibit strong lensing flares.

measure the variables. The principle of similitude (Rayleigh 1915) or
dimensional homogeneity, states that only commensurable quantities (ones having
the same dimension) may be compared, therefore, meaningful laws of nature must
be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which
was formalized in the $\rm \Pi$ theorem (Vaschy 1892; Buckingham 1914).
However, most relations in allometry do not satisfy this basic requirement,
including the `3/4 Law' (Kleiber 1932) that relates the basal metabolic rate
and body mass, which it is sometimes claimed to be the most fundamental
biological rate (Brown et al. 2004) and the closest to a law in life sciences
(West \& Brown 2004). Using the $\rm \Pi$ theorem, here we show that it is
possible to construct a unique homogeneous equation for the metabolic rates, in
agreement with data in the literature. We find that the variations in the
dependence of the metabolic rates on body mass are secondary, coming from
variations in the allometric dependence of the heart frequencies. This includes
not only different classes of animals (mammals, birds, invertebrates) but also
different exercise conditions (basal and maximal). Our results demonstrate that
most of the differences found in the allometric exponents (White et al. 2007)
are due to compare incommensurable quantities and that our dimensionally
homogenous formula, unify these differences into a single formulation. We
discuss the ecological implications of this new formulation in the context of
the Malthusian's, Fenchel's and the total energy consumed in a lifespan

fluid. When large numbers of such forced filaments interact through the
surrounding fluid, as in particular stages of oocyte development in
$Drosophila~melanogaster$, complex dynamics are observed, but the detailed
mechanics underlying them has remained unclear. Motivated by these
observations, we study here perhaps the simplest model for these phenomena: an
elastic filament, pinned at one end, acted on by a molecular motor treated as a
point force. Because the force acts tangential to the filament, no matter what
its shape, this ""follower-force"" problem is intrinsically non-variational, and
thereby differs fundamentally from Euler buckling, where the force has a fixed
direction, and which, in the low Reynolds number regime, ultimately leads to a
stationary, energy-minimizing shape. Through a combination of linear stability
theory, analytical study of a solvable simplified ""two-link"" model, and
numerical studies of the full elastohydrodynamic equations of motion we
elucidate the Hopf bifurcation that occurs with increasing forcing of a

a challenging and a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we present
the HAMUHI-CODE, a novel fast heuristic algorithm for multi-scale hierarchical
community detection inspired on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering
technique. We define a new structural similarity of vertices based on the
classical cosine similarity by removing some vertices in order to increase the
probability of identifying inter-cluster edges. Then we use the proposed
structural similarity in a new agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that does
not merge only clusters with maximal similarity as in the classical approach,
but merges any cluster that does not meet a parameterized community definition
with its most similar adjacent cluster. The algorithm computes all the similar
clusters at the same time is checking if each cluster meets the parameterized
community definition. It is done in linear time complexity in terms of the
number of cluster in the iteration. Since a complex network is a sparse graph,
our approach HAMUHI-CODE has a super-linear time complexity with respect to the
size of the input in the worst-case scenario (if the clusters merge in pairs),
making it suitable to be applied on large-scale complex networks. To test the
properties and the efficiency of our algorithm we have conducted extensive
experiments on real world and synthetic benchmark networks by comparing it to
several baseline state-of-the-art algorithms.

While multi-task training of such models alleviates the need for large

main idea of this paper is to leverage the encoding of the slot names and

demonstrate that the optimal reconstruction of the individual FCs through

reconstructed individual connectivity profiles increases both at the global and

functional data of the subjects. Furthermore, reconstructed FC data provide
more robust associations with task-behavioral measurements. Finally, we extend
this approach to also map the most task-sensitive functional connections.
Results show that is possible to maximize individual fingerprinting in the
functional connectivity domain regardless of the task, a crucial next step in
the area of brain connectivity towards individualized connectomics.

During their access to the frequency spectrum licensed to the primary users,
the secondary unlicensed users assist the primary system in fortifying security

themselves from eavesdropping. The main objective of this work is to maximize
the secrecy rate of the secondary system, while adhering to all individual
primary users' secrecy rate constraints. In the case of active eavesdroppers
and perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transceivers, the utility
function of interest is nonconcave and the involved constraints are nonconvex,

propose an iterative algorithm to arrive at least to a local optimum of the

the monomer concentration raised to the power, which is the `critical nucleaus

way, has been recently challenged by an alternative two-step mechanism, when
the soluble monomers first form a metastable aggregate (micelle), and then
undergo conversion into the conformation rich in ${\beta}$-strands that are
able to form a stable growing nucleus for the protofilament. Here we put
together the elements of extensive knowledge about aggregation and nucleation
kinetics, using a specific case of A${\beta_{1\mathrm{-}42}}$ amyloidogenic
peptide for illustration, to find theoretical expressions for the effective
rate of amyloid nucleation. We find that at low monomer concentration in
solution, and also at low interaction energy between two peptide conformations
in the micelle, the nucleation occurs via the classical route. At higher
monomer concentration, and a range of other interaction parameters between
peptides, the two-step `aggregation-conversion' mechanism of nucleation takes
over. In this regime, the effective rate of the process can be interpreted as a
power of monomer concentration in a certain range of parameters, however, the
exponent is determined by a complicated interplay of interaction parameters and
is not related to the minimum size of the growing nucleus (which we find to be
${\sim}$ 7-8 for A${\beta_{1-42}}$).

consider the ODE $\partial_t^2 u = -(\nabla V)(u)$ describing the trajectory of
a particle $t \mapsto u(t)$ in the potential well $V$. We consider the question
of whether the dynamics of this family of ODE are \emph{universal} in the sense
that they contain (as embedded copies) any first-order ODE $\partial_t u =
X(u)$ arising from a smooth vector field $X$ on a manifold $M$. Assuming that
$X$ is nonsingular and $M$ is compact, we show (using the Nash embedding
theorem) that this is possible precisely when the flow $(M,X)$ supports a
geometric structure which we call a \emph{strongly adapted $1$-form}; many
smooth flows do have such a $1$-form, but we give an example (due to Bryant) of
a flow which does not, and hence cannot be modeled by the dynamics of a
potential well. As one consequence of this embeddability criterion, we
construct an example of a (coercive) potential well system which is
\emph{Turing complete} in the sense that the halting of any Turing machine with
a given input is equivalent to a certain bounded trajectory in this system
entering a certain open set. In particular, this system contains trajectories
for which it is undecidable whether that trajectory enters such a set.
  Remarkably, the above results also hold if one works instead with the
nonlinear wave equation $\partial_t^2 u - \Delta u = -(\nabla V)(u)$ on a torus
instead of a particle in a potential well, or if one replaces the target domain
$\mathbf{R}^m$ by a more general Riemannian manifold.

unknown mixture of $k$ spherical Gaussians, the goal is to estimate the model
parameters using a single pass over the data stream. We analyze a streaming
version of the popular Lloyd's heuristic and show that the algorithm estimates
all the unknown centers of the component Gaussians accurately if they are
sufficiently separated. Assuming each pair of centers are $C\sigma$ distant
with $C=\Omega((k\log k)^{1/4}\sigma)$ and where $\sigma^2$ is the maximum
variance of any Gaussian component, we show that asymptotically the algorithm
estimates the centers optimally (up to constants); our center separation
requirement matches the best known result for spherical Gaussians
\citep{vempalawang}. For finite samples, we show that a bias term based on the
initial estimate decreases at $O(1/{\rm poly}(N))$ rate while variance
decreases at nearly optimal rate of $\sigma^2 d/N$.
  Our analysis requires seeding the algorithm with a good initial estimate of
the true cluster centers for which we provide an online PCA based clustering
algorithm. Indeed, the asymptotic per-step time complexity of our algorithm is
the optimal $d\cdot k$ while space complexity of our algorithm is $O(dk\log
k)$.
  In addition to the bias and variance terms which tend to $0$, the
hard-thresholding based updates of streaming Lloyd's algorithm is agnostic to
the data distribution and hence incurs an approximation error that cannot be
avoided. However, by using a streaming version of the classical
(soft-thresholding-based) EM method that exploits the Gaussian distribution
explicitly, we show that for a mixture of two Gaussians the true means can be
estimated consistently, with estimation error decreasing at nearly optimal
rate, and tending to $0$ for $N\rightarrow \infty$.

the same sequence. In the first scenario, we show that a combination of
superposition coding, time-sharing and Gel'fand-Pinsker binning is sufficient
to approach the capacity to within three bits per channel use for any number of
possible state realizations. In the second scenario, we derive capacity to
within four bits-per-channel-use for the case of two possible state sequences.
This result is extended to the CCDP channel with any number of possible state
sequences under certain conditions on the scaling parameters which we denote as
""strong fading"" regime. We conclude by providing some remarks on the capacity
of the CCDP channel in which the state sequences have any jointly Gaussian
distribution.

the establishment of the 4-scalar, manifestly-covariant evolution quantum wave
equation, denoted as covariant quantum gravity (CQG) wave equation, which
advances the quantum state $\psi $ associated with a prescribed background
space-time. In this paper, the CQG-wave equation is proved to follow at once by
means of a Hamilton-Jacobi quantization of the classical variational tensor
field $g\equiv \left\{ g_{\mu \nu }\right\} $ and its conjugate momentum,
referred to as (canonical) $g-$quantization. The same equation is also shown to
be variational and to follow from a synchronous variational principle
identified here with the quantum Hamilton variational principle. The
corresponding quantum hydrodynamic equations are then obtained upon introducing
the Madelung representation for $\psi $, which provide an equivalent
statistical interpretation of the CQG-wave equation. Finally, the quantum state
$\psi $ is proved to fulfill generalized Heisenberg inequalities, relating the
statistical measurement errors of quantum observables. These are shown to be
represented in terms of the standard deviations of the matric tensor $g\equiv

taken into account to prevent the fronts leaking problem during the fronts
propagation. These enhancements can be derived from the image edge-dependent
vector field such as the gradient vector flow. The numerical implementations
are carried out by the Finsler variant of the fast marching method, leading to
very efficient interactive segmentation schemes. We apply the proposed Finsler
fronts propagation model to image segmentation applications. Specifically, the
foreground and background segmentation is implemented by the Voronoi index map.
In addition, for the application of tubularity segmentation, we exploit the
level set lines of the geodesic distance map associated to the proposed Finsler
metric providing that a thresholding value is given.

the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these
higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way

`transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on

  Empirical Evidence",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new estimator for the spot covariance matrix of a
multi-dimensional continuous semi-martingale log asset price process which is
subject to noise and non-synchronous observations. The estimator is constructed
based on a local average of block-wise parametric spectral covariance
estimates. The latter originate from a local method of moments (LMM) which
recently has been introduced. We prove consistency and a point-wise stable
central limit theorem for the proposed spot covariance estimator in a very
general setup with stochastic volatility, leverage effects and general noise
distributions. Moreover, we extend the LMM estimator to be robust against
autocorrelated noise and propose a method to adaptively infer the
autocorrelations from the data. Based on simulations we provide empirical
guidance on the effective implementation of the estimator and apply it to
high-frequency data of a cross-section of Nasdaq blue chip stocks. Employing
the estimator to estimate spot covariances, correlations and volatilities in
normal but also unusual periods yields novel insights into intraday covariance
and correlation dynamics. We show that intraday (co-)variations (i) follow
underlying periodicity patterns, (ii) reveal substantial intraday variability
associated with (co-)variation risk, and (iii) can increase strongly and nearly
instantaneously if new information arrives.

optical distortions induced by multiple scattering can be effectively undone
with the knowledge of the medium's scattering-matrix, this matrix is generally
unknown, and cannot be measured with high resolution without the presence of
fluorescent or absorbing probes at all points of interest. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce here the concept of the acousto-optic transmission
matrix (AOTM). Taking advantage of the near scattering-free propagation of
ultrasound in complex samples, we noninvasively measure an
ultrasonically-encoded, spatially-resolved, optical scattering-matrix. We
demonstrate that a singular value decomposition analysis of the AOTM, acquired
using a single or multiple ultrasonic beams, allows controlled optical focusing

provides a generalized framework for analyzing acousto-optical experiments, and
for noninvasive, high-resolution study of complex media.

cluster (hereafter MACS0416) is one of the most efficient lenses in the sky,
and in 2014 it was observed with high-cadence imaging from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). Here we describe two unusual transient events that appeared
behind MACS0416 in a strongly lensed galaxy at redshift $z = 1.0054 \pm
0.0002$. These transients---designated HFF14Spo-NW and HFF14Spo-SE and
collectively nicknamed ""Spock""---were faster and fainter than any supernova
(SN), but significantly more luminous than a classical nova. They reached peak
luminosities of $\sim10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_{\rm AB} < -14$ mag) in 5
rest-frame days, then faded below detectability in roughly the same time span.
Models of the cluster lens suggest that these events may be spatially
coincident at the source plane, but are most likely not temporally coincident.
We find that HFF14Spo can be explained as a luminous blue variable (LBV), a
recurrent nova (RN), or a pair of stellar microlensing events. To distinguish
between these hypotheses will require a clarification of the positions of
nearby critical curves, along with high-cadence monitoring of the field that
could detect new transient episodes in the host galaxy.

state of an organization, the organization's risk is defined as its maximum
possible expected loss, and the risk assessment problem is modeled as a
constrained optimization problem. The influence of different factors on an
organization's risk is uncovered through theoretical analysis. Based on
extensive experiments, we speculate that the attack strategy obtained by
applying the hill-climbing method to the proposed optimization problem, which
we call the HC strategy, always leads to the maximum possible expected loss. We
then present a set of five heuristic attack strategies and, through comparative
experiments, show that the HC strategy causes a higher risk than all these

two factors on the attacker's HC cost profit is determined through computer

Kaiser-Stebbins effect for standard (massive) cosmic strings. There are two
regimes depending on the energy $E$ of a massless string per unit length. At
low energies, $EG/c^4\ll 1$, massless and massive strings act similarly. At
high energies, $EG/c^4 \sim 1$, massless string effects are quite different.
Our work provides a method to describe different physical phenomena on
spacetimes of massless strings which take into account the presence of a

They could have arisen from large (order one) curvature fluctuations produced
during inflation that reentered the horizon in the radiation era. At reentry,
these fluctuations source gravitational waves (GW) via second order anisotropic
stresses. These GW, together with those (possibly) sourced during inflation by
the same mechanism responsible for the large curvature fluctuations, constitute
a primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB) that unavoidably accompanies the
PBH formation. We study how the amplitude and the range of frequencies of this
signal depend on the statistics (Gaussian versus $\chi^2$) of the primordial
curvature fluctuations, and on the evolution of the PBH mass function due to
accretion and merging. We then compare this signal with the sensitivity of
present and future detectors, at PTA and LISA scales. We find that this SGWB
will help to probe, or strongly constrain, the early universe mechanism of PBH
production. The comparison between the peak mass of the PBH distribution and
the peak frequency of this SGWB will provide important information on the
merging and accretion evolution of the PBH mass distribution from their
formation to the present era. Different assumptions on the statistics and on
the PBH evolution also result in different amounts of CMB $\mu$-distortions.
Therefore the above results can be complemented by the detection (or the
absence) of $\mu$-distortions with an experiment such as PIXIE.

  Methods: We have applied previously developed methodology to estimate the

2009-10 seasons.
  Results: The average annual rates (per 100,000) of influenza and
RSV-associated hospitalizations for any cause excluding asthma (ICD-9 code 493)
in the principal diagnosis with a respiratory cause (ICD-9 codes 460-519) in

  Conclusions: The estimated rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations in young
children are high, with those rates declining rapidly with age. Additionally,
the estimated rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations with asthma as a
secondary diagnosis in young children, combined with data on the prevalence of
asthma in those age groups suggest very high rates of RSV-associated

We discuss nonlinear dynamical protocols which allow for efficient excitation
and control of nonlinear phonons. We consider recent inspiring proposals:
inducing ferroelectricity in paraelectric material such as KTaO$_3$ and
inducing structural deformations in cuprates like La$_2$CuO$_4$ [A. Subedi
et.al, Phys. Rev. B 89,220301 (2014), A.Subedi, Phys. Rev. B 95, 134113
(2017)]. High-frequency phonon modes are driven by mid-infrared pulses, and
coupled to lower-frequency modes those indirect excitation causes structural
deformations. Such proposals are in line with a series of recent experiments on
light-induced phase transitions. We study in a more detail the case of KTaO$_3$
without strain, where (at first glance) it was not possible to excite the
needed low frequency phonon mode by resonant driving of the higher frequency
one. Behaviour of the phonon system is explained using a reduced model of
coupled driven nonlinear oscillators. We find a dynamical mechanism which
prevents effective excitation at resonance driving, and show that for certain
detunings of driving frequency from the exact resonance the system response is,
counterintuitively, greatly amplified. In order to induce ferroelectricity in
KTaO$_3$ without a strain we employ driving with sweeping frequency, realizing
so called capture into resonance. The method works for realistic femtosecond

conical singularity due to identification $\tau=\tau + 2 \pi q$ in one
isometric angle. We compute the value of the spectral zeta-function at zero
$z(q) = \zeta(0, q)$ that controls the coefficient of the logarithmic UV
divergence of the one-loop partition function on $S^4_q$. While the value of
the conformal anomaly a-coefficient is proportional to $z(1)$, we argue that in
general the second $c = C_T$ anomaly coefficient is related to a particular
combination of the second and first derivatives of $z(q) $ at $q=1$. The
universality of this relation for $C_T$ is supported also by examples in 6 and
2 dimensions. We use it to compute the c-coefficient for conformal higher spins
finding that it coincides with the ""$r=-1$"" value of the one-parameter Ansatz
suggested in arXiv:1309.0785. Like the sums of $a_s$ and $c_s$ coefficients,
the regularized sum of $z_s(q)$ over the whole tower of conformal higher spins
$s=1,2, ...$ is found to vanish, implying UV finiteness on $S^4_q$ and thus
also the vanishing of the associated Re'nyi entropy. Similar conclusions are
found to apply to the standard 2-derivative massless higher spin tower. We also
present an independent computation of the full set of conformal anomaly
coefficients of the 6d Weyl graviton theory defined by a particular combination
of the three 6d Weyl invariants that has a (2,0) supersymmetric extension.

effects: spin fluctuations drive the superfluidity of Helium-3 and a similar
mechanism operating in metals can give rise to superconductivity. It is
conventional to discuss the latter in terms of the forces induced by the
quantum fluctuations. However, focusing directly upon the free energy provides
a useful alternative perspective in the classical case and can also be applied
to study quantum fluctuations. Villain first developed this approach for
insulating magnets and coined the term order-by-disorder to describe the
observed effect. We discuss the application of this idea to metallic systems,
recent progress made in doing so, and the broader prospects for the future.

decomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a
system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description
online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing
DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data
becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and
computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that
places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward
manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A
variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of ""windowed
DMD"", in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method
is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the
state dimension is less than about~200, the proposed algorithm is the most
efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more
efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on
several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex
example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that
the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure
measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.

that for these field configurations the amplitude and phase modulation
functions are not varied independently. However, there exists at least one
exception when the model is unconditionally integrable, that is the Rabi
frequency and the detuning of the driving optical field are controlled
independently. This is a constant-amplitude periodic level-crossing model, for
which the detuning in a limit becomes a Dirac delta-comb configuration with

the original $P-6m2$ symmetry of the pristine COF (COF-Fe-0), we have
computationally designed seven new COFs by intercalating Fe atoms between two

the pristine and Fe-intercalated COF materials are investigated here. We
predict that the electronic properties of COFs can be fine tuned by adding Fe
atoms between two organic layers in their structures. Our calculations show
that these new intercalated-COFs are promising semiconductors. The effect of Fe
atoms on the electronic band structures and density of states (DOSs) has also
been investigated using the aforementioned DFT-D method. The contribution of
the $d$-subshell electron density of the Fe atoms plays an important role in
improving the semiconductor properties of these new materials. These

Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices of the parallel and
shunt types into large power transmission systems, which allows to delay or
avoid installations of generally much more expensive power lines. Methodology
takes as an input projected economic development, expressed through a paced
growth of the system loads, as well as uncertainties, expressed through
multiple scenarios of the growth. We price new devices according to their
capacities. Installation cost contributes to the optimization objective in
combination with the cost of operations integrated over time and averaged over
the scenarios. The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a
gradual distribution of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the
investment budget, or equivalently constraint on building capacity, is
introduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not only
newly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees
of freedom. This complex optimization problem is stated using the most general
AC Power Flows. Non-linear, non-convex, multiple-scenario and multi-time-frame
optimization is resolved via efficient heuristics, consisting of a sequence of
alternating Linear Programmings or Quadratic Programmings (depending on the
generation cost) and AC-PF solution steps designed to maintain operational
feasibility for all scenarios. Computational scalability and application of the
newly developed approach is illustrated on the example of the 2736-nodes large
Polish system. One most important advantage of the framework is that the
optimal capacity of FACTS is build up gradually at each time frame in a limited
number of locations, thus allowing to prepare the system better for possible
congestion due to future economic and other uncertainties.
