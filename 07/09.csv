populations, and organizations. Recent advances in deep learning allow for the
rapid and automatic assessment of organizational diversity and possible
discrimination by race, sex, age and other parameters. Automating the process
of assessing the organizational diversity using the deep neural networks and
eliminating the human factor may provide a set of real-time unbiased reports to
all stakeholders. In this pilot study we applied the deep-learned predictors of
race and sex to the executive management and board member profiles of the 500
largest companies from the 2016 Forbes Global 2000 list and compared the
predicted ratios to the ratios within each company's country of origin and
ranked them by the sex-, age- and race- diversity index (DI). While the study
has many limitations and no claims are being made concerning the individual
companies, it demonstrates a method for the rapid and impartial assessment of
organizational diversity using deep neural networks.

to a union of several subspaces, subspace clustering refers to the process of
clustering the points according to their subspace and identifying the

each sample as a weighted combination of the other samples, with weights of
minimal $\ell_1$ norm, and then uses those learned weights to cluster the
samples. SSC is stable in settings where each sample is contaminated by a
relatively small amount of noise. However, when there is a significant amount
of additive noise, or a considerable number of entries are missing, theoretical
guarantees are scarce. In this paper, we study a robust variant of SSC and
establish clustering guarantees in the presence of corrupted or missing data.
We give explicit bounds on amount of noise and missing data that the algorithm
can tolerate, both in deterministic settings and in a random generative model.
Notably, our approach provides guarantees for higher tolerance to noise and
missing data than existing analyses for this method. By design, the results
hold even when we do not know the locations of the missing data; e.g., as in

paradigm is its reservoir --- a directed and weighted network of neurons that
projects the input time series into a high dimensional space where linear
regression or classification can be applied. Despite extensive studies, the
impact of the reservoir network on the ESN performance remains unclear.
Combining tools from physics, dynamical systems and network science, we attempt
to open the black box of ESN and offer insights to understand the behavior of
general artificial neural networks. Through spectral analysis of the reservoir
network we reveal a key factor that largely determines the ESN memory capacity
and hence affects its performance. Moreover, we find that adding short loops to
the reservoir network can tailor ESN for specific tasks and optimize learning.
We validate our findings by applying ESN to forecast both synthetic and real

ESN. More importantly, it demonstrates the power of combining tools from

(GPs) with RBF kernels on the other hand have better calibrated uncertainties
and do not overconfidently extrapolate far from data in their training set.
However, GPs have poor representational power and do not perform as well as
DNNs on complex domains. In this paper we show that GP hybrid deep networks,
GPDNNs, (GPs on top of DNNs and trained end-to-end) inherit the nice properties
of both GPs and DNNs and are much more robust to adversarial examples. When
extrapolating to adversarial examples and testing in domain shift settings,
GPDNNs frequently output high entropy class probabilities corresponding to
essentially ""don't know"". GPDNNs are therefore promising as deep architectures
that know when they don't know.

  Tensor Decomposition","15 pages, 20 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often corrupted by a mixture of several types
of noise during the acquisition process, e.g., Gaussian noise, impulse noise,
dead lines, stripes, and many others. Such complex noise could degrade the
quality of the acquired HSIs, limiting the precision of the subsequent
processing. In this paper, we present a novel tensor-based HSI restoration
approach by fully identifying the intrinsic structures of the clean HSI part
and the mixed noise part respectively. Specifically, for the clean HSI part, we
use tensor Tucker decomposition to describe the global correlation among all
bands, and an anisotropic spatial-spectral total variation (SSTV)
regularization to characterize the piecewise smooth structure in both spatial
and spectral domains. For the mixed noise part, we adopt the $\ell_1$ norm
regularization to detect the sparse noise, including stripes, impulse noise,
and dead pixels. Despite that TV regulariztion has the ability of removing
Gaussian noise, the Frobenius norm term is further used to model heavy Gaussian
noise for some real-world scenarios. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm
for solving the resulting optimization problem by using the augmented Lagrange
multiplier (ALM) method. Finally, extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world noise HSIs are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art ones.

cloud-aided transmission in order to compensate for the limited hit probability
of the caches at the base stations (BSs). Unlike the typical wired scenarios
studied in the networking literature in which entire files are typically
cached, recent research has suggested that fractional caching at the BSs of a
wireless system can be beneficial. This paper investigates the benefits of
fractional caching in a scenario with a cloud processor connected via a
wireless fronthaul link to a BS, which serves a number of mobile users on a
wireless downlink channel using orthogonal spectral resources. The fronthaul
and downlink channels occupy orthogonal frequency bands. The end-to-end
delivery latency for given requests of the users depends on the HARQ processes
run on the two links to counteract fading-induced outages. An analytical
framework based on theory of Markov chains with rewards is provided that
enables the optimization of fractional edge caching at the BSs. Numerical
results demonstrate meaningful advantages for fractional caching due to the
interplay between caching and HARQ transmission. The gains are observed in the
typical case in which the performance is limited by the wireless downlink
channel and the file popularity distribution is not too skewed.

design two co-decoding schemes that effectively combine the outputs of the two

We exploit the multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique
for multiuser computation offloading, such that different users can
simultaneously offload their computation tasks to the multi-antenna BS over the
same time/frequency resources, and the BS can employ successive interference
cancellation (SIC) to efficiently decode all users' offloaded tasks for remote
execution. We aim to minimize the weighted sum-energy consumption at all users
subject to their computation latency constraints, by jointly optimizing the
communication and computation resource allocation as well as the BS's decoding
order for SIC. For the case with partial offloading, the weighted sum-energy
minimization is a convex optimization problem, for which an efficient algorithm
based on the Lagrange duality method is presented to obtain the globally
optimal solution. For the case with binary offloading, the weighted sum-energy
minimization corresponds to a {\em mixed Boolean convex problem} that is
generally more difficult to be solved. We first use the branch-and-bound (BnB)
method to obtain the globally optimal solution, and then develop two
low-complexity algorithms based on the greedy method and the convex relaxation,
respectively, to find suboptimal solutions with high quality in practice. Via
numerical results, it is shown that the proposed NOMA-based computation
offloading design significantly improves the energy efficiency of the multiuser
MEC system as compared to other benchmark schemes. It is also shown that for
the case with binary offloading, the proposed greedy method performs close to
the optimal BnB based solution, and the convex relaxation based solution
achieves a suboptimal performance but with lower implementation complexity.

on copper foil a decade ago, inch-sized single-crystal graphene has been
achieved. We present here the growth, in 20 minutes, of a graphene film of 5 x
50 cm2 dimension with > 99% ultra-highly oriented grains. This growth was
achieved by: (i) synthesis of sub-metre-sized single-crystal Cu(111) foil as
substrate; (ii) epitaxial growth of graphene islands on the Cu(111) surface;
(iii) seamless merging of such graphene islands into a graphene film with high
single crystallinity and (iv) the ultrafast growth of graphene film. These
achievements were realized by a temperature-driven annealing technique to
produce single-crystal Cu(111) from industrial polycrystalline Cu foil and the
marvellous effects of a continuous oxygen supply from an adjacent oxide. The
as-synthesized graphene film, with very few misoriented grains (if any), has a
mobility up to ~ 23,000 cm2V-1s-1 at 4 K and room temperature sheet resistance
of ~ 230 ohm/square. It is very likely that this approach can be scaled up to
achieve exceptionally large and high-quality graphene films with single

mixed-integer linear programs at every iteration of the algorithm, we
adaptively partition the variable domains appearing in the multi-linear terms.
We also provide proofs on convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm to a

the sequential bound-tightening procedure as a presolve step, where we observe
the importance of solving piecewise relaxations compared to basic convex
relaxations to speed-up the convergence of the algorithm to global optimality.

small-size neural network is sufficient in the ""policy layer"" to handle many

approach. Here the branching ratios, the $CP$ asymmetries and the complete set
of polarization observables are investigated systematically. Besides the
traditional contributions from the factorizable and nonfactorizable diagrams at
the leading order, the next-to-leading order (NLO) vertex corrections could
also provide considerable contributions. The PQCD predictions for the branching
ratios of the $B_{(s)}\to \psi(2S)K^{*}, \psi(2S) \phi$ decays are consistent
with the measured values within errors. As for $B\to \psi(2S) \rho, \psi(2S)
\omega$ decays, the branching ratios can reach the order of $10^{-5}$ and could
be measured in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The numerical results show
that the direct $CP$ asymmetries of the considered decays are very small. Thus
the observation of any large direct $CP$ asymmetry for these decays will be a
signal for new physics. The mixing induced $CP$ asymmetries in the neutral
modes are very close to $\sin 2\beta_{(s)}$, which suggests that these channels
can give a cross-check on the measurement of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) angle $\beta$ and $\beta_s$. We found that the longitudinal polarization
fractions $f_0$ are suppressed to $\sim 50\%$ due to the large nonfactorizable
contributions. The magnitudes and phases of the two transverse amplitudes
$\mathcal {A}_{\parallel}$ and $\mathcal {A}_{\perp}$ are roughly equal, which
is an indication for the approximate light quark helicity conservation in these
decays. The overall polarization observables of $B\to \psi(2S) K^{*0}$ and
$B_s\to \psi(2S) \phi$ channels are also in good agreement with the
experimental measurements as reported by LHCb and BaBar. Other results can also
be tested by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments.

increase solar PV generation penetration levels. The proposed MFC approach with
its corresponding intelligent controllers does not require any precise model

assuming the availability of a good model, the various building architectures
would compromise the performance objectives of any model-based control
strategy. The objective is to consume most of the PV generation locally while
maintaining occupants comfort and physical constraints of HVAC units. That is,
by enabling proper scheduling of responsive loads temporally and spatially to
minimize the difference between demand and PV production, it would be possible
to reduce voltage variations and two-way power flow. Computer simulations show
promising results where a significant proportion of the PV generation can be
consumed by building HVAC units with the help of intelligent control.

of their natural satellites. It is conventionally treated by parameterized
equilibrium tidal theory, in which the tidal torque declines rapidly with

(2017) find that some Saturnian satellites are currently migrating outward
faster than predicted by equilibrium tidal theory. Resonance locking between
satellites and internal oscillations of Saturn, proposed by Fuller et al.

resonance locking theory predicts dynamical tidal perturbations to Saturn's
gravitational field in addition to those produced by equilibrium tidal bulges.
We show that these perturbations can likely be detected during Cassini's
proximal orbits if migration of satellites results from resonant gravity modes,
but will likely be undetectable if migration results from inertial wave
attractors or dissipation of the equilibrium tide. Additionally, we show that
the detection of gravity modes would place constraints on the size of the

the process of the path selection between the source and destination node.
These metrics are bandwidth and uptime of relays as node conditions and delays
between the relays as a path condition. Through a number of experiments we show
that we could double the performance observed by end users when using the
proposed technique as opposed to the current Tor path selection algorithm. More
importantly, the proposed technique only requires a software upgrade on the
client side, and other Tor nodes do not need to be modified.

practically relevant problem of coherence manipulation using finite resources
has been left open. This letter establishes the one-shot theory of coherence
dilution, which involves converting maximally coherent states into an arbitrary
quantum state using maximally incoherent operations, dephasing-covariant
incoherent operations, incoherent operations, or strictly incoherent

interpretations that estimate the one-shot coherence cost --- the minimum
amount of maximally coherent states needed for faithful coherence dilution.
Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic coherence dilution results with maximally
incoherent operations, incoherent operations, and strictly incoherent

quantum information processing tasks that exploit coherence as resources, such

resemble familiar baryonic matter, is considered. Mirror dark matter, which
arises from an isomorphic hidden sector, is a specific and theoretically
constrained scenario. Other possibilities include models with more generic
hidden sectors that contain massless dark photons (unbroken $U(1)$ gauge
interactions). Such dark matter not only features dissipative cooling
processes, but is also assumed to have nontrivial heating sourced by ordinary
supernovae (facilitated by the kinetic mixing interaction). The dynamics of
dissipative dark matter halos around rotationally supported galaxies,
influenced by heating as well as cooling processes, can be modelled by fluid
equations. For a sufficiently isolated galaxy with stable star formation rate,
the dissipative dark matter halos are expected to evolve to a steady state
configuration which is in hydrostatic equilibrium and where heating and cooling
rates locally balance. Here, we take into account the major cooling and heating
processes, and numerically solve for the steady state solution under the
assumptions of spherical symmetry, negligible dark magnetic fields, and that
supernova sourced energy is transported to the halo via dark radiation. For the
parameters considered, and assumptions made, we were unable to find a
physically realistic solution for the constrained case of mirror dark matter
halos. Halo cooling generally exceeds heating at realistic halo mass densities.
This problem can be rectified in more generic dissipative dark matter models,

data, which are generally hard to obtain. One promising source of recordings of
audio events is the large amount of multimedia data on the web. In particular,
if the audio content analysis must itself be performed on web audio, it is
important to train the recognizers themselves from such data. Training from
these web data, however, poses several challenges, the most important being the
availability of labels: labels, if any, that may be obtained for the data are
generally weak, and not of the kind conventionally required for training

weak labels offer an effective method to learn from web data. We then propose a
robust and efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework to
learn audio event recognizers from weakly labeled data. The proposed method can
train from and analyze recordings of variable length in an efficient manner and
outperforms a network trained with strongly labeled web data by a considerable

time stamps within the recording are not available during training, our
proposed framework is able to localize events during the inference stage.

samples forwarded to a remote estimator over a channel that is modeled as a
queue. The estimator reconstructs an estimate of the real-time signal value
from causally received samples. We study the optimal online sampling strategy
that minimizes the mean square estimation error subject to a sampling rate
constraint. We prove that the optimal sampling strategy is a threshold policy,
and find the optimal threshold. This threshold is determined by how much the
Wiener process varies during the random service time and the maximum allowed
sampling rate. Further, if the sampling times are independent of the observed
Wiener process, the above sampling problem for minimizing the estimation error
is equivalent to a sampling problem for minimizing the age of information. This
reveals an interesting connection between the age of information and remote
estimation error. Our comparisons show that the estimation error achieved by
the optimal sampling policy can be much smaller than those of age-optimal
sampling, zero-wait sampling, and periodic sampling.

prior knowledge and preliminary analysis on the landscape of a global
optimization problem can give us an insight into the complexity of the problem.
This knowledge can better inform us in deciding what optimization method should
be used to tackle the problem. However, this analysis becomes problematic when
the dimensionality of the problem is high. This paper presents a framework to
take a deeper look at the global optimization problem to be tackled: by
analyzing the low-dimensional representation of the problem through discovering
the active subspaces of the given problem. The virtue of this is that the
problem's complexity can be visualized in a one or two-dimensional plot, thus
allow one to get a better grip about the problem's difficulty. One could then
have a better idea regarding the complexity of their problem to determine the
choice of global optimizer or what surrogate-model type to be used.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate how the active subspaces can be used to
perform design exploration and analysis.

with the circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction was equal to or
stronger to SN 1988Z for the first 200 days and is observed at all epochs after
explosion. Optical spectra revealed multi-component hydrogen lines appearing by
day 33 and persisting and slowly evolving over the next few years. By day 1509
the H$\alpha$ emission was still strong and exhibiting multiple peaks, hinting
that the CSM was in a disc or torus around the SN. SN 2013L is part of a
growing subset of SNe IIn that shows both strong CSM interaction signatures and
the underlying broad lines from the SN ejecta photosphere. The presence of a
blue H$\alpha$ emission bump and a lack of a red peak does not appear to be due
to dust obscuration since an identical profile is seen in Pa$\beta$. Instead
this suggests a high concentration of material on the near-side of the SN or a
disc inclination of roughly edge-on and hints that SN 2013L was part of a
massive interactive binary system. Narrow H$\alpha$ P-Cygni lines that persist
through the entirety of the observations measure a progenitor outflow speed of
80--130 km s$^{-1}$, speeds normally associated with extreme red supergiants,
yellow hypergiants, or luminous blue variable winds. This progenitor scenario
is also consistent with an inferred progenitor mass-loss rate of 0.3 - 8.0

  Features at Maximum Brightness","18 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJ. Comments and suggestions
  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a set of new quantitative classification criteria for major
subclasses of Type I Supernovae (SNe). We analyze peak spectra of 146 SNe Ia
from the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP), 12 SNe Ib, 19 SNe Ic (including
5 SNe Ic-BL) and 4 SNe Ib/c. All the spectra are within 5 days of maximum
light. We study their absorption line depths relative to the pseudo-continuum
at around observed wavelength 6150{\AA}, attributed to Si II 6355{\AA} for SNe
Ia and Ic and to hydrogen for SNe Ib, and O I $\lambda 7774$\AA\ observed
around $\lambda 7500$\AA. We found that Type I SNe could be quantitatively
classified using the line depths at these two absorption regions. Type Ia SNe,
including normal SNe Ia, Ia-1991bg and Ia-1999aa, show strong signatures of Si
II near peak with relative line depth values of $a{\rm (\lambda6150\AA)>0.35}$.
Only SNe Ia-2002cx (Iax) do not satisfy this criterion, while the $a{\rm (O\ I\
\lambda 7774\AA)}$ index can separate SNe Ia-1991bg and Ia-1999aa cleanly. Type
Ib SNe satisfy that $a{\rm (\lambda6150\AA)<0.35}$ and $a{\rm (\lambda6150\AA)}
/ a{\rm (O\ I\ \lambda 7774\AA)>1}$, while regular Type Ic SNe show $a{\rm
(\lambda6150\AA)<0.35}$ but $a{\rm (\lambda6150\AA)} / a{\rm (O\ I\ \lambda
7774\AA)<1}$. These quantitive classification criteria work well for the
majority of normal Type I SN subclasses. Peculiar SNe Ia-2002cx and SNe Ic-BL
are the exception. We apply these criteria to provide clear identifications to
intermediate or unclear SNe Ib/c. The results show good consistency with
classification using specific spectral line features. Though there are still
some puzzles about the physical mechanisms driving the diverse line ratios, our
method is an accurate empirical method to identify the majority of Type I SNe.

  well-posedness and asymptotics",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) subjected to a strong
magnetic field along $x_1$ direction in three-dimensional thin domains
$\Omega_\delta=\mathbb{R}^2\times(-\delta,\delta)$ with slip boundary
conditions. It is well-known that in this situation the system will generate
Alfv\'en waves. Our results are summarized as follows:
  (i).\, We construct the global solutions (Alfv\'en waves) to MHD in the thin
domain $\Omega_\delta$ with $\delta>0$. In addition, the uniform energy
estimates are obtained with respected to the parameter $\delta$.
  (ii). We justify the asymptotics of the MHD equations from the thin domain
$\Omega_\delta$ to the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. More precisely, we prove that the
3D Alfv\'en waves in $\Omega_\delta$ will converge to the Alfv\'en waves in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ in the limit that $\delta$ goes to zero. This shows that
Alfv\'en waves propagating along the horizontal direction of the (3D) strip are
stable and can be approximated by the (2D) Alfv\'en waves when $\delta$ is
sufficiently small. Moreover, the control of the (2D) Alfv\'en waves can be
obtained from the control of (3D) Alfv\'en waves in the thin domain
$\Omega_\delta$ with aid of the uniform bounds.
  The proofs of main results rely on the design of the proper energy functional
and the null structures of the nonlinear terms. Here the null structures means
two aspects: separation of the Alfv\'en waves ($z_+$ and $z_-$) and no bad
quadratic terms $Q(\partial_3 z_-^h, \partial_3 z_+^h)$ where $z_\pm=(z_\pm^h,
z^3_\pm)$ and $Q(\partial_3 z_-^h,\partial_3 z_+^h)$ is the linear combination
of terms $\partial^\alpha \partial_3 z_-^h\partial^\beta \partial_3 z_+^h$ with
$\alpha, \beta \in (\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0})^3$.

of horizons stays unchanged and their positions receive only finite
corrections, the geometry, thermodynamics and formation of RN black holes
change seriously in particular for small ones. The entropy receives a
logarithmic correction. The line $Q=M$, separating naked singularities from
physical solutions is corrected, putting a lower limit on the mass and an upper
limit on the temperature of the black hole as a function of its charge. The
modifications are highly significant in the cases of near-extremal and small
black holes. We also show that for black holes with small mass can stay in
thermal equilibrium without any constraint on the volume of the container. This
result is in contrast to the large black holes that need a finite volume
container for thermal equilibrium. The minimum of the mass lower limits occurs
at zero charge, resulting in the extremal Schwarzschild black hole with a
specific mass of the order of $M_{p}$ and zero temperature. This state which
has only gravitational interaction will be the final stage of Hawking
radiation. Stability and lack of any interaction but gravitational, makes the
extremal Schwarzschild black hole a serious candidate for dark matter particle.

simulation on a rotating globally spherical geometry. In this Part IV, we focus
on numerical aspects while the model derivation was described in Part III. The
algorithm we propose is based on the splitting approach. Namely, equations are
decomposed on a uniformly elliptic equation for the dispersive pressure
component and a hyperbolic part of shallow water equations (on a sphere) with
source terms. This algorithm is implemented as a two-step predictor-corrector
scheme. On every step, we solve separately elliptic and hyperbolic problems.
Then, the performance of this algorithm is illustrated on model idealised
situations with an even bottom, where we estimate the influence of sphericity
and rotation effects on dispersive wave propagation. The dispersive effects are
quantified depending on the propagation distance over the sphere and on the
linear extent of generation region. Finally, the numerical method is applied to
a couple of real-world events. Namely, we undertake simulations of the
Bulgarian 2007 and Chilean 2010 tsunamis. Whenever the data is available, our
computational results are confronted with real measurements.

Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts
and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g.,
journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and
practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and
-practice in a given area. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct
SLR studies in SE. However, given the facts that several phases of MLRs differ
from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process
and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially
useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present
guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR
guidelines, we benefit from three inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE,
(2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other
fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. All
derived guidelines are discussed in the context of three examples MLRs as
running examples (two from SE and one MLR from the medical sciences). Results:
The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in
SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting
of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast
set of recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other
fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.
Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of three types of solid
experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines support researchers to
effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE.

becoming a big challenge today. Classic visualization ap- proaches focus on
revealing 2D and 3D spatial information and modeling statistical test. Those
methods would easily fail when data become mas- sive. Recent attempts concern
on how to simply cluster data and perform prediction with time-oriented
information. However, those approaches could still be further enhanced as they
also have limitations for han- dling massive clusters and labels. In this
paper, we propose a visualiza- tion methodology for mobility data using
artificial neural net techniques. This method aggregates three main parts that
are Back-end Data Model, Neural Net Algorithm including clustering method
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and prediction approach Recurrent Neural Net (RNN)

results to users with an interactive system. SOM is able to cluster the
visiting patterns and detect the abnormal pattern. RNN can perform the predic-
tion for time series analysis using its dynamic architecture. Furthermore, an
interactive system will enable user to interpret the result with graph- ics,
animation and 3D model for a close-loop feedback. This method can be
particularly applied in two tasks that Commercial-based Promotion and abnormal

given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the largest eigenvalue

as a determinant whose elements are integrals of a confluent hypergeometric
function. For the determinant elements, conventional evaluation approaches,
e.g., truncation of infinite series ensuing from the hypergeometric function or
numerical integration, can be unreliable and slow even for moderate antenna
numbers and Rician $ K $-factor values. Therefore, herein, we derive by hand
and by computer algebra also differential equations that are then solved from
initial conditions computed by conventional approaches. This is the holonomic
gradient method (HGM). Previous HGM-based evaluations of MIMO relied on
differential equations that were not theoretically guaranteed to converge, and,
thus, yielded reliable results only for few antennas or moderate $ K $. Herein,
we reveal that gauge transformations can yield differential equations that are
{\emph{stabile}}, i.e., guarantee HGM convergence. The ensuing HGM-based CDF
evaluation is demonstrated reliable, accurate, and expeditious in computing the
MRC outage probability even for very large antenna numbers and values of $ K $.

sensitive channels that include a specialized device to sense voltage. Gating
currents of the voltage sensor are now known to depend on the back-and-forth
movements of positively charged arginines through the hydrophobic plug of a
voltage sensor domain. Transient movements of these permanently charged
arginines, caused by the change of transmembrane potential, further drag the S4
segment and induce opening/closing of ion conduction pore by moving the S4-S5
linker. The ion conduction pore is a separate device from the voltage sensor,
linked (in an unknown way) by the mechanical motion and electric field changes
of the S4-S5 linker. This moving permanent charge induces capacitive current
flow everywhere. Everything interacts with everything else in the voltage
sensor so everything must interact with everything else in its mathematical
model, as everything does in the whole protein. A PNP-steric model of arginines
and a mechanical model for the S4 segment are combined using energy variational
methods in which all movements of charge and mass satisfy conservation laws of
current and mass. The resulting 1D continuum model is used to compute gating
currents under a wide range of conditions, corresponding to experimental
situations. Chemical-reaction-type models based on ordinary differential
equations cannot capture such interactions with one set of parameters. Indeed,
they may inadvertently violate conservation of current. Conservation of current
is particularly important since small violations (<0.01%) quickly (<< 10-6
seconds) produce forces that destroy molecules. Our model reproduces signature
properties of gating current: (1) equality of on and off charge in gating
current (2) saturating voltage dependence in QV curve and (3) many (but not
all) details of the shape of gating current as a function of voltage.

backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown

Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation,

the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both
accuracy and cost. This opens up new possibilities in economics, finance,

the Frobenius norm of an $m \times n$ matrix with $m \le n$ is $1/\sqrt{m}$ and
is (up to scalar scaling) attained only by matrices having pairwise orthonormal
rows. In the present paper, the smallest possible ratio between spectral and
Frobenius norms of $n_1 \times \dots \times n_d$ tensors of order $d$, also
called the best rank-one approximation ratio in the literature, is
investigated. The exact value is not known for most configurations of $n_1 \le
\dots \le n_d$. Using a natural definition of orthogonal tensors over the real
field (resp., unitary tensors over the complex field), it is shown that the
obvious lower bound $1/\sqrt{n_1 \cdots n_{d-1}}$ is attained if and only if a
tensor is orthogonal (resp., unitary) up to scaling. Whether or not orthogonal
or unitary tensors exist depends on the dimensions $n_1,\dots,n_d$ and the
field. A connection between the (non)existence of real orthogonal tensors of
order three and the classical Hurwitz problem on composition algebras can be
established: existence of orthogonal tensors of size $\ell \times m \times n$
is equivalent to the admissibility of the triple $[\ell,m,n]$ to the Hurwitz
problem. Some implications for higher-order tensors are then given. For
instance, real orthogonal $n \times \dots \times n$ tensors of order $d \ge 3$
do exist, but only when $n = 1,2,4,8$. In the complex case, the situation is
more drastic: unitary tensors of size $\ell \times m \times n$ with $\ell \le m
\le n$ exist only when $\ell m \le n$. Finally, some numerical illustrations
for spectral norm computation are presented.

validated in Td-MoTe2 by the STM/STS experiments. Compared with the STS of

information applications, such as the characterisation of mutual information in
cryptographic protocols, or as a technique to derive fundamental theorems in

several decades, starting with the early attempts to formalise information

Logit (SML), a discrete choice model that generalizes the multinomial logit

capture differences in attractiveness, brand awareness and, or visibility of
the products in the market. When a consumer is presented with an assortment of
products, she first considers products in the first level and, if none of them
is purchased, products in the second level are considered. This model is a
special case of the Perception-Adjusted Luce Model (PALM) recently proposed by
Echenique et al (2018). It can explain many behavioural phenomena such as the
attraction, compromise, similarity effects and choice overload which cannot be
explained by the MNL model or any discrete choice model based on random
utility. In particular, the SML model allows violations to regularity which
states that the probability of choosing a product cannot increase if the offer
set is enlarged.
  This paper shows that the seminal concept of revenue-ordered assortment sets,
which contain an optimal assortment under the MNL model, can be generalized to
the SML model. More precisely, the paper proves that all optimal assortments
under the SML are revenue-ordered by level, a natural generalization of
revenue-ordered assortments that contains, at most, a quadratic number of
assortments. As a corollary, assortment optimization under the SML is
polynomial-time solvable. This result is particularly interesting given that
the SML model does not satisfy the regularity condition and, therefore, it can
explain choice behaviours that cannot be explained by any choice model based on
random utility.

cosmologically late times. Our study is purely phenomenological and
parameterized in terms of three effective parameters characterizing the
redshift of mass generation, the width of the transition region, and the
present day neutrino mass. We also study the possibility that neutrinos become
strongly self-interacting at the time where the mass is generated. We find that
in a number of cases, models with large present day neutrino masses are allowed
by current CMB, BAO and supernova data. The increase in the allowed mass range
makes it possible that a non-zero neutrino mass could be measured in direct
detection experiments such as KATRIN. Intriguingly we also find that there are
allowed models in which neutrinos become strongly self-interacting around the
epoch of recombination.

Convolutional neural networks trained for image classification over large

most successful approaches are based on encoding the activations of
convolutional layers, as they convey the image spatial information. In this
paper, we go beyond this spatial information and propose a local-aware encoding
of convolutional features based on semantic information predicted in the target

Class Activation Maps (CAMs). CAMs are based on the knowledge contained in the

requiring external information. In addition, we use CAMs to generate object
proposals during an unsupervised re-ranking stage after a first fast search.
Our experiments on two public available datasets for instance retrieval,

systems. In a fundamental point of view, however, evolution of quantum systems
by the laws of quantum mechanics is more restrictive than classical systems,
identified to a specific form of dynamics, that is, unitary transformations
and, consequently, positive and completely positive maps to subsystems. This
also characterizes classes of disallowed transformations on quantum systems,
among which positive but not completely maps are of particular interest as they
characterize entangled states, a general resource in quantum information
processing. Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of
approximating those non-physical maps, positive but not completely positive
maps, with quantum channels. Since it has been proposed as a method of
detecting entangled states, it has stimulated fundamental problems on
classifications of positive maps and the structure of Hermitian operators and
quantum states, as well as on quantum measurement such as quantum design in
quantum information theory. It has developed efficient and feasible methods of
directly detecting entangled states in practice, for which proof-of-principle
experimental demonstrations have also been performed with photonic qubit
states. Here, we present a comprehensive review on quantum information
processing with structural physical approximations and the related progress.

We call this model the dynamic quantile function (DQF) model. Instead of a

DQF model in order to make statistical inference while accounting for parameter
uncertainty; an efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for sampling-based
posterior inference. Using ten international market indices and approximately
2,000 days of out-of-sample data from each market, the performance of the DQF
model compares favourably, in terms of forecasting VaR of intra-daily returns,
against the interval-valued and histogram-valued time-series models.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the QF-valued forecasts can be used to
forecast VaR measures at the daily timescale via a simple quantile regression
model on daily returns (QR-DQF). In certain markets, the resulting QR-DQF model
is able to provide competitive VaR forecasts for daily returns.

upper bound of $m\lesssim 10^{-30}$eV on the mass of dark matter. A $C^0$ onset

of the cloud is less than the Jeans length. We find that the linear
perturbation of density in such a system obeys a wave equation in acoustic
analogue of Minkowski space-time which is similar to Klein-Gordon equation for
tachyon field in Minkowski space-time, i.e; Klein-Gordon equation with negative
mass-squared term in a flat space time background. We further find the analogy
with tachyon field for linear perturbation of density by studying linear
perturbations in a stable cloud made of Bose-Einstein condensate as dark
matter.

differential yield of the charged primary particles in $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=0.9 TeV, 2.76 TeV,7TeV$ and in $Pb-Pb$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76 TeV$ with 6 centrality bins contains several $p_T$ regions
with special properties. These distributions were analysed by fitting the data
with exponential functions. We conclude that the regions reflect features of
fragmentation and hadronization of partons through the string dynamics. The
nuclear transparency results in negligible influence of the medium in the III
region ($p_T >17-20 GeV/c$), which has highest $p_T$ values. The effects and
changes by the medium start to appear weakly in the II region ($4-6 GeV/c <
p_T< 17-20 GeV/c$) and become stronger in the I region ($p_T <4-6 GeV/c$) . It
seems that the II region has highest number of strings. The increase in string
density in this region could lead to fusion of strings, appearance of a new
string and collective behaviour of the partons in the most central collisions.
These phenomena can explain anomalous behaviour of the Nuclear Modification
Factor in the II region. We propose the II region as a possible area of Quark
Gluon Plasma formation through string fusion. The first $p_T$ regions are the
ones with the maximum number of hadrons and minimum number of strings due to
direct hadronization of the low energy strings into two quark systems - mesons.

  Technology Management. Vol 1, June 2017",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing quality in is a cornerstone of modern quality management
philosophies. Design for X (DfX) techniques provide guidelines, heuristics, and
metrics to ensure that a particular quality attribute exists in a design.
Although hundreds of papers have been published on DfX approaches, few
researchers have explored systematically applying multiple DfX in a particular
problem context. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves, boundaries between
people, computers, and objects will become less distinct, underscoring the need
for more holistic design. Using mixed methods, this paper examines the utility
of DfX in the emerging IoT ecosystem. We identify DfX that are applicable to
IoT-related design, and find gaps that demand further research and development.
The results from this study can be used to help designers and quality managers
select or develop appropriate DfX to use in designing components for the
Internet of Things (IoT), supporting actionable strategies for quality and
customer satisfaction.
