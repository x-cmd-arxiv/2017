network using deep reinforcement learning (RL) against wireless impairments.
This algorithm enables the cellular network cluster to self-heal by allowing RL
to learn how to improve the downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio
through exploration and exploitation of various alarm corrective actions. The
main contributions of this paper are to 1) introduce a deep RL-based fault
handling algorithm which self-organizing networks can implement in a polynomial
runtime and 2) show that this fault management method can improve the radio
link performance in a realistic network setup. Simulation results show that our
proposed algorithm learns an action sequence to clear alarms and improve the
performance in the cellular cluster better than existing algorithms, even
against the randomness of the network fault occurrences and user movements.

graphics and geometry processing applications. In particular, Laplacian
eigenbases allow generalizing the classical Fourier analysis to manifolds. A
key drawback of such bases is their inherently global nature, as the Laplacian
eigenfunctions carry geometric and topological structure of the entire
manifold. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for local spectral shape
analysis. We show how to efficiently construct localized orthogonal bases by
solving an optimization problem that in turn can be posed as the
eigendecomposition of a new operator obtained by a modification of the standard
Laplacian. We study the theoretical and computational aspects of the proposed
framework and showcase our new construction on the classical problems of shape
approximation and correspondence. We obtain significant improvement compared to
classical Laplacian eigenbases as well as other alternatives for constructing

with a de Vaucouleurs profile. Combining our results with those from the
literature, we find tight relationship ($\sim 0.2$ dex scatter) between the
effective radius of the GC system and the virial radius (or mass) of its host

It is infeasible or expensive to locate such ligands on proteins with standard

approach proposed here is the scanning of a spatial and angular grid around the

probability distributions estimated from MD simulations and experimental

strong external electromagnetic field is investigated using a kinetic approach
in the weakly quantum regime ($\chi \lesssim 1$, with $\chi$ the electron
quantum parameter). Three complementary descriptions are considered, their
domain of applicability discussed and their predictions on average properties
of an electron population compared. The first description relies on the
radiation reaction force in the Landau and Lifschitz (LL) form. The second
relies on the linear Boltzmann equation for the electron and photon
distribution functions. It is valid for any $\chi \lesssim 1$, and usually
implemented numerically using a Monte-Carlo (MC) procedure. The third
description relies on a Fokker-Planck (FP) expansion and is rigorously derived
for any ultra-relativistic, otherwise arbitrary configuration. Our study shows
that the evolution of the average energy of an electron population is described
with good accuracy in many physical situations by the leading term of the LL
equation with the so-called quantum correction, even for large values of the
$\chi$. The leading term of the LL friction force (with quantum correction) is
actually recovered naturally by taking the FP limit. The FP description is
necessary to correctly describe the evolution of the energy variance (second
order moment) of the distribution function, while the full linear Boltzmann
(MC) description allows to describe the evolution of higher order moments whose
contribution can become important when $\chi \rightarrow 1$. This analysis
allows further insight on the effect of particle straggling in the deformation
of the particle distribution function. A general criterion for the limit of
validity of each description is proposed, as well as a numerical scheme for
inclusion of the FP description in Particle-In-Cell codes.

we show that - against earlier predictions - surface magnetic states of the
martensite and the austenite can be also probed efficiently via longitudinal
MOKE. A single variant magnetic state, which occurs at room temperature, is
characterized by ferromagnetic hysteresis loops similar to standard
ferromagnets. Temperature dependencies of Kerr rotation were found to be
linearly proportional to magnetization for martensitic phases. After passing
through an inter martensitic structural transition at around 260 K in zero

the room temperature values. On the other hand, at higher temperatures above
338 K where an austenite structure is formed, the MOKE signals are dominated by
quadratic contributions and the magnitude of Kerr rotation drops due to changes
in the electronic and magnetic domains structure. After the sample is cooled

Therefore, any theory whose correlations are exactly, or very close to, the

the rare examples where a limited quantum speedup, a speedup by QA over SA, has

It is therefore important to study the signatures of pairing in the magnetic
excitation spectrum of simple models known to show unconventional
superconducting tendencies. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
technique, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor $S({\bf k},\omega)$
of a generalized $t-U-J$ Hubbard model away from half-filling in a two-leg
ladder geometry. The addition of $J$ enhances pairing tendencies. We analyze
quantitatively the signatures of pairing in the magnetic excitation spectra. We
found that the superconducting pair-correlation strength, that can be estimated
independently from ground state properties, is closely correlated with the
integrated low-energy magnetic spectral weight in the vicinity of $(\pi,\pi)$.
In this wave-vector region, robust spin incommensurate features develop with
increasing doping. The branch of the spectrum with rung direction wave-vector
$k_{rung}=0$ does not change substantially with doping where pairing dominates,
and thus plays a minor role. We discuss the implications of our results for
neutron scattering experiments, where the spin excitation dynamics of

tool of choice for cloud structure analysis and star formation studies. Its
simplicity is attractive, and the PDF could offer access to cloud physical
parameters otherwise difficult to measure, but there has been some confusion in
the literature on the definition of its completeness limit and shape at the low
column density end. In this Letter we use the natural definition of the
completeness limit of a column density PDF, the last closed column-density
contour inside a surveyed region, and apply it to a set of large-scale maps of
nearby molecular clouds. We conclude that there is no observational evidence
for log-normal PDFs in these objects. We find that all studied molecular clouds
have PDFs well described by power-laws, including the diffuse cloud Polaris.
Our results call for a new physical interpretation for the shape of the column
density PDFs. We find that the slope of a cloud PDF is invariant to distance
but not to the spatial arrangement of cloud material, and as such it is still a
useful tool to investigate cloud structure.

LAT-RTV uses the product of gradient and local activity measurement to boost
the performance of image smoothing. Experimental results are presented to

resulted in a breadth of inferential strategies that both create opportunities
for more reliable inference as well as complicate the choices that an applied
researcher has to make and defend. Relatedly, researchers advocating for new
methods typically compare their method to at best 2 or 3 other causal inference
strategies and test using simulations that may or may not be designed to
equally tease out flaws in all the competing methods. The causal inference data
analysis challenge, ""Is Your SATT Where It's At?"", launched as part of the 2016
Atlantic Causal Inference Conference, sought to make progress with respect to
both of these issues. The researchers creating the data testing grounds were
distinct from the researchers submitting methods whose efficacy would be
evaluated. Results from 30 competitors across the two versions of the
competition (black box algorithms and do-it-yourself analyses) are presented
along with post-hoc analyses that reveal information about the characteristics
of causal inference strategies and settings that affect performance. The most
consistent conclusion was that methods that flexibly model the response surface
perform better overall than methods that fail to do so. Finally new methods are
proposed that combine features of several of the top-performing submitted

  We present a general approach to such problems, using a `junta approximation

$H^+$-free hypergraph is essentially contained in a `junta' -- a hypergraph
determined by a small number of vertices -- that is also $H^+$-free, which
effectively reduces the extremal problem to an easier problem on juntas. Using
this approach, we obtain, for all $C<k<n/C$, a complete solution of the
extremal problem for a large class of $H$'s, which includes the aforementioned
problems, and solves them for a large new set of parameters.
  We apply our method also to the 1974 Erd\H{o}s-Chv\'{a}tal simplex
conjecture, which asserts that for any $d < k \leq \frac{d}{d+1}n$, the maximal
size of a $k$-uniform family that does not contain a $d$-simplex (i.e., $d+1$

phase transition at a large but finite density could nevertheless be important
to determine the maximum mass of compact stars. In particular, in the range
$3\leq N_{c}\lesssim5.5$ the quark phase would take place in compact stars and
would lead to the formation of an unstable branch of hybrid stars. As a
consequence, the maximum mass is restricted to the range
$2.1M_{\odot}<M_{max}<3M_{\odot}$. For larger value of $N_{c}$, the phase
transition would occur at densities too high to be reached in the core of
compact stars. However, the very requirement that it occurs (although at a very
large density) translates into interesting constraints on the stiffness of the
baryonic phase: its speed of sound must exceed $\sqrt{1/3}$.

state-space ${\sf X}$, whose transition probabilities are parameterized by a
real-valued vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. Under the assumption that
$\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is geometrically ergodic with corresponding stationary
distribution $\pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, we are interested in estimating the

$$\alpha(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \pi( \boldsymbol{\theta}) f.$$
  To this end, we first give sufficient conditions for the differentiability of
$\alpha(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and for the calculation of its gradient via a
sequence of finite horizon expectations. We then propose two different
likelihood ratio estimators and analyze their limiting behavior.

spins 1 and 2 were investigated. A technique of simultaneous Ramsey
interferometry was developed for individual control of the vectors of two spins
with almost the same Zeeman splittings. The mixture of spinor condensates is
generated in the transversely polarized spin-1 and the longitudinally polarized
spin-2 states. The time evolution of the spin-1 condensate exhibits dephasing
and rephasing of the Larmor precession due to the interaction with the spin-2
condensate. The scattering lengths between spin-1 and -2 atoms were estimated
by comparison with the numerical simulation using the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. The proposed technique is expected to facilitate the further study of
multiple spinor condensates.

  Models using Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new method for calculating joint-state posteriors of
mixed-audio features using deep neural networks to be used in factorial speech
processing models. The joint-state posterior information is required in
factorial models to perform joint-decoding. The novelty of this work is its
architecture which enables the network to infer joint-state posteriors from the
pairs of state posteriors of stereo features. This paper defines an objective
function to solve an underdetermined system of equations, which is used by the
network for extracting joint-state posteriors. It develops the required
expressions for fine-tuning the network in a unified way. The experiments
compare the proposed network decoding results to those of the vector Taylor
series method and show 2.3% absolute performance improvement in the monaural
speech separation and recognition challenge. This achievement is substantial
when we consider the simplicity of joint-state posterior extraction provided by
deep neural networks.

describes particles of different species hopping clockwise on a ring with
parameters giving the hopping rates for different species. We introduce a
combinatorial object that we call \emph{toric rhombic alternative tableaux},
which are certain fillings of tableaux on a triangular lattice tiled with
rhombi, and are in bijection with the well-studied \emph{multiline queues} of
Ferrari and Martin. Using the tableaux, we obtain a formula for the stationary
probabilities of this TASEP, which specializes to results of Ayyer and
Linusson. We obtain, in addition, an explicit determinantal formula for these
probabilities, and define a Markov chain on the tableaux that projects to the
two-species TASEP on a ring.

  velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line","6 pages, 5 figures, ApJ Letters accepted",,"10.1007/s11671-010-9750-7",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The properties of the dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been
investigated in detail, mainly focusing on the geometry and components;
however, the kinematics of the torus is still not clear. The narrow iron
K$\alpha$ line at 6.4 keV is thought to be produced by the X-ray reflection
from the torus. Thus, the velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of it is able
to constrain the kinematics of the torus. Such effort is limited by the
spectral resolution of current CCD detectors and should be possible with the
microcalorimeter on the next generation X-ray satellite. In this paper, we
first construct the response functions of the torus under a uniform inflow, a
Keplerian rotation, and a uniform outflow. Then the energy-dependent light
curve of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line is simulated according to the
performance of the X-ray Integral Field Unit in Athena. Finally, the
energy-dependent cross-correlation function is calculated to reveal the
kinematic signal. According to our results, one hundred observations with 5 ks
exposure of each are sufficient to distinguish the above three velocity fields.
Although the real geometry and velocity field of the torus could be more
complex than we assumed, the present result proves the feasibility of the
velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line. The
combination of the dynamics of the torus with those of the broad line region
and the host galaxy is instructive for the understanding of the feeding and
feedback process of AGNs.

frequency band 20-475 Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the range of
[-1.0, +0.1]e-8 Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby spinning and
slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy. This search uses
the data from Advanced LIGO's first observational run, O1. No periodic
gravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were placed on their
strengths. The lowest upper limits on worst-case (linearly polarized) strain
amplitude h0 are 4e-25 near 170 Hz. For a circularly polarized source (most
favorable orientation), the smallest upper limits obtained are 1.5e-25. These
upper limits refer to all sky locations and the entire range of frequency
derivative values. For a population-averaged ensemble of sky locations and
stellar orientations, the lowest upper limits obtained for the strain amplitude
are 2.5e-25.

  Ising model","28 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the Ising model at its critical temperature with external
magnetic field $ha^{15/8}$ on the square lattice with lattice spacing $a$. We
show that the truncated two-point function in this model decays exponentially
with a rate independent of $a$. As a consequence, we show exponential decay in
the near-critical scaling limit Euclidean magnetization field. For the lattice
model with $a=1$, the mass (inverse correlation length) is of order $h^{8/15}$
as $h\downarrow 0$; for the Euclidean field, it equals exactly $Ch^{8/15}$ for
some $C$. Although there has been much progress in the study of critical
scaling limits, results on near-critical models are far fewer due to the lack
of conformal invariance away from the critical point. Our arguments combine
lattice and continuum FK representations, including coupled conformal loop and
measure ensembles, showing that such ensembles can be useful even in the study
of near-critical scaling limits. Thus we provide the first substantial
application of measure ensembles.

machine learning. The simplest method for PCA, the power iteration, requires
$\mathcal O(1/\Delta)$ full-data passes to recover the principal component of a
matrix with eigen-gap $\Delta$. Lanczos, a significantly more complex method,
achieves an accelerated rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ passes. Modern
applications, however, motivate methods that only ingest a subset of available
data, known as the stochastic setting. In the online stochastic setting, simple
algorithms like Oja's iteration achieve the optimal sample complexity $\mathcal
O(\sigma^2/\Delta^2)$. Unfortunately, they are fully sequential, and also
require $\mathcal O(\sigma^2/\Delta^2)$ iterations, far from the $\mathcal
O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ rate of Lanczos. We propose a simple variant of the power
iteration with an added momentum term, that achieves both the optimal sample
and iteration complexity. In the full-pass setting, standard analysis shows
that momentum achieves the accelerated rate, $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$. We
demonstrate empirically that naively applying momentum to a stochastic method,
does not result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis
that reveals the ""breaking-point variance"" beyond which this acceleration does
not occur. By combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques,
we construct stochastic PCA algorithms, for the online and offline setting,
that achieve an accelerated iteration complexity $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$.
Due to the embarassingly parallel nature of our methods, this acceleration
translates directly to wall-clock time if deployed in a parallel environment.
Our approach is very general, and applies to many non-convex optimization
problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique.

modulation to acquire two-dimensional spectra by isolating specific nonlinear
contributions to the photoluminescence or photocurrent excitation signal. We
demonstrate that an incoherent contribution to the measured lineshape, arising
from nonlinear population dynamics over the entire photoexcitation lifetime,
generates a similar lineshape to the expected 2D coherent spectra in
condensed-phase systems. In those systems, photoexcitations are mobile such
that inter-particle interactions are important on any timescale, including
those long compared to the 2D coherent experiment. Measurements on a
semicrystalline polymeric semiconductor film at low temperature show that, in
some conditions in which multi-exciton interactions are suppressed, the
technique predominantly detects coherent signal and can be used, in our
example, to extract homogeneous linewidths. The same method used on a
lead-halide perovskite photovoltaic cell shows that incoherent population
mixing of mobile photocarriers can dominate the measured signal since
carrier-carrier bimolecular scattering is active even at low excitation
densities, which hides the coherent contribution to the spectral lineshape.

necessary condition is developed to indicate the distance between the current
operating point and the power flow solvability boundary. Compared to existing
methods, the operating condition-dependent critical loading factor provided by
the proposed condition is less conservative and is closer to the actual power
flow solution space boundary. The proposed method only requires the present
snapshots of voltage phasors to monitor the power flow insolvability and
voltage stability. Hence, it is computationally efficient and suitable to be
applied to a power distribution system with volatile DG outputs. The accuracy
of the proposed necessary condition and the index is validated by simulations
on a distribution test system with different DG penetration levels.

[as its point spread function (PSF) is broader than the PSF of the broad-line
region (BLR)], but from hot and young stars, the same ones that probably
account for the observed sigma-drop. (2) There is a correlation between
redshift and the full width at half-maximum of the BLR emission lines. With a
simple model assuming gravitational redshift, we described it as an emitting
ring with varying emitting radii and small inclination angles. (3) There is an
H II region close to the AGN, which is composed of many substructures forming
an apparent spiral with a velocity gradient. (4) We also detected a probable
outflow coming from the AGN and it seems to contaminate the H II region

kinematics, and survival as they fall through the magnetized Galactic halo. For
a reasonable model for the halo magnetic field, most infalling clouds see
transverse rather than radial field lines. We find that significant compression
(and thereby amplification) of the ambient magnetic field occurs in front of
the cloud and in the tail of material stripped from the cloud. The compressed
transverse field attenuates hydrodynamical instabilities. This delays cloud
destruction, though not indefinitely. The observed B-field compression is
related to the cloud's distance from the Galactic plane. As a result, the
observed rotation measure provides useful distance information on a cloud's
location.

Hence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based

Bose gases in optical lattices. We assume that the barrier is created by local
suppression of the hopping amplitude. When the system is in a close vicinity of
the Mott transition at commensurate fillings, where an approximate
particle-hole symmetry emerges, there exist bound states of Higgs amplitude
mode that are localized around the barrier. By applying the Gutzwiller
mean-field approximation to the Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze properties of
normal modes of the system with a special focus on the Higgs bound states. We
show that when the system becomes away from the Mott transition point, the
Higgs bound states turn into quasi-bound states due to inevitable breaking of
the particle-hole symmetry. We use a stabilization method to compute the
resonance energy and line width of the quasi-bound states. We compare the
results obtained by the Gutzwiller approach with those by the Ginzburg-Landau
theory. We find that the Higgs bound states survive even in a parameter region
far from the Mott transition, where the Ginzburg-Landau theory fails.

hundreds of layers and $10$,$000$s of nodes. Such network sizes entail
significant computational complexity due to the large number of convolutions
that need to be carried out; in addition, a large number of parameters needs to
be learned and stored. Very deep and wide CNNs may therefore not be well suited
to applications operating under severe resource constraints as is the case,
e.g., in low-power embedded and mobile platforms. This paper aims at
understanding the impact of CNN topology, specifically depth and width, on the
network's feature extraction capabilities. We address this question for the
class of scattering networks that employ either Weyl-Heisenberg filters or
wavelets, the modulus non-linearity, and no pooling. The exponential feature
map energy decay results in Wiatowski et al., 2017, are generalized to
$\mathcal{O}(a^{-N})$, where an arbitrary decay factor $a>1$ can be realized
through suitable choice of the Weyl-Heisenberg prototype function or the mother
wavelet. We then show how networks of fixed (possibly small) depth $N$ can be
designed to guarantee that $((1-\varepsilon)\cdot 100)\%$ of the input signal's
energy are contained in the feature vector. Based on the notion of
operationally significant nodes, we characterize, partly rigorously and partly
heuristically, the topology-reducing effects of (effectively) band-limited
input signals, band-limited filters, and feature map symmetries. Finally, for
networks based on Weyl-Heisenberg filters, we determine the prototype function
bandwidth that minimizes---for fixed network depth $N$---the average number of
operationally significant nodes per layer.

demonstrate this through the construction of $p$-adic analogs of two families

Pricing a leasing contract
is complicated because the leasing rate embodies an expectation of the residual

decisions, the paper develops resale price forecasting models. A peculiarity of
the leasing business is that forecast errors entail different costs.
Identifying effective ways to address this characteristic is the main objective
of the paper. More specifically, the paper contributes to the literature
through i) consolidating and integrating previous work in forecasting with
asymmetric cost of error functions, ii) systematically evaluating previous
approaches and comparing them to a new approach, and iii) demonstrating that
forecasting with asymmetric cost of error functions enhances the quality of
decision support in car leasing. For example, under the assumption that the
costs of overestimating resale prices is twice that of the opposite error,
incorporating corresponding cost asymmetry into forecast model development
reduces decision costs by about eight percent, compared to a standard
forecasting model. Higher asymmetry produces even larger improvements.

injection is a mass-to-charge dependent process. We performed hybrid
simulations of collisionless shocks and analyzed a joint injection of $p$ and

results equally apply to C and O fully ionized ions, since they have similar

source-sink pairs, and the goal is to find a subgraph of minimum total length
such that all pairs are connected. The problem is APX-Hard and can be
2-approximated by, e.g., the elegant primal-dual algorithm of Agrawal, Klein,
and Ravi from 1995.
  We give a local-search-based constant-factor approximation for the problem.
Local search brings in new techniques to an area that has for long not seen any
improvements and might be a step towards a combinatorial algorithm for the more
general survivable network design problem. Moreover, local search was an
essential tool to tackle the dynamic MST/Steiner Tree problem, whereas dynamic
Steiner Forest is still wide open.
  It is easy to see that any constant factor local search algorithm requires
steps that add/drop many edges together. We propose natural local moves which,
at each step, either (a) add a shortest path in the current graph and then drop
a bunch of inessential edges, or (b) add a set of edges to the current
solution. This second type of moves is motivated by the potential function we
use to measure progress, combining the cost of the solution with a penalty for
each connected component. Our carefully-chosen local moves and potential
function work in tandem to eliminate bad local minima that arise when using
more traditional local moves.

originating from a metastable magnetic field-induced canting of chromium
sublattice in the presence of gadolinium moments in GdCrTiO5 at low
temperatures. Compared to the isostructural neodymium compound, significant
differences of magnetism and magnetoelectric effects are seen. We present the
results of thorough investigations of temperature and magnetic field dependent
magnetization as well as ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. These bulk
measurements are complemented by local-probe spectroscopy utilizing
electron-spin resonance and muon-spin rotation/relaxation for probing the
chromium moments. Ferroelectric order is inferred from pyro- and magnetocurrent
measurements. GdCrTiO5 shows a pyrocurrent signal around 10 K, only if the
system is cooled in an applied magnetic field exceeding 10 kOe. A distinct
spin-driven ferroelectric order is revealed in this state for temperatures
below 10 K, which can be switched by changing magnetic-field direction and the
polarity of the electric field. But, the magnetic measurements reveal no clear
signature of long-range magnetic ordering. The presence of such
meta-magnetoelectric-type behaviour in the absence of any meta-magnetic
behavior is rare in the literature. Our microscopic spectroscopy results
indicate significant changes of the magnetic properties around 10 K. Probably
there is an exchange frustration between Gd and Cr moments, which prevents
long-range magnetic ordering at further high temperature. Below 10 K, weak
magnetic ordering occurs by minimizing frustration due to lattice distortion,
which helps in magnetodielectric coupling. However, the non-polar distortion
attains appreciable values after application of magnetic fields above 10 kOe to
break the spatial inversion symmetry, which creates ferroelectricity.

  Anti-concentration","in FOCS 2017",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.OC math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several fundamental problems that arise in optimization and computer science
can be cast as follows: Given vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_m \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and a
constraint family ${\cal B}\subseteq 2^{[m]}$, find a set $S \in \cal{B}$ that
maximizes the squared volume of the simplex spanned by the vectors in $S$. A
motivating example is the data-summarization problem in machine learning where
one is given a collection of vectors that represent data such as documents or
images. The volume of a set of vectors is used as a measure of their diversity,
and partition or matroid constraints over $[m]$ are imposed in order to ensure
resource or fairness constraints. Recently, Nikolov and Singh presented a
convex program and showed how it can be used to estimate the value of the most
diverse set when ${\cal B}$ corresponds to a partition matroid. This result was
recently extended to regular matroids in works of Straszak and Vishnoi, and
Anari and Oveis Gharan. The question of whether these estimation algorithms can
be converted into the more useful approximation algorithms -- that also output
a set -- remained open.
  The main contribution of this paper is to give the first approximation
algorithms for both partition and regular matroids. We present novel
formulations for the subdeterminant maximization problem for these matroids;
this reduces them to the problem of finding a point that maximizes the absolute
value of a nonconvex function over a Cartesian product of probability
simplices. The technical core of our results is a new anti-concentration
inequality for dependent random variables that allows us to relate the optimal
value of these nonconvex functions to their value at a random point. Unlike
prior work on the constrained subdeterminant maximization problem, our proofs
do not rely on real-stability or convexity and could be of independent interest
both in algorithms and complexity.

infection modelling. A variety of different approaches have been proposed in
the literature. We study the performance of a number of such methods, and
characterize their performance in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and
generality. To this end, we consider first the classic stochastic
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, and then a multi-dimensional
generalization of this which allows for Erlang distributed infectious periods.
We find that (i) for a below-threshold infection initiated by a small number of
infected individuals, approximation via a linear branching process works well;
(ii) for an above-threshold infection initiated at endemic equilibrium, methods
from Hamiltonian statistical mechanics yield correct asymptotic behaviour as
population size becomes large; (iii) the widely-used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
diffusion approximation gives a very poor approximation, but may retain some
value for qualitative comparisons in certain cases; (iv) a more detailed
diffusion approximation can give good numerical approximation in certain
circumstances, but does not provide correct large population asymptotic
behaviour, and cannot be relied upon without some form of external validation
(eg simulation studies).

different theoretical and practical representations have been proposed to
answer the usual queries in multiple domains. However, ternary relations have
not received as much attention, even though many real-world applications
require the processing of ternary relations. In this paper we present a new
compressed and self-indexed data structure that we call Interleaved $K^2$-tree
(I$K^2$-tree), designed to compactly represent and efficiently query general
ternary relations. The I$K^2$-tree is an evolution of an existing data
structure, the $K^2$-tree, initially designed to represent Web graphs and later
applied to other domains. The I$K^2$-tree is able to extend the $K^2$-tree to
represent a ternary relation, based on the idea of decomposing it into a
collection of binary relations but providing indexing capabilities in all the
three dimensions. We present different ways to use I$K^2$-tree to model
different types of ternary relations using as reference two typical domains:
RDF and Temporal Graphs. We also experimentally evaluate our representations
comparing them in space usage and performance with other solutions of the state
of the art.

one neighbor not in M, this neighbor is added to M. The power domination number
of a graph G is the minimum size of a set S such that this process ends up with

geometrical characteristics of the trajectories in state space, in four-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-and W-type states, coupled to common and
independent classical random telegraph noise (RTN) sources. It is shown from
numerical simulations that: (i) the dynamics of entanglement depends
drastically not only on the input configuration of the qubits and the presence
or absence of memory effects, but also on whether the qubits are coupled to the
RTN in a CE or IEs; (ii) a considerable amount of entanglement can be
indefinitely trapped when the qubits are embedded in a CE; (iii) the CE
configuration preserve better the entanglement initially shared between the
qubits than the IEs, however, for W-type states, there is a period of time
and/or certain values of the purity for which, the opposite can be found.
Thanks to results obtained in our earlier works on the three-qubit model, we
are able to conclude that entanglement becomes more robustly protected from
decay when the number of qubits of the system increases. Finally, we find that
the trajectories in state space of the system quantified by the quantum Jensen
Shannon divergence (QJSD) between the time-evolved states of the qubits and
some reference states may be curvilinear or chaotic.

Those are well de- fined solutions of Hermitian equations used to describe many

leaky electromagnetic cavities require the use of bi-orthogonal eigenbasis.
Physical consequences of non-Hermiticity challenge our physical understanding.
However, the usual need to compensate for energy losses made the few successful
attempts to probe non-Hermiticity extremely complicated. We show that this
issue can be overcome considering localized plasmonic systems. Indeed, since
the non-Hermiticity in these systems does not stem from from temporal
invariance breaking but from spatial symmetry breaking, its consequences can be
observed more easily. We report on the theoretical and experimental evidence of
non-Hermiticity induced strong coupling between surface plasmon modes of
different orders within silver nano-crosses. The sym- metry conditions for
triggering this counter-intuitive self-hybridization phenomenon are provided.

the in-plane current induced spin torque observed in the normal

ferromagnet much thinner than its spin diffusion length, such as Pt/Co with
$\sim 10$nm thickness, our approach addresses simultaneously the two
contributions to the spin torque, namely the spin-transfer torque (SHE-STT) due
to SHE induced spin injection, and the spin-orbit torque (SOT) due to SOC
induced spin accumulation. The SOC produces an effective magnetic field at the
interface, hence it modifies the angular momentum conservation expected for the
SHE-STT. The SHE induced spin voltage and the interface spin current are
mutually dependent, hence are solved in a self-consistent manner. In addition,
the spin transport mediated by the quantum well states may be responsible for
the experimentally observed rapid variation of the spin torque with respect to
the thickness of the ferromagnet.

$H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming finite element space and a Hybrid
Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) formulation of the viscous forces.
$H(\operatorname{div})$-conformity results in favourable properties such as
pointwise divergence free solutions and pressure-robustness. However, for the
approximation of the velocity with a polynomial degree $k$ it requires unknowns
of degree $k$ on every facet of the mesh. In view of the superconvergence
property of other HDG methods, where only unknowns of polynomial degree $k-1$
on the facets are required to obtain an accurate polynomial approximation of
order $k$ (possibly after a local post-processing) this is sub-optimal. The key
idea in this paper is to slightly relax the $H(\operatorname{div})$-conformity
so that only unknowns of polynomial degree $k-1$ are involved for
normal-continuity. This allows for optimality of the method also in the sense
of superconvergent HDG methods. In order not to loose the benefits of
$H(\operatorname{div})$-conformity we introduce a cheap reconstruction operator
which restores pressure-robustness and pointwise divergence free solutions and
suits well to the finite element space with relaxed
$H(\operatorname{div})$-conformity. We present this new method, carry out a
thorough $h$-version error analysis and demonstrate the performance of the

systems, deepening understanding of the many-body physics behind. Here we
review the nonlinear and collective dynamics in a periodically modulated
magneto-optically trapped cold atoms. By temporally modulating the intensity of
the trapping lasers with the controlled phases, one can realize two kinds of
nonlinear oscillators, the parametrically driven oscillator and the resonantly
driven Duffing oscillator, which exhibit the dynamical bistable states. Cold
atoms behave not only as the single-particle nonlinear oscillators, but also as
the coupled oscillators by the light-induced inter-atomic interaction, which
leads to the phase transitions far from equilibrium in a way similar to the
phase transition in equilibrium. The parametrically driven cold atoms show the
ideal mean-field symmetry-breaking transition, and the symmetry is broken with
respect to time translation by the modulation period. Such a phase transition
results from the cooperation and competition between the inter-particle
interaction and the fluctuations, which lead to the nonlinear switching of
atoms between the vibrational states, and the experimentally measured critical
characteristics prove it as the ideal mean-field transition class. On the other
hand, the resonantly driven cold atoms that possess the coexisting periodic
attractors exhibit the kinetic phase transition analogous to the discontinuous
gas-liquid phase transition in equilibrium, and interestingly the global
interaction between atoms causes the shift of the phase-transition boundary.

high-performance computing, and cloud applications, parallel network systems
will increasingly follow suit. Today, parallelism is an essential architectural
feature of 40/100/400 Gigabit Ethernet standards, whereby high speed Ethernet
systems are equipped with multiple parallel network interfaces. This creates
new network topology abstractions and new technology requirements: instead of a
single high capacity network link, multiple Ethernet end-points and interfaces
need to be considered together with multiple links in form of discrete parallel
paths. This new paradigm is enabling implementations of various new features to
improve overall system performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance
of parallel network systems with network coding. In particular, by using random
LNC (RLNC), - a code without the need for decoding, we can make use of the fact
that we have codes that are both distributed (removing the need for
coordination or optimization of resources) and composable (without the need to
exchange code information), leading to a fully stateless operation. We propose
a novel theoretical modeling framework, including derivation of the upper and
lower bounds as well as an expected value of the differential delay of parallel
paths, and the resulting queue size at the receiver. The results show a great
promise of network system parallelism in combination with RLNC: with a proper
set of design parameters, the differential delay and the buffer size at the
Ethernet receiver can be reduced significantly, while the cross-layer design
and routing can be greatly simplified.

Intuitively, the voids and narrow gaps that characterise the crystal form an
interconnected network of Helmholtz-like resonators. We use this intuition to
argue that these continuous photonic (phononic) crystals are in fact
asymptotically equivalent, at low frequencies, to discrete capacitor-inductor
(mass-spring) networks whose lumped parameters we derive explicitly. The
crystals are tantamount to metamaterials as their entire acoustic branch, or
branches when the discrete analogue is polyatomic, is squeezed into a
subwavelength regime where the ratio of wavelength to period scales like the
ratio of period to gap width raised to the power 1/4; at yet larger wavelengths
we accordingly find a comparably large effective refractive index. The fully
analytical dispersion relations predicted by the discrete models yield
dispersion curves that agree with those from finite-element simulations of the
continuous crystals. The insight gained from the network approach is used to
show that, surprisingly, the continuum created by a closely packed hexagonal
lattice of cylinders is represented by a discrete honeycomb lattice. The
analogy is utilised to show that the hexagonal continuum lattice has a
Dirac-point degeneracy that is lifted in a controlled manner by specifying the
area of a symmetry-breaking defect.

Specifically, equilibria characterised by the same initial structural
properties (Plummer density profile) and with different degrees of
tangentially-biased (radially-biased) anisotropy, reach core collapse earlier

accelerated (delayed) phase of the early evolution of collisional stellar
systems ""anisotropic-response""), which we have characterised both in terms of
the evolution of the velocity moments and of a fluid model of two-body
relaxation. For the case of the most tangentially anisotropic model the initial
phase of evolution involves a catastrophic collapse of the inner part of the
system which continues until an isotropic velocity distribution is reached.
This study represents a first step towards a comprehensive investigation of the
role played by kinematic richness in the long-term dynamical evolution of

`projections' on the $j$-dimensional cochains for $0 \leq j \leq k$. The random
walk shrinks each of these parts by a factor of $\frac{k+1-j}{k+2}$ plus an
error term that depends on the spectral expansion. %Our two Decomposition
Theorems differ in their assumptions on the local spectral gaps - we derive
different Decomposition Theorems for the cases of one-sided local spectral gap
and two-sided local spectral gap.

the prospects to realize interstellar spaceflight within a few decades. Here we
examine passive deceleration via momentum braking from ionized interstellar
media. The very large area to mass relations needed as a consequence of the low
interstellar densities, of the order of 0.1 particles per $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, or
lower, are potentially realizable with magnetic sails generated by
superconducting coils. Integrating the equations of motion for interstellar
protons hitting a Biot Savart loop we evaluate the effective reflection area
$A(v)$ in terms of the velocity $v$ of the craft. We find that the numerical
data is fitted over two orders of magnitude by the scaling relation $A(v)\ =\
0.081A_R\log^3(I/(\beta I_c))$, where $A_R=\pi R^2$ is the bare sail area, $I$
the current and $\beta=v/c$. The critical current $I_c$ is $1.55\cdot10^6$
Ampere. The resulting universal deceleration profile can be evaluated
analytically and mission parameters optimized for a minimal craft mass.
  For the case of a sample high speed transit to Proxima Centauri we find that
magnetic momentum braking would involve daunting mass requirements of the order
of $10^3$ tons. A low speed mission to the Trappist-1 system could be realized
on the other side already with a 1.5 ton spacecraft, which would be furthermore
compatible with the specifications of currently envisioned directed energy
launch systems. The extended cruising times of the order of $10^4$ years imply
however that a mission to the Trappist-1 system would be viable only for
mission concepts for which time constrains are not relevant.

dark matter vortex in the spacetime of a stationary axisymmetric Kerr black
hole. In analytical calculations the dark matter sector was modeled by an
addition of a U (1)-gauge field coupled to the visible sector. The backreaction
analysis revealed that the impact of the dark vortex presence is far more
complicated than causing only a deficit angle. The vortex causes an ergosphere
shift and the event horizon velocity is also influenced by its presence. These
phenomena are more significant than in the case of a visible vortex sector. The
area of the event horizon of a black hole is diminished and this decline is
larger in comparison to the Kerr black hole with an Abelian Higgs vortex case.
After analyzing the gravitational properties for the general setup, we focused
on the subset of models that are motivated by particle physics. We retained the
Abelian Higgs model as a description of the dark matter sector (this sector
contained a heavy dark photon and an additional complex scalar) and added a
real scalar representing the real component of the Higgs doublet in the unitary
gauge, as well as an additional U (1)-gauge field representing an ordinary
electromagnetic field. Moreover, we considered two coupling channels between
the visible and dark sectors, which were the kinetic mixing between the gauge
fields and a quartic coupling between the scalar fields. After solving the
equations of motion for the matter fields numerically we analyzed properties of
the cosmic string in the dark matter sector and its influence on the visible
sector fields that are directly coupled to it. We found out that the presence
of the cosmic string induced spatial variation in the vacuum expectation value
of the Higgs field and a nonzero electromagnetic field around the black hole.

cosmological backgrounds with convergent asymptotics. The condition of
convergence corresponds to the requirement that the second fundamental form,
when suitably normalised, converges. The model examples are the Kasner
solutions. The main result of the article is optimal energy estimates. However,
we also derive asymptotics and demonstrate that the leading order asymptotics
can be specified.
  It is sometimes argued that if the factors multiplying the spatial
derivatives decay exponentially (for a system of wave equations), then the
spatial derivatives can be ignored. This line of reasoning is incorrect: we
give examples of equations such that
  1) the factors multiplying the spatial derivatives decay exponentially,
  2) the factors multiplying the time derivatives are constants,
  3) the energies of individual modes of solutions asymptotically decay
exponentially, and
  4) the energies of generic solutions grow as $e^{e^{t}}$ as $t\rightarrow
\infty$.
  When the factors multiplying the spatial derivatives grow exponentially, the
Fourier modes of solutions oscillate with a frequency that grows exponentially.
To obtain asymptotics, we fix a mode and consider the net evolution over one
period. Moreover, we replace the evolution (over one period) with a matrix
multiplication. We cannot calculate the matrices, but we approximate them. To
obtain the asymptotics we need to calculate a matrix product where there is no
bound on the number of factors, and where each factor can only be approximated.
Nevertheless, we obtain detailed asymptotics. In fact, it is possible to
isolate an overall behaviour (growth/decay) from the (increasingly violent)
oscillatory behaviour. Moreover, we are also in a position to specify the
leading order asymptotics.

and outputs in a pictorial way using an operad of wiring diagrams. Each
dynamical system is a box with certain inputs and outputs, and multiple
dynamical systems are linked together using wiring diagrams, which describe how
the outputs of one dynamical system to the inputs of another. By describing
dynamical systems in this way, we can decompose a large dynamical system as a
collection of smaller, simpler dynamical systems linked together. Of course,
this decomposition is only useful if we can work with these smaller, simpler
dynamical systems instead of the larger one. In his paper, Spivak shows that we
can perform Euler's method on these smaller systems and still get the same
results as working on the larger one. In this paper, we extend his results to
prove that we can do something similar with the Runge-Kutta method. However, we
need to modify the framework used in Spivak's paper to account for the fact
that the Runge-Kutta method requires multiple steps, unlike Euler's method. To
better describe these systems, we define wiring diagrams as objects of a
double-category and dynamical systems in terms of double functors, giving a
categorical description of this approximation method.

holographic string model, has thus far been entirely missing in the literature.
This paper fills in this gap. Using the delocalized type IIA SYZ mirror (with
$SU(3)$ structure) of the holographic type IIB dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD of
arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 as constructed in arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at finite

wrapping a vanishing two-cycle in the top-down holographic construct of
arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 = ${\cal O}(1)$ in the IR in the MQGP limit of
arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at the end of a Seiberg duality cascade), we obtain
analytical (not just numerical) expressions for the vector and scalar meson
spectra and compare our results with previous calculations of hep-th/0412141,
arXiv:1409.0559 [hep-th], and obtain a closer match with the Particle Data
Group (PDG) results (Chin. Phys. C, 38, 090001 (2014) and 2015 update). Through
explicit computations, we verify that the vector and scalar meson spectra
obtained by the gravity dual with a black hole for all temperatures (small and
large) are nearly isospectral with the spectra obtained by a thermal gravity
dual valid for only low temperatures; the isospectrality is much closer for
vector mesons than scalar mesons. The black hole gravity dual (with a horizon
radius smaller than the deconfinement scale) also provides the expected
large-$N$ suppressed decrease in vector meson mass with an increase of
temperature.

Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$, and are consisted of two similar layer of buckled SiN sheet.
Similarly, \gamma-phase is consisted of two puckered SiN sheets. For these
phases, the two layers are connected with Si-Si covalent bonds. Transformation
between \alpha- and \beta-phases is difficult because of the high energy
barrier. Phonon spectra of both \alpha- and \beta-phase suggest their
thermodynamic stabilities, because no phonon mode with imaginary frequency is
present. By Contrast, \gamma-phase is unstable because phonon modes with
imaginary frequencies are found along \Gamma-Y path in the Brilliouin zone.
Both \alpha- and \beta-phase are semiconductor with narrow fundamental indirect
band gap of 1.7eV and 1.9eV, respectively. As expected, only s and p orbitals
in the outermost shells contribute the band structures. The p$_{z}$ orbitals
have greater contribution near the Fermi level. These materials can easily
exfoliate to form 2D structures, and may have potential electronic
applications.

moving mirrors and find that they grow with time. Hence, they are not
suppressed in comparison with the semi--classical contributions. Thus, we
observe the break down of the perturbation theory, discuss its physical origin
and ways to deal with such a situation.

using time-limited balanced truncation, which restricts the well known balanced
truncation framework to prescribed finite time intervals. The main emphasis is
on the efficient numerical realization of this model reduction approach in case
of large system dimensions. We discuss numerical methods to deal with the
resulting matrix exponential functions and Lyapunov equations which are solved
for low-rank approximations. Our main tool for this purpose are rational Krylov
subspace methods. We also discuss the eigenvalue decay and numerical rank of
the solutions of the Lyapunov equations. These results, and also numerical
experiments, will show that depending on the final time horizon, the numerical
rank of the Lyapunov solutions in time-limited balanced truncation can be
smaller compared to standard balanced truncation. In numerical experiments we
test the approaches for computing low-rank factors of the involved Lyapunov
solutions and illustrate that time-limited balanced truncation can generate
reduced order models having a higher accuracy in the considered time region.

II, in the AGB stars of NGC 6752. This depression is much greater than that
expected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in
particular the dominant effect of overionisation. Here we attempt to reproduce
the apparent Fe discrepancy, and investigate differences in reported sodium
abundances. We compare in detail the methods and results of the recent study
with those of an earlier study of NGC 6752 AGB stars. Iron and sodium
abundances are derived using Fe I, Fe II, and Na I lines. Various uncertainties
are explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,
using different observational data and computational tools. Further
investigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly
dependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise
uncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using
the infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\rm{eff}}$ scales used by
both the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated
temperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression. Our IRFM temperatures result
in negligible apparent depression, consistent with theory. We also re-derived
sodium abundances and, remarkably, found them to be unaffected by the new
temperature scale. [Na/H] in the AGB stars is consistent between all studies.
Since Fe is constant, it follows that [Na/Fe] is also consistent between
studies, apart from any systematic offsets in Fe. We recommend the use of
$(V-K)$ relations for AGB stars. We plan to investigate the effect of the
improved temperature scale on other elements, and re-evaluate the subpopulation
distributions on the AGB, in the next paper of this series. [abridged]

theory of gravity, known as MOG (for MOdified Gravity), proposed to address the
dark matter problem. This theory introduces two scalar fields $G(x)$ and
$\mu(x)$, and one vector field $\phi_{\alpha}(x)$, in addition to the metric
tensor. We set the corresponding self-interaction potentials to zero, as in the
standard form of MOG. Then using the phase space analysis in the flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, we show that the theory possesses a
viable sequence of cosmological epochs with acceptable time dependency for the
cosmic scale factor. We also investigate MOG's potential as a dark energy model
and show that extra fields in MOG cannot provide a late time accelerated
expansion. Furthermore, using a dynamical system approach to solve the
non-linear field equations numerically, we calculate the angular size of the
sound horizon, i.e. $\theta_{\text{s}}$, in MOG. We find that $8\times
10^{-3}\text{rad}<\theta_{\text{s}}<8.2\times 10^{-3} \text{rad} $ which is way
outside the current observational bounds. Finally, we generalize MOG to a
modified form called mMOG, and we find that mMOG passes the sound-horizon
constraint. However, mMOG also cannot be considered as a dark energy model
un;ess one adds a cosmological constant, and more importantly, the matter
dominated era is still slightly different from the standard case.

phase transition in holographic approach. We argue that their criticality is
controlled by the holographic scaling geometry with deformations induced by a
relevant operator at finite temperature. Specifically, in the quantum critical
region controlled by a single fixed point, the butterfly velocity decreases
when deviating from the critical point. While, in the non-critical region, the
behavior of the butterfly velocity depends on the specific phase at low
temperature. Moreover, in the holographic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition, the universal behavior of the butterfly velocity is absent.
Finally, the tendency of our holographic results matches with the numerical
results of Bose-Hubbard model. A comparison between our result and that in the

We consider here no-idle/no-wait shop scheduling problems with makespan as
performance measure and determine related complexity results. We first analyze
the two-machine no-idle/no-wait flow shop problem and show that it is
equivalent to a special version of the game of dominoes which is polynomially
solvable by tackling an Eulerian path problem on a directed graph. We present
for this problem an O(n) exact algorithm. As a byproduct we show that the
Hamiltonian Path problem on a digraph G(V,A) with a special structure (where
every pair of vertices i,j either has all successors in common or has no common
successors) reduces to the two-machine no-idle/no-wait flow shop problem.
Correspondingly, we provide a new polynomially solvable special case of the
Hamiltonian Path problem. Then, we show that also the corresponding $m$-machine
no-idle no-wait flow shop problem is polynomially solvable and provide an O(mn

shop problem and the 2-machine no-idle/no-wait open shop problem are NP-Hard in

varying polytropic uid suggested recently by the first author. On going
research in both directions, i.e. dark energy and non-gravitational
interaction, opens very interesting perspectives for solving the problems which
are related to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. The fact that
available observational data allows to parametrize the dark side of our
Universe in form of interacting dark uids is not less surprising, than the
accelerated expansion itself. Therefore, the consideration of new forms of
non-gravitational interactions in modern cosmology still is one of the actual
topics and requires deep and systematic research. This fact motivates us to
consider various new forms of non-gravitational logarithmic interactions and
study their cosmological consequences. Appropriate classification of the models
is presented in the light of actively discussed Om analysis and the result for
the Hubble parameter measured at z = 2:34 in BOSS experiment.

disc continuum emission of 80 Be stars observed in different epochs. In this
way, we determined 169 specific disc structures, namely their density scale,
$\rho_0$, and exponent, $n$. We found that the $n$ values range mainly between
$1.5$ and $3.5$, and $\rho_0$ varies between $10^{-12}$ and
$10^{-10}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$, with a peak close to the lower value. Our
large sample also allowed us to firmly establish that the discs around
early-type stars are denser than in late-type stars. Additionally, we estimated
the disc mass decretion rates and found that they range between $10^{-12}$ and
$10^{-9}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$. These values are compatible with recent
stellar evolution models of fast-rotating stars. One of the main findings of
this work is a correlation between the $\rho_0$ and $n$ values. In order to
find out whether these relations can be traced back to the evolution of discs
or have some other origin, we used the VDD model to calculate temporal
sequences under different assumptions for the time profile of the disc mass
injection. The results support the hypothesis that the observed distribution of
disc properties is due to a common evolutionary path. In particular, our
results suggest that the timescale for disc growth, during which the disc is
being actively fed by mass injection episodes, is shorter than the timescale
for disc dissipation, when the disc is no longer fed by the star and dissipates
as a result of the viscous diffusion of the disc material.

the computational complexity grows exponentially with the $K$. To address those

open. While numerical simulations feature a large number and complexity of
involved physical processes, this plenty of effects may hide the fundamentals
that determine the evolution of molecular clouds and enable the formation of
stars. Purely analytical models, on the other hand, tend to suffer from rough
approximations or a lack of completeness, limiting their predictive power. In
this paper, we present a model that incorporates central concepts of
astrophysics as well as reliable results from recent simulations of molecular

self-consistent semi-analytical framework that describes the formation,
evolution and star formation activity of molecular clouds, including a number
of feedback effects to account for the complex processes inside those objects.
The final equation system is solved numerically but at much lower computational
expense than, e.g., hydrodynamical descriptions of comparable systems. The
model presented in this paper agrees well with a broad range of observational
results, showing that molecular cloud evolution can be understood as an
interplay between accretion, global collapse, star formation and stellar

  We consider capacities of single-antenna autonomous terminals communicating
to the LIS where the entire surface is used as a receiving antenna array. Under
the condition that the surface-area is sufficiently large, the received signal
after a matched-filtering (MF) operation can be closely approximated by a
sinc-function-like intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. We analyze the
capacity per square meter (m^2) deployed surface, \hat{C}, that is achievable
for a fixed transmit power per volume-unit, \hat{P}. Moreover, we also show
that the number of independent signal dimensions per m deployed surface is
2/\lambda for one-dimensional terminal-deployment, and \pi/\lambda^2 per m^2
for two and three dimensional terminal-deployments. Lastly, we consider
implementations of the LIS in the form of a grid of conventional antenna
elements and show that, the sampling lattice that minimizes the surface-area of
the LIS and simultaneously obtains one signal space dimension for every spent
antenna is the hexagonal lattice. We extensively discuss the design of the
state-of-the-art low-complexity channel shortening (CS) demodulator for
data-transmission with the LIS.

flavours is modified in strong magnetic field by calculating the thermodynamic
observables of hot QCD matter up to one-loop, where the magnetic field affects
mainly the quark contribution and the gluonic part is largely unaffected except
for the softening of the screening mass due to the strong magnetic field. To
begin with the effect of magnetic field on the thermodynamics, we have first
calculated the pressure of a thermal QCD medium in strong magnetic field limit
(SML), where the pressure at fixed temperature increases with the magnetic
field faster than the increase with the temperature at constant magnetic field.
This can be envisaged from the dominant scale of thermal medium in SML, which
is the magnetic field, like the temperature in thermal medium in absence of
strong magnetic field. Thus although the presence of strong magnetic field
makes the pressure of hot QCD medium harder but the increase of pressure with
respect to the temperature becomes less steeper. Corroborated to the above
observations, the entropy density is found to decrease with the temperature in
the ambience of strong magnetic field which resonates with the fact that the
strong magnetic field restricts the dynamics of quarks in two dimensions, hence
the phase space gets squeezed resulting the reduction of number of microstates.
Moreover the energy density is seen to decrease and the speed of sound of
thermal QCD medium is increased in the presence of strong magnetic field. These
crucial findings in strong magnetic field could have phenomenological
implications in heavy ion collisions because the expansion dynamics of the
medium produced in noncentral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is
effectively controlled by both the energy density and the speed of sound.

from 4 K to 40 K and in fields up to 7 T. From an analysis of the temperature
dependence of the self-field critical current density Jc(T) that takes into
account weak link behavior and proximity effect, we study the grain boundaries
(GB) transparency to supercurrents and we establish a relationship between GB
oxygenation in the different steps of the fabrication process and the GB
transparency to supercurrents. We find that grain boundary oxygenation starts
in the first crystallization stage, but it becomes complete in the plateau at
836 {\deg}C and in slow cooling stages, and is further enhanced in the
prolonged post annealing step. Such oxygenation makes GBs more conducting, thus
improving the inter-grain Jc value and temperature dependence. On the other
hand, from the inspection of the Tc values in the framework of the phase
diagram dome, we find that grains are oxygenated already in the crystallization
step up to the optimal doping, while successive slow cooling and post annealing
treatments further enhance the degree of overdoping, especially if carried out
in oxygen atmosphere rather than in air.

gas giants. We have found that planetary evolution significantly affects not
only the time-scale of exomoon migration but also its final fate. Thus, if any
change in planetary radius, internal mass distribution and rotation occurs in
time-scales lower or comparable to orbital evolution, exomoon may only migrate
outwards and prevent tidal disruption or a collision with the planet. If
exomoons are discovered in the future around close-in giant planets, our
results may contribute to constraint planetary evolution and internal structure
models.

equivalence of two approaches --- action and order-by-order gravity equation
approach --- for cosmological perturbation theory, and establish that both lead
to equivalent results for any gravity models at any order of perturbations. We
then focus on Hamiltonian formalism that has not been studied extensively in
the literature. We provide a generalized Hamiltonian approach for cosmological
perturbations which is equivalent to the Lagrangian approach. We show that, the
approach can be applied to any model at any order of perturbations. Using this
approach, we show that evaluating interaction Hamiltonian is simpler and
efficient than earlier approach. In the next work, we concentrate on
generalized non-canonical scalar field and by introducing a new variable
provide a technique to write Hamiltonian for generalized non-canonical scalar
field. We then implement our Hamiltonian approach for non-canonical scalar
field and evaluate interaction Hamiltonian without slow-roll approximations.
Finally, for the first time, we construct a vector Galileon model in curved
space-time in which, the field equations do not contain any higher-derivative
terms, yet, preserving U(1) gauge-invariance. Conformal invariance is broken in
this model which leads to primordial magnetogenesis and we compare the

certain solutions of the differential equation defining them are not. We
exploit this by numerically precomputing the logarithms of carefully chosen
solutions of the associated Legendre differential equation and representing
them via piecewise trivariate Chebyshev expansions. These precomputed
expansions, which allow for the rapid evaluation of the associated Legendre
functions over a large swath of parameter domain mentioned above, are
supplemented with asymptotic and series expansions in order to cover it
entirely. The results of numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of
our approach are presented, and our code for evaluating the associated Legendre
functions is publicly available.

associated with 47% of all road accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication has the potential of preventing up to 35% of such serious road
collisions. In fact, under the 5G/LTE Rel.15+ standardization, V2V is a
critical use-case not only for the purpose of enhancing road safety, but also
for enabling traffic efficiency in modern smart cities. Under this anticipated
5G definition, high reliability of 0.99999 is expected for semi-autonomous
vehicles (i.e., driver-in-the-loop). As a consequence, there is a need to
assess the reliability, especially for accident-prone areas, such as
intersections. We unpack traditional average V2V reliability in order to
quantify its related fine-grained V2V reliability. Contrary to existing work on
infinitely large roads, when we consider finite road segments of significance
to practical real-world deployment, fine-grained reliability exhibits bimodal
behavior. Performance for a certain vehicular traffic scenario is either very
reliable or extremely unreliable, but nowhere in relative proximity to the
average performance.

predictable signals. Second, we adapt hierarchical structures of residual
convolutional units to train multi-factor crime prediction models. Experiments

hinder fast system-wide estimation and real-time control and optimization of
operations. This paper studies graph reduction methods of power grids that are
favorable for fast simulations and follow-up applications. While the classical
Kron reduction has been successful in reduced order modeling of power grids
with traditional, hierarchical design, the selection of reference nodes for the
reduced model in a multiscale, distribution and transmission, network becomes
ambiguous. In this work we extend the use of the iterative Kron reduction by
utilizing the electric grid's graph topology for the selection of reference
nodes, consistent with the design features of multiscale networks.
Additionally, we propose further reductions by aggregation of coherent
subnetworks of triangular meshes, based on the graph topology and network
characteristics, in order to preserve currents and build another power-flow
equivalent network.
  Our reductions are achieved through the use of iterative aggregation of
sub-graphs that include general tree structures, lines, and triangles.
Important features of our reduction algorithms include that: (i) the reductions
are, either, equivalent to the Kron reduction, or otherwise produce a
power-flow equivalent network; (ii) due to the former mentioned power-flow
equivalence, the reduced network can model the dynamic of the swing equations
for a lossless, inductive, steady state network; (iii) the algorithms
efficiently utilize hash-tables to store the sequential reduction steps.

Subsequently, other kinds of statistical functions are proposed to characterize

functions, and the contour statistical functions. Based on a large amount of
historical observations, these functions are employed to statistically quantify

phase change between the liquid and gas phases are simulated directly without
using any phase change models. The numerical method is validated by comparing
numerical results with analytical solutions for the vaporization of n-heptane

n-heptane drops impacting on a solid wall with different temperatures are
studied numerically. The results show that the size of the film formed by drop
impact decreases when temperature increases. When the temperature is high
enough, the drop will rebound.
