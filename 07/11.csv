tens of seconds after the initial spike of magnetar giant flares. It has been
conjectured that this emission might arise via inverse Compton scattering in a
highly extended corona generated by super-Eddington outflows high up in the
magnetosphere. In this paper we undertake a detailed examination of this model.
We investigate the properties of the required scatterers, and whether the
mechanism is consistent with the degree of pulsed emission observed in the tail
of the giant flare. We conclude that the mechanism is consistent with current
data, although the origin of the scattering population remains an open
question. We propose an alternative picture in which the emission is closer to
that star and is dominated by synchrotron radiation. The $RHESSI$ observations
of the December 2004 flare modestly favor this latter picture. We assess the

an apparent increase was recently seen with newly detected VLA bursts. It is
expected that more repeating FRB sources may be detected in the future. In this
work, we investigate a list of possible astrophysical processes that might
cause DM variation of a particular FRB source. The processes include (1) the
cosmological scale effects such as Hubble expansion and large-scale structure
fluctuations; (2) the FRB local effects such as gas density fluctuation,
expansion of a supernova remnant, a pulsar wind nebula, and an HII region; and
(3) the propagation effect due to plasma lensing. We find that the DM
variations contributed by the large-scale structure are extremely small, and
any observable DM variation is likely caused by the plasma local to the FRB
source. Besides mechanisms that produce decreasing DM with time, we suggest
that an FRB source in an expanding supernova remnant around a nearly neutral
ambient medium during the deceleration (Sedov-Taylor and snowplow) phases or in
a growing HII region can introduce DM increasing. Some effects (e.g. an FRB
source moving in an HII region or plasma lensing) can give either positive or
negative DM variations. Future observations of DM variations of FRB 121102 and
other repeating FRB sources can bring important clues for the physical origin

other non-Abelions often requires a symmetry leading to a gap in a
single-particle spectra. Disorder introduces states into the gap and enables
conductance and proximity-induced superconductivity via the in-gap states. We
show that disorder-enabled topological superconductivity can be realized in a
quantum Hall ferromagnet, when helical domain walls are coupled to an s-wave
superconductor. Solving a general quantum mechanical problem of impurity bound
states in a system of spin-orbit coupled Landau levels, we show that
disorder-induced Majorana modes emerge in a setting of the quantum Hall
ferromagnetic transition in a CdMnTe quantum wells at a filling factor $\nu=2$.
Recent experiments on transport through electrostatically controlled single
domain wall in this system indicated the vital role of disorder in conductance,
but left an unresolved question whether this could intrinsically preclude
generation of Majorana fermions. The proposed resolution of the problem,
demonstrating emergence of Majorana fermions exclusively due to impurity
disorder, opens a path forward. We show that electrostatic control of domain
walls in an integer quantum Hall ferromagnet allows manipulation of Majorana
modes. Similar physics can emerge for ferromagnetic transitions in the
fractional quantum Hall regime leading to the formation and control of higher
order non-Abelian excitations.

magnetism in the ISM and a troublesome contaminant for studies of CMB
polarization. In each case, an understanding of the significance of the
polarization signal requires well-calibrated physical models of dust grains.
Despite decades of progress in theory and observation, polarized dust models
remain largely underconstrained. During its 2012 flight, the balloon-borne
telescope BLASTPol obtained simultaneous broad-band polarimetric maps of a
translucent molecular cloud at 250, 350, and 500 microns. Combining these data
with polarimetry from the Planck 850 micron band, we have produced a
submillimeter polarization spectrum for a cloud of this type for the first
time. We find the polarization degree to be largely constant across the four
bands. This result introduces a new observable with the potential to place
strong empirical constraints on ISM dust polarization models in a previously
inaccessible density regime. Comparing with models by Draine and Fraisse
(2009), our result disfavors two of their models for which all polarization
arises due only to aligned silicate grains. By creating simple models for
polarized emission in a translucent cloud, we verify that extinction within the
cloud should have only a small effect on the polarization spectrum shape
compared to the diffuse ISM. Thus we expect the measured polarization spectrum
to be a valid check on diffuse ISM dust models. The general flatness of the
observed polarization spectrum suggests a challenge to models where temperature
and alignment degree are strongly correlated across major dust components.

strongest heating and erosion rate, thus exposing the subsurface most pristine
material. In this work we investigate, thanks to the OSIRIS images, the
geomorphology, the spectrophotometry and some transient events of two Southern
hemisphere regions: Anhur and part of Bes. Bes is dominated by outcropping
consolidated terrain covered with fine particle deposits, while Anhur appears
strongly eroded with elongated canyon-like structures, scarp retreats,
different kinds of deposits, and degraded sequences of strata indicating a
pervasive layering. We discovered a new 140 m long and 10 m high scarp formed
in the Anhur/Bes boundary during/after the perihelion passage, close to the
area where exposed CO$_2$ and H$_2$O ices were previously detected. Several
jets have been observed originating from these regions, including the strong
perihelion outburst, an active pit, and a faint optically thick dust plume. We
identify several areas with a relatively bluer slope (i.e. a lower spectral
slope value) than their surroundings, indicating a surface composition enriched
with some water ice. These spectrally bluer areas are observed especially in
talus and gravitational accumulation deposits where freshly exposed material
had fallen from nearby scarps and cliffs. The investigated regions become
spectrally redder beyond 2 au outbound when the dust mantle became thicker,
masking the underlying ice-rich layers.

natural linewidth of 350 kHz offers an interesting possibility to study
different regimes of a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The intermediate value of
the spectral linewidth of the cooling transition allows the observation of
three distinct regimes depending on intensity and detuning of the cooling
beams. Namely, the ""bowl-shaped"" regime when light pressure force competes with
gravity, the ""double structure"" regime with interplay between Doppler and
polarization-gradient (sub-Doppler) cooling, and the ""symmetric"" regime when
Doppler cooling dominates over sub-Doppler cooling and gravity. The
polarization-gradient cooling manifests itself by a two-temperature momentum
distribution of atoms resulting in a double-structure of the spatial MOT
profile consisting of a cold central fraction surrounded by a hot halo. We
studied the ""double structure"" regime at different saturation parameters and

high-profile attacks on cyber-physical systems. An attacker that manages to
access a local network could remotely affect control performance by tampering
with sensor measurements delivered to the controller. Recent results have shown
that with network-based attacks, such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks, the
attacker can introduce an unbounded state estimation error if measurements from
a suitable subset of sensors contain false data when delivered to the
controller. While these attacks can be addressed with the standard
cryptographic tools that ensure data integrity, their continuous use would
introduce significant communication and computation overhead. Consequently, we
study effects of intermittent data integrity guarantees on system performance
under stealthy attacks. We consider linear estimators equipped with a general
type of residual-based intrusion detectors (including $\chi^2$ and SPRT
detectors), and show that even when integrity of sensor measurements is
enforced only intermittently, the attack impact is significantly limited;
specifically, the state estimation error is bounded or the attacker cannot
remain stealthy. Furthermore, we present methods to: (1) evaluate the effects
of any given integrity enforcement policy in terms of reachable
state-estimation errors for any type of stealthy attacks, and (2) design an
enforcement policy that provides the desired estimation error guarantees under
attack. Finally, on three automotive case studies we show that even with less
than 10% of authenticated messages we can ensure satisfiable control
performance in the presence of attacks.

the base spaces of the cones, the actions must be conjugate by this map. The
converse is false in general, conjugacy of actions is not sufficient for
quasi-isometry of the respective warped cones. For a general quasi-isometry of
warped cones, using the asymptotically faithful covering constructed in a
previous work with Jianchao Wu, we deduce that the two groups are
quasi-isometric after taking Cartesian products with suitable powers of the
integers.
  Secondly, we characterise geometric properties of a group (coarse
embeddability into Banach spaces, asymptotic dimension, property A) by
properties of the warped cone over an action of this group. These results apply
to arbitrary asymptotically faithful coverings, in particular to box spaces. As
an application, we calculate the asymptotic dimension of a warped cone, improve
bounds by Szab\'o, Wu, and Zacharias and by Bartels on the amenability
dimension of actions of virtually nilpotent groups, and give a partial answer
to a question of Willett about dynamic asymptotic dimension.
  In the appendix, we justify optimality of the aforementioned result on
general quasi-isometries by showing that quasi-isometric warped cones need not
come from quasi-isometric groups, contrary to the case of box spaces.

of sites currently in $S$, and $m$ is the number of vertices of $P$, and
updates in $O(\sqrt{n}\log^3 m)$ time. The space usage is $O(n\log m + m)$. If
only insertions are allowed, we can support queries in worst-case $O(\log^2

Although advantages of using group information have been well-studied by
shrinkage-based approaches, benefits of group sparsity have not been
well-documented for greedy-type methods, which much limits our understanding
and use of this important class of methods. In this paper, generalizing from a
popular forward-backward greedy approach, we propose a new interactive greedy
algorithm for group sparsity learning and prove that the proposed greedy-type
algorithm attains the desired benefits of group sparsity under high dimensional
settings. An estimation error bound refining other existing methods and a
guarantee for group support recovery are also established simultaneously. In
addition, we incorporate a general M-estimation framework and introduce an
interactive feature to allow extra algorithm flexibility without compromise in
theoretical properties. The promising use of our proposal is demonstrated
through numerical evaluations including a real industrial application in human
activity recognition at home. Supplementary materials for this article are

second-order conic programming respectively, do not converge to the global
infimum. The same goes for the r-DSOS and r-SDSOS hierarchies. This refutes the
claim in the literature according to which the DSOS and SDSOS hierarchies can
solve any polynomial optimization problem to arbitrary accuracy. In contrast,
the Lasserre hierarchy based on semidefinite programming yields the global
infimum and the global minimizer with the first order relaxation. We further
observe that the dual to the SDSOS hierarchy is the moment hierarchy where
every positive semidefinite constraint is relaxed to all necessary second-order
conic constraints. As a result, the number of second-order conic constraints
grows quadratically in function of the size of the positive semidefinite

suggests that DSOS and SDSOS are not necessarily more tractable alternatives to

dimension-six operators. The latter theory is marginal in six dimensions and
contains modes with a wrong-sign propagator, echoing the behavior of conformal
gravity. The dimension-six Lagrangian is uniquely determined by demanding that
its scattering amplitudes obey the color-kinematics duality. The conformal
gravity amplitudes obtained from the double copy are compared with the
Berkovits-Witten twistor string and shown to agree up to at least eight points
in the MHV sector. Our construction can be generalized in a number of ways.
Adding scalars to the dimension-six theory gives Maxwell-Weyl gravity, and
further adding phi^3 self-interactions among these scalars gives
Yang-Mills-Weyl gravity. The latter is identified with Witten's twistor string
for maximal N=4 supersymmetry. Deforming the dimension-six theory by adding a
Yang-Mills term, m^2 F^2, gives a gauge theory that interpolates between

representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of

What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper
takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the
relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting
the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we
investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this
data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising
(and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision
tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second,
we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of
promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a
better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art
results for different vision tasks including image classification, object
detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is
that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop
collective efforts in building larger datasets.

amplitude of the lensing B-modes (parameter $A_{lens}$), jointly with the
estimation of the astrophysical foregrounds including both synchrotron and

of the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain $r$ in the presence of
realistic lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior
distribution of $r$ and $A_{lens}$, which we improve by adopting a prior on
$A_{lens}$ taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement. As it applies
to the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on $r$
that is due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B-modes by lensing, unlike
standard delensing techniques that are performed on maps. However, the method
allows to correct for the bias on $r$ induced by lensing, at the expense of a
larger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We
quantify, for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off
between bias correction and increase of uncertainty on $r$. For LiteBIRD
simulations, which include foregrounds and lensing contamination, we find that
correcting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the lensing
bias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a $3\sigma$ detection
of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$. The significance of the detection is increased to
$6\sigma$ when the current SPT prior on $A_{lens}$ is adopted.

depend on stellar conditions near the super-massive black hole (SMBH), which
are on difficult-to-measure sub-parsec scales. We test whether $R_\text{TDE}$
depends on kpc-scale global galaxy properties, which are observable. We
concentrate on stellar surface mass density, $\Sigma_{M_\star}$, and velocity
dispersion, $\sigma_v$, which correlate with the stellar density and velocity
dispersion of the stars around the SMBH. We consider 35 TDE candidates, with
and without known X-ray emission. The hosts range from star-forming to
quiescent to quiescent with strong Balmer absorption lines. The last (often
with post-starburst spectra) are overrepresented in our sample by a factor of
$35^{+21}_{-17}$ or $18^{+8}_{-7}$, depending on the strength of the H$\delta$
absorption line. For a subsample of hosts with homogeneous measurements,
$\Sigma_{M_\star}=10^9$-$10^{10}~{\rm M_\odot / kpc^2}$, higher on average than
for a volume-weighted control sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with
similar redshifts and stellar masses. This is because: (1) most of the TDE
hosts here are quiescent galaxies, which tend to have higher $\Sigma_{M_\star}$
than the star-forming galaxies that dominate the control, and (2) the
star-forming hosts have higher average $\Sigma_{M_\star}$ than the star-forming
control. There is also a weak suggestion that TDE hosts have lower $\sigma_v$
than for the quiescent control. Assuming that $R_{\rm TDE}\propto
\Sigma_{M_\star}^\alpha \times \sigma_v^\beta$, and applying a statistical
model to the TDE hosts and control sample, we estimate $\hat{\alpha}=0.9 \pm
0.2$ and $\hat{\beta}=-1.0 \pm 0.6$. This is broadly consistent with
$R_\text{TDE}$ being tied to the dynamical relaxation of stars surrounding the
SMBH.

unexplained 3.5 keV line from galaxy clusters. A promising model, which can
explain the morphology of the signal and its non-observation in dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, involves a 7 keV dark matter particle decaying into a pair
of ultra-light axions that convert into photons in the magnetic field of the
clusters. Given that light axions emerge naturally in 4D string vacua, in this
paper we present a microscopic realisation of this model within the framework
of type IIB flux compactifications. Dark matter is a local closed string axion
which develops a tiny mass due to subdominant poly-instanton corrections to the
superpotential and couples via kinetic mixing to an almost massless open string
axion living on a D3-brane at a singularity. The interaction of this
ultra-light axion with photons is induced by U(1) kinetic mixing. After
describing the Calabi-Yau geometry and the brane set-up, we discuss in depth
moduli stabilisation, the resulting mass spectrum and the strength of all
relevant couplings.

freeze-out of DM annihilations into RHNs. Due to the inert nature of the RHNs,
we show that it is possible for the two sectors to remain thermally decoupled
by having more than two generations of the RHNs. The hotter temperature implies
higher abundances of DM and RHNs with the following consequences. For
leptogenesis, an enhancement in efficiency up to a factor of 51.6 can be
obtained, though a resonant enhancement of CP violation is still required due
to an upper mass bound of about 4 TeV for the RHNs. For the DM, an enhanced
annihilation cross section up to a factor of 51.6 is required to obtain the
correct DM abundance. This scenario can be probed via indirect detection of DM
annihilating into RHNs, which then decay into $h\,\nu$, $Z\,\nu$ and $W^{\pm}

while simultaneously optimizing the size distribution of the MaNGA integral
field units (IFUs), the IFU allocation strategy, and the target density to
produce a survey defined in terms of maximizing S/N, spatial resolution, and
sample size. Our selection strategy makes use of redshift limits that only
depend on i-band absolute magnitude ($M_i$), or, for a small subset of our
sample, $M_i$ and color (NUV-i). Such a strategy ensures that all galaxies span
the same range in angular size irrespective of luminosity and are therefore
covered evenly by the adopted range of IFU sizes. We define three samples: the
Primary and Secondary samples are selected to have a flat number density with
respect to $M_i$ and are targeted to have spectroscopic coverage to 1.5 and 2.5
effective radii (Re), respectively. The Color-Enhanced supplement increases the
number of galaxies in the low-density regions of color-magnitude space by
extending the redshift limits of the Primary sample in the appropriate color
bins. The samples cover the stellar mass range $5\times10^8 \leq M_* \leq
3\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ and are sampled at median physical resolutions of
1.37 kpc and 2.5 kpc for the Primary and Secondary samples respectively. We
provide weights that will statistically correct for our luminosity and
color-dependent selection function and IFU allocation strategy, thus correcting
the observed sample to a volume limited sample.

stochastic and it is not obvious from a region's initial conditions whether a
binary will form and, if it does, which stars will end up in which cluster. We
find the probability that a region will divide is mainly determined by its
virial ratio, and a virial ratio above 'equilibrium' is generally necessary for
binary formation. We also find that the mass ratio of the two clusters is
strongly influenced by the initial degree of spatial substructure in the

electromagnetic fields that are strongly confined inside optical cavities

of light-matter interaction at room temperature, for a wide variety of cavity
materials and geometries. Understanding the universal features of such organic
cavities represents a significant challenge for theoretical modelling, as
experiments show that these systems are characterized by an intricate
competition between coherent and dissipative processes involving entangled
nuclear, electronic and photonic degrees of freedom. In this review, we discuss
a new theoretical framework that can successfully describe organic cavities
under strong light-matter coupling. The theory combines standard concepts in
chemical physics and quantum optics to provide a microscopic description of
vibronic organic polaritons that is fully consistent with available
experiments, and yet is profoundly different from the common view of organic
polaritons. We show that by introducing a new class of vibronic polariton wave
functions with a photonic component that is dressed by intramolecular
vibrations, the new theory can offer a consistent solution to some of the
long-standing puzzles in the interpretation of organic cavity
photoluminescence. Throughout this review, we confront the predictions of the
model with spectroscopic observations, and describe the conditions under which
the theory reduces to previous approaches. We finally discuss possible
extensions of the theory to account for realistic complexities of organic

show that the optical line profiles produced by expanding TDE outflows are most
likely primarily emission features, rather than the P-Cygni profiles seen in
most supernova spectra. This is a result of the high line excitation
temperatures in the highly irradiated TDE gas. The outflow kinematics cause the
emission peak to be blueshifted and to have an asymmetric red wing. Such
features have been observed in some TDE spectra, and we propose that these may
be signatures of outflows. We also show that non-coherent scattering off of hot
electrons can broaden the emission lines by $\sim 10000$~km~s$^{-1}$, such that
in some TDEs the line width may be set by the electron scattering optical depth
rather than the gas kinematics. The scattering broadened line profiles produce
distinct, wing-shaped profiles that are similar to those observed in some TDE
spectra. The narrowing of the emission lines over time in these observed events
may be related to a drop in density rather than a drop in line-of-sight
velocity.

drive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even at arbitrarily small
dust-to-gas mass ratios. Here, we identify and study both resonant and new
non-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral
hydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\,k^{2}$). The
gas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external
accelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift
velocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\em all}
dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\mu$
around resonance, as $\sim\mu^{1/3}$ or $\sim \mu^{1/2}$ (depending on
wavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is
larger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic regime a
'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with
wavenumber, even for vanishingly small $\mu$ and values of the coupling
strength ('stopping time'). In the subsonic regime non-resonant instabilities
always exist, but their growth rates no longer increase indefinitely towards
small wavelengths. The dimensional scalings and qualitative behavior of the
instability do not depend sensitively on the drag law or equation-of-state of
the gas. The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing
dust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are
otherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds,
AGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the
character of these outflows and could drive clumping and/or turbulence in the

method. Image-based measurements of underfoot in average was 4mm less than
actual measures. Mean absolute error of underfoot length was 1.6mm, however
length obtained from side foot had 4.4mm mean absolute error. Furthermore,
based on t-test and f-test results, no significant difference between manual

Hofman and Maldacena. Conformal invariance allows parity-odd tensor-structures

stars were found using high-resolution spectra from the Magnetism in Massive
Stars (MiMeS) spectroscopic survey. Nitrogen abundances were obtained using
non-LTE equivalent widths and line profiles, and Monte Carlo simulation was
used to determine the error bounds of the measured nitrogen abundances due to
uncertainties in the adopted stellar parameters, continuum normalization, and
atomic data. In addition, the effects of the gravitational darkening and disk
contamination on the measured Be star nitrogen abundances were investigated.
About one third of the sample Be stars and half of the normal B-type stars have
nitrogen enrichments that may be due to rotational mixing in these rapidly
rotating objects. Corrections for gravitational darkening and disk
contamination do not significantly change the overall results for the Be star
sample. The average nitrogen abundance of the B and Be star samples coincide
with the solar abundance, although the dispersion in the nitrogen abundances is
much larger in the Be star sample. The Be star sample also has a significant
fraction of sub-solar nitrogen abundance objects which are not present in
significant numbers in the B star sample. This may point to yet unresolved
systematic errors in the analysis of the Be stars

one does not need an assumption of restricted eigenvalue type in order to
derive fast rates for the Lasso, while it is well-known to be mandatory for
linear regression for instance. Numerical results illustrate the benefits of
this penalized procedure compared to standard maximum likelihood approaches

(KPZ) equation. It has always been known that if during the discrete
integration of the KPZ equation the nearest-neighbor height-difference exceeds
a critical value, an instability appears and the integration diverges. One way
to avoid these instabilities is to replace the KPZ nonlinear-term by a function
of the same term that depends on a single adjustable parameter which is able to
control pillars or grooves growing on the interface. Here, we propose a
different integration method which consists of directly limiting the value
taken by the KPZ nonlinearity, thereby imposing a restriction rule that is
applied in each integration time-step, as if it were the growth rule of a
restricted discrete model, e.g. restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS). Taking the
discrete KPZ equation with restrictions to its dimensionless version, the
integration depends on three parameters: the coupling constant $g$, the inverse
of the time-step $k$, and the restriction constant $\varepsilon$ which is
chosen to eliminate divergences while keeping all the properties of the
continuous KPZ equation. We study in detail the conditions in the parameters'
space that avoids divergences in the 1-dimensional integration and reproduce
the scaling properties of the continuous KPZ with a particular parameter set.
We apply the tested methodology to the $d$-dimensional case ($d = 3,4$) with
the purpose of obtaining the growth exponent $\beta$, by establishing the
conditions of the coupling constant $g$ under which we recover known values
reached by other authors, in particular for the RSOS model. This method allows
us to infer that $d = 4$ is not the critical dimension of the KPZ universality
class, where the strong-coupling phase dissapears.

halos, we find the following results. BHs accrete gas at the Eddington rate
over $z = 9 - 6$. At $z = 6$, our most-massive BH has grown to $M_{\rm BH} = 4

out} \sim 2000 M_{\odot}$/yr) outflows of shock-heated low-density gas form at
$z \sim 7$, and propagate up to hundreds kpc. Star-formation is quenched over
$z = 8 - 6$, and the total SFR (SFR surface density near the galaxy center) is
reduced by a factor of $5$ ($1000$). We analyse the relative contribution of
multiple physical process: (i) disrupting cosmic filamentary cold gas inflows,
(ii) reducing central gas density, (iii) ejecting gas outside the galaxy; and
find that AGN feedback has the following effects at $z = 6$. The inflowing gas
mass fraction is reduced by $\sim 12 \%$, the high-density gas fraction is
lowered by $\sim 13 \%$, and $\sim 20 \%$ of the gas outflows at a speed larger
than the escape velocity ($500$ km/s). We conclude that quasar-host galaxies at
$z \geq 6$ are accreting non-negligible amount of cosmic gas, nevertheless AGN
feedback quenches their star formation dominantly by powerful outflows ejecting
gas out of the host galaxy halo.

owing to their confined geometry and electrostatic tunability. They have
offered an exceptional testbed for superconductivity, leading to the
realization of hybrid systems combining the macroscopic quantum properties of
superconductors with the possibility to control charges down to a single
electron. These advances brought semiconductor nanowires to the forefront of
efforts to realize topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. A prime
challenge to benefit from the topological properties of Majoranas is to reduce
the disorder in hybrid nanowire devices. Here, we show ballistic
superconductivity in InSb semiconductor nanowires. Our structural and chemical
analyses demonstrate a high-quality interface between the nanowire and a NbTiN
superconductor which enables ballistic transport. This is manifested by a
quantized conductance for normal carriers, a strongly enhanced conductance for
Andreev-reflecting carriers, and an induced hard gap with a significantly
reduced density of states. These results pave the way for disorder-free
Majorana devices.

in which the probe signal is at much lower frequency than the mechanical drive

by including Duffing and non-linear damping terms in a harmonic oscillator

superconductivity and magnetic order is known to coexist (such as some
heavy-fermion materials), the superconductivity is thought to be of an
unconventional nature. Recently, the conducting gas that lives at the interface
between the perovskite band insulators LaAlO$_3$ (LAO) and SrTiO$_3$ (STO) has
also been shown to host both superconductivity and magnetism. Most previous
research has focused on LAO/STO samples in which the interface is in the (001)

orientation, which has hexagonal symmetry at the interface, and has been
predicted to have potentially interesting topological properties, including
unconventional superconducting pairing states. Here we report measurements of
the magnetoresistance of (111) LAO/STO heterostructures at temperatures at
which they are also superconducting. As with the (001) structures, the
magnetoresistance is hysteretic, indicating the coexistence of magnetism and
superconductivity, but in addition, we find that this magnetoresistance is
anisotropic. Such an anisotropic response is completely unexpected in the
superconducting state, and suggests that (111) LAO/STO heterostructures may
support unconventional superconductivity.

reactive nitrogen compounds at benign conditions. Titania has been reported as
an active photocatalyst for reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia; however there
is little fundamental understanding of how this process occurs. In this work
the rutile (110) model surface is hypothesized to be the active site, and a
computational model based on the Bayesian error estimation functional
(BEEF-vdW) and computational hydrogen electrode is applied in order to analyze
the expected dinitrogen coverage at the surface as well as the overpotentials
for electrochemical reduction and oxidation. This is the first application of
computational techniques to photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, and the results
indicate that the thermodynamic limiting potential for nitrogen reduction on
rutile (110) is considerably higher than the conduction band edge of rutile
TiO$_2$, even at oxygen vacancies and iron substitutions. This work provides
strong evidence against the most commonly reported experimental hypotheses, and
indicates that rutile (110) is unlikely to be the relevant surface for nitrogen
reduction. However, the limiting potential for nitrogen oxidation on rutile
(110) is significantly lower, indicating that oxidative pathways may be
relevant on rutile (110). These findings suggest that photocatalytic dinitrogen
fixation may occur via a complex balance of oxidative and reductive processes.

investigations of surface adhesion. In fact, the shape of an adhered cantilever
carries information of the adhesion energy that locks one end to the substrate.
We demonstrate here that the system is also sensitive to the dispersion forces
that are operative very close to the point of contact, but their contribution
to the shape is maximum at about one third of the unadhered length. When the
force exceeds a critical value the cantilever does not lose stability but it
settles at smaller unadhered length, whose relation to adhesion energy is only
slightly affected by the force. Our calculations suggest to use adhered
cantilevers to measure the dispersion forces at short separations, where other
methods suffer from jump-to-contact instability. Simultaneous measurement of
the force and adhesion energy allows the separation of the dispersion
contribution to the surface adhesion.

consequently minimizing search effort. Moreover, it must infer such directions

of computing a heuristic that explicitly minimizes search effort. In this
paper, we do so by training a heuristic policy that maps the partial

Unfortunately, naively training such policies leads to slow convergence and
poor local minima. We present SaIL, an efficient algorithm that trains
heuristic policies by imitating ""clairvoyant oracles"" - oracles that have full
information about the world and demonstrate decisions that minimize search
effort. We leverage the fact that such oracles can be efficiently computed
using dynamic programming and derive performance guarantees for the learnt

that SaIL consistently outperforms state of the art algorithms. Our approach
paves the way forward for learning heuristics that demonstrate an anytime

solutions of the Hubbard model including the symmetry-broken phases. In this
method, the electron operator is factorized into a fermioninc spinon describing
the physical spin and a slave-spin describing the charge fluctuations.
Following the $U(1)$ formalism derived by Yu and Si [Phys. Rev. B 86, 085104
(2012)], it is shown that the self-consistent equations to explore various
symmetry-broken density wave states can be constructed in general with a
cluster of multiple slave-spin sites. We employ this method to study the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) state in the single band Hubbard model with the two and
four-site clusters of slave spins. While the Hubbard gap, the charge gap due to
the doubly-occupied states, scales with the Hubbard interaction $U$ as
expected, the AFM gap $\Delta$, the gap in the spinon dispersion in the AFM
state, exhibits a crossover from the weak to strong-coupling behaviors as $U$
increases. Our cluster slave-spin method reproduces not only the traditional
mean-field behavior of $\Delta \sim U$ in the weak-coupling limit, but also the
behavior of $\Delta \sim t^2/U$ predicted by the superexchange mechanism in the
strong coupling limit. In addition, the holon-doublon correlator as functions
of $U$ and doping $x$ is also computed, which exhibits a strong tendency toward
the holon-doublon binding in the strong coupling regime. We further show that
the quasiparticle weight obtained by the cluster slave-spin method is in a good
agreement with the generalized Gutzwiller approximation in both AFM and
paramagnetic states, and the results can be improved beyond the generalized
Gutzwiller approximation as the cluster is enlarged from a single site to 4
sites. Our results demonstrate that the cluster slave-spin method can be a
powerful tool to systematically investigate the strongly correlated system.

criteria for a workable reactor. We consider the reactions $ d + t \rightarrow
n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow
3 \alpha$ in this study. The critical temperature of the plasma is determined
from overcoming the stopping power of the beam with the fusion energy gain. The
needed plasma lifetime is determined from the width of the resonance, the beam
velocity and the plasma density. We estimate the critical beam flux by
balancing the energy of fusion production against the plasma thermo-energy and
the loss due to stopping power for the case of an inert plasma. The product of
critical flux and plasma lifetime is independent of plasma density and has a
weak dependence on temperature. Even though the critical temperatures for these
reactions are lower than those for the thermonuclear reactors, the critical
flux is in the range of $10^{22} - 10^{24}/\rm{cm^2/s}$ for the plasma density
$\rho_t = 10^{15}/{\rm cm^3}$ in the case of an inert plasma. Several
approaches to control the growth of the two-stream instability are discussed.

will require further studies. Finally, we consider the case where the injected

designed in order to energetically favor the principal interplanar angles of a
target crystal structure. This is achieved via an analysis performed by
examining the crystal's structure factor. This approach successfully yields
energetically stable simple cubic, diamond cubic, simple hexagonal, graphene

a particularly complex and technologically important crystal structure, we show
how this three-point correlation function method can be used to generate

paradigms in fMRI. It uses activity evoked by position-varying high luminance
contrast visual patterns presented throughout the visual field for determining
the spatial organization of cortical visual areas. While the advantage of using
high luminance contrast is that it tends to drive a wide range of neural
populations - thus resulting in high signal-to-noise BOLD responses - this may
also be a limitation, especially for approaches that attempt to squeeze more
information out of the BOLD response, such as population receptive field (pRF)
mapping. In that case, more selective stimulation of a subset of neurons -
despite reduced signals - could result in better characterization of pRF
properties. Here, we used a second-order stimulus based on local differences in
orientation texture - to which we refer as orientation contrast - to perform
retinotopic mapping. Participants in our experiment viewed arrays of Gabor
patches composed of a foreground (a bar) and a background. These could only be
distinguished on the basis of a difference in patch orientation. In our
analyses, we compare the pRF properties obtained using this new orientation
contrast-based retinotopy (OCR) to those obtained using classic luminance
contrast-based retinotopy (LCR). Specifically, in higher order cortical visual
areas such as LO, our novel approach resulted in non-trivial reductions in
estimated population receptive field size of around 30%. We discuss how OCR -
by limiting receptive field scatter and reducing BOLD displacement - may result
in more accurate pRF localization as well. We conclude that using our approach,
it is possible to selectively target particular neuronal populations, opening
the way to use pRF modeling to dissect the response properties of more
clearly-defined neuronal populations in different visual areas.

electromagnetic calculations. We first show that non-locality can significantly
modify the plasmonic response: it changes the energy of propagating plasmons up
to tens of percent. We then discuss how, by changing the distance between a
dipolar source and a semi-infinite 10 nm thin film, it is possible to control
the excitation of acoustic and optical propagating plasmons, which can
propagate over a distance of several plasmonic wavelengths. Furthermore, we
consider 10 nm thin TI nanodisks and study the excitation of acoustic and
optical localized plasmon modes by a point dipole source and plane wave
illumination, respectively. The resonant plasmonic modes appear at frequencies
that strongly depends on the size of the disk, and that can be potentially
tuned by applying electrostatic gating to modify the Fermi Energy of the
conductive 2-dimensional layer that forms at the interfaces of the TI. We
observe a spectral shift from ~29 $\mu$m to ~34 $\mu$m by changing the Fermi
Energy from 250meV to 350meV. Last, the electromagnetic energy of these
plasmonics modes can be confined to very small regions, of effective volume
~(120 nm)^3 for the smaller disk considered, much less than the free-space
wavelength cubed $\lambda$^3 ~(35000 nm)^3. The strong confinement is desirable
for achieving very efficient coupling with nearby systems. Our detailed study
thus shows that thin topological insulators are a promising system to control
both the spin and charge oscillations associated with the plasmonic resonances,

with a convex nose, like a sphere, produce a well defined splash with a
relatively large cavity behind the model. In contrast, we find that with a
concave nose, there is hardly a splash and the cavity extent is greatly
reduced. This may be explained by the fact that in the concave nosed case, the
initial impact is between a confined air pocket and the free surface unlike in
the convex nosed case. From measurements of the unsteady pressure in the
concave nose portion, we show that in this case, the maximum pressures are
significantly lower than the classically expected ""water hammer"" pressures and
also lower than those generally measured on other geometries. Thus, the
presence of an air pocket in the case of a concave nosed body adds an
interesting dimension to the classical problem of impact of solid bodies on to
a free surface.

excitons[1]. According to Hund's rules[2], the lowest energy exciton in organic
materials should be a poorly emitting triplet state. Analogously, the lowest
exciton level in all known inorganic semiconductors is believed to be optically
inactive. These 'dark' excitons (into which the system can relax) hinder
light-emitting devices based on semiconductor nanostructures. While strategies
to diminish their influence have been developed[3-5], no materials have been
identified in which the lowest exciton is bright. Here we show that the lowest
exciton in quasi-cubic lead halide perovskites is optically active. We first
use the effective-mass model and group theory to explore this possibility,
which can occur when the strong spin-orbit coupling in the perovskite
conduction band is combined with the Rashba effect [6-10]. We then apply our
model to CsPbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) nanocrystals[11], for which we measure size- and
composition-dependent fluorescence at the single-nanocrystal level. The bright
character of the lowest exciton immediately explains the anomalous
photon-emission rates of these materials, which emit 20 and 1,000 times
faster[12] than any other semiconductor nanocrystal at room[13-16] and
cryogenic[17] temperatures, respectively. The bright exciton is further
confirmed by detailed analysis of the fine structure in low-temperature
fluorescence spectra. For semiconductor nanocrystals[18], which are already
used in lighting[19,20], lasers[21,22], and displays[23], these optically
active excitons can lead to materials with brighter emission and enhanced
absorption. More generally, our results provide criteria for identifying other
semiconductors exhibiting bright excitons with potentially broad implications
for optoelectronic devices.

polynomial-time hard due to signomial constraints, we then propose an algorithm
to obtain a local optimum with polynomial complexity. Our framework serves as a
benchmark for pilot design in scenarios with either ideal or non-ideal

that electronic correlations are also important in the metallic phase of

highly compliant solids. The classic theories of contact mechanics describe
adhesion with a compliant substrate as a competition between surface energies
driving deformation to establish contact and bulk elasticity resisting this.
However, it has recently been shown that surface stresses provide an additional
restoring force that can compete with and even dominate over elasticity in
highly compliant materials, especially when length scales are small compared to
the ratio of the surface stress to the elastic modulus, $\Upsilon/E$. Here, we
investigate experimentally the contribution of surface stresses to the force of
adhesion. We find that the elastic and capillary contributions to the adhesive
force are of similar magnitude, and that both are required to account for
measured adhesive forces between rigid silica spheres and compliant, silicone
gels. Notably, the strain-dependence of the solid surface stress contributes
significantly to the stiffness of soft solid contacts.

analyze the general question of using problem structure in EAs focusing on
confronting work done in gray-box optimization with related research
accomplished in FDAs. This contrasted analysis helps us to identify, in current

approaches, which are usually overlooked, are identified and discussed.
Besides, an extensive review of previous research related to different uses of
the problem structure in EAs is presented. The paper also elaborates on some of
the questions that arise when extending the use of problem structure in EAs,

collection of objects to optimize some application specific objective function.
This problem is generally referred to as the Object Partitioning Problem (OPP)
and is known to be NP-hard. We here consider a particularly challenging version
of OPP, namely, the Stochastic On-line Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP). In
SO-EPP, the target partitioning is unknown and has to be inferred purely from
observing an on-line sequence of object pairs. The paired objects belong to the
same partition with probability $p$ and to different partitions with
probability $1-p$, with $p$ also being unknown. As an additional complication,
the partitions are required to be of equal cardinality. Previously, only
sub-optimal solution strategies have been proposed for SO- EPP. In this paper,
we propose the first optimal solution strategy. In brief, the scheme that we
propose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian network representation of SO-EPP
problems. Based on probabilistic reasoning, we are not only able to infer the
underlying object partitioning with optimal accuracy. We are also able to
simultaneously infer $p$, allowing us to accelerate learning as object pairs
arrive. Furthermore, our scheme is the first to support arbitrary constraints
on the partitioning (Constrained SO-EPP). Being optimal, BN-EPP provides
superior performance compared to existing solution schemes. We additionally
introduce Walk-BN-EPP, a novel WalkSAT inspired algorithm for solving large
scale BN-EPP problems. Finally, we provide a BN-EPP based solution to the
problem of order picking, a representative real-life application of BN-EPP.

standard model. Often these models are only considered as effective low energy
theory without any assumption about an UV completion. This leaves not only the
hierarchy problem of the SM unsolved, but introduces a copy of it because of
the new fundamental scalars responsible for breaking the new gauge group. A
possible solution is to embed these models into a supersymmetric framework.
However, this gives rise to an additional source of fine-tuning compared to the
MSSM and poses the question how natural such a setup is. One might expect that
the additional fine-tuning is huge, namely, $O(M^2_{\rm SUSY}/m^2_{Z'})$. In
this paper we point out that this is not necessarily the case. We show that it
is possible to find a focus point behaviour also in the new sector in
co-existence to the MSSM focus point. We call this 'Double Focus Point
Supersymmetry'. Moreover, we stress the need for a proper inclusion of
radiative corrections in the fine-tuning calculation: a tree-level estimate
would lead to predictions for the tuning which can be wrong by many orders of
magnitude. As showcase, we use the $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended MSSM and discuss
possible consequence of the observed $^8\textrm{Be}$ anomaly. However, similar
features are expected for other models with an extended gauge group which
involve potentially large Yukawa-like interactions of the new scalars.

Way (MW) field red giant stars observed by the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). These atypical giants exhibit strong Al
and N enhancements accompanied by C and Mg depletions, strikingly similar to
those observed in the so-called second-generation (SG) stars of globular
clusters (GCs). Remarkably, we find low-Mg abundances ([Mg/Fe]$<$0.0) together
with strong Al and N overabundances in the majority (5/7) of the metal-rich
([Fe/H]$\gtrsim - 1.0$) sample stars, which is at odds with actual observations
of SG stars in Galactic CGs of similar metallicities. This chemical pattern is
unique and unprecedented among MW stars, posing urgent questions about its
origin. These atypical stars could be former SG stars of dissolved GCs formed
with intrinsically lower abundances of Mg and enriched Al (subsequently
self-polluted by massive AGB stars) or the result of exotic binary systems. We
speculate that the stars Mg-deficiency as well as the orbital properties
suggest that they could have an extragalactic origin. This discovery should
guide future dedicated spectroscopic searches of atypical stellar chemical
patterns in our Galaxy; a fundamental step forward to understand the Galactic
formation and evolution.

coupled to an arbitrary dissipative classical system (diagonal reduced density
matrix). The quantum and classical dynamics can modify each other, being
described by an arbitrary time-irreversible hybrid Lindblad equation. Given a
measurement trajectory, a conditional bipartite stochastic state can be
inferred by taking into account all previous recording information (filtering).
Here, we demonstrate that the joint quantum-classical state can also be
inferred by taking into account both past and future measurement results
(smoothing). The smoothed hybrid state is estimated without involving
information from unobserved measurement channels. Its average over recording
realizations recovers the joint time-irreversible behavior. As an application
we consider a fluorescent system monitored by an inefficient photon detector.
This feature is taken into account through a fictitious classical two-level
system. The average purity of the smoothed quantum state increases over that of
the (mixed) state obtained from the standard quantum jump approach.

in the normal roadways. Predicting the traffic flow in highways especially, is
demanded to solve this congestion problem. Predictions on time-series
multivariate data, such as in the traffic flow dataset, have been largely
accomplished through various approaches. The approach with conventional
prediction algorithms, such as with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is only
capable of accommodating predictions that are independent in each time unit.
Hence, the sequential relationships in this time series data is hardly
explored. Continuous Conditional Random Field (CCRF) is one of Probabilistic
Graphical Model (PGM) algorithms which can accommodate this problem. The
neighboring aspects of sequential data such as in the time series data can be
expressed by CCRF so that its predictions are more reliable. In this article, a
novel approach called DM-CCRF is adopted by modifying the CCRF prediction
algorithm to strengthen the probability of the predictions made by the baseline
regressor. The result shows that DM-CCRF is superior in performance compared to
CCRF. This is validated by the error decrease of the baseline up to 9%
significance. This is twice the standard CCRF performance which can only
decrease baseline error by 4.582% at most.

  photoelectrodes: Theory and simulations","19 pages, 12 figures, detailed version",,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last several years, there has been a wealth of studies to clarify the
role of thin layers of electrocatalysts on semiconducting photoelectrodes to
the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has been shown that
the addition of a thin oxide overlayer in many cases cathodically shifts the
potential of photocurrent onset and/or increases the maximum photocurrent,
leading to greater collection efficiencies beneficial for OER. However, the
origin of this enhancement is not well understood. Here, we present a model
relying on analytical expressions rather than differential equations to
investigate the role of surface states in electrocatalyst-modified
semiconductor photoelectrodes. Without catalyst overlayer, we find that if
surface states are screened, meaning charged surface states are electronically
neutralized via nearby solution ions, no Helmholtz potential is generated and
photoelectrodes exhibit good performance. In contrast, if the surface states
are unscreened, an additional Helmholtz potential forms decreasing the amount
of band bending and resulting in poor performance. In the presence of a
catalyst overlayer, there is a strong dependence on how the surface states
interact with the catalyst. Catalysts in series with surface states can
increase the effective rate of transfer from surface states to solution,
leading to an increase in total current while catalysts that act in parallel
with surface states can increase the open circuit voltage or photovoltage. Both
series and parallel catalyst effects operate in tandem in real devices, leading
to an increase in current and/or photovoltage, depending on the relevant
exchange currents. This model does not only help to understand the role of
surface states in charge transfer and ultimately efficiencies in
photoelectrochemical systems but also allows facile application for other
researchers.

Bayesian nonparametric models. Finally, we formalize the relationship between

all cases, our results show essentially no difference in gamma between the

surprisingly homogeneous across the SMC when probed at a resolution of 30 pc.
Contrary to recent suggestions from numerical simulations, we do not find a
significant change in gamma due to stellar feedback as traced by the SFR
surface density. This could be due to the stellar feedback being widespread
over the whole of the SMC, but more likely due to a large-scale gravitational
driving of turbulence. We show that the lack of difference between central and

as a method for the analysis of signals that can be broken down into multiple

of SST, based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), enables the
sharpening of instantaneous frequency (IF) information derived from the STFT,
as well as the separation of amplitude-phase components corresponding to
distinct IF curves. However, this SST is limited by the time-frequency
resolution of the underlying window function, and may not resolve signals
exhibiting diverse time-frequency behaviors with sufficient accuracy. In this
work, we develop a framework for an SST based on a ""quilted"" short-time Fourier
transform (SST-QSTFT), which allows adaptation to signal behavior in separate
time-frequency regions through the use of multiple windows. This motivates us
to introduce a discrete reassignment frequency formula based on a finite
difference of the phase spectrum, ensuring computational accuracy for a wider
variety of windows. We develop a theoretical framework for the SST-QSTFT in
both the continuous and the discrete settings, and describe an algorithm for
the automatic selection of optimal windows depending on the region of interest.
Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the superior numerical performance of
SST-QSTFT relative to other SST methods in a noisy context. Finally, we apply
SST-QSTFT to audio recordings of animal calls to demonstrate the potential of
our method for the analysis of real bioacoustic signals.

  Repair",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated program repair is a problem of finding a transformation (called a
patch) of a given incorrect program that eliminates the observable failures. It
has important applications such as providing debugging aids, automatically
grading assignments and patching security vulnerabilities. A common challenge
faced by all existing repair techniques is scalability to large patch spaces,
since there are many candidate patches that these techniques explicitly or
implicitly consider.
  The correctness criterion for program repair is often given as a suite of
tests, since a formal specification of the intended program behavior may not be
available. Current repair techniques do not scale due to the large number of
test executions performed by the underlying search algorithms. We address this
problem by introducing a methodology of patch generation based on a
test-equivalence relation (if two programs are ""test-equivalent"" for a given
test, they produce indistinguishable results on this test). We propose two
test-equivalence relations based on runtime values and dependencies
respectively and present an algorithm that performs on-the-fly partitioning of
patches into test-equivalence classes.
  Our experiments on real-world programs reveal that the proposed methodology
drastically reduces the number of test executions and therefore provides an
order of magnitude efficiency improvement over existing repair techniques,
without sacrificing patch quality.

generalizing the puzzle to an $n \times n$ board with $n^2-1$ squares, we can
study the computational complexity of problems related to the puzzle; in
particular, we consider the problem of determining whether a given end
configuration can be reached from a given start configuration via at most a
given number of moves. This problem was shown NP-complete in Ratner and Warmuth
(1990). We provide an alternative simpler proof of this fact by reduction from
the rectilinear Steiner tree problem.

several signals, each corresponding to one configuration of the 4f shell. The
present theory simplifies to such superposition only if nearly all effects of

importance in many practical applications. Most of the existing methods assume
foreground and background show visually distinct characteristics and thus the
foreground can be detected once a good background model is obtained. However,
there are many situations where this is not the case. Of particular interest in
video surveillance is the camouflage case. For example, an active attacker
camouflages by intentionally wearing clothes that are visually similar to the
background. In such cases, even given a decent background model, it is not
trivial to detect foreground objects. This paper proposes a texture guided
weighted voting (TGWV) method which can efficiently detect foreground objects
in camouflaged scenes. The proposed method employs the stationary wavelet
transform to decompose the image into frequency bands. We show that the small
and hardly noticeable differences between foreground and background in the
image domain can be effectively captured in certain wavelet frequency bands. To
make the final foreground decision, a weighted voting scheme is developed based
on intensity and texture of all the wavelet bands with weights carefully
designed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art results.

index and surface brightness are included in training on galaxy samples from

morphological parameters to full $ugriz$ photometry, only mild improvements are
obtained, while the gains are substantial in cases where fewer passbands are
available. For instance, the combination of $grz$ photometry and morphological
parameters almost fully recovers the metrics of $5$-band photometric redshifts.
We demonstrate that with morphology it is possible to determine useful redshift
distribution $N(z)$ of galaxy samples without any colour information. We also
find that the inclusion of quasar redshifts and associated object sizes in
training improves the quality of photometric redshift catalogues, compensating
for the lack of a good star-galaxy separator. We further show that
morphological information can mitigate biases and scatter due to bad
photometry. As an application, we derive both point estimates and posterior
distributions of redshifts for the official CS82 catalogue, training on
morphology and SDSS Stripe-82 $ugriz$ bands when available. Our redshifts yield
a 68th percentile error of $0.058(1+z)$, and a catastrophic outlier fraction of
$5.2$ per cent. We further include a deep extension trained on morphology and

abundances of the $\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs, including spin states, in physical
conditions corresponding to starless cores and protostellar envelopes.
  Methods. We developed a new rate coefficient set for the $\rm H_3^+$
isotopologs, allowing for rotational excitation, using the state-to-state rate
coefficients from Hugo et al. These new so-called species-to-species rate
coefficients are compared with previously-used ground state-to-species rate
coefficients.
  Results. The species-to-species and ground state-to-species model results
differ at high density and toward increasing temperatures ($T > 10$ K). The
species-to-species model predicts a lower $\rm H_3^+$ deuteration degree at
high density owing to an increase of the rate coefficients of endothermic
reactions that decrease deuteration. At 20 K the ground state-to-species model
overestimates the abundance of $\rm H_2D^+$ by a factor of about two while the
abundance of $\rm D_3^+$ can differ by an order of magnitude between the
models. Spin-state abundance ratios are also affected, and the new model better
reproduces recent observations of ortho and para $\rm H_2D^+$ and $\rm D_2H^+$.
The applicability regime of the new rate coefficients depends on the critical
densities of the various rotational transitions.
  Conclusions. The difference in the abundances of the $\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs
predicted by the two models is negligible at 10 K but excited states are very
important in studies of deuteration at higher temperatures, for example in
protostellar envelopes. The species-to-species rate coefficients provide a more
realistic approach to the chemistry of the $\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs than the
ground state-to-species rate coefficients do, and so the former should be
adopted in chemical models describing the chemistry of the $\rm H_3^+ + H_2$
reacting system.

region (AR) 12192. They were all confined flares and were not followed by
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To examine the structures of the four flares
close to the solar disk center from October 22 to 26, we employ firstly
composite triple-time images in each flare process to display {the stratified
structure} of these flare loops. The loop structures of each flare in both
lower (171 {\AA}) and higher (131 {\AA}) temperature channels are complex,
e.g., the flare loops rooting at flare ribbons are sheared or twisted (enwound)
together, and the complex structures have not been destroyed during the flares.
For the first flare, although the flare loop system appears as a spindle shape,
we can estimate their structure from observations, with lengths ranging from
130 to 300 Mm, heights from 65 to 150 Mm, widths at the middle part of the
spindle from 40 to 100 Mm, and shear angles from 16$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$.
Moreover, the flare ribbons display irregular movements, such as the left
ribbon fragments of the flare on 22 swept a small region repeatedly, and the
both ribbons of the flare on 26 moved along the same direction, instead of
separating from each other. These irregular movements also imply that the
corresponding flare loops are complex, e.g. several sets of flare loops are
twisted together. Although previous studies suggest that the background
magnetic fields prevent confined flares from erupting, we firstly suggest based
on these observations that the complex flare loop structures may be responsible
for these confined flares.

component. Thus, the initial statistical work should be the estimation of the
reliability of each component of the system. This is not an easy task because
when the system fails, the failure time of a given component can not be
observed, that is, censored data. Rodrigues et al. (2017) presented a solution
for reliability estimation of components when it is avaliable the system
failure time and the status of each component at the time of system failure (if
it had failed before, after or it is responsible for system failure). However,
there are situations it may be difficult to identify the status of components
at the moment of system failure.
  Such cases are systems with masked causes of failure. Since parallel and
series systems are the simplest systems, innumerous alternative solutions for
these two systems have been appeared in the literature. To the best of our
knowledge, this seems to be the first work that considers the general case of
coherent systems. The three-parameter Weibull distribution is considered as the
component failure time model. Identically distributed failure times is not
required restrictions. Furthermore, there is no restriction on the subjective
choice of prior distributions but preference has been given to continuous prior
distributions; these priors represent well the nuances of the environment that
the system operates. The statistical work of obtaining quantities of the
posterior distribution is supported by the Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm.
With several simulations, the excellent performance of the model was evaluated.
We also consider a computer hard-drives real dataset in order to present the
practical relevance of the proposed model.

be seen that those cities that have the largest number of articles; i.e., that
can be considered as the most significant sites of corporate R&D in which firms
operate in fast-growing industries, are primarily in the pharmaceutical and
information technology industries. For these reasons, some mid-sized cities

multipliers (ADMM) methods (e.g.\ SAG-ADMM, SDCA-ADMM and SVRG-ADMM) have made
exciting progress such as linear convergence rates for strongly convex
problems. However, the best known convergence rate for general convex problems
is O(1/T) as opposed to O(1/T^2) of accelerated batch algorithms, where $T$ is
the number of iterations. Thus, there still remains a gap in convergence rates
between existing stochastic ADMM and batch algorithms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the momentum acceleration trick for batch optimization into the
stochastic variance reduced gradient based ADMM (SVRG-ADMM), which leads to an
accelerated (ASVRG-ADMM) method. Then we design two different momentum term
update rules for strongly convex and general convex cases. We prove that
ASVRG-ADMM converges linearly for strongly convex problems. Besides having a
low per-iteration complexity as existing stochastic ADMM methods, ASVRG-ADMM
improves the convergence rate on general convex problems from O(1/T) to
O(1/T^2). Our experimental results show the effectiveness of ASVRG-ADMM.

results for a class of convex functions with a strong geometric structure, that
we coined ""mirror-stratifiable"". These functions are such that there is a
bijection between a primal and a dual stratification of the space into
partitioning sets, called strata. This pairing is crucial to track the strata
that are identifiable by solutions of parametrized optimization problems or by
iterates of optimization algorithms. This class of functions encompasses all
regularizers routinely used in signal and image processing, machine learning,
and statistics. We show that this ""mirror-stratifiable"" structure enjoys a nice
sensitivity theory, allowing us to study stability of solutions of optimization
problems to small perturbations, as well as activity identification of
first-order proximal splitting-type algorithms. Existing results in the
literature typically assume that, under a non-degeneracy condition, the active
set associated to a minimizer is stable to small perturbations and is
identified in finite time by optimization schemes. In contrast, our results do
not require any non-degeneracy assumption: in consequence, the optimal active
set is not necessarily stable anymore, but we are able to track precisely the
set of identifiable strata.We show that these results have crucial implications
when solving challenging ill-posed inverse problems via regularization, a
typical scenario where the non-degeneracy condition is not fulfilled. Our
theoretical results, illustrated by numerical simulations, allow to
characterize the instability behaviour of the regularized solutions, by
locating the set of all low-dimensional strata that can be potentially
identified by these solutions.

high smoothness for the auxiliary vector function reconstruction, which, at the

during a systematic testing of error estimates, are presented in the second

both the error estimation (indication) and the computational expenses points of
view. Several examples illustrate that functional error estimates
(alternatively referred to as the majorants and minorants of deviation from an
exact solution) perform a much sharper error control than, for instance,
residual-based error estimates. Simultaneously, assembling and solving the
routines for an auxiliary variable reconstruction which generate the majorant
of an error can be executed several times faster than the routines for a primal

consisting of a multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) that transfers wireless
energy to and receives sensing data from a cluster of low-power wireless
devices (WDs). To enhance the throughput performance of some far-away WDs, we
allow one of the WDs to act as the cluster head (CH) that helps forward the
messages of the other cluster members (CMs). However, the performance of the
proposed cluster-based cooperation is fundamentally limited by the high energy
consumption of the CH, who needs to transmit all the WDs' messages including
its own. To tackle this issue, we exploit the capability of multi-antenna
energy beamforming (EB) at the HAP, which can focus more transferred power to
the CH to balance its energy consumption in assisting the other WDs.
Specifically, we first derive the throughput performance of each individual WD
under the proposed scheme. Then, we jointly optimize the EB design, the
transmit time allocation among the HAP and the WDs, and the transmit power
allocation of the CH to maximize the minimum data rate achievable among all the
WDs (the max-min throughput) for improved throughput fairness among the WDs. An
efficient optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization
problem. Moreover, we simulate under practical network setups and show that the
proposed multi-antenna enabled cluster-based cooperation can effectively
improve the throughput fairness of WPCN.

after the Big Bang. With the increased availability of multi-object
spectroscopy and X-ray data an ever increasing fraction of local clusters are
recognised as exhibiting signs of recent or past merging events on various
scales. Our goal is to probe how these mergers affect the evolution and content
of their member galaxies. We specifically aim to answer the following
questions: Is the quenching of star formation in merging clusters enhanced when
compared with relaxed clusters? Is the quenching preceded by a (short lived)
burst of star formation? We obtained optical spectroscopy of >400 galaxies in
the field of the merging cluster Abell 520. We combine these observations with
archival data to get a comprehensive picture of the state of star formation in
the members of this merging cluster. Finally, we compare these observations
with a control sample of 10 non-merging clusters at the same redshift from The
Arizona Cluster Redshift Survey (ACReS). We split the member galaxies in
passive, star forming or recently quenched depending on their spectra. The core
of the merger shows a decreased fraction of star forming galaxies compared to
clusters in the non-merging sample. This region, dominated by passive galaxies,
is extended along the axis of the merger. We find evidence of rapid quenching
of the galaxies during the core passage with no signs of a star burst on the
time scales of the merger (~0.4Gyr). Additionally, we report the tentative
discovery of an infalling group along the main filament feeding the merger,
currently at ~2.5 Mpc from the merger centre. This group contains a high
fraction of star forming galaxies as well as ~2/3 of all the recently quenched
galaxies in our survey.

information, we show that the two-mode squeezed vacuum state can achieve a
lower bound of estimation error than the coherent and squeezed vacuum state
under a photon-loss channel. We further consider practical measurement schemes,
homodyne detection and photon number resolving detection (PNRD), to
characterize the accuracy of phase estimation in reality and find that the
coherent and squeezed vacuum state largely achieves a lower bound than the
two-mode squeezed vacuum in the lossy MZI while maintaining quantum enhancement
over the shot-noise limit. By comparing homodyne detection and PNRD, we
demonstrate that quadrature measurement with homodyne detection is more robust
against photon loss than parity measurement with PNRD. We also show that double
homodyne detection can provide a better tool for phase estimation than single
homodyne detection against photon loss.

DeepTrend, a deep hierarchical neural network used for traffic flow prediction
which considers and extracts the time-variant trend. DeepTrend has two stacked
layers: extraction layer and prediction layer. Extraction layer, a fully
connected layer, is used to extract the time-variant trend in traffic flow by
feeding the original flow series concatenated with corresponding simple average
trend series. Prediction layer, an LSTM layer, is used to make flow prediction
by feeding the obtained trend from the output of extraction layer and
calculated residual series. To make the model more effective, DeepTrend needs
first pre-trained layer-by-layer and then fine-tuned in the entire network.
Experiments show that DeepTrend can noticeably boost the prediction performance

taking into account the pair fluctuation effects and respects some important
restrictions like the $f$-sum rule. Our numerical results show that the dynamic
density structure factor at large incoming momentum and at half recoil
frequency has a qualitatively similar behavior as the order parameter, which
can signify the appearance of the condensate. This qualitatively agrees with
the recent Bragg spectroscopy experiment results. We also present the results

facilitate content sharing among users. ICN will make it easy for users to
appoint storage nodes, in various network locations, perhaps owned or
controlled by them, where shared content can be stored and disseminated from.
These storage nodes should be (somewhat) trusted since not only they have (some
level of) access to user shared content, but they should also properly enforce
access control. Traditional forms of encryption introduce significant overhead
when it comes to sharing content with large and dynamic groups of users. To
this end, proxy re-encryption provides a convenient solution. In this paper, we
use Identity-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (IB-PRE) to provide confidentiality and
access control for content items shared over ICN, realizing secure content
distribution among dynamic sets of users. In contrast to similar IB-PRE based
solutions, our design allows each user to generate the system parameters and
the secret keys required by the underlay encryption scheme using their own
Private Key Generator, therefore, our approach does not suffer from the key
escrow problem. Moreover, our design further relaxes the trust requirements on
the storage nodes by preventing them from sharing usable content with
unauthorized users. Finally, our scheme does not require out-of-band secret key
distribution.

anisotropies would confirm the presence of a primordial gravitational wave
background (GWB). In the inflation paradigm this would be an unprecedented
probe of the energy scale of inflation as it is directly proportional to the
power spectrum of the GWB. However, similar tensor perturbations can be
produced by the matter fields present during inflation, breaking this simple
relationship. It is therefore important to be able to distinguish between
different generation mechanisms of the GWB. In this paper, we analyse the
detectability of a new axion-SU(2) gauge field model using its chiral,
scale-dependent tensor spectrum. We forecast the detectability of the resulting
CMB TB and EB cross-correlations by the LiteBIRD satellite, considering the
effects of residual foregrounds, gravitational lensing, and for the first time
assess the ability of such an experiment to jointly detect primordial TB and EB
spectra and self-calibrate its polarimeter. We find that LiteBIRD will be able
to detect the chiral signal for $r_*>0.03$ with $r_*$ denoting the
tensor-to-scalar ratio at the peak scale, and that the maximum signal-to-noise
for $r_*<0.07$ is $\sim 2$. We go on to consider an advanced stage of a
LISA-like mission, and find that such experiments would complement CMB
observations by providing sensitivity to GWB chirality on scales inaccessible
to the CMB. We conclude that in order to use the CMB to distinguish this model
from a conventional vacuum fluctuation model two-point statistics provide some
power, but to achieve high statistical significance we would require higher
order statistics which take advantage of the model's non-Gaussianity. On the
other hand, in the case of a spectrum peaked at very small scales, inaccessible
to the CMB, a highly significant detection could be made using space-based
laser interferometers.

anticipate, forecast, and mitigate cyber attacks. A common approach is
time-series forecasting of cyber attacks based on data from network telescopes,
honeypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems. This research
has uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyber attacks. Here, we
propose an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of
attacks that are analyst-detected and -verified occurrences of malware. We call
these instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically, our dataset was
analyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service
Provider (CSSP) for the U.S. Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on
automated systems. Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over
approximately seven years. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts,
our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in
other sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a
number for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the
development of effective risk-management strategies. We used a Bayesian State
Space Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead could be
predicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model. Our findings of
systematicity in analyst-detected cyber attacks are consistent with previous
work using other sources. The advanced information provided by a forecast may
help with threat awareness by providing a probable value and range for future
cyber events one week ahead. Other potential applications for cyber event
forecasting include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for
cyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing and sensor configuration) in CSSPs.
Enhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity.

simple model, the Higgs lepton-flavor violating $h\to \mu \tau$ decay can occur
at the tree level, and its branching ratio can be as large as the current

conditional heteroscedasticity and a comparatively fast computing time. The

by, and increase with the proximity to, a Hund's coupling-favored Mott

line is found where these three features get enhanced, departing from the Mott
transition at half filling and extending in the interaction/doping plane,
between a normal (at weak interaction and large doping) and a Hund's metal (at
strong interaction and small doping). This phenomenology is found identically
in models with featureless bands, highlighting the generality of this physics

Some analytical arguments are also given to gain insight into these defining

enhanced/diverging electronic compressibility near the Hund's metal crossover,

importance, the studies of metrics are usually limited to a narrow area or a
well-defined objective. Our study aims to more broadly survey the metrics that
are commonly used for analyzing, developing and managing telecommunication
networks in order to facilitate understanding of the current metrics landscape.
The metrics are simple abstractions of systems, and they directly influence how
the systems are perceived by different stakeholders. However, defining and
using metrics for telecommunication systems with ever increasing complexity is
a complicated matter which has not been so far systematically and
comprehensively considered in the literature. The common metrics sources are
identified, and how the metrics are used and selected is discussed. The most
commonly used metrics for telecommunication systems are categorized and
presented as energy and power metrics, quality-of-service metrics,
quality-of-experience metrics, security metrics, and reliability and resilience
metrics. Finally, the research directions and recommendations how the metrics
can evolve, and be defined and used more effectively are outlined.

Given a class of language C, the separation problem for C takes as input two
regular languages and asks whether there exists a third one which belongs to C,
includes the first one and is disjoint from the second. Typically, obtaining an
algorithm for separation yields a deep understanding of the investigated class
C. This explains why a lot of effort has been devoted to finding algorithms for
the most prominent classes.
  Here, we are interested in classes within concatenation hierarchies. Such
hierarchies are built using a generic construction process: one starts from an
initial class called the basis and builds new levels by applying generic
operations. The most famous one, the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and
Cohen, classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. Moreover, it
was shown by Thomas that it corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy
of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages
that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. Finding
separation algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy is among the most famous
open problems in automata theory.
  Our main theorem is generic: we show that separation is decidable for the
level 3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite. Furthermore, in
the special case of the dot-depth, we push this result to the level 5/2. In
logical terms, this solves separation for $\Sigma_3$: first-order sentences
having at most three quantifier blocks starting with an existential one.

explore a set of methods including Pooling-LSTM (PLSTM), Hierarchical-LSTM
(HLSTM), Random-LSTM (RLSTM) in order to address the problem of large amount of
frames in a video. We also introduce two attention pooling methods, single
attention pooling (ATT) and multiply attention pooling (Multi-ATT) so that we
can pay more attention to the informative frames in a video and ignore the
useless frames. In the video-level classification part, two methods are
proposed to increase the classification performance, i.e.
Hierarchical-Mixture-of-Experts (HMoE) and Classifier Chains (CC). Our final
submission is an ensemble consisting of 18 sub-models. In terms of the official

ecosystems, superficially different, are alike in some deeper way. An external
observer can choose any ecosystem property as being important. In contrast, two
ecosystems are equivalent from the point of view of the organisms they contain
if and only if for each species, the proportional population growth rate does
not differ between the ecosystems. Comparative studies of ecosystems should
therefore focus on patterns in proportional population growth rates, rather
than patterns in other properties such as relative abundances. Popular
activities such as measuring dissimilarity, and representing dissimilarity via
ordination, can then be done from the point of view of the organisms in
ecosystems. Summarizing the state of an ecosystem under this approach remains
challenging. In general, the dynamics on equivalence classes of ecosystems
defined in this way are structurally different from the dynamics of ecosystems
as seen by an external observer. This may limit the extent to which natural
selection can act on ecosystem structure.

during the radiation-dominated epoch in the early Universe, then this produces
large amplitude perturbations that collapse into dense objects known as axion

inside the horizon when axion oscillations begin. For the QCD axion $M_0\sim
10^{-10}M_\odot$, however for an axion-like particle $M_0$ can approach
$M_\odot$ or higher. Using the Press-Schechter formalism we compute the mass
function of halos formed by hierarchical structure formation from these seeds.
We compute the concentrations and collapse times of these halos and show that
they can grow to be as massive as $10^6M_0$. Within the halos, miniclusters
likely remain tightly bound, and we compute their gravitational microlensing
signal taking the fraction of axion dark matter collapsed into miniclusters,
$f_{\rm MC}$, as a free parameter. A large value of $f_{\rm MC}$ severely
weakens constraints on axion scenarios from direct detection experiments. We
take into account the non-Gaussian distribution of sizes of miniclusters and
determine how this effects the number of microlensing events. We develop the
tools to consider microlensing by an extended mass function of non-point-like

  Research",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a strategic model of pollution control. A firm,
representative of the productive sector of a country, aims at maximizing its
profits by expanding its production. Assuming that the output of production is
proportional to the level of pollutants' emissions, the firm increases the
level of pollution. The government of the country aims at minimizing the social
costs due to the pollution, and introduces regulatory constraints on the
emissions' level, which then effectively cap the output of production.
Supposing that the firm and the government face both proportional and fixed
costs in order to adopt their policies, we model the previous problem as a
stochastic impulse two-person nonzero-sum game. The state variable of the game
is the level of the output of production which evolves as a general linearly
controlled one-dimensional Ito-diffusion. Following an educated guess, we first
construct a pair of candidate equilibrium policies and of corresponding
equilibrium values, and we then provide a set of sufficient conditions under
which they indeed realize an equilibrium. Our results are complemented by a
numerical study when the (uncontrolled) output of production evolves as a
geometric Brownian motion, and the firm's operating profit and the government's
running cost functions are of power type. An analysis of the dependency of the
equilibrium policies and values on the model parameters yields interesting new
behaviors that we explain as a consequence of the strategic interaction between
the firm and the government.

the context of simplified supersymmetric models for various decay hypotheses.
Models with larger differences in mass between the top squark and neutralino

a more compressed mass hierarchy are probed up to 660 and 610 GeV,

the reason why CDW and superconducting orders compete with each other at low

have been performed by instantly applying a constant shear rate to a random,
static, isotropic assembly of identical, soft, frictional spheres at either
zero or finite pressure by keeping constant the solid volume fraction until the
steady state is reached. If the system is slowly sheared, or, equivalently, if
the particles are sufficiently rigid, the granular material exhibits either
large or small fluctuations in the evolving pressure, depending whether the
average number of contacts per particle (coordination number) is less or larger
than a critical value. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuations is
rate-dependent when the coordination number is less than the critical and
rate-independent otherwise, signatures of fluid-like and solid-like behaviour,
respectively. The same critical coordination number has been previously found
to represent the minimum value at which rate-independent components of the
stresses develop in steady, simple shearing and the jamming transition in
isotropic random packings. The observed complex behaviour of the measured
pressure in the fluid-solid transition clearly suggests the need for
incorporating in a nontrivial way the coordination number, the solid volume
fraction, the particle stiffness and the intensity of the particle agitation in
constitutive models for the onset and the arrest of granular flows.

convex objectives and conic constraints at each stage. We present a new
stochastic first-order method, namely the dynamic stochastic approximation

We show that DSA can achieve an optimal ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ rate of
convergence in terms of the total number of required scenarios when applied to
a three-stage stochastic optimization problem. We further show that this rate
of convergence can be improved to ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ when the objective

general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems with the number of stages
$T > 3$. The developed DSA algorithms only need to go through the scenario tree
once in order to compute an $\epsilon$-solution of the multi-stage stochastic
optimization problem. As a result, the memory required by DSA only grows
linearly with respect to the number of stages. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that stochastic approximation type methods are
generalized for multi-stage stochastic optimization with $T \ge 3$.

exclusion of top squark masses below 650-730 GeV.

is the particular spin texture of the Fermi surface, which resembles a
one-dimensional topological state, and spin protection should hence prevent the

nesting-driven mechanism of the reconstruction is indeed excluded by the
absence of any changes in the electronic structure near the Fermi surface, as
observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. However, distinct
changes in the electronic structure at higher binding energies are found to
accompany the structural phase transition. This, as well as the observed short
correlation length of the pairing distortion, suggest that the transition is of
the strong coupling type and driven by phonon entropy rather than electronic

calculations by replacing step-function profiles with more realistic profiles
characterized by strong but finite gradient along the radial direction. It is
shown that the resulting surface current is no longer a delta-function current
density, but a finite and smooth current density profile with internal

Moreover, this current density profile has peaks of both signs, unlike the
delta-function case with a sign opposite to, or the same as the plasma current.
We show analytically and numerically that such current density can be separated
into two parts, with one of them, called the convective current density,
describing the transport of the background plasma density by the displacement,
and the other part that remains, called the residual current density. It is
argued that consideration of both types of current density is important and can
resolve past controversies.
