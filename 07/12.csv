frequency domains is crucial for building quantum networks based on
superconducting circuits. Optoelectromechanical systems, in which microwave and
optical cavity modes are coupled to a common mechanical oscillator, are a
promising route towards this goal. In these systems, efficient, low-noise
conversion is possible using a mechanically dark mode of the fields but the
conversion bandwidth is limited to a fraction of the cavity linewidth. Here, we
show that an array of optoelectromechanical transducers can overcome this
limitation and reach a bandwidth that is larger than the cavity linewidth. The
coupling rates are varied in space throughout the array so that the
mechanically dark mode of the propagating fields adiabatically changes from
microwave to optical or vice versa. This strategy also leads to significantly
reduced thermal noise with the collective optomechanical cooperativity being
the relevant figure of merit. Finally, we demonstrate that, quite surprisingly,
the bandwidth enhancement per transducer element is largest for small arrays;
this feature makes our scheme particularly attractive for state-of-the-art
experimental setups.

discuss NEB expansion events (NEEs), which took place every 3-5 years during
this time, and how the various features of the NEB are involved in them. I
present evidence that the NEE affects not just the northern edge, but the whole
width of the belt. It begins with an outbreak of a bright rift that is more
northerly and slower-moving than usual; this is often involved with the first
ejection of dark material northwards into the N. Tropical Zone, but typically
the rift also expands southwards across the width of the NEB. NEBs dark
formations are usually affected, as they are during individual interactions
with rifts at other times; they may be disrupted, or intensified, and they
usually undergo deceleration. The expansion of the dark NEB to the north occurs
concurrently, and is followed by the appearance of new dark 'barges' and white
ovals flanking the NEBn jet. The speed of the NEBs dark formations varies with
their mean spacing, consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that they are
planetary Rossby waves. In most apparitions since 2000 we have also detected
smaller, faster features (120 m/s). I propose that these represent waves of the

  Measures: Negative Results, And An Alternative",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The bound that arises out of sparse recovery analysis in compressed sensing
involves input signal sparsity and some property of the sensing matrix. An
effort has therefore been made in the literature to optimize sensing matrices
for optimal recovery using this property. We discover, in the specific case of
optimizing codes for the CACTI camera, that the popular method of mutual
coherence minimization does not produce optimal results: codes designed to
optimize effective dictionary coherence often perform worse than random codes
in terms of mean squared reconstruction error.
  This surprising phenomenon leads us to investigate the reliability of the
coherence bound for matrix optimization, in terms of its looseness. We examine,
on simulated data, the looseness of the bound as it propagates across various
steps of the inequalities in a derivation leading to the final bound. We then
similarly examine an alternate bound derived by Tang, G. et al, based on the
$\ell_1/\ell_{\infty}$ notion of sparsity, which is a compromise between
coherence and the restricted isometry constant (RIC). Moreover, we also perform
a bound looseness analysis for the RIC as derived by Cai, T. et al. The
conclusion of these efforts is that coherence optimization is problematic not
only because of the coherence bound on the RIC, but also the RIC bound itself.
These negative results imply that despite the success of previous work in
designing sensing matrices based on optimization of a matrix quality factor,
one needs to exercise caution in using them for practical sensing matrix
design.
  We then introduce a paradigm for optimizing sensing matrices that overcomes
the looseness of compressed sensing upper bounds using an average case error
approach. We show a proof-of-concept design using this paradigm that performs
convincingly better than coherence-based design in the CACTI case, and no worse
for general matrices.

typical of SEB Revivals.
  1) The Revival started with a bright white plume.
  2) The initial plume erupted in a pre-existing cyclonic oval ('barge').
Subsequent white plumes continued to appear on the track of this barge, which
was the location of the sub-surface source of the whole Revival.
  3) These plumes were extremely bright in the methane absorption band, i.e.
thrusting up to very high altitudes, especially when new.
  4) Brilliant, methane-bright plumes also appeared along the leading edge of
the central branch. Altogether, 7 plumes appeared at the source and at least 6
along the leading edge.
  5) The central branch of the outbreak was composed of large convective cells,
each initiated by a bright plume, which only occupied a part of each cell,
while a very dark streak defined its west edge.
  6) The southern branch began with darkening and sudden acceleration of
pre-existing faint spots in a slowly retrograding wave-train.
  7) Subsequent darker spots in the southern branch were complex structures,
not coherent vortices.
  8) Dark spots in the southern branch had typical SEBs jetstream speeds but

one of the key probes of the cosmic expansion rate at redshifts z~2.5, well
before dark energy is believed to have become dynamically significant. A key
advantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and
hence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other
cosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission is
sensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark
matter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate this
sensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the
intergalactic medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each
simulation starts from initial conditions at the kinematic decoupling era
(z~1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized gas thermal
evolution at reionization (z~8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-$\alpha$
forest transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale
structure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization. The changes
in the gas distribution and temperature-density relation at low redshift are
more subtle, due to the convergent temperature evolution in the ionized phase.
The change in the BAO scale is estimated to be of the order of 0.12% at z=2.5;
some of the major uncertainties and avenues for future improvement are
discussed. The predicted streaming velocity shift would be a subdominant but
not negligible effect (of order $0.26\sigma$) for the upcoming DESI
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey, and exceeds the cosmic variance floor. It is
hoped that this study will motivate additional theoretical work on the
magnitude of the BAO shift, both in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and in other
tracers of large-scale structure.

  workshop",,,"q-bio.QM stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Behaviors of several laboratory animals can be modeled as sequences of
stereotyped behaviors, or behavioral motifs. However, identifying such motifs
is a challenging problem. Behaviors have a multi-scale structure: the animal
can be simultaneously performing a small-scale motif and a large-scale one
(e.g. \textit{chewing} and \textit{feeding}). Motifs are compositional: a
large-scale motif is a chain of smaller-scale ones, folded in (some behavioral)
space in a specific manner. We demonstrate an approach which captures these
structures, using rat locomotor data as an example. From the same dataset, we
used a preprocessing procedure to create different versions, each describing
motifs of a different scale. We then trained several Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) in parallel, one for each dataset version. This approach essentially
forced each HMM to learn motifs on a different scale, allowing us to capture
behavioral structures lost in previous approaches. By comparing HMMs with
models representing different null hypotheses, we found that rat locomotion was
composed of distinct motifs from second scale to minute scale. We found that
transitions between motifs were modulated by rats' location in the environment,
leading to non-Markovian transitions. To test the ethological relevance of
motifs we discovered, we compared their usage between rats with differences in
a high-level trait, prosociality. We found that these rats had distinct motif
repertoires, suggesting that motif usage statistics can be used to infer
internal states of rats. Our method is therefore an efficient way to discover

The experiment used the 6 GeV electron beam from the CEBAF accelerator at

of the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The scattered electron was
detected by CLAS and the photon by a dedicated electromagnetic calorimeter at

We measured beam-spin asymmetries larger than those observed on the free proton

reconstructing the dispersions of d-wave Bogoliubov excitations, but the
successful identification and interpretation of QPI in scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) experiments rely on theoretical results obtained for the
case of isolated impurities. We introduce a highly flexible technique to
simulate STS measurements by computing the local density of states using
real-space Green's functions defined on two-dimensional lattices with as many
as 100,000 sites. We focus on the following question: to what extent can the
experimental results be reproduced when various forms of distributed disorder
are present? We consider randomly distributed point-like impurities, smooth
""Coulombic"" disorder, and disorder arising from random on-site energies and
superconducting gaps. We find an apparent paradox: the QPI peaks in the
Fourier-transformed local density of states appear to be sharper and better
defined in experiment than those seen in our simulations. We arrive at a no-go
result for smooth-potential disorder since this does not reproduce the QPI
peaks associated with large-momentum scattering. An ensemble of point-like
impurities gets closest to experiment, but this goes hand in hand with impurity
cores that are not seen in experiment. We also study the effects of possible
measurement artifacts (the ""fork mechanism""), which turn out to be of
relatively minor consequence. It appears that there is an unknown mechanism at
work which renders the QPI peaks much sharper than they are based on present
theoretical understanding.

wire. We derive exact expressions for the probability of diffusive return to
the starting point in a given time. The result is valid for wires with or
without time-reversal symmetry and allows for the possibility of topologically
protected conducting channels. In the absence of protected channels, Anderson
localization leads to a nonzero limiting value of the return probability at
long times, which is approached as a negative power of time with an exponent
depending on the symmetry class. When topologically protected channels are
present (in a wire of either unitary or symplectic symmetry), the probability
of return decays to zero at long time as a power law whose exponent depends on
the number of protected channels. Technically, we describe the electron
dynamics by the one-dimensional supersymmetric non-linear sigma model. We
derive an exact identity that relates any local dynamical correlation function
in a disordered wire of unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry to a
certain expectation value in the random matrix ensemble of class AIII, CI, or

power of logical formalisms over discrete structures, such as words. Naturally,
""understanding"" is not a mathematical notion. This investigation requires
therefore a concrete objective to capture this understanding. In the
literature, the standard choice for this objective is the membership problem,
whose aim is to find a procedure deciding whether an input regular language can
be defined in the logic under investigation. This approach was cemented as the
right one by the seminal work of Sch\""utzenberger, McNaughton and Papert on
first-order logic and has been in use since then. However, membership questions
are hard: for several important fragments, researchers have failed in this
endeavor despite decades of investigation. In view of recent results on one of
the most famous open questions, namely the quantifier alternation hierarchy of
first-order logic, an explanation may be that membership is too restrictive as
a setting. These new results were indeed obtained by considering more general
problems than membership, taking advantage of the increased flexibility of the
enriched mathematical setting. This opens a promising research avenue and
efforts have been devoted at identifying and solving such problems for natural
fragments. Until now however, these problems have been ad hoc, most fragments
relying on a specific one. A unique new problem replacing membership as the
right one is still missing. The main contribution of this paper is a suitable
candidate to play this role: the Covering Problem. We motivate this problem
with 3 arguments. First, it admits an elementary set theoretic formulation,
similar to membership. Second, we are able to reexplain or generalize all known
results with this problem. Third, we develop a mathematical framework and a
methodology tailored to the investigation of this problem.

relationships between them, forming a deep, hierarchical symbolic network
structure. Powered by such a structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like
humans, because of its unique characteristics. First, it is universal, using
the same structure to store any knowledge. Second, it can learn symbols from
the world and construct the deep symbolic networks automatically, by utilizing
the fact that real world objects have been naturally separated by
singularities. Third, it is symbolic, with the capacity of performing causal
deduction and generalization. Fourth, the symbols and the links between them
are transparent to us, and thus we will know what it has learned or not - which
is the key for the security of an AI system. Fifth, its transparency enables it
to learn with relatively small data. Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated.
Last but not least, it is more friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We
present the details of the model, the algorithm powering its automatic learning
ability, and describe its usefulness in different use cases. The purpose of
this paper is to generate broad interest to develop it within an open source
project centered on the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model towards the
development of general AI.

frequencies are located on a continuous domain. We consider a uniform array of
sensors that collects measurements whose spectrum is composed of a finite
number of frequencies, where each sensor has an unknown calibration parameter.
Our goal is to recover the spectrum and the calibration parameters
simultaneously from multiple snapshots of the measurements. In the noiseless
case with an infinite number of snapshots, we prove uniqueness of this problem
up to certain trivial, inevitable ambiguities based on an algebraic method, as
long as there are more sensors than frequencies. We then analyze the
sensitivity of this algebraic technique with respect to the number of snapshots
and noise.
  We next propose an optimization approach that makes full use of the
measurements by minimizing a non-convex objective which is non-negative and
continuously differentiable over all calibration parameters and Toeplitz
matrices. We prove that, in the case of infinite snapshots and noiseless
measurements, the objective vanishes only at equivalent solutions to the true
calibration parameters and the measurement covariance matrix. The objective is
minimized using Wirtinger gradient descent which is proven to converge to a
critical point. We show empirically that this critical point provides a good
approximation of the true calibration parameters and the underlying
frequencies.

earlier civilization, some authors noted that this alternative offers a
testable aspect: the seeds could be supplied with a signature that might be
found in extant organisms. In particular, it was suggested that the optimal
location for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part
of cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too
speculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a
signature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is
doomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss
the motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that ""biological SETI""
involves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a
well-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms
of molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting
the guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first
principles and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the
canonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked
systematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,
we perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.
Statistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the
code, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison
analysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,
in agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the
canonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found
attributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make
perfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most

they can be recombined into an exponentially large set of new concepts. This
paper describes SCAN (Symbol-Concept Association Network), a new framework for

fast symbol association, grounding them in disentangled visual primitives that

generative model baselines, our approach requires very few pairings between
symbols and images and makes no assumptions about the form of symbol
representations. Once trained, SCAN is capable of multimodal bi-directional

driver of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole
feedback in its low-accretion state. Across the entire population we measure a
median color transition timescale dt_green of ~1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for
increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of
quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas
fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and
their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies.

closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation
amplifies the initial seed fields ($10^{-14}$ comoving Gauss) to the values
observed in low-redshift galaxies ($1-10\,\mu{\rm G}$). The magnetic field
topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields
are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are
present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution
of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of $280$
clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of $1.1\times 10^{7}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$, and generate mock observations for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA. Our
simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates
with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between
total radio power and X-ray emission, $M_{500}$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
$Y_{\rm 500}$ parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our
most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma
and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes
as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different
instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations,

effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the
total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ~ 10 h/Mpc by 20%. The non-linear
two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over
a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high
redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated
galaxies agrees well with SDSS at its mean redshift z ~ 0.1, both as a function
of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild
excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^9-10^10
Msun/h^2. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable
theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We
find that the clustering length of the galaxy auto-correlation function depends
strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope gamma is nearly
invariant with stellar mass, but declines from gamma ~ 1.8 at redshift z=0 to
gamma ~ 1.6 at redshift z ~ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect
significant scale-dependencies in the bias of different observational tracers

acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts

formation of their carrier(s). The $\lambda 8692$ UF is present in all RCBs.
Its carrier is likely of a carbonaceous molecular nature, presumably different

magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation
(stellar masses ${\log} (M_\star / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 9.7 - 11.2$). As
abundances of magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way are
observed across a variety of spatial locations and metallicities, comparison
with the stellar abundances in our more than $850$ Milky Way-like galaxies
provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. To this
end we use the magnesium to iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII
and SNIa metal return prescription, and a means to compare our simulated
abundances to a wide variety of galactic observations. The europium to iron
ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star -- neutron star mergers, the
assumed primary site of europium production in our models, which in turn is a
sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our
simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show
no correlation with assembly history, present day galactic properties, and
average galactic stellar population age. In general, we reproduce the europium
to iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, with the level
of enhancement being sensitive to gas properties during redshifts $z \approx
2-4$. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to
resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of
[Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is very robust.

biased because survey instruments typically only trace the inner parts of the
most massive galaxies. We present aperture corrections for the two most widely
used stellar kinematic quantities $V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$. Our
demonstration involves integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and the
ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$ Survey. We find a tight relation for both $V/\sigma$ and
$\lambda_{R}$ when measured in different apertures that can be used as a linear
transformation as a function of radius, i.e., a first-order aperture
correction. We find that $V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$ radial growth curves are
well approximated by second order polynomials. By only fitting the inner
profile (0.5$R_{\rm{e}}$), we successfully recover the profile out to one
$R_{\rm{e}}$ if a constraint between the linear and quadratic parameter in the
fit is applied. However, the aperture corrections for $V/\sigma$ and
$\lambda_{R}$ derived by extrapolating the profiles perform as well as applying
a first-order correction. With our aperture-corrected $\lambda_{R}$
measurements, we find that the fraction of slow rotating galaxies increases
with stellar mass. For galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}>$ 11, the fraction
of slow rotators is $35.9\pm4.3$ percent, but is underestimated if galaxies
without coverage beyond one $R_{\rm{e}}$ are not included in the sample

the slow rotator fraction is similar as compared to using aperture corrected
values ($38.3\pm4.4$ percent). Thus, aperture effects can significantly bias
stellar kinematic IFS studies, but this bias can now be removed with the method

resolved regions across the central 3 $\times$ 3 kpc$^2$ region of the active

independent estimates from data at other wavelengths. The star formation

forms an ionization cone which is aligned with the nuclear radio jet. The
optical line emission associated with shock excitation is cospatial with strong
$H_2$ and [Fe II] emission and with regions of high ionized gas velocity
dispersion ($\sigma > 100$ km s$^{-1}$). The shock component also traces the
outer boundary of the AGN ionization cone and may therefore be produced by
outflowing material interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium. Our

clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies,
with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse
intra-cluster light. The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the
definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters
between 20 to 40% of the total stellar mass. Haloes of $5\times 10^{14}M_{\rm

kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow
as the dark matter's ( $-3.5 < \alpha_{\rm 3D} < -3$). Total halo mass is a
very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at $z=0$, the 3D stellar
mass measured within 30 kpc scales as $\propto (M_{\rm 500c})^{0.49}$ with a
$\sim 0.12$ dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the
available observational constraints, even though the abundance of TNG less
massive galaxies ($< 10^{11}M_{\rm sun}$ in stars) is in good agreement with
the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of
massive galaxies fall too on a tight ($\sim$0.16 dex scatter) power-law
relation with halo mass, with $r^{\rm stars}_{\rm 0.5} \propto (M_{\rm

for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kpc, and we show how
on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of
the galaxy or its halo.

extensive searches for their sources. We present constraints from seven years

Galactic plane. This flux is expected from cosmic-ray interactions with the
interstellar medium or near localized sources. Two methods were developed to
test for a spatially-extended flux from the entire plane, both maximum
likelihood fits but with different signal and background modeling techniques.
We consider three templates for Galactic neutrino emission based primarily on
gamma-ray observations and models that cover a wide range of possibilities.
Based on these templates and an unbroken $E^{-2.5}$ power-law energy spectrum,
we set 90% confidence level upper limits constraining the possible Galactic
contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux to be relatively small, less than 14%
of the flux reported in Aartsen et al. (2015a) above 1 TeV. A stacking method
is also used to test catalogs of known high energy Galactic gamma-ray sources.

They then calculated the dark matter kinetic decoupling temperature

hereafter GG08) calculation of $T_{\mathrm{kd}}$ in an early matter-dominated
era (EMDE), which occurs when the Universe is dominated by either a decaying
oscillating scalar field or a semistable massive particle before Big Bang
nucleosynthesis. VG15 found that dark matter decouples at a lower temperature
in an EMDE than it would in a radiation-dominated era, while GG08 found that
dark matter decouples at a higher temperature in an EMDE than it would in a
radiation-dominated era. VG15 attributed this discrepancy to the presence of a
matching constant that ensures that the dark matter temperature is continuous
during the transition from the EMDE to the subsequent radiation-dominated era
and concluded that the GG08 result is incorrect. We show that the disparity is
due to the fact that VG15 compared $T_\mathrm{kd}$ in an EMDE to the decoupling
temperature in a radiation-dominated universe that would result in the same
dark matter temperature at late times. Since decoupling during an EMDE leaves
the dark matter colder than it would be if it decoupled during radiation
domination, this temperature is much higher than $T_\mathrm{kd}$ in a standard
thermal history, which is indeed lower than $T_{\mathrm{kd}}$ in an EMDE, as
stated by GG08.

supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way to be pulled
apart by the black hole's tidal forces. The star is then ""spaghettified"" into a
long stream of matter, with approximately one half being bound to Sgr A* and
the other half unbound. Within this stream, the local self-gravity dominates
the tidal field of Sgr A*, which at minimum restricts the stream to a small
finite width. As the stream cools from adiabatic expansion and begins to
recombine, the residual self-gravity allows for planetary-mass fragments to
form along the length of the stream; these fragments are then shot out into the
galaxy at range of velocities, with the fastest moving at ~10% c. We determine
the phase space distributions of these fragments for a realistic ensemble of
stellar disruptions, along with the local density of fragments in the solar
neighborhood. We find that ~$10^7$ fragments produced by Sgr A* accumulate
within the Milky Way over its lifetime, that there are ~$10^7$ fragments that
lie within 1 Mpc of the Milky Way originating from other galaxies, and that the
nearest fragment to our Sun is on average 500 pc distant.

(MCMC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detector. The new approach
resolves the previously reported high SNR stalling problem of MCMC without the
need for hybridization with another detector method or adding heuristic
temperature scaling factors. Another common problem with MCMC algorithms is the
unknown convergence time making predictable fixed-length implementations
problematic. When an insufficient number of iterations is used on a slowly
converging example, the output LLRs can be unstable and overconfident.
Therefore, we develop a method to identify rare slowly converging runs and
mitigate their degrading effects on the soft-output information. This improves
forward-error-correcting code performance and removes a symptomatic error floor
in BER plots. Next, pseudo-convergence is identified with a novel way to
visualize the internal behavior of the Gibbs sampler. An effective and
efficient pseudo-convergence detection and escape strategy is suggested.
Finally, the new excited MCMC (X-MCMC) detector is shown to have near
maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) performance even with challenging, realistic,
highly-correlated channels at the maximum MIMO sizes and modulation rates

to measure their magnetization at saturation and their interlayer exchange

for the investigated Ru range thickness (0.5-1 nm). Their dynamic magnetic
properties were studied using Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique. The
BLS measurements reveal pronounced non-reciprocal spin waves propagation. In
contrast to the calculations for symmetrical IEC CoFeB layers, this

model based on the perpendicular interface anisotropy difference between the

dependence of the spin wave non-reciprocity is well reproduced by considering a
constant iDMI and different perpendicular interfacial anisotropy fields between

such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections and numerous smaller-scale
events such as solar jets. These events are often associated with accelerated
particles that can cause emission at radio wavelengths. The reconfiguration of
the solar magnetic field in the corona is believed to be the cause of the
majority of solar energetic events and accelerated particles. Aims. Here, we
investigate a bright J-burst that was associated with a solar jet and the
possible emission mechanism causing these two phenomena. Methods. We used data
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to observe a solar jet, and radio
data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph
(NRH) to observe a J-burst over a broad frequency range (33-173 MHz) on 9 July
2013 at ~11:06 UT. Results. The J-burst showed fundamental and harmonic
components and it was associated with a solar jet observed at extreme
ultraviolet wavelengths with SDO. The solar jet occurred at a time and location
coincident with the radio burst, in the northern hemisphere, and not inside a
group of complex active regions in the southern hemisphere. The jet occurred in
the negative polarity region of an area of bipolar plage. Newly emerged
positive flux in this region appeared to be the trigger of the jet.
Conclusions. Magnetic reconnection between the overlying coronal field lines
and the newly emerged positive field lines is most likely the cause of the
solar jet. Radio imaging provides a clear association between the jet and the
J-burst which shows the path of the accelerated electrons.

signatures and quantify the column densities of H$_2$ ground states in each

there is a clear deviation in high energy states (T$_{exc}$ $\gtrsim$ 20,000 K)
away from thermal equilibrium populations (T(H$_2$) $\gtrsim$ 3500 K).
  We create a metric to estimate the total column density of non-thermal H$_2$
(N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$) and find that the total column densities of thermal
(N(H$_2$)) and N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ correlate for transition disks and targets
with detectable C IV-pumped H$_2$ fluorescence. We compare N(H$_2$) and
N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ to circumstellar observables and find that N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$
correlates with X-ray and FUV luminosities, but no correlations are observed
with the luminosities of discrete emission features (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, C IV).
Additionally, N(H$_2$) and N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ are too low to account for the
H$_2$ fluorescence observed in PPDs, so we speculate that this H$_2$ may
instead be associated with a diffuse, hot, atomic halo surrounding the
planet-forming disk. We create a simple photon-pumping model for each target to
test this hypothesis and find that Ly$\alpha$ efficiently pumps H$_2$ levels

learnt sequentially. This is achieved by formulating the estimator as a
probabilistic model and defining dedicated prior distributions over the kernel

sparsity. The model can then be trained using a subset of data to initialise
standard KAFs or updated sequentially each time a new observation becomes

and inference is achieved using gradient-based maximum-a-posteriori
optimisation and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and can be confidently used
to compute predictions. The proposed framework was validated on nonlinear time

KAFs in terms of mean square error and the sparsity of the learnt dictionaries.

familiar macroscopic counterpart: the possibility of state transitions is not
determined by free energy alone, but by an infinite family of free-energy-like
quantities; strong fluctuations (possibly of quantum origin) allow to extract
less work reliably than what is expected from computing the free energy
difference. However, these known results rely crucially on the assumption that
the thermal machine is not only exactly preserved in every cycle, but also kept
uncorrelated from the quantum systems on which it acts. Here we lift this
restriction: we allow the machine to become correlated with the microscopic
systems on which it acts, while still exactly preserving its own state.
Surprisingly, we show that this restores the second law in its original form:
free energy alone determines the possible state transitions, and the
corresponding amount of work can be invested or extracted from single systems
exactly and without any fluctuations. At the same time, the work reservoir
remains uncorrelated from all other systems and parts of the machine. Thus,
microscopic machines can increase their efficiency via clever ""correlation
engineering"" in a perfectly cyclic manner, which is achieved by a catalytic
system that can sometimes be as small as a single qubit (though some setups
require very large catalysts). Our results also solve some open mathematical
problems on majorization which may lead to further applications in entanglement
theory.

the closed $\Lambda$CDM model has reduced power, relative to the tilted,

luminous flare of thermal emission. About two dozen of these stellar tidal
disruption flares (TDFs) may have been detected in optical transient surveys.
However, explaining the observed properties of these events within the tidal
disruption paradigm is not yet possible. This theoretical ambiguity has led
some authors to suggest that optical TDFs are due to a different process, such
as a nuclear supernova or accretion disk instabilities. Here we present a test
of a fundamental prediction of the tidal disruption event scenario: a
suppression of the flare rate due to the direct capture of stars by the black
hole. Using a recently compiled sample of candidate TDFs with black hole mass
measurements, plus a careful treatment of selection effects in this
flux-limited sample, we confirm that the dearth of observed TDFs from high-mass
black holes is statistically significant. All the TDF impostor models we
consider fail to explain the observed mass function; the only scenario that
fits the data is a suppression of the rate due to direct captures. We find that
this suppression can explain the low volumetric rate of the luminous TDF
candidate ASASSN-15lh, thus supporting the hypothesis that this flare belongs
to the TDF family. Our work is the first to present the optical TDF luminosity
function. A steep power law is required to explain the observed rest-frame
g-band luminosity, $dN/dL_{g} \propto L_{g}^{-2.5}$. The mean event rate of the
flares in our sample is about $1 \times10^{-4}$ per galaxy per year, consistent
with the theoretically expected tidal disruption rate.

length 2 are of four types as in a ""classical"" matroid. Tutte polynomials
$\tau(x,y)$ of matroids are calculated either by recursion over
deletion/contraction of single elements, by an enumeration of bases with
respect to internal/external activities, or by substitution $x \to (x-1),\; y
\to (y-1)$ in their rank generating functions $\rho(x,y)$. The $q$-analogue of
the passage from a Tutte polynomial to its corresponding RGF is
straight-forward, but the analogue of the reverse process $x \to (x-1),\; y \to
(y-1)$ is more delicate.
  For matroids $M(S)$ on a set $S$, and relative to any linear order on the
points, the concept of internal/external activity of a point relative to a
basis gives rise to a partition of the underlying Boolean algebra $B(S)$ into a
set of ""prime-free"" (or ""structureless"") minors, such minors being direct sums
of loops and isthmi (coloops), with one such prime-free minor for each basis.
What usually goes unnoticed is that each prime-free minor has a unique clopen
flat. The latter property carries over to $q$-matroids, but each prime-free
minor will contain many bases. So internal and external activity in
$q$-matroids must be defined not for points relative to bases, but rather for
coverings in the underlying complemented modular lattice. Following lattice
paths from arbitrary subspaces $A$ along active coverings (downward for
internally active, upward for externally active) will lead to the unique clopen
subspace in the prime-free minor containing the subspace $A$.
  There are a number of interesting questions concerning $q$-matroids that
remain unsolved.

density profile, the coffee-ring effect changes the outcome of competition: the
bacterial strain that wins in the low-density interior loses in the far denser

protect their confidentiality and integrity from malicious operating systems.
The SSL/TLS protocol, which is the de facto standard for protecting
transport-layer network communications, has been broadly deployed for a secure
communication channel. However, in this paper, we show that the marriage
between SGX and SSL may not be smooth sailing.
  Particularly, we consider a category of side-channel attacks against SSL/TLS
implementations in secure enclaves, which we call the control-flow inference
attacks. In these attacks, the malicious operating system kernel may perform a
powerful man-in-the-kernel attack to collect execution traces of the enclave
programs at page, cacheline, or branch level, while positioning itself in the
middle of the two communicating parties. At the center of our work is a
differential analysis framework, dubbed Stacco, to dynamically analyze the
SSL/TLS implementations and detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited as
decryption oracles. Surprisingly, we found exploitable vulnerabilities in the
latest versions of all the SSL/TLS libraries we have examined.
  To validate the detected vulnerabilities, we developed a man-in-the-kernel
adversary to demonstrate Bleichenbacher attacks against the latest OpenSSL
library running in the SGX enclave (with the help of Graphene) and completely
broke the PreMasterSecret encrypted by a 4096-bit RSA public key with only
57286 queries. We also conducted CBC padding oracle attacks against the latest
GnuTLS running in Graphene-SGX and an open-source SGX-implementation of mbedTLS
(i.e., mbedTLS-SGX) that runs directly inside the enclave, and showed that it
only needs 48388 and 25717 queries, respectively, to break one block of AES
ciphertext. Empirical evaluation suggests these man-in-the-kernel attacks can
be completed within 1 or 2 hours.

particular vibrational modes leads to a red-shift of the low-frequency edge of
the electronic absorption spectrum, which is a prerequisite for the VIPER

parallel computation} (MPC) frameworks, such as MapReduce, Hadoop, Dryad, or
Spark. One of the reasons for their success is the fact that these frameworks
are able to accurately capture the nature of large-scale computation. In
particular, compared to the classic distributed algorithms or PRAM models,
these frameworks allow for much more local computation. The fundamental
question that arises in this context is though: can we leverage this additional
power to obtain even faster parallel algorithms?
  A prominent example here is the {\em maximum matching} problem---one of the
most classic graph problems. It is well known that in the PRAM model one can
compute a 2-approximate maximum matching in $O(\log{n})$ rounds. However, the
exact complexity of this problem in the MPC framework is still far from
understood. Lattanzi et al. showed that if each machine has $n^{1+\Omega(1)}$
memory, this problem can also be solved $2$-approximately in a constant number
of rounds. These techniques, as well as the approaches developed in the follow
up work, seem though to get stuck in a fundamental way at roughly $O(\log{n})$
rounds once we enter the near-linear memory regime. It is thus entirely
possible that in this regime, which captures in particular the case of sparse
graph computations, the best MPC round complexity matches what one can already
get in the PRAM model, without the need to take advantage of the extra local
computation power.
  In this paper, we finally refute that perplexing possibility. That is, we
break the above $O(\log n)$ round complexity bound even in the case of {\em
slightly sublinear} memory per machine. In fact, our improvement here is {\em
almost exponential}: we are able to deliver a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to
maximum matching, for any fixed constant $\epsilon>0$, in $O((\log \log n)^2)$
rounds.

conventional magnetic fields induce precession at a rate proportional to the
gyromagnetic ratio, rotation shifts the precession of all spins equally, and
thus primarily affect nearby $^{13}$C nuclear spins. We are thus able to
explore these effects via quantum sensing in a rapidly rotating frame, and

coming from the nonminimal coupling with the scalar curvature, saturates the

rotating black hole is obtained by applying an improper coordinate
transformation to the static one. Although both spacetimes are locally
equivalent, they are globally different, as it is confirmed by the nonvanishing

bounded from below by the angular momentum in agreement with the existence of
an event horizon. The thermodynamical analysis is carried out in the grand

exhibited. The thermodynamical local stability of the rotating hairy black

second method is based on introducing a new auxiliary non-local variable with
the subsequent transformation to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding
system of ODEs. The third method is based on adding to the original equation of
a differential constraint, which is an auxiliary ODE connecting the given
variables and a new variable. The proposed methods lead to problems whose
solutions are represented in parametric form and do not have blowing-up
singular points; therefore the transformed problems admit the application of
standard fixed-step numerical methods. The efficiency of these methods is
illustrated by solving a number of test problems that admit an exact analytical
solution. It is shown that: (i) the methods based on non-local transformations
of a special kind are more efficient than several other methods, (ii) among the
proposed methods, the most general method is the method based on the
differential constraints. Some examples of nonclassical blow-up problems are
considered. Simple theoretical estimates are derived for the critical value of
an independent variable. It is shown that the method based on a non-local
transformation of the general form as well as the method based on the
differential constraints admit generalizations to the $n$th-order ODEs and
systems of coupled ODEs.

lengthening by a single information symbol and code extension by at most
$\bigl\lceil t/2\bigr\rceil$ code symbols. Furthermore, by extending a code

family of $t$-server PIR codes. Based on a code construction technique that
lengthens and extends a $t$-server PIR code simultaneously, a basic algorithm
to find good (i.e., small blocklength) $t$-server PIR codes is proposed. For
the special case of $t=5$, we find provably optimal PIR codes for code
dimensions $k\leq 6$, while for all $7\leq k\leq 32$ we find codes of smaller
blocklength than the best known codes from the literature. Furthermore, in the

Kilometre Array (SKA) precursor technology and expertise, specifically from the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope. Using drift scans and a model
for the sky brightness temperature at low frequencies, we have derived the
EDA's receiver temperature as a function of frequency. The EDA is shown to be
sky-noise limited over most of the frequency range measured between 60 and 240
MHz. By using the EDA in interferometric mode with the MWA, we used calibrated
visibilities to measure the absolute sensitivity of the array. The measured
array sensitivity matches very well with a model based on the array layout and
measured receiver temperature. The results demonstrate the practicality and
feasibility of using MWA-style precursor technology for SKA-scale stations. The
modular architecture of the EDA allows upgrades to the array to be rolled out

adversarial perturbations. Slightly perturbing an image in a carefully chosen
direction in the image space may cause a trained neural network model to
misclassify it. Recently, it was shown that physical adversarial examples
exist: printing perturbed images then taking pictures of them would still
result in misclassification. This raises security and safety concerns.
  However, these experiments ignore a crucial property of physical objects: the
camera can view objects from different distances and at different angles. In
this paper, we show experiments that suggest that current constructions of
physical adversarial examples do not disrupt object detection from a moving
platform. Instead, a trained neural network classifies most of the pictures
taken from different distances and angles of a perturbed image correctly. We
believe this is because the adversarial property of the perturbation is
sensitive to the scale at which the perturbed picture is viewed, so (for
example) an autonomous car will misclassify a stop sign only from a small range
of distances.
  Our work raises an important question: can one construct examples that are
adversarial for many or most viewing conditions? If so, the construction should
offer very significant insights into the internal representation of patterns by
deep networks. If not, there is a good prospect that adversarial examples can
be reduced to a curiosity with little practical impact.

vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at

derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful
observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We
present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can
act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We
find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the
long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is
applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence
improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the
39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a
few to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is
improved: 6 by <1%, 11 between 1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies
studied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved, specifically datasets with
low precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the wet
component is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase
stability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher
frequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently
have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for
which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the
scaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other
origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to
undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.

and two-soliton solutions. The general $N$-soliton case is described shortly.
Subsequently, we show that the CH2 system reduces to the CH equation and the

presented in parametric forms, reproducing the existing results for the reduced
equations. Last, we discuss the reduction from the HS2 system to the HS

circular polarization of the 21 cm radiation from the pre-reionization epoch.
Our method relies on the splitting of the $F = 1$ hyperfine level of neutral
hydrogen due to the quadrupole moment of the CMB. We show that unlike the
Zeeman effect, where $M_{F}=\pm 1$ have opposite energy shifts, the CMB
quadrupole shifts $M_{F}=\pm 1$ together relative to $M_{F}= 0$. This splitting
leads to a small circular polarization of the emitted 21 cm radiation. In this
paper (Paper I in a series on this effect), we present calculations on the
microphysics behind this effect, accounting for all processes that affect the
hyperfine transition. We conclude with an analytic formula for the circular
polarization from the Dark Ages as a function of pre-reionization parameters
and the value of the remote quadrupole of the CMB. We also calculate the
splitting of the $F = 1$ hyperfine level due to other anisotropic radiation
sources and show that they are not dominant. In a companion paper (Paper II) we
make forecasts for measuring the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ using future radio
arrays.

($z\sim 20$). The tomographic measurement of 21 cm circular polarization allows
us to construct a 3D remote quadrupole field. Measuring the $B$-mode component
of this remote quadrupole field can be used to put bounds on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We make Fisher forecasts for a future Fast Fourier
Transform Telescope (FFTT), consisting of an array of dipole antennas in a
compact grid configuration, as a function of array size and observation time.
We find that a FFTT with a side length of 100 km can achieve $\sigma(r)\sim
4\times 10^{-3}$ after ten years of observation and with a sky coverage
$f_{\mathrm{sky}}\sim 0.7$. The forecasts are dependent on the evolution of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ flux in the pre-reionization era, that remains observationally
unconstrained. Finally, we calculate the typical order of magnitudes for
circular polarization foregrounds and comment on their mitigation strategies.

clusters of cells responding to gradients, however, there is a critical
difference: even genetically identical cells have differing responses to
chemical signals. With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is
limited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling. We find that when different
cells cooperate the resulting bias can be much larger than the effects of
ligand-receptor binding. Specifically, when a strongly-responding cell is at
one end of a cell cluster, cluster motion is biased toward that cell. These
errors are mitigated if clusters average measurements over times long enough
for cells to rearrange. In consequence, fluid clusters are better able to sense
gradients: we derive a link between cluster accuracy, cell-to-cell variation,
and the cluster rheology. Because of this connection, increasing the noisiness
of individual cell motion can actually increase the collective accuracy of a
cluster by improving fluidity.

which implies an absence of significant mergers, appears to be driven by
secular processes. Short bars of sub-kiloparsec radius have been hypothesized
to be an important mechanism for driving gas inflows to small scale, feeding
central BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this
mechanism, we examine the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence
of BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to be robust, long-lived structures;
extremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely destroy such
bars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in
large-scale outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass $M_{\rm
bh}\sim0.05-0.2\%$ of the total stellar mass ($M_\star$) are present. In
agreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host short bars have
BHs with a mass fraction less than $0.2\%M_\star$. Thus the dissolution of
short inner bars is possible, perhaps even frequent, in the universe. An
important implication of this result is that inner bar-driven gas inflows may
be terminated when BHs grow to $\sim0.1\%M_\star$. We predict that
$0.2\%M_\star$ is the maximum mass of BHs allowed if they are fed predominately
via inner bars. This value matches well the maximum ratio of BH-to-host galaxy
stellar mass observed in galaxies with pseudo-bulges and most nearby AGN host
galaxies. This hypothesis provides a novel explanation for the lower $M_{\rm
bh}/M_\star$ in galaxies which have avoided significant mergers compared with
galaxies with classical bulges.

elements and the semantic structure of mathematical expressions to enable users
to quickly spot deficiencies in the Content MathML markup that does not affect

required reading the verbose and complex MathML markup. VMEXT also allows one
to visualize similar and identical elements of two expressions. Visualizing
expression similarity can support support developers in designing retrieval
approaches and enable improved interaction concepts for users of mathematical
information retrieval systems. We demonstrate VMEXT's visualizations in two
web-based applications. The first application presents the visualizations

approximations and ad-hoc heuristics that may undermine the efficiency and
reliability of power system operations, that are ever growing in scale and

the first time a computational method, which is capable of solving large-scale

particular, the elaborate BDLRR is formulated as a joint optimization problem
of shrinking the unfavorable representation from off-block-diagonal elements
and strengthening the compact block-diagonal representation under the
semi-supervised framework of low-rank representation. To this end, we first
impose penalty constraints on the negative representation to eliminate the
correlation between different classes such that the incoherence criterion of
the extra-class representation is boosted. Moreover, a constructed subspace
model is developed to enhance the self-expressive power of training samples and
further build the representation bridge between the training and test samples,
such that the coherence of the learned intra-class representation is
consistently heightened. Finally, the resulting optimization problem is solved
elegantly by employing an alternative optimization strategy, and a simple
recognition algorithm on the learned representation is utilized for final
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method

(defined as their value for the resource fraction they receive minus their
payment). Starting with the seminal work of Johari and Tsitsiklis [Mathematics
of Operations Research, 2004], a long list of papers studied the price of
anarchy (in terms of the social welfare --- the total users' value) of resource
allocation mechanisms for a variety of allocation and payment rules. Here, we
further assume that each user has a budget constraint that invalidates
strategies that yield a payment that is higher than the user's budget. This
subtle assumption, which is arguably more realistic, constitutes the
traditional price of anarchy analysis meaningless as the set of equilibria may
change drastically and their social welfare can be arbitrarily far from
optimal. Instead, we study the price of anarchy using the liquid welfare
benchmark that measures efficiency taking budget constraints into account. We
show a tight bound of 2 on the liquid price of anarchy of the well-known Kelly
mechanism and prove that this result is essentially best possible among all
multi-user resource allocation mechanisms. This comes in sharp contrast to the
no-budget setting where there are mechanisms that considerably outperform Kelly
in terms of social welfare and even achieve full efficiency. In our proofs, we
exploit the particular structure of worst-case games and equilibria, which also
allows us to design (nearly) optimal two-player mechanisms by solving simple
differential equations.

generalized seniority that corresponds to the quasi-spin $SU(2)$ algebra

and the generators of the corresponding generalized seniority generating
sympletic algebras $Sp(2\Omega)$ in $U(2\Omega) \supset Sp(2\Omega)$ have
one-to-one correspondence. Using these, derived are the special seniority
selection rules for electromagnetic transitions. A particular choice for
$\alpha_j$'s as advocated by Arvieu and Moszkowski (AM) in the past gives
pairing Hamiltonians having maximum correlation with well known effective
interactions. The various results derived for identical fermion systems are
shown to extend to identical boson systems with the bosons occupying
several-$\ell$ orbits as for example in $sd$, $sp$, $sdg$ and $sdpf$ IBM's. The
quasi-spin algebra here is $SU(1,1)$ and the generalized seniority quantum

different $SO(2\Omega)$ algebras here will be important in the study of quantum

results are explained under the basic assumptions of the molecular
recombination model. The ERDA hydrogen counts are composed of two distinct
hydrogen desorption processes, limited by rapid molecular diffusion in the
initial stages of irradiation, and as the fluence progresses a slow process
limited by diffusion of atomic hydrogen takes over. Which of the aforesaid
processes dominates, is determined by the continuously evolving Hydrogen
concentration within the films. The ERDA measurements were also carried out for
films treated with low temperature (300 degrees centigrade) hydrogen plasma
annealing (HPA). The HPA treated films show an improved diffusion of atomic
hydrogen, resulting from healing of weak bonds and passivation of dangling
bonds. Further, upon HPA, films also show evolution of hydrogen with
significantly higher counts, at advanced fluences, relative to the as-deposited
films. These results indicate the potential of HPA towards improved H retention
in a-SiNx:H films. The study distinguishes clearly the presence of two
diffusion processes in a-SiNx:H whose diffusion rates differ by an order of
magnitude, with hydrogen radicals not being able to diffuse beyond ~1 nm from
the point of their creation. The results are very relevant for the passivation
applications of a-SiNx:H

reveal the essential difference between the global scale models and local scale

spatial) distances and sequential (or genomic) distances. More specifically,
clusters from global scale models optimize Euclidean distance relations. Local
scale models, on the other hand, result in clusters that optimize the genomic
distance relations. For a biomolecular data, Euclidean distances and sequential
distances are two independent variables, which can never be optimized
simultaneously in data clustering. However, sequence scale in my SeqMM can work
as a tuning parameter that balances these two variables and deliver different
clusterings based on my purposes. Further, my SeqMM is used to explore the
hierarchical structures of chromosomes. I find that in global scale, the
Fiedler vector from my SeqMM bears a great similarity with the principal vector
from principal component analysis, and can be used to study genomic
compartments. In TAD analysis, I find that TADs evaluated from different scales
are not consistent and vary a lot. Particularly when the sequence scale is
small, the calculated TAD boundaries are dramatically different. Even for
regions with high contact frequencies, TAD regions show no obvious consistence.
However, when the scale value increases further, although TADs are still quite
different, TAD boundaries in these high contact frequency regions become more
and more consistent. Finally, I find that for a fixed local scale, my method

instability that transforms thin bars into boxy or peanut-shaped structures,
but the physical conditions necessary for buckling to occur are not fully
understood. We use the large sample of local disk galaxies in the
Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey to examine the incidence of bars and buckled bars
across the Hubble sequence. Depending on the disk inclination angle ($i$), a
buckled bar reveals itself as either a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge (at high $i$)
or as a barlens structure (at low $i$). We visually identify bars,
boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, and barlenses, and examine the dependence of bar and
buckled bar fractions on host galaxy properties, including Hubble type, stellar
mass, color, and gas mass fraction. We find that the barred and unbarred disks
show similar distributions in these physical parameters. The bar fraction is
higher (70\%--80\%) in late-type disks with low stellar mass ($M_{*} <
10^{10.5}\, M_{\odot}$) and high gas mass ratio. In contrast, the buckled bar
fraction increases to 80\% toward massive and early-type disks ($M_{*} >
10^{10.5}\, M_{\odot}$), and decreases with higher gas mass ratio. These
results suggest that bars are more difficult to grow in massive disks that are
dynamically hotter than low-mass disks. However, once a bar forms, it can
easily buckle in the massive disks, where a deeper potential can sustain the
vertical resonant orbits. We also find a probable buckling bar candidate (ESO
506$-$G004) that could provide further clues to understand the timescale of the
buckling process.

  heterogeneous coherence time",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is one of the key technologies
in future generation networks. Owing to their considerable spectral and energy
efficiency gains, massive MIMO systems provide the needed performance to cope
with the ever increasing wireless capacity demand. Nevertheless, the number of
scheduled users stays limited in massive MIMO both in time division duplexing
(TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. This is due to the
limited coherence time, in TDD systems, and to limited feedback capacity, in
FDD mode. In current systems, the time slot duration in TDD mode is the same
for all users. This is a suboptimal approach since users are subject to
heterogeneous Doppler spreads and, consequently, different coherence times. In
this paper, we investigate a massive MIMO system operating in TDD mode in
which, the frequency of uplink training differs among users based on their
actual channel coherence times. We argue that optimizing uplink training by
exploiting this diversity can lead to considerable spectral efficiency gain. We
then provide a user scheduling algorithm that exploits a coherence interval
based grouping in order to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate.

relationships, but also sheds light on biological functional properties.
However, traditional definitions of structure or sequence similarity always
involve superposition or alignment and are computationally inefficient. In this
paper, I propose a new method called persistent similarity, which is based on a
newly-invented method in algebraic topology, known as persistent homology.
Different from all previous topological methods, persistent homology is able to
embed a geometric measurement into topological invariants, thus provides a
bridge between geometry and topology. Further, with the proposed persistent
Betti function (PBF), topological information derived from the persistent
homology analysis can be uniquely represented by a series of continuous
one-dimensional (1D) functions. In this way, any complicated biomolecular
structure can be reduced to several simple 1D PBFs for comparison. Persistent
similarity is then defined as the quotient of sizes of intersect areas and
union areas between two correspondingly PBFs. If structures have no significant
topological properties, a pseudo-barcode is introduced to insure a better
comparison. Moreover, a multiscale biomolecular representation is introduced
through the multiscale rigidity function. It naturally induces a multiscale
persistent similarity. The multiscale persistent similarity enables an
objective-oriented comparison. State differently, it facilitates the comparison
of structures in any particular scale of interest. Finally, the proposed method
is validated by four different cases. It is found that the persistent
similarity can be used to describe the intrinsic similarities and differences
between the structures very well.

over the other testing IQA approaches for assessing the THz image quality with
PLCC (SROCC) values of 0.8925 (-0.8706), and with RMSE value of 0.3993. The
linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plot further verified that the
Fish__bb could substitute for the subjective IQA. Nonetheless, for the
classification of THz security images, we tended to use S3 as a criterion for
ranking THz security image grades because of the relatively low false positive
rate in classifying bad THz image quality into acceptable category (24.69%).
Interestingly, due to the specific property of THz image, the average pixel
intensity gave the best performance than the above complicated IQA algorithms,

the axial magnetic field in flux-rope coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the
solar corona and farther away in the interplanetary medium. The method, based
on the conservation principle of magnetic helicity, uses the relative magnetic
helicity of the solar source region as input estimates, along with the radius
and length of the corresponding CME flux rope. The method was initially applied
to cylindrical force-free flux ropes, with encouraging results. We hereby
extend our framework along two distinct lines. First, we generalize our
formalism to several possible flux-rope configurations (linear and nonlinear
force-free, non-force-free, spheromak, and torus) to investigate the dependence
of the resulting CME axial magnetic field on input parameters and the employed
flux-rope configuration. Second, we generalize our framework to both Sun-like
and active M-dwarf stars hosting superflares. In a qualitative sense, we find
that Earth may not experience severe atmosphere-eroding magnetospheric
compression even for eruptive solar superflares with energies ~ 10^4 times
higher than those of the largest Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite (GOES) X-class flares currently observed. In addition, the two
recently discovered exoplanets with the highest Earth-similarity index, Kepler

(GC) analysis, which is characterized by the following properties: (i) only the
candidate driver variable is wavelet transformed (ii) the decomposition is
performed using the \`a trous wavelet transform with cubic B-spline filter. We
measure GC, at a given scale, by including the wavelet coefficients of the
driver times series, at that scale, in the regression model of the target. To
validate our method, we apply it to publicly available scalp EEG signals, and
we find that the condition of closed eyes, at rest, is characterized by an
enhanced GC among channels at slow scales w.r.t. eye open condition, whilst the
standard Granger causality is not significantly different in the two
conditions.

familial amyloid neuropathy, cancers, etc.), computing the individual risk of
the disease based on family history (FH) is of critical interest both for
clinicians and patients. Such a risk is very challenging to compute because: 1)
the genotype X of the individual of interest is in general unknown; 2) the
posterior distribution P(X|FH, T > t) changes with t (T is the age at disease
onset for the targeted individual); 3) the competing risk of death is not
negligible. In this work, we present a modeling of this problem using a
Bayesian network mixed with (right-censored) survival outcomes where hazard
rates only depend on the genotype of each individual. We explain how belief
propagation can be used to obtain posterior distribution of genotypes given the
FH, and how to obtain a time-dependent posterior hazard rate for any individual
in the pedigree. Finally, we use this posterior hazard rate to compute
individual risk, with or without the competing risk of death. Our method is
illustrated using the Claus-Easton model for breast cancer (BC). This model
assumes an autosomal dominant genetic risk factor such as non-carriers
(genotype 00) have a BC hazard rate $\lambda$ 0 (t) while carriers (genotypes
01, 10 and 11) have a (much greater) hazard rate $\lambda$ 1 (t). Both hazard
rates are assumed to be piecewise constant with known values (cuts at 20, 30,.
.. , 80 years). The competing risk of death is derived from the national French
registry.

fundamentally important to beat and investigate the systematics. This is best
be done with other independent good distance indicators. One of the promising
method is the flux-weighted gravity luminosity relation (FGLR) of the blue
supergiants. As the blue supergiants are the brightest objects in the galaxies,
they can probe distance up to 10 Mpc, with negligible blending effects. While
the FGLR method delivered distance in good agreement with other distance
indicators, it has been shown that this method delivers larger distance in the

of FGLR suffers systematics from stellar variability. Using CFHT M33 monitoring

stellar variability plays negligible role in the FGLR distance determination.

masses are bounced back due to centrifugal force, since angular momentum
significantly grows before collapse. As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs
are rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the
nondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation. The smaller the density
fluctuation $\sigma_{H}$ at horizon entry is, the stronger the tendency towards
the extreme rotation. Combining the effect of angular momentum with that of
anisotropy, we estimate the black hole production rate. We find that the
production rate suffers from suppression dominantly due to angular momentum for
a smaller value of $\sigma_{H}$, while due to anisotrpopy for a larger value of
$\sigma_{H}$. We argue that matter domination significantly enhances the
production of PBHs despite the suppression. If the matter-dominated phase does
not last so long, the effect of the finite duration significantly suppresses
PBH formation and weakens the tendency towards large spins. (abridged)

essence of chaos are not yet clear. Based on the well-known logistic map, chaos
used to be regarded as intrinsic randomicity of determinate dynamics systems.
However, urbanization dynamics indicates new explanation about it. Using
mathematical derivation, numerical computation, and empirical analysis, we can
explore chaotic dynamics of urbanization. The key is the formula of
urbanization level. The urbanization curve can be described with the logistic
function, which can be transformed into 1-dimensional map and thus produce
bifurcation and chaos. On the other hand, the logistic model of urbanization
curve can be derived from the rural-urban population interaction model, and the
rural-urban interaction model can be discretized to a 2-dimensional map. An
interesting finding is that the 2-dimensional rural-urban coupling map can
create the same bifurcation and chaos patterns as those from the 1-dimensional
logistic map. This suggests that the urban bifurcation and chaos come from
spatial interaction between rural and urban population rather than pure
intrinsic randomicity of determinate models. This discovery provides a new way
of looking at origin and essence of bifurcation and chaos. By analogy with
urbanization models, the classical predator-prey interaction model can be
developed to interpret the complex dynamics of the logistic map in physical and
social sciences.

predicted by QED. In addition to the effect from QED, the effect also has a
possibility to probe the dark sector. The effect predicted by QED is parity
conservative, but the effect from the dark sector can induce parity violation.
To pursue this possibility, we calculated the effect from the dark sector with
the generalized Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian that is applicable to
parity-violating theories. Various dark sector models exist, among which the
contribution of the dark sector neutrinos to the VMB experiment is examined.
The contribution comes from the mixing of photon with the dark sector Z boson
and violates parity, thus inducing a parity-violating electromagnetic
interaction. If the polarization vector is denoted by ${\epsilon}(\theta_i)$
when its direction is rotated by an angle $\theta_i$ from the direction of the
applied magnetic field, the change of the polarization from
${\epsilon}(45^\circ)$ to ${\epsilon}(-45^\circ)$ and vice versa are examined.
The contribution from the dark sector modifies the magnitude of the
polarization change, so it can be detected by measuring the magnitude
precisely. In addition to the change in the magnitude, the dark sector also
induces parity-violating effects. We also propose a new scheme to measure the
effect of parity violation directly. By measuring the change of polarization
from ${\epsilon}(0^{\circ})$ to ${\epsilon}(90^\circ)$, and vice versa, with a
ring Fabry-P\'erot resonator, one can search for the effect directly. The
signal that appears in this scheme is evidence of parity violation from beyond
standard model theories.

advanced persistent threats (APTs). First, an APT-based cyber attack-defense
process is modeled as an individual-level dynamical system. Second, the dynamic
model is shown to exhibit the global stability. On this basis, a new security
metric of cyber networks, which is known as the limit security, is defined as
the limit expected fraction of compromised nodes in the networks. Next, the
influence of different factors on the limit security is illuminated through
theoretical analysis and computer simulation. This work helps understand the

nano-grating fabrication based on laser-induced periodic surface structuring.
In this letter for the first time the usage of the nonlinear laser lithography
as a perspective method of the alignment of nematics was presented. By
nonlinear laser lithography, microgrooves with about 1 {\mu}m period were
formed on Ti layer. The microstructured Ti layer was coated with
oxidianiline-polyimide film with annealing of the polymer followed without any
further processing. Aligning properties of microstructured Ti layers were
examined with combined twist LC cell. The dependencies of the twist angle of LC
cells and azimuthal anchoring energy of layers on scanning speed and power of
laser beam during processing of the Ti layer were the focus of our studies as
well. The maximum azimuthal anchoring energy, obtained for pure microstructured
Ti layer, is comparable with photoalignment technology. It was found that the
deposition of polyimide film on microstructured Ti layer leads to the gain
effect of the azimuthal anchoring energy. Also, AFM study of aligning surfaces
was carried out.

effect is principally understood using the relation between the ingoing modes
which leave past null infinity and the outgoing modes which arrive at future
null infinity. Naturally, these modes are described using advanced and retarded
null coordinates instead of the usual Schwarzschild coordinates. However, null
coordinates do not lead to a true Hamiltonian that describes the evolution of
these modes. In order to overcome these hurdles in a canonical formulation, we
introduce here a set of near-null coordinates which allows one to perform an
exact Hamiltonian-based derivation of the Hawking effect. This derivation opens
up an avenue to explore the Hawking effect using different canonical
quantization methods such as polymer quantization.

play a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. A
proper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires
approaches more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed
further light onto this problem, in this paper we propose a unifying framework
based on different analytical and numerical tools available to deal with

white noise, and then we apply a standard path integral approach to gain

using as a guideline a variation of the contact process--which can also be seen
as a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst class--where the propagation
or birth rate varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle
in a systematic manner some of the relevant questions concerning population
dynamics under environmental variability, such as determining the stationary
population density, establishing the conditions under which a population may
become extinct, and estimating extinction times. We focus on the emerging phase
diagram and its possible phase transitions, underlying how these are affected
by the presence of environmental noise time-correlations.

overdensities $\xi\le 100$. The lensing-comptonization cross-correlation is
dominated by gas with overdensities in the range $\xi\approx[3-33]$; the signal
is generated at redshifts $z\le 1$. If only 10\% of the measured

an upper limit of $\bar{T}_e\lesssim 10^6$K on the mean temperature of Inter

confirm that the state space Riemannian manifold becomes strongly curved in
regions where the black hole system develops strong statistical correlations in
the grand canonical ensemble ($M$ and $Q$ fluctuating). We establish the exact
proportionality between the state space scalar curvature $R$ and the inverse of
the singular free energy near the isolated critical point for the grand
canonical ensemble in spacetime dimension $d=5$, thus hopefully moving a step
closer to the agenda of a concrete physical interpretation of $R$ for black
holes. On the other hand, we show that while $R$ signals the Davies transition
points (which exist in GB-AdS black holes for $d \ge 6$) through its
divergence, it does not scale as the inverse of the singular free energy there.
Furthermore, adapting to the black hole case the ideas developed in
\cite{rupp2} in the context of pure fluids, we find that the state space
geometry encodes phase coexistence and first order transitions, identifies the
asymptotically critical region and even suggests a Widom line like crossover
regime in the supercritical region for $5-d$ case. The sign of $R$ appears to
imply a significant difference between the microscopic structure of the small

single-microphone, speaker-independent speech separation remains challenging
for two main reasons. The first reason is the arbitrary order of the target and
masker speakers in the mixture permutation problem, and the second is the
unknown number of speakers in the mixture output dimension problem. We propose
a novel deep learning framework for speech separation that addresses both of
these issues. We use a neural network to project the time-frequency
representation of the mixture signal into a high-dimensional embedding space. A
reference point attractor is created in the embedding space to represent each
speaker which is defined as the centroid of the speaker in the embedding space.
The time-frequency embeddings of each speaker are then forced to cluster around
the corresponding attractor point which is used to determine the time-frequency
assignment of the speaker. We propose three methods for finding the attractors
for each source in the embedding space and compare their advantages and
limitations. The objective function for the network is standard signal
reconstruction error which enables end-to-end operation during both training
and test phases. We evaluated our system using the Wall Street Journal dataset
WSJ0 on two and three speaker mixtures and report comparable or better
performance than other state-of-the-art deep learning methods for speech
separation.

that the solution to the large hierarchy problem of the weak scale remains

neatly explained by unsteady flow of gas in a barred potential. We use
high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations coupled to a state-of-the-art

point-symmetric with respect to the Galactic Centre, asymmetries develop
spontaneously due to the combination of a hydrodynamical instability known as

The other way is based on the point of view of Hertz, by considering the system
as a projection of a free system. In the later manner, the ""time"" appearing in
the Schr\""odinger equation is a linear combination of the time-duration with
the ""time"" quotient of the action by the energy on each solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Both of them are based on a rule of quantization that
we explain in Section 4.

electromagnetic waves. Focusing and polarization state analysis are among
functions, required for effective manipulation of radiation. Here a
polarization sensitive Fresnel zone plate lens is proposed and experimentally
demonstrated for GHz spectral range. Two spatially separated focal spots for
orthogonal polarizations are obtained by designing metasurface pattern, made of
overlapping tightly packed cross and rod shaped antennas with a strong
polarization selectivity. Optimized subwavelength pattern allows multiplexing
two different lenses with low polarization crosstalk on the same substrate and
provides a control over focal spots of the lens only by changing of the
polarization state of the incident wave. More than a wavelength separation
between the focal spots was demonstrated for a broad spectral range, covering
half a decade in frequency. The proposed concept could be straightforwardly
extended for THz and visible spectra, where polarization-sensitive elements
utilize localized plasmon resonance phenomenon.

$\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, s.t. $f=\left|\alpha\right|^2$ is a solution of a

regular energy functional on a subspace of distribution functions $f\in L^1$.
Secondly, we give a full well-posedness theory for the obtained system
corresponding to Vlasov-Poisson in $d\geq3$ dimensions. Finally, we adapt the
classical globality results for $d=3$ to the generalized system.

valuable information about their evolutionary status. Their detection can be
performed using the $\Delta a$ photometric system, which maps a characteristic
flux depression at $\lambda \sim 5200$ \AA. This paper aims at studying the
occurrence of CP stars in the earliest stages of evolution of a stellar
population by applying this technique to Hogg 16, a very young Galactic open
cluster (about 25 Myr). We identified several peculiar candidates: two B-type
stars with a negative $\Delta a$ index (CD-60 4701, CPD-60 4706) are likely
emission-line (Be) stars, even though spectral measurements are necessary for a
proper classification of the second one; a third object (CD-60 4703),
identified as a Be candidate in literature, appears to be a background B-type
supergiant with no significant $\Delta a$ index, which does not rule out the
possibility that it is indeed peculiar as the normality line of $\Delta a$ for
supergiants has not been studied in detail yet. A fourth object (CD-60 4699)
appears to be a magnetic CP star of 8 M$_\odot$, but obtained spectral data
seem to rule out this hypothesis. Three more magnetic CP star candidates are
found in the domain of early F-type stars. One is a probable nonmember and
close to the border of significance, but the other two are probably pre-main
sequence cluster objects. This is very promising, as it can lead to very strong
constraints to the diffusion theory. Finally, we derived the fundamental
parameters of Hogg 16 and provide for the first time an estimate of its metal
content.

Lagrangian systems. Due to the discontinuity resulted from the switching
topology, achieving consensus in the context of uncertain Lagrangian systems is
challenging. We propose a new adaptive controller based on dynamic feedback to
resolve this problem and additionally propose a new analysis tool for
rigorously demonstrating the stability and convergence of the networked
systems. The new introduced analysis tool is referred to as uniform
integral-L_p stability, which is motivated for addressing integral-input-output
properties of linear time-varying systems. It is then shown that the consensus
errors between the systems converge to zero so long as the union of the graphs
contains a directed spanning tree. It is also shown that the proposed
controller enjoys the robustness with respect to constant communication delays.
The performance of the proposed adaptive controllers is shown by numerical
simulations.

microquasar SS 433 make this source a good candidate for a very high-energy
(VHE) gamma-ray emitter. Gamma-ray fluxes have been predicted for both the
central binary and the interaction regions between jets and surrounding nebula.
Also, non-thermal emission at lower energies has been previously reported. We
explore the capability of SS 433 to emit VHE gamma rays during periods in which
the expected flux attenuation due to periodic eclipses and precession of the
circumstellar disk periodically covering the central binary system is expected
to be at its minimum. The eastern and western SS433/W50 interaction regions are
also examined. We aim to constrain some theoretical models previously developed
for this system. We made use of dedicated observations from MAGIC and H.E.S.S.
from 2006 to 2011 which were combined for the first time and accounted for a
total effective observation time of 16.5 h. Gamma-ray attenuation does not
affect the jet/medium interaction regions. The analysis of a larger data set
amounting to 40-80 h, depending on the region, was employed. No evidence of VHE
gamma-ray emission was found. Upper limits were computed for the combined data
set. We place constraints on the particle acceleration fraction at the inner
jet regions and on the physics of the jet/medium interactions. Our findings
suggest that the fraction of the jet kinetic power transferred to relativistic
protons must be relatively small to explain the lack of TeV and neutrino
emission from the central system. At the SS433/W50 interface, the presence of
magnetic fields greater 10$\mu$G is derived assuming a synchrotron origin for
the observed X-ray emission. This also implies the presence of high-energy
electrons with energies up to 50 TeV, preventing an efficient production of
gamma-ray fluxes in these interaction regions.

velocities in brittle materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically
undergo a micro-branching instability at about 40% of their sonic limiting
velocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks
unprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without
micro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their
fundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in
condensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture
instabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical
theory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a
stressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict
crack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle
fracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in
the presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by
extensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability
controlled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This
instability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an
intrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture
energy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This
ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the
classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack
dynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles
in the failure of materials.

primarily due to the formation of collisionless shocks, that should affect the

the focal spot can be freely moved in a large area by small variations of the

illuminate magnonic devices like nano oscillators with a steerable spin wave

sub-sampling to solve the two problems. With ultrashort optical pulse and a
pair of chromatic dispersions, the broadband RF signal is firstly short-time
Fourier-transformed to a spectrum-spread pulse. Then a time slot, corresponding
to the target spectrum slice, is coherently optical-sampled with
in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) demodulation. We demonstrate the novel bandpass
sampling by a numerical example, which shows the desired uneven intensity
response, i.e. pre-filtering. We show in theory that appropriate time-stretch
capacity from dispersion can result in pre-filtering bandwidth less than
sampling rate. Image rejection due to I/Q sampling is also analyzed. A
proof-of-concept experiment, which is based on a time-lens sampling source and
chirped fiber Bragg gratings (CFBGs), shows the center-frequency-tunable

urbanisation of our planet (United Nations, 2014) and the spread of ubiquitous
computing (Weiser, 1991) and urban data streams. This process of urbanisation
corresponds with the process of digitalisation of urban life: while
urbanisation acts on a physical infrastructural level, the digital develops as
a kind of metastructure above the infrastructure. This metastructural level
offers a flexible framework through which information is continuously and
operatively being symbolized. Today, Information technology and the
availability of abundant urban data streams could be considered as forerunners
of our time, having unprecedented impacts comparable to the ones brought by the
steam engine at the dawn of industrialisation and the electrification of
cities. It is therefore no longer conceivable to think of the physical
structure of the city without including its digital counterpart. Against this
background, we will explore the role of computational power and information
technologies as dominant factors in the formation of computational urban models
and normative city theories. We will show how these models and theories,
emerging mainly during the 19th and 20th centuries, present leaping
correspondences with more ancient conceptions of the city, when observed from a
meta-level or episteme (Foucault, 2002) approach. First, and for the sake of
clarity, we will deal with some methodological elucidations around the concepts
of theory, model and episteme, and how we will refer conceptually to these
terms throughout this paper. Secondly, we will review these evolving
technological and computational levels of abstraction and their influence on
the different conceptions of the city. Thirdly, we will develop the hypothesis
of a conceptual gap, between our current technological capacity -- grounded on
the abundance and availability of urban data streams -- and the state of the
art in urban modelling and city theory. Lastly, building upon Foucault's
concept of episteme (Foucault, 1970) and genealogy (Foucault, 1977b), we will
explore this gap by speculating around the possibility of an inversion in
computational urban modelling and city theory. And above all, we will question
the terms in which we can think of the city, in an age where the world can be
virtually conceived as fully urban, and the continuity and abundance of urban
data streams giving account of it can be taken for granted. How are we
articulating the phenomena we call city on top of this generic common ground?

in multiple fields, such as quan- tum metrology, quantum lithography or even
biological systems. State-of-the-art methods to obtain them rely on
post-selection, multi-level systems or Rydberg atomic ensembles. Recently, it
was shown that a strongly driven two-level system interacting with a detuned
cavity mode can be engineered to continuously emit n-photon states. In the
present work, we show that spectral filtering of its emission relaxes
considerably the requirements on the system parameters even to the more
accessible bad-cavity situation, opening up the possibility of implementing
this protocol in a much wider landscape of different platforms. This
improvement is based on a key observation: in the imperfect case where only a
certain fraction of emission is composed of n-photon states, these have a well
defined energy separated from the rest of the signal, which allows to reveal
and purify multiphoton emission just by frequency filtering. We demonstrate
these results by obtaining analytical expressions for relevant figures of merit
of multiphoton emission, such as the n-photon coupling rate between cavity and
emitter, the fraction of light emitted as n-photon states, and n-photon
emission rates. This allows us to make a systematic study of such figures of
merit as a function of the system parameters and demonstrate the viability of
the protocol in several relevant types of cavity QED setups, where we take into
account the impact of their respective experimental limitations.

only be stated ""up to homotopy"", and thus require coherences. The established
notion of a univalent category (Ahrens, Kapulkin, Shulman) solves this by
considering only truncated types, roughly corresponding to an ordinary
category. This fails to capture many naturally occurring structures, stemming
from the fact that the naturally occurring structures in homotopy type theory
are not ordinary, but rather higher categories.
  Out of the large variety of approaches to higher category theory that
mathematicians have proposed, we believe that, for type theory, the simplicial
strategy is best suited. Work by Lurie and Harpaz motivates the following
definition. Given the first (n+3) levels of a semisimplicial type S, we can
equip S with three properties: first, contractibility of the types of certain
horn fillers; second, a completeness property; and third, a truncation
condition. We call this a complete semi-Segal n-type. This is very similar to
an earlier suggestion by Schreiber.
  The definition of a univalent (1-) category can easily be extended or
restricted to the definition of a univalent n-category (more precisely,
(n,1)-category) for n in {0,1,2}, and we show that the type of complete
semi-Segal n-types is equivalent to the type of univalent $n$-categories in
these cases. Thus, we believe that the notion of a complete semi-Segal n-type
can be taken as the definition of a univalent n-category.
  We provide a formalisation in the proof assistant Agda using a completely
explicit representation of semi-simplicial types for levels up to 4.

foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range
$0.2<z<0.8$, and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with photometric
redshifts $\gtrsim1.2$. It constitutes a substantial improvement over the
cross-correlation measurements made by Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. (2014) with
updated catalogues and wider area (with $S/N\gtrsim 5$ below 10' and reaching
$S/N\sim 20$ below 30""). The better statistics allow us to split the sample in
different redshift bins and to perform a tomographic analysis (with $S/N\gtrsim
3$ below 10 arcmin and reaching $S/N\sim 15$ below 30""). Moreover, we implement
a halo model to extract astrophysical information about the background galaxies
and the deflectors that are producing the lensing link between the foreground
(lenses) and background (sources) samples. In the case of the sources, we find
typical mass values in agreement with previous studies: a minimum halo mass to
host a central galaxy, $M_{min}\sim 10^{12.26} M_\odot$, and a pivot halo mass
to have at least one sub-halo satellite, $M_1\sim 10^{12.84} M_\odot$. However,
the lenses are massive galaxies or even galaxy groups/clusters, with minimum
mass of $M_{min}^{lens}\sim 10^{13.06} M_\odot$. Above a mass of
$M_1^{lens}\sim 10^{14.57} M_\odot$ they contain at least one additional
satellite galaxy which contributes to the lensing effect. The tomographic
analysis shows that, while $M_1^{lens}$ is almost redshift independent, there
is a clear evolution of increase $M_{min}^{lens}$ with redshift in agreement
with theoretical estimations. Finally, the halo modeling allows us to identify
a strong lensing contribution to the cross-correlation for angular scales below
30"". This interpretation is supported by the results of basic but effective
simulations.

paper, we show how macromanagement decisions in StarCraft can be learned
directly from game replays using deep learning. Neural networks are trained on
789,571 state-action pairs extracted from 2,005 replays of highly skilled
players, achieving top-1 and top-3 error rates of 54.6% and 22.9% in predicting
the next build action. By integrating the trained network into UAlbertaBot, an
open source StarCraft bot, the system can significantly outperform the game's
built-in Terran bot, and play competitively against UAlbertaBot with a fixed

express a wide range of different strategies and thus improving the network's

promising avenue for future research. Ultimately this approach could lead to
strong StarCraft bots that are less reliant on hard-coded strategies.

disentangled A1 and A2, the two protostellar cores present. For the first time,
we were able to derive the column densities and fractional abundances
simultaneously for the two objects, allowing us to analyse the chemical
differences between them. Molecular emission from organic molecules is
concentrated exclusively in A2 even though A1 is the strongest continuum
emitter. The protostellar core A2 displays typical hot corino abundances and
its deconvolved size is 70 au. In contrast, the upper limits we placed on
molecular abundances for A1 are extremely low, lying about one order of
magnitude below prestellar values. The difference in the amount of organic
molecules present in A1 and A2 ranges between one and two orders of magnitude.
Our results suggest that the optical depth of dust emission at these
wavelengths is unlikely to be sufficiently high to completely hide a hot corino
in A1 similar in size to that in A2. Thus, the significant contrast in
molecular richness found between the two sources is most probably real. We
estimate that the size of a hypothetical hot corino in A1 should be less than
12 au. Our results favour a scenario in which the protostar in A2 is either
more massive and/or subject to a higher accretion rate than A1, as a result of
inhomogeneous fragmentation of the parental molecular clump. This naturally
explains the smaller current envelope mass in A2 with respect to A1 along with
its molecular richness.

developed starting with a closed system in contact with a heat bath. A
trajectory undergoes Markovian transitions between observable meso-states that
correspond to a coarse-grained description of, e.g., a biomolecule or a
biochemical network. By separating the closed system into a core system and
into reservoirs for ligands and reactants that bind to, and react with the core
system, a description as an open system controlled by chemical potentials and
possibly an external force is achieved. Entropy production and further
thermodynamic quantities defined along a trajectory obey various fluctuation
theorems. For describing fluctuations in a non-equilibrium steady state in the
long-time limit, the concept of a rate function for large deviations from the
mean behaviour is derived from the weight of a trajectory. Universal bounds on
this rate function follow which prove and generalize the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation that quantifies the inevitable trade-off between cost and
precision of any biomolecular process. Specific illustrations are given for
molecular motors, Brownian clocks and enzymatic networks that show how these
tools can be used for thermodynamic inference of hidden properties of a system.

which was monitored for 6 days with the Medicina Radio Astronomical Station and
the Sardinia Radio Telescope. Long observations were performed in order to
follow the evolution of the flare on a hourly scale, covering six frequency
ranges from 1.5 GHz to 25.6 GHz. The radio emission reached a maximum of 13.2
+/- 0.7 Jy at 7.2 GHz and 10 +/- 1 Jy at 18.6 GHz. Rapid flux variations were
observed at high radio frequencies at the peak of the flare, together with
rapid evolution of the spectral index: alpha steepened from 0.3 to 0.6 within 5
hours. This is the first time that such fast variations are observed, giving
support to the evolution from optically thick to optically thin plasmons in
expansion moving outward from the core. Based on the Italian network (Noto,
Medicina and SRT) and extended to the European antennas (Torun, Yebes, Onsala),
VLBI observations were triggered at 22 GHz on five different occasions, four
times prior to the giant flare, and once during its decay phase. Flux
variations of 2-hour duration were recorded during the first session. They
correspond to a mini-flare that occurred close to the core ten days before the
onset of the giant flare. From the latest VLBI observation we infer that four
days after the flare peak the jet emission was extended over 30 mas.

  ESOP 2018",,,,"cs.PL cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Operational semantics have been enormously successful, in large part due to
its flexibility and simplicity, but they are not compositional. Denotational
semantics, on the other hand, are compositional but the lattice-theoretic
models are complex and difficult to scale to large languages. However, there
are elementary models of the $\lambda$-calculus that are much less complex: by
Coppo, Dezani-Ciancaglini, and Salle (1979), Engeler (1981), and Plotkin
(1993).
  This paper takes first steps toward answering the question: can elementary
models be good for the day-to-day work of language specification,
mechanization, and compiler correctness? The elementary models in the
literature are simple, but they are not as intuitive as they could be. To
remedy this, we create a new model that represents functions literally as
finite graphs. Regarding mechanization, we give the first machine-checked proof
of soundness and completeness of an elementary model with respect to an
operational semantics. Regarding compiler correctness, we define a polyvariant
inliner for the call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus and prove that its output is
contextually equivalent to its input. Toward scaling elementary models to
larger languages, we formulate our semantics in a monadic style, give a
semantics for System F with general recursion, and mechanize the proof of type
soundness.

  Minimizing Resampling Distortion",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large field-of-view fisheye lens cameras have attracted more and more
researchers' attention in the field of robotics. However, there does not exist
a convenient off-the-shelf stereo rectification approach which can be applied
directly to fisheye stereo rig. One obvious drawback of existing methods is
that the resampling distortion (which is defined as the loss of pixels due to
under-sampling and the creation of new pixels due to over-sampling during
rectification process) is severe if we want to obtain a rectification with
epipolar line (not epipolar circle) constraint. To overcome this weakness, we
propose a novel pixel-wise local homography technique for stereo rectification.
First, we prove that there indeed exist enough degrees of freedom to apply
pixel-wise local homography for stereo rectification. Then we present a method
to exploit these freedoms and the solution via an optimization framework.
Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method have been
verified on real fisheye lens images. The rectification results show that the
proposed approach can effectively reduce the resampling distortion in
comparison with existing methods while satisfying the epipolar line constraint.
By employing the proposed method, dense stereo matching and 3D reconstruction
for fisheye lens camera become as easy as perspective lens cameras.

strategies for quantile regression models. In classical Least Squares
Estimation (LSE) method, the relationship between the explanatory and explained
variables in the coordinate plane is estimated with a mean regression line. In
order to use LSE, there are three main assumptions on the error terms showing
white noise process of the regression model, also known as Gauss-Markov
Assumptions, must be met: (1) The error terms have zero mean, (2) The variance
of the error terms is constant and (3) The covariance between the errors is
zero i.e., there is no autocorrelation. However, data in many areas, including
econometrics, survival analysis and ecology, etc. does not provide these
assumptions. First introduced by Koenker, quantile regression has been used to
complement this deficiency of classical regression analysis and to improve the
least square estimation. The aim of this study is to improve the performance of
quantile regression estimators by using pre-test and shrinkage strategies. A
Monte Carlo simulation study including a comparison with quantile $L_1$--type
estimators such as Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net are designed to evaluate the
performances of the estimators. Two real data examples are given for
illustrative purposes. Finally, we obtain the asymptotic results of suggested
estimators

the three ($x$, $y$ and $z$) components. This has important consequences for
possible spintronic applications. The charge conductance shows interesting
behaviour near the zero of the Fermi energy. Where in presence of magnetic
adatoms the familiar plateau at $2e^2/h$ vanishes, thereby transforming a
quantum spin Hall insulating phase to an ordinary insulator. The local charge
current and the local spin current provide an intuitive idea on the conductance
features of the system. We found that, the local charge current is independent
of Rashba SOI, while the three components of the local spin currents are
sensitive to Rashba SOI. Moreover the fluctuations of the spin polarized
conductance are found to be useful quantities as they show specific trends,
that is, they enhance with increasing adatom densities. A two terminal GNR
device seems to be better suited for possible spintronic applications.

composite materials often takes into account the periodicity of the underlying
micro-structure. A well established method dealing with the structural behavior
of periodic micro-structures is the so- called Asymptotic Expansion
Homogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material
displacement, scale bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors,
can be derived in order to connect the strains at the level of the
macro-structure with micro- structural strains. For complicated inhomogeneous
micro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the
numerical solution of a PDE problem - typically with the Finite Element Method.
Moreover, when dealing with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material
parameters, there is considerable uncertainty introduced in the actual stresses
experienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost of computing
the elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing
with the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly
computationally intractable. This problem is even more pronounced when the
effect of damage in the micro-scale is considered, where re-evaluation of the
micro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every occurring
damage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling
approach is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale
behavior of the structure with the material behavior in the micro-scale,
therefore reducing the number of costly evaluations of corrector functions,
allowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static
damage in the analysis of composite structural components.

gas-phase molecular fingerprinting of acetylene with a high-spectral-resolution

of great interest in a communication scenario. Since polar codes are capacity
achieving codes with low encoding-decoding complexity and they can approach
perfect secrecy rates for binary-input degraded wiretap channels in symmetric
settings, they are investigated extensively in the literature recently. In this
paper, a polar coding scheme to achieve secrecy capacity in non-symmetric
binary input channels is proposed. The proposed scheme satisfies security and
reliability conditions. The wiretap channel is assumed to be stochastically
degraded with respect to the legitimate channel and message distribution is
uniform. The information set is sent over channels that are good for Bob and
bad for Eve. Random bits are sent over channels that are good for both Bob and
Eve. A frozen vector is chosen randomly and is sent over channels bad for both.
We prove that there exists a frozen vector for which the coding scheme
satisfies reliability and security conditions and approaches the secrecy
capacity. We further empirically show that in the proposed scheme for
non-symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels, the equivocation rate
achieves its upper bound in the whole capacity-equivocation region.

commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational
constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around
this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse
representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a
concatenation of banded Circulant matrices. While several works have presented
algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very
few truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In
this work, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model
providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions
and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal

the $\ell_0$ norm, mutual coherence, Spark and RIP to their counterparts in the
convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global
model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit
problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind
bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local
treatment.
