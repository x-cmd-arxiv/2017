viral progression. In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core, DDX3X contains
N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we investigate the substrate and protein
requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80
residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that
for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a
single-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA
structural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting
only of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded
RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a
single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X
to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the
single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer
formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity. Interestingly,
the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the protein concentration suggests that the
DDX3X trimer hydrolyzes only two molecules of ATP. Lastly, a DNA substrate that
contains single-stranded-double-stranded regions does not support the ATPase
activity of DDX3X.

added, i.e. at large P\'eclet numbers, several intermediate time scales arise,
with qualitatively and quantitatively different transport properties: depending
on the parameter of the flow, the initial position of a tracer, and the aging
time, motion of the tracers ranges from subdiffusive to super-ballistic.
Extensive numerical simulations of the aged mean squared displacement for

necessary conditions for the existence of a solution. The necessary condition
is a thermodynamic one, namely that the adiabatic bulk modulus, $K_S$, of the

and $f$ is an arbitrary function. Although this condition has appeared in the

basic shock stability principles -- an interesting connection to the existing
literature on the relationship between self-similarity of the second kind and

Load-following control costs are expressed through the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR). The power network is described by a set of nonlinear
differential algebraic equations (DAEs). By linearizing the DAEs around a known
equilibrium, a linearized OPF that accounts for steady-state operational
constraints is formulated first. This linearized OPF is then augmented by a set
of linear matrix inequalities that are algebraically equivalent to the
implementation of an LQR controller. The resulting formulation, termed LQR-OPF,
is a semidefinite program which furnishes optimal steady-state setpoints and an
optimal feedback law to steer the system to the new steady state with minimum
load-following control costs. Numerical tests demonstrate that the setpoints
computed by LQR-OPF result in lower overall costs and frequency deviations

terms of the maximum degree $\Delta$ of the input graph $G$ and hold when

graphs with girth $\geq 5$ and $\Delta$ sufficiently large where $\alpha\approx
1.7632\ldots$ is the root of $\alpha=\exp(1/\alpha)$; further improvements on
the constant $\alpha$ hold with stronger girth and maximum degree assumptions.
For sparse random graphs the maximum degree is a function of $n$ and the goal
is to obtain results in terms of the expected degree $d$. The following rapid
mixing results for $G(n,d/n)$ hold with high probability over the choice of the
random graph for sufficiently large constant~$d$. Mossel and Sly (2009) proved
rapid mixing for constant $k$, and Efthymiou (2014) improved this to $k$ linear
in~$d$. The condition was improved to $k>3d$ by Yin and Zhang (2016) using
non-MCMC methods. Here we prove rapid mixing when $k>\alpha d$ where
$\alpha\approx 1.7632\ldots$ is the same constant as above. Moreover we obtain
$O(n^{3})$ mixing time of the Glauber dynamics, while in previous rapid mixing
results the exponent was an increasing function in $d$. As in previous results
for random graphs our proof analyzes an appropriately defined block dynamics to

quadratic rational maps ${\bf rat}_2$, consisting of maps with totally
disconnected Julia sets. Whereas the Cantor locus is well understood, its
boundary and dynamical relation to the boundary is not. In this paper we
explore the boundary of the Cantor locus near parabolic boundary points. We do
this by constructing a local parametrization, which fixes the dynamical
positions of the critical values, relative to the parabolic basin of the
quadratic polynomial $\mathrm{P}_{\omega_{p/q}}(z)=\omega_{p/q} z+z^2$,
$\omega_{p/q}=e^{2\pi ip/q}$. We characterize which pairs, of dynamical

controls the dynamical postions of the critical values, for any limit point in
the bounded case, and for any limit point of a rescaled sequence of $q$th

methods for modulation of its intensity and polarisation. Magneto-optical
effects at the nanoscale are usually observed in magnetophotonic crystals,
nanostructured hybrid materials or magnetoplasmonic crystals. An indirect
action of an external magnetic field (e.g. through the Faraday effect) is
explained by the fact that natural materials exhibit negligible magnetism at
optical frequencies. However, the concept of metamaterials overcome this
limitation imposed by nature by designing artificial subwavelength meta-atoms
that support a strong magnetic response, usually termed as optical magnetism,
even when they are made of nonmagnetic materials. The fundamental question is
what would be the effect of the interaction between an external magnetic field
and an optically-induced magnetic response of metamaterial structures. Here we
make the first step toward answering this fundamental question and demonstrate
the multifold enhancement of the magneto-optical response of nanoantenna

rotating turbulent flows in triple periodic domains, varying the Rossby number
$Ro$ (that measures the inverse rotation rate) and the Reynolds number $Re$
(that measures the strength of turbulence). The examined flows are sustained by
either a helical or a non-helical Roberts force, that is invariant along the
axis of rotation. The forcing acts at a wavenumber $k_f$ such that $k_fL=4$,
where $2\pi L$ is the size of the domain. Different flow behaviours were
obtained as the parameters are varied. Above a critical rotation rate the flow
becomes quasi two dimensional and transfers energy to the largest scales of the
system forming large coherent structures known as condensates. We examine the
behaviour of these condensates and their scaling properties close and away from
this critical rotation rate. Close to the the critical rotation rate the system
transitions super-critically to the condensate state displaying a bimodal
behaviour oscillating randomly between an incoherent-turbulent state and a
condensate state. Away from the critical rotation rate, it is shown that two
distinct mechanisms can saturate the growth of the large scale energy. The
first mechanism is due to viscous forces and is similar to the saturation
mechanism observed for the inverse cascade in two-dimensional flows. The second
mechanism is independent of viscosity and relies on the breaking of the
two-dimensionalization condition of the rotating flow. The two mechanisms
predict different scaling with respect to the control parameters of the system
(Rossby and Reynolds), which are tested with the present results of the
numerical simulations. A phase space diagram in the $Re,Ro$ parameter plane is
sketched.

convolutional neural networks to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual
tracking. Deep neural networks trained on object recognition datasets consist
of multiple convolutional layers. These layers encode target appearance with
different levels of abstraction. For example, the outputs of the last
convolutional layers encode the semantic information of targets and such
representations are invariant to significant appearance variations. However,
their spatial resolutions are too coarse to precisely localize the target. In
contrast, features from earlier convolutional layers provide more precise
localization but are less invariant to appearance changes. We interpret the
hierarchical features of convolutional layers as a nonlinear counterpart of an
image pyramid representation and explicitly exploit these multiple levels of
abstraction to represent target objects. Specifically, we learn adaptive
correlation filters on the outputs from each convolutional layer to encode the
target appearance. We infer the maximum response of each layer to locate
targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. To further handle the issues with scale
estimation and re-detecting target objects from tracking failures caused by
heavy occlusion or out-of-the-view movement, we conservatively learn another
correlation filter, that maintains a long-term memory of target appearance, as
a discriminative classifier. We apply the classifier to two types of object
proposals: (1) proposals with a small step size and tightly around the
estimated location for scale estimation; and (2) proposals with large step size
and across the whole image for target re-detection. Extensive experimental
results on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm
performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods.

the fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) 2007on and 2011iv, hosted by the
Fornax cluster member NGC 1404. The B-band light curves of SN 2007on and SN
2011iv are characterised by dm_15(B) decline-rate values of 1.96 mag and 1.77
mag, respectively. Although they have similar decline rates, their peak B- and
H-band magnitudes differ by ~0.60 mag and ~0.35 mag, respectively. After
correcting for the luminosity vs. decline rate and the luminosity vs. colour
relations, the peak B-band and H-band light curves provide distances that
differ by ~14% and ~9%, respectively. These findings serve as a cautionary tale
for the use of transitional SNe Ia located in early-type hosts in the quest to
measure cosmological parameters. Interestingly, even though SN 2011iv is
brighter and bluer at early times, by three weeks past maximum and extending
over several months, its B-V colour is 0.12 mag redder than that of SN 2007on.
To reconcile this unusual behaviour, we turn to guidance from a suite of
spherical one-dimensional Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation explosion
models. In this context, 56Ni production depends on both the so-called
transition density and the central density of the progenitor white dwarf. To
first order, the transition density drives the luminosity-width relation, while
the central density is an important second-order parameter. Within this
context, the differences in the B-V color evolution along the Lira regime
suggests the progenitor of SN~2011iv had a higher central density than
SN~2007on.

settles in a disc. We present a 2D analytical model for AGN-driven outflows in
a gaseous disc and demonstrate the main improvements, compared to existing 1D

certain AGN luminosity ($\sim 10^{43}$erg/s in our fiducial model), above which
the outflow remains momentum-driven in the disc up to galactic scales. We
reproduce results of 3D simulations that gas is preferentially ejected
perpendicular to the disc and find that the fraction of ejected interstellar
medium is lower than in 1D models. The recovery time of gas in the disc,
defined as the freefall time from the radius to which the AGN pushes the ISM at
most, is remarkably short, of the order 1Myr. This indicates that AGN-driven

the source; however, on the northwestern side and elsewhere in the source, low
velocity shocks may be causing the observed chaotic magnetic field pattern.
High-spatial-resolution continuum and spectral-line observations also reveal a
tight (~130 AU) protobinary system in SMM1-b, the eastern component of which is
launching an extremely high-velocity, one-sided jet visible in both CO(2-1) and

instabilities of three-dimensional strongly spin-orbit coupled semimetals with
a quadratic band touching point. In these semimetals the electronic structure
at the Fermi energy is described by spin j=3/2 quasiparticles, which are
fundamentally different from those in ordinary metals with spin j=1/2. We
develop a general approach to analyzing pairing instabilities in j=3/2
materials by decomposing the pair scattering interaction into irreducible
channels, projecting them to the Fermi surface and deriving the corresponding
Eliashberg theory. Applying our method to a generic density-density interaction
in YPtBi we establish the following results: (i) The pairing strength in each
channel uniquely encodes the j=3/2 nature of the Fermi surface band
structure--a manifestation of the fundamental difference with ordinary metals.
In particular, this implies that Anderson's theorem, which addresses the effect
of spin-orbit coupling and disorder on pairing states of spin-1/2 electrons,
cannot be applied in this case. (ii) The leading pairing instabilities are
different for electron and hole doping. This implies that superconductivity
depends on carrier type. (iii) In the case of hole doping--relevant to YPtBi,
we find two odd-parity channels in close competition with s-wave pairing. One
of these two channels is a multicomponent pairing channel, allowing for the
possibility of time-reversal symmetry breaking. (iv) In the case of Coulomb
interactions mediated by the long-ranged electric polarization of optical
phonon modes, a significant coupling strength is generated in spite of the
extremely low density of carriers. Furthermore, non-linear response and Fermi
liquid corrections can favor non-s-wave pairing and potentially account for the

through short ($\lesssim 1\,$Myr) accretion episodes that can reach or even
exceed the Eddington rate. In this regime, BH growth is limited by bursty
stellar feedback continuously evacuating gas from galactic nuclei, and BHs
remain under-massive relative to the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$
relation. BH growth is more efficient at later times, when the nuclear stellar
potential retains a significant gas reservoir, star formation becomes less
bursty, and galaxies settle into a more ordered state, with BHs rapidly
converging onto the scaling relation when the host reaches $M_{\rm bulge} \sim
10^{10}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. Our results are not sensitive to the details of the
accretion model so long as BH growth is tied to the gas content within $\sim

derivative which has no effect on the gapless photon, but has two important,
closely related consequences: attaching electric charge to magnetic monopoles
(the Witten effect) and leading to a Chern-Simons theory on the boundary. We
will find that a similar story holds in the higher-spin $U(1)$ gauge theories.
These theories admit generalized $\theta$ terms which have no effect on the
gapless gauge mode, but which bind together electric and magnetic charges (both
of which are generally subdimensional) in specific combinations, in a
higher-spin manifestation of the Witten effect. We derive the corresponding
Witten quantization condition. We find that, as in Maxwell theory, imposing
time-reversal invariance restricts $\theta$ to certain discrete values. We also
find that these new $\theta$ terms imply a non-trivial boundary structure. The
boundaries host fracton excitations coupled to a tensor $U(1)$ gauge field with
a Chern-Simons-like action, in both chiral and non-chiral varieties. These
boundary theories open a door to the study of $U(1)$ fracton phases described
by tensor Chern-Simons theories, not only on boundaries of three-dimensional
systems, but also in strictly two spatial dimensions. We explicitly work
through three examples of bulk and boundary theories, the principles of which
can be readily extended to arbitrary higher-spin theories.

simulations of cosmic reionization previously calibrated to match a wider range
of Ly$\alpha$ forest data to show that the occurrence of seven transmission
spikes in the narrow redshift range z = 5.85 - 6.1 is very sensitive to the
exact timing of reionization. Occurrence of the spikes requires the most under
dense regions of the IGM to be already fully ionised. The rapid onset of a long
trough at z = 6.12 requires a strong decrease of the photo-ionisation rate at
z$\sim$6.1 in this line-of-sight, consistent with the end of percolation at
this redshift. The narrow range of reionisation histories that we previously
found to be consistent with a wider range of Ly$\alpha$ forest data have a
reasonable probability of showing seven spikes and the mock absorption spectra
provide an excellent match to the spikes and the trough in the observed
spectrum of ULAS J1120+0641. Despite the large overall opacity of Ly$\alpha$ at

with high spatial (~0.6"" or 0.15 pc) and spectral (R=11200) resolution. Radial
velocity, velocity dispersion and monochromatic maps were derived. The region
displays a mix of narrow, sigma ~ 20 km/s profiles and multiple broader

kinematics. A comparison with previously obtained VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy
demonstrates that the data agree well in the regions of overlap, but the
Fabry-Perot data are superior in spatial coverage. A preliminary analysis of
the observations finds a new expanding bubble south of R136, with a projected
radius of r=5.6 pc and an expansion velocity of 29 +/- 4 km/s. In addition, the
first-time detailed kinematic maps derived here for several complexes and

ranges of stellar rotation rates. Here we study details of differences in MSTO
morphology expected from spreads in age versus spreads in rotation rates, using
Monte Carlo simulations with the Geneva SYCLIST isochrone models that include
the effects of stellar rotation. We confirm a recent finding of Niederhofer et
al. that a distribution of stellar rotation velocities yields an MSTO extent
that is proportional to the cluster age, as observed. However, we find that
stellar rotation yields MSTO crosscut widths that are generally smaller than
observed ones at a given age. We compare the simulations with high-quality
Hubble Space Telescope data of NGC 1987 and NGC 2249, which are the two only
relatively massive star clusters with an age of ~1 Gyr for which such data is
available. We find that the distribution of stars across the eMSTOs of these
clusters cannot be explained solely by a distribution of stellar rotation
velocities, unless the orientations of rapidly rotating stars are heavily
biased towards an equator-on configuration. Under the assumption of random
viewing angles, stellar rotation can account for ~60% and ~40% of the observed

a subdominant fraction ($\sim 11\%$) of the relic density and its decay gives
the PeV scale neutrino flux observed at IceCube by appropriately choosing the

degeneracy in scalar field parameters $(\gamma, \beta)$ and coupling $\zeta$
value in producing the correct amplitude of CMB power spectrum. However the
value of parameter $\tan(\beta)=1.8$, which is tightly fixed from the
requirement of PeV scale SUSY breaking, removes the degeneracy in the values of

any time window $[t,t')$ and whose route contains $e$, is at most
$\rho(t'-t)+\sigma$, where $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are non-negative parameters.
Informally, $\rho$ bounds the long-term rate of injections and $\sigma$ bounds
the ""burstiness"" of injection: $\sigma=0$ means that the injection is as smooth
as it can be.
  It is known that greedy scheduling of the packets (under which a link is not
idle if there is any packet ready to be sent over it) may result in $\Omega(n)$
buffer size even on an $n$-line network and very smooth injections
($\sigma=0$). In this paper we propose a simple non-greedy scheduling policy
and show that, in a tree where all packets are destined at the root, no buffer
needs to be larger than $\sigma+2\rho$ to ensure that no overflows occur, which

symmetries of Dirac equation with scalar and vector mean-field potentials
originally found independently in the 70's by Smith and Tassie, and Bell and
Ruegg. As relativistic symmetries, they have been extensively researched and
applied to several physical systems for the last 18 years. The main feature of
these symmetries is the suppression of the spin-orbit coupling either in the
upper or lower components of the Dirac spinor, thereby turning the respective
second-order equations into Schr\""odinger-like equations, i.e, without a matrix
structure. In this paper we use the original formalism of Bell and Ruegg to
derive general requirements for the Lorentz structures of potentials in order
to have these SU(2) symmetries in the Dirac equation, again allowing for the
suppression of the matrix structure of the second-order equation of either the
upper or lower components of the Dirac spinor. Furthermore, we derive
equivalent conditions for spin and pseudospin symmetries with 2- and
1-dimensional potentials and list some possible candidates for 3, 2, and 1

variant of the gradient coding problem, in which we settle for approximate
gradient computation instead of the exact one. This approach enables graceful
degradation, i.e., the $\ell_2$ error of the approximate gradient is a
decreasing function of the number of stragglers. Our main result is that
normalized adjacency matrices of expander graphs yield excellent approximate
gradient codes, which enable significantly less computation compared to exact
gradient coding, and guarantee faster convergence than trivial solutions under
standard assumptions. We experimentally test our approach on Amazon EC2, and
show that the generalization error of approximate gradient coding is very close

however, in widespread species complexes with few barriers to dispersal,
multiple contact zones, and limited reproductive isolation, discordance between
phenotypes and phylogeographic groups is more probable. Wagtails (Aves:
Motacilla) are a genus of birds with striking plumage pattern variation across
Eurasia. Up to 13 subspecies are recognized within a single species, yet
previous studies using mitochondrial DNA have supported phylogeographic groups
that are inconsistent with subspecies plumage characteristics. In this study,
we investigate the link between phenotypes and genotype by comparing
populations thought to be at different stages along the speciation continuum.
We take a phylogeographic approach by estimating population structure, testing
for isolation by distance, conducting demographic modeling, and estimating the
first time-calibrated species tree for the genus. Our study provides strong
evidence for species-level patterns of differentiation in wagtails, however
population-level differentiation is less pronounced. We find evidence that
three of four widespread Eurasian species exhibit an east-west divide that
contradicts both subspecies taxonomy and phenotypic variation. Both the
geographic location of this divide and time estimates from demographic models
are overlapping in two sympatric species, indicating that coincident
Pleistocene events shaped their histories.

of the particle representation, it follows the Riesz definition of the
fractional derivative and results in a non-conservative scheme. The other three
methods follow the particle strength exchange (PSE) methodology and are by
construction conservative, in the sense that the total particle strength is
time invariant. The first PSE algorithm is based on using direct
differentiation to estimate the fractional diffusion flux, and exploiting the
resulting estimates in an integral representation of the divergence operator.
Meanwhile, the second one relies on the regularized Riesz representation of the
fractional diffusion term to derive a suitable interaction formula acting
directly on the particle representation of the diffusing field. A third PSE
construction is considered that exploits the Green's function of the fractional
diffusion equation. The performance of all four approaches is assessed for the
case of a one-dimensional diffusion equation with constant diffusivity. This
enables us to take advantage of known analytical solutions, and consequently
conduct a detailed analysis of the performance of the methods. This includes a
quantitative study of the various sources of error, namely filtering,
quadrature, domain truncation, and time integration, as well as a space and
time self-convergence analysis. These analyses are conducted for different

their service period. Just before the server arrives at a station there is some
deterministic glue period. Customers (both new arrivals and retrials) arriving
at the station during this glue period will be served during the visit of the
server. Customers arriving in any other period leave immediately and will retry
after an exponentially distributed time. As this model defies a closed-form
expression for the queue length distributions, our main focus is on their
heavy-traffic asymptotics, both at embedded time points (beginnings of glue
periods, visit periods and switch periods) and at arbitrary time points. We
obtain closed-form expressions for the limiting scaled joint queue length
distribution in heavy traffic and use these to accurately approximate the mean
number of customers in the system under different loads.

known as a foundation for reasoning when knowledge is expressed at various

since its foundation, many questions remain open. One of the most important
open questions seems to be the relationship between frequencies and the
Mathematical Theory of Evidence. The theory is blamed to leave frequencies
outside (or aside of) its framework. The seriousness of this accusation is
obvious: (1) no experiment may be run to compare the performance of DST-based
models of real world processes against real world data, (2) data may not serve
as foundation for construction of an appropriate belief model.
  In this paper we develop a frequentist interpretation of the DST bringing to
fall the above argument against DST. An immediate consequence of it is the
possibility to develop algorithms acquiring automatically DST belief models
from data. We propose three such algorithms for various classes of belief model
structures: for tree structured belief networks, for poly-tree belief networks
and for general type belief networks.

in a cosmological model based in the scalar-tensor theory with non-minimal

the physical bounds on the squared sound speed. The numeric results are
geometrically illustrated by means of a qualitative procedure of analysis that
is based on the mapping of the orbits in the phase plane onto the surfaces that
represent physical quantities in the extended phase space, that is: the phase
plane complemented with an additional dimension relative to the given physical
parameter. We find that the cosmological model based in the non-minimal
derivative coupling theory -- this includes both the quintessence and the pure
derivative coupling cases -- has serious causality problems related with
superluminal propagation of the scalar and tensor perturbations. Even more
disturbing is the finding that, despite that the underlying theory is free of
the Ostrogradsky instability, the corresponding cosmological model is plagued
by the Laplacian (classical) instability related with negative squared sound
speed. This instability leads to an uncontrollable growth of the energy density
of the perturbations that is inversely proportional to their wavelength. We
show that independent of the self-interaction potential, for the positive
coupling the tensor perturbations propagate superluminally, while for the
negative coupling a Laplacian instability arises. This latter instability
invalidates the possibility for the model to describe the primordial inflation.

nano-optical light-trapping concepts enable the use of ultra-thin absorber
architectures. In both cases, the local density of electronic and optical
states deviates strongly from that in a homogeneous bulk material. At the same
time, non-local and coherent phenomena like tunneling or ballistic transport
become increasingly relevant. As a consequence, the semi-classical, diffusive
bulk picture conventionally assumed may no longer be appropriate to describe
the physical processes of generation, transport, and recombination governing
the photovoltaic operation of such devices. In this review, we provide a
quantum-kinetic perspective on photovoltaic device operation that reaches
beyond the limits of the standard simulation models for bulk solar cells.
Deviations from bulk physics are assessed in ultra-thin film and
nanostructure-based solar cell architectures by comparing the predictions of
the semi-classical models for key physical quantities such as absorption
coefficients, emission spectra, generation and recombination rates as well as
potentials, densities and currents with the corresponding properties as given

is governed by $(N-1)(N-2)/2$ independent triad phases (each involving only
three particles). The deterministic distinguishability, preventing quantum
interference with two or three particles, allows for the genuine $(N\ge

deterministically distinguishable from all others except two by their internal
states allows for a novel (circle-dance) interference of $N\ge 4$ particles
governed by a collective $N$-particle phase, while simultaneously preventing
the $R$-particle interference for $3\le R\le N-1$. The genuine $N$-particle
interference manifests the $N$th order quantum correlations between identical
particles at a multiport output, it does not appear in the marginal probability
for a subset of the particles, e.g., it cannot be detected if at least one of

on two different versions of this elementary structure, that a wide range of
tunnel rates is attainable while maintaining single-electron occupation. A
characteristic change in slope of the charge transitions as a function of the
reservoir gate voltage, attributed to screening from charges in the reservoir,
is observed in all devices, and is expected to play a role in the sizable
tuning orthogonality of the split enhancement gate structure. The all-silicon
process is expected to minimize strain gradients from electrode thermal
mismatch, while the single gate layer should avoid issues related to overlayers
(e.g., additional dielectric charge noise) and help improve yield. Finally,
reservoir gate control of the tunnel barrier has implications for
initialization, manipulation and readout schemes in multi-quantum dot

in $\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation models by assuming that the fraction of
baryons that turns into stars drops steeply with decreasing halo mass and
essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm
max}<20$-$30$ km/s. Dark matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have
characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are small enough to
probe only the rising part of the halo circular velocity curve (i.e., half-mass
radii, $r_{1/2}\ll 1$ kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement with
this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo $V_{\rm max}$ but
their characteristic velocities are well below $20$ km/s. These `cold faint
giants' (an extreme example is the recently discovered Crater 2 Milky Way
satellite) can only be reconciled with our $\Lambda$CDM models if they are the
remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We
examine this possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations of the Local Group. Assuming that low velocity dispersion
satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor masses,
radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with
those of isolated dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in
the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides
remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies, lowering their
accelerations below the $a_{\rm min}\sim 10^{-11} m/s^2$ minimum expected for
isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are
inconsistent with the predictions from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result
that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that scenario.

truncating them to a fixed length, perhaps due to long-standing use of this
technique with IPv4 and a belief that it's ""good enough."" We claim that simple
anonymization by truncation is suspect since it does not entail privacy
guarantees nor does it take into account some common address assignment
practices observed today. To investigate, with standard activity logs as input,
we develop a counting method to determine a lower bound on the number of active
IPv6 addresses that are simultaneously assigned, such as those of clients that
access World-Wide Web services. In many instances, we find that these empirical
measurements offer no evidence that truncating IPv6 addresses to a fixed number
of bits, e.g., 48 in common practice, protects individuals' privacy.
  To remedy this problem, we propose kIP anonymization, an aggregation method
that ensures a certain level of address privacy. Our method adaptively
determines variable truncation lengths using parameter k, the desired number of
active (rather than merely potential) addresses, e.g., 32 or 256, that can not
be distinguished from each other once anonymized. We describe our
implementation and present first results of its application to millions of real
IPv6 client addresses active over a week's time, demonstrating both feasibility
at large scale and ability to automatically adapt to each network's address
assignment practice and synthesize a set of anonymous aggregates (prefixes),
each of which is guaranteed to cover (contain) at least k of the active
addresses. Each address is anonymized by truncating it to the length of its

system, with exoplanets being in close orbits around their host stars and

the star and the exoplanet for such systems that are similar to the tidal
interactions observed in close stellar binary systems. For the exoplanet, tidal
interaction can lead to circularization of its orbit and the synchronization of
its rotational and orbital period. For the host star, it has long been
speculated if significant angular momentum transfer can take place between the
planetary orbit and the stellar rotation. In the case of the Earth-Moon system,
such tidal interaction has led to an increasing distance between Earth and
Moon. For stars with Hot Jupiters, where the orbital period of the exoplanet is
typically shorter than the stellar rotation period, one expects a decreasing
semimajor axis for the planet and enhanced stellar rotation, leading to
increased stellar activity. Also excess turbulence in the stellar convective
zone due to rising and subsiding tidal bulges may change the magnetic activity

Due to the non-zero size of the obstacles, the blocking is typically correlated
across both anchor and target locations, with the extent of correlation
increasing with obstacle size. If a target does not have line-of-sight to a
minimum number of anchors, then its position cannot be estimated unambiguously
and is, therefore, said to be in a blind-spot. However, the analysis of the
blind-spot probability of a given target is challenging due to the inherent
randomness in the obstacle locations and sizes. In this letter, we develop a
new framework to analyze the worst-case impact of correlated blocking on the
blind-spot probability of a typical target; in particular, we model the
obstacles by a Poisson line process and the anchor locations by a Poisson point
process. For this setup, we define the notion of the asymptotic blind-spot
probability of the typical target and derive a closed-form expression for it as
a function of the area distribution of a typical Poisson-Voronoi cell. As an
upper bound for the more realistic case when obstacles have finite dimensions,
the asymptotic blind-spot probability is useful as a design tool to ensure that
the blind-spot probability of a typical target does not exceed a desired
threshold, $\epsilon$.

this work, we present Chandra/ACIS observations and near-infrared spectra with
the Large Binocular Telescope of six advanced mergers with projected pair

hosting dual AGNs with projected separations less than ~10 kpc, despite showing

demonstrate that 1) optical studies miss a significant fraction of single and

effective in identifying dual AGN candidates in late-stage mergers. Our
multi-wavelength observations suggest that the buried AGNs in these mergers are

elimination of fast variables that the slow coordinates effectively experience
a thermal bath of spatially-varying temperature. In this work, we investigate
how such a temperature landscape arises according to how the slow variables
affect the character of the driven quasi-steady-state reached by the fast

known to lead to the accumulation of probability density in low temperature

deriving the temperature landscape for a general class of overdamped systems

system how the attraction to low effective temperature has a fine-tuning effect

low force fluctuation in the fast-variable steady-state. We furthermore
demonstrate that a particularly strong effect of this kind can take place when
the slow variable is tuned to bring about orderly, integrable motion in the
fast dynamics that avoids thermalizing energy absorbed from the drive. We thus
point to a potentially general feedback mechanism in multi-time-scale active
systems, that leads to the exploration of slow variable space, as if in search

geometries are typically harder to solve than their steady counterparts.
Approximation techniques are often the only resort. Felderhof (see e.g. 2005,
2009b) has developed a point-particle approximation framework to solve such
problems, especially in the context of Brownian motion. Despite excellent
agreement with past experiments, this framework has an inconsistency which we
address in this work. Upon implementing our modifications, the framework passes
consistency checks that it previously failed. Further, it is not obvious that
such an approximation should work for short time-scale motion. We investigate
its validity by deriving it from a general formalism based on integral
equations through a series of systematic approximations. We also compare
results from the point-particle framework against a calculation performed using
the method of reflections, for the specific case of a sphere near a full-slip
plane boundary. We find from our analysis that the reasons for the success of
the point-particle approximation are subtle and have to do with the nature of
the unsteady Oseen tensor. Finally, we provide numerical predictions for
Brownian motion near a full-slip and a no-slip plane wall based on the
point-particle approximation as used by Felderhof, our modified point-particle
approximation, and the method of reflections. We show that our modifications to
Felderhof's framework would become significant for systems of metallic

reflection group $W$, the closed positive root cone is tiled by the images of
the open weight cone under the action of the linear transformations $id-w$.
Shortly thereafter E. Meinrencken extended the result to affine Weyl groups.
P.V. Bibikov and V.S. Zhgoon then gave a uniform proof for a discrete
reflection group acting on a simply-connected space of constant curvature.
  In this paper we show that the Waldspurger and Meinrenken theorems of type A
give a new perspective on the combinatorics of the symmetric group. In
particular, for each permutation matrix $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ we define a
non-negative integer matrix $\mathbf{WT}(w)$, called the Waldspurger transform
of $w$. The definition of the matrix $\mathbf{WT}(w)$ is purely combinatorial
but its columns are the images of the fundamental weights under the action of
$id-w$, expressed in simple root coordinates. The possible columns of
$\mathbf{WT}(w)$ (which we call UM vectors) are in bijection with many
interesting structures including: unimodal Motzkin paths, abelian ideals in
nilradical of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$, Young diagrams
with maximum hook length $n$, and integer points inside a certain polytope.
  We show that the sum of the entries of $\mathbf{WT}(w)$ is equal to half the
entropy of the corresponding permutation $w$, which is known to equal the rank
of $w$ in the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of the Bruhat order. Inspired by
this, we extend the Waldpurger transform $\mathbf{WT}(M)$ to alternating sign
matrices $M$ and give an intrinsic characterization of the image. This provides
a geometric realization of Dedekind-MacNeille completion of the Bruhat order
(a.k.a. the lattice of alternating sign matrices).

magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) plasmas is of crucial importance for the safe
operation of ITER. In order to develop these strategies, an accurate diagnostic
capability that allows good estimates of the RE distribution function in these
plasmas is needed. Synchrotron radiation (SR) of RE in MCF, besides of being
one of the main damping mechanisms for RE in the high energy relativistic
regime, is routinely used in current MCF experiments to infer the parameters of
RE energy and pitch angle distribution functions. In the present paper we
address the long standing question about what are the relationships between
different RE distribution functions and their corresponding synchrotron
emission simultaneously including: full-orbit effects, information of the
spectral and angular distribution of SR of each electron, and basic geometric
optics of a camera. We study the spatial distribution of the SR on the poloidal
plane, and the statistical properties of the expected value of the synchrotron
spectra of runaway electrons. We observe a strong dependence of the synchrotron
emission measured by the camera on the pitch angle distribution of RE, namely
we find that crescent shapes of the spatial distribution of the SR as measured
by the camera relate to RE distributions with small pitch angles, while ellipse
shapes relate to distributions of runaways with larger the pitch angles. A weak
dependence of the synchrotron emission measured by the camera with the RE
energy, value of the q-profile at the edge, and the chosen range of wavelengths
is observed. Furthermore, we find that oversimplifying the angular dependence
of the SR changes the shape of the synchrotron spectra, and overestimates its
amplitude by approximately 20 times for avalanching RE and by approximately 60
times for mono-energetic distributions of runaways.

automatic repeat request (HARQ) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
scheme for large-scale device-to-device (D2D) networks. Specifically,
interference aware rate selection and power allocation are considered to
maximize long term average throughput (LTAT) and area spectral efficiency
(ASE). The design framework is based on stochastic geometry that jointly
accounts for the spatial interference correlation at the NOMA receivers as well
as the temporal interference correlation across HARQ transmissions. It is found
that ignoring the effect of the aggregate interference, or overlooking the
spatial and temporal correlation in interference, highly overestimates the NOMA
performance and produces misleading design insights. An interference oblivious
selection for the power and/or transmission rates leads to violating the
network outage constraints. To this end, the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of NOMA transmission and manifest the importance of the
cooperative HARQ to combat the negative effect of the network aggregate
interference. For instance, comparing to the non-cooperative HARQ assisted
NOMA, the proposed scheme can yield an outage probability reduction by $32$%.
Furthermore, an interference aware optimal design that maximizes the LTAT given
outage constraints leads to $47$% throughput improvement over HARQ-assisted
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.

abundant patterns on objects, or object curves to follow particular models, the

structured representations which make explicit 3D curves, surfaces, and their
spatial relationships. Reconstructing surface representations can now be
constrained by the 3D drawing acting like a scaffold to hang on the computed
representations, leading to increased robustness and quality of reconstruction.
This paper presents one way of completing such 3D drawings with surface
reconstructions, by exploring occlusion reasoning through lofting algorithms.

interacting particle system with diffusion, pair annihilation, and creation by
pairs, has defied a consensus about the universality class that it belongs to.
An argument by Hinrichsen [H. Hinrichsen, Physica A {\bf 361}, 457 (2006)]
claims that freely diffusing particles in the PCPD should play the same role as
frozen particles, when it comes to the critical behavior. Therefore, the PCPD
is claimed to have the same critical phenomena as a model with infinitely many
absorbing states that belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality
class. To investigate if diffusing particles are really indistinguishable from
frozen particles in the sense of the renormalization group, we numerically
study a variation of the PCPD by introducing a nonorder field associated with
infinitely many absorbing states. We find that a crossover from the PCPD to the
DP occurs due to the nonorder field. Since, by studying a similar model, we
exclude the possibility that mere introduction of a nonorder field to one model
can entail a nontrivial crossover to another model in the same universality
class, we attribute the observed crossover to the difference of the
universality class of the PCPD from the DP class.

Properties of parity-time-symmetric complex potentials have been heavily
studied before. In this article, new classes of non-parity-time-symmetric
complex potentials featuring conjugate-pair eigenvalue symmetry in its spectrum
are constructed by operator symmetry methods. Due to this eigenvalue symmetry,
it is shown that the spectrum of these complex potentials is often all-real.
Under parameter tuning in these potentials, phase transition can also occur,
where pairs of complex eigenvalues appear in the spectrum. A peculiar feature
of the phase transition here is that, the complex eigenvalues may bifurcate out
from an interior continuous eigenvalue inside the continuous spectrum, in which
case a phase transition takes place without going through an exceptional point.
In one spatial dimension, this class of non-parity-time-symmetric complex
potentials is of the form $V(x)=h'(x)-h^2(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary
parity-time-symmetric complex function. These potentials in two spatial
dimensions are also derived. Diffraction patterns in these complex potentials
are further examined, and unidirectional propagation behaviors are
demonstrated.

construct codes with larger sizes as compared to the previous constructions. We
determine the sizes of optimal tandem-duplication codes for lengths up to
twenty, develop recursive methods to construct tandem-duplication codes for all

shape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important
role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these
insights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource model (MCRM) or
its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small
ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights
derived from small ecosystems many not scale up large ecosystems with many
resources and species because large systems with many interacting components
often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from
analyzing smaller systems. To address this shortcoming, we develop a
sophisticated statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when
both the number of species and the number of resources is large. We find that
in this limit, species generically and consistently perturb their environments
and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity
approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting
for the effect of this emergent environmental engineering on species invasion
and ecological stability. Our work suggests that environmental engineering is a
generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account
when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the
important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in
furthering our understanding of ecology.

biological hypothesis proposes that human reproductive cycles are an adaptation
to the seasonal cycles caused by hemisphere positioning, while the cultural
hypothesis proposes that conception dates vary mostly due to cultural factors,
such as vacation schedule or religious holidays. However, for many countries,
common records used to investigate these hypotheses are incomplete or

the Northern Hemisphere. Here we show that interest in sex peaks sharply online

documented human birth cycles, even after adjusting for numerous factors such
as language, season, and amount of free time due to holidays. We further show
that mood, measured independently on Twitter, contains distinct collective
emotions associated with those cultural celebrations, and these collective
moods correlate with sex search volume outside of these holidays as well. Our
results provide converging evidence that the cyclic sexual and reproductive

demonstrate the flexibility of the PMP framework, we separate tuna and
swordfish production technologies into three policy relevant fishing targets.
We find the model most accurately predicts vessel-specific annual bigeye catch

0.53. To demonstrate the model's usefulness to policy makers, we simulate the
economic impact to individual vessels from increasing and decreasing the bigeye
catch limit in the WCPO by 10%. Our results suggest that such policy changes
will have moderate impacts on most vessels, but large impacts on a few
generating a fat tailed distribution. These results offer insights into the
range of winners and losers resulting from changes in fishery policies, and
therefore, which policies are more likely to gain widespread industry support.
As a tool for fishery management, the calibrated PMP model offers a flexible

fishing vessels to evaluate policy changes.

minimizing dissipated heat. However, determining whether or not a particular
sensor is evolved or designed to be accurate and efficient is difficult. This
arises partly from the functional constraints being at cross purposes and
partly since quantifying the predictive performance of even in silico sensors
can require prohibitively long simulations. To circumvent these difficulties,
we develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of
the broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden
semi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs. Predictive metrics include the
instantaneous memory and the mutual information between present sensor state
and input future, while dissipative metrics include power consumption and the
nonpredictive information rate. Success in deriving these formulae relies
heavily on identifying the environment's causal states, the input's minimal
sufficient statistics for prediction. Using these formulae, we study the
simplest nontrivial biological sensor model---that of a Hill molecule,
characterized by the number of ligands that bind simultaneously, the sensor's
cooperativity. When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable
information, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget
generally depends on the environment's past hysteretically. In this way, the
sensor gains robustness to environmental fluctuations. Given the simplicity of
the Hill molecule, such hysteresis will likely be found in more complex
predictive sensors as well. That is, adaptations that only locally optimize
biochemical parameters for prediction and dissipation can lead to sensors that
""remember"" the past environment.

is incomplete. For example, the parameters of the standard model of particle
physics are ""unnaturally"" small (in various technical senses), which has driven
much of the search for physics beyond the standard model. Of particular
interest is the fine-tuning of the universe for life, which suggests that our
universe's ability to create physical life forms is improbable and in need of
explanation, perhaps by a multiverse. This claim has been challenged on the
grounds that the relevant probability measure cannot be justified because it
cannot be normalized, and so small probabilities cannot be inferred. We show
how fine-tuning can be formulated within the context of Bayesian theory testing
(or \emph{model selection}) in the physical sciences. The normalizability
problem is seen to be a general problem for testing any theory with free
parameters, and not a unique problem for fine-tuning. Physical theories in fact
avoid such problems in one of two ways. Dimensional parameters are bounded by
the Planck scale, avoiding troublesome infinities, and we are not compelled to
assume that dimensionless parameters are distributed uniformly, which avoids
non-normalizability.

in Floquet topological phases with intriguing properties such as very large
Chern numbers and unusual edge states. Whether such Floquet topological phases
could generate robust edge state conductance much larger than their static
counterparts is an interesting question. In this paper, working under the
Keldysh formalism, we study two-lead transport via the edge states of
irradiated quantum Hall insulators using the method of recursive
Floquet-Green's functions. Focusing on a harmonically-driven Hofstadter model,
we show that quantized Hall conductance as large as $8e^2/h$ can be realized,
but only after applying the so-called Floquet sum rule. To assess the
robustness of edge state transport, we analyze the DC conductance,
time-averaged current profile and local density of states. It is found that
co-propagating chiral edge modes are more robust against disorder and defects
as compared with the remarkable counter-propagating edge modes, as well as
certain symmetry-restricted Floquet edge modes. Furthermore, we go beyond the
wide-band limit, which is often assumed for the leads, to study how the
conductance quantization (after applying the Floquet sum rule) of Floquet edge
states can be affected if the leads have finite bandwidths. These results may
be useful for the design of transport devices based on Floquet topological
matter.

presents a blueshift toward temperature increase, interestingly, we also
observe an unusual optical band edge at 1.48 eV in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single

redshift toward the enhancement in temperature, in agreement with the Varshni
relation. More interestingly, the unusual band edge exhibits a series of
obvious absorption and photocurrent signals, but the according
photoluminescence signals are not observable. This indicates that this band
edge is particularly beneficial for the photovoltaic effect due to the
inhibited radiative recombination. The kinetics on photo-involved charge
transition and transfer are investigated using the pump-probe photoconductivity
technique, and a changeable band structure model was proposed.

lattice rules are constructed in two steps: i) construction of classical
polynomial lattice rules over $\mathbb{F}_b$ with $\alpha$ consecutive sizes of
nodes, $b^{m-\alpha+1},\ldots,b^{m}$, and ii) recursive application of
Richardson extrapolation to a chain of $\alpha$ approximate values of the

  We prove the existence of good extrapolated polynomial lattice rules

Sobolev spaces with general weights. Then, by restricting to product weights,
we show that such good extrapolated polynomial lattice rules can be constructed
by the fast component-by-component algorithm under a computable quality
criterion. The required total construction cost is of order $(s+\alpha)N\log
N$, which improves the currently known result for interlaced polynomial lattice
rule, that is of order $s\alpha N\log N$. We also study the dependence of the
worst-case error bound on the dimension.
  A big advantage of our method compared to interlaced polynomial lattice rules
is that the fast QMC matrix vector method can be used in this setting, while
still achieving the same rate of convergence. Such a method was previously not
known.

this end, we regard the evolving landmark data as a high-dimensional path and
apply non-linear path signature techniques to provide an expressive, robust,
non-linear, and interpretable representation for the sequential events. We do
not extract signature features from the raw path, rather we propose path
disintegrations and path transformations as preprocessing steps. Path
disintegrations turn a high-dimensional path linearly into a collection of
lower-dimensional paths; some of these paths are in pose space while others are
defined over a multiscale collection of temporal intervals. Path
transformations decorate the paths with additional coordinates in standard ways
to allow the truncated signatures of transformed paths to expose additional
features. For spatial representation, we apply the signature transform to
vectorize the paths that arise out of pose disintegration, and for temporal
representation, we apply it again to describe this evolving vectorization.
Finally, all the features are collected together to constitute the input vector
of a linear single-hidden-layer fully-connected network for classification.
Experimental results on four datasets demonstrated that the proposed feature
set with only a linear shallow network and Dropconnect is effective and
achieves comparable state-of-the-art results to the advanced deep networks, and

Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras for which applying any power of the Serre functor
on any indecomposable projective module, the result remains a stalk complex.
Typical examples are given by (higher) hereditary algebras and self-injective
algebras; it turns out that other interesting algebras such as (higher)
canonical algebras are also Serre-formal.
  Starting from a Serre-formal algebra, we consider a series of algebras -
called the replicated algebras - given by certain subquotients of its
repetitive algebra. We calculate the self-injective dimension and dominant
dimension of all such replicated algebras and determine which of them are
minimal Auslander-Gorenstein, i.e. when the two dimensions are finite and equal
to each other. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many minimal
Auslander-Gorenstien algebras in such a series if, and only if, the
Serre-formal algebra is twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau.
  We apply these results to a construction of algebras from Yamagata, called
SGC extensions, given by iteratively taking the endomorphism ring of the
smallest generator-cogenerator. We give a sufficient condition so that the SGC
extensions and replicated algebras coincide. Consequently, in such a case, we

image-driven model-based description of ventricular motion. In this approach,
the end-diastolic geometry and time-dependent deformation of the left ventricle
cavity are obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance images and a fictitious
elastic structure is used to impose the contractile behavior of the left
ventricle. This allows seamless treatment of the isovolumic phases. Besides the
ventricular motion, the intracavitary fluid dynamics is controlled by the
mitral valve. Three different mitral valve models are included in the
simulation: an idealized diode (with or without regurgitation) and a lumped
parameter model accounting for the opening dynamics of the valve and including
regurgitation.

imaging by Kerr rotation microscopy. The observed out-of-plane magnetization is
independent of in-plane magnetic field, linearly proportional to the in-plane
current density, and optimized when the current is orthogonal to the

theoretical model of valley magnetoelectricity driven by Berry curvature

galaxies with directly measured supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, $M_{\rm
BH}$, to determine each galaxy's logarithmic spiral arm pitch angle, $\phi$.
For predicting black hole masses, we have derived the relation: $\log({M_{\rm
BH}/{\rm M_{\odot}}}) = (7.01\pm0.07) - (0.171\pm0.017)[|\phi|-15\deg]$. The
total root mean square scatter associated with this relation is 0.43 dex in the
$\log{M_{\rm BH}}$ direction, with an intrinsic scatter of $0.33\pm0.08$ dex.
The $M_{\rm BH}$-$\phi$ relation is therefore at least as accurate at
predicting SMBH masses in spiral galaxies as the other known relations. By
definition, the existence of an $M_{\rm BH}$-$\phi$ relation demands that the
SMBH mass must correlate with the galaxy discs in some manner. Moreover, with
the majority of our sample (37 of 44) classified in the literature as having a
pseudobulge morphology, we additionally reveal that the SMBH mass correlates
with the large-scale spiral pattern and thus the discs of galaxies hosting
pseudobulges. Furthermore, given that the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\phi$ relation is
capable of estimating black hole masses in bulge-less spiral galaxies, it
therefore has great promise for predicting which galaxies may harbour
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{\rm BH}<10^5$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$).
Extrapolating from the current relation, we predict that galaxies with $|\phi|
\geq 26.7\deg$ should possess IMBHs.

that are distinguished from the normal $\delta$ Scuti stars (NDSTs). On the H-R
diagram and the $\log g-T$ diagram, the UCVs are far beyond the red edge of
pulsational instability trip. Their effective temperatures are lower than
6700\,K with periods in the range from 0.09 to 0.22\,days. NDSTs have
metallicity close to that of the Sun as expected, while UCVs are slightly metal
poor than NDSTs. The two peaks on the distributions of the period and stellar
atmospheric parameters are all caused by the existence of UCVs. When those UCVs
are excluded, it is discovered that the effective temperature, the
gravitational acceleration and the metallicity all are correlated with the
pulsating period for NDSTs and their physical properties and evolutionary
states are discussed. The detecting of those UCVs indicates that about 25\% of
the known $\delta$ Scuti stars may be misclassified. However, if some of them
are confirmed to be pulsating stars, they will be a new-type pulsator and their
investigations will shed light on theoretical instability domains and on the
theories of interacting between the pulsation and the convection of solar-type

precisely our construction converts certain graphs in Euclidean $(n+1)$-space
to CMC $n$-hypersurfaces with asymptotically Delaunay ends in two steps: First
appropriate small perturbations of the given graph have their vertices replaced
by round spherical regions and their edges and rays by Delaunay pieces so that
a family of initial smooth hypersurfaces is constructed. One of the initial
hypersurfaces is then perturbed to produce the desired CMC $n$-hypersurface
which depends on the given family of perturbations of the graph and a small in
absolute value parameter $\underline\tau$. This construction is very general
because of the abundance of graphs which satisfy the required conditions and
because it does not rely on symmetry requirements. For any given $k\ge2$ and
$n\ge3$ it allows us to realize infinitely many topological types as CMC
$n$-hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with $k$ ends. Moreover for each case
there is a plethora of examples reflecting the abundance of the available
graphs. This is in sharp contrast with the known examples which in the best of

symmetry of superconductivity in $\text{KFe}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$ in a simple but
comprehensive way. By modeling the material with a strong coupling
$t-J_{1}-J_{2}$ model, we find phase transitions of pairing symmetry driven by
the competition between the local spin antiferromagnetic couplings from nodal
$d_{x^2-y^2}\times s_{x^2+y^2}$-wave to nodeless $% s_{x^2 y^2} $-wave through
the intermediate $s+id\times s$ mixed pairing phase, which is consistent with
the observation of pressure experiments. The emergent $d$-wave form factor
inevitably arises from the projection of inter-orbital Cooper pairing onto the
Fermi surface and is inherited from the electronic structure in the
representation of $C_{4}^{p}$ symmetry. Moreover, the $S_{4}$ symmetry dictates
2 copies of $d$-wave pairing condensates, counting 8 nodes in total. We further
show that weakly breaking $C_{4}^{p}$ naturally leads to the octet nodal gap as
precisely observed in laser angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The
octet nodes reflect the collaboration of the $C_{4}^{p}$ and $S_{4}$

specify design spaces for program components, and the onerous task of

automated analysis tools and optimization heuristics. However, in current
approaches to Programming by Optimization, design space specification and
exploration relies on external configuration algorithms, executable wrappers

  Here we show that the architectural pattern of Dependency Injection provides
a superior alternative to the traditional Programming by Optimization pipeline.
We demonstrate that configuration tools based on Dependency Injection fit
naturally into the software development process, while requiring less overhead
than current wrapper-based mechanisms. Furthermore, the structural
correspondence between Dependency Injection and context-free grammars yields a
new class of evolutionary metaheuristics for automated algorithm configuration.
We found that the new heuristics significantly outperform existing

yet economical infrastructure to host online services such as multimedia
streaming, email and bulk storage. Many such services perform geo-replication
to provide necessary quality of service and reliability to users resulting in
frequent large inter- datacenter transfers. In order to meet tenant service
level agreements (SLAs), these transfers have to be completed prior to a
deadline. In addition, WAN resources are quite scarce and costly, meaning they
should be fully utilized. Several recently proposed schemes, such as B4,
TEMPUS, and SWAN have focused on improving the utilization of inter-datacenter
transfers through centralized scheduling, however, they fail to provide a
mechanism to guarantee that admitted requests meet their deadlines. Also, in a
recent study, authors propose Amoeba, a system that allows tenants to define
deadlines and guarantees that the specified deadlines are met, however, to
admit new traffic, the proposed system has to modify the allocation of already
admitted transfers. In this paper, we propose Rapid Close to Deadline
Scheduling (RCD), a close to deadline traffic allocation technique that is fast
and efficient. Through simulations, we show that RCD is up to 15 times faster
than Amoeba, provides high link utilization along with deadline guarantees, and
is able to make quick decisions on whether a new request can be fully satisfied
before its deadline.

($L_R$), X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) and BH mass ($\mbh$), the so-called
`fundamental plane' (FP) of BH activity. Yet the supporting data are very
limited in the $\mbh$ regime between stellar mass (i.e., BHXBs) and
10$^{6.5}$\,\msun\ (namely, the lower bound of supermassive BHs in common
AGNs). In this work, we developed a new method to measure the 1.4 GHz flux
directly from the images of the VLA FIRST survey, and apply it to the type-1
low-mass AGNs in the \cite{2012ApJ...755..167D} sample. As a result, we
obtained 19 new low-mass AGNs for FP research with both \mbh\ estimates ($\mbh
\approx 10^{5.5-6.5}$\,\msun), reliable X-ray measurements, and (candidate)
radio detections, tripling the number of such candidate sources in the
literature.Most (if not all) of the low-mass AGNs follow the standard
radio/X-ray correlation and the universal FP relation fitted with the combined
dataset of BHXBs and supermassive AGNs by \citet{2009ApJ...706..404G}; the
consistency in the radio/X-ray correlation slope among those accretion systems
supports the picture that the accretion and ejection (jet) processes are quite
similar in all accretion systems of different \mbh. In view of the FP relation,
we speculate that the radio loudness $\mathcal{R}$ (i.e., the luminosity ratio
of the jet to the accretion disk) of AGNs depends not only on Eddington ratio,
but probably also on \mbh.

several authors have proposed methods for adapting the activation functions

approaches, however, have gained wide acceptance in practice, and research in
this topic remains open. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of flexible

multiple variations for designing and initializing these kernel activation
functions (KAFs), including a multidimensional scheme allowing to nonlinearly
combine information from different paths in the network. The resulting KAFs can
approximate any mapping defined over a subset of the real line, either convex
or nonconvex. Furthermore, they are smooth over their entire domain, linear in
their parameters, and they can be regularized using any known scheme, including
the use of $\ell_1$ penalties to enforce sparseness. To the best of our
knowledge, no other known model satisfies all these properties simultaneously.
In addition, we provide a relatively complete overview on alternative
techniques for adapting the activation functions, which is currently lacking in
the literature. A large set of experiments validates our proposal.

excess over the photosphere by comparing the observed flux ratio at 22 $\mu$m
and 12 $\mu$m ($f_{22}/f_{12}$) with the corresponding synthetic value, derived
from results of classical model photospheres. We found a detection rate of
0.85$\%$ at 22 $\mu$m (2 excesses) in the sample of stars with planets and
0.1$\%$ (1 detection) for the stars without planets. The difference of the
detection rate between the two samples is not statistically significant, a
result that is independent of the different approaches found in the literature
to define an excess in the wavelength range covered by ${\it WISE}$

  Landmark Search",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile landmark search (MLS) recently receives increasing attention for its
great practical values. However, it still remains unsolved due to two important
challenges. One is high bandwidth consumption of query transmission, and the
other is the huge visual variations of query images sent from mobile devices.
In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, named as canonical view based
discrete multi-modal hashing (CV-DMH), to handle these problems via a novel
three-stage learning procedure. First, a submodular function is designed to
measure visual representativeness and redundancy of a view set. With it,
canonical views, which capture key visual appearances of landmark with limited
redundancy, are efficiently discovered with an iterative mining strategy.
Second, multi-modal sparse coding is applied to transform visual features from
multiple modalities into an intermediate representation. It can robustly and
adaptively characterize visual contents of varied landmark images with certain
canonical views. Finally, compact binary codes are learned on intermediate
representation within a tailored discrete binary embedding model which
preserves visual relations of images measured with canonical views and removes
the involved noises. In this part, we develop a new augmented Lagrangian
multiplier (ALM) based optimization method to directly solve the discrete
binary codes. We can not only explicitly deal with the discrete constraint, but
also consider the bit-uncorrelated constraint and balance constraint together.
Experiments on real world landmark datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of CV-DMH over several state-of-the-art methods.

spin-momentum locking (SML) which can be used for both time-dependent and
steady-state transport analysis on a wide variety of materials with spin-orbit
coupling such as topological insulators, heavy metals, oxide interfaces, and
narrow bandgap semiconductors. This model is based on a time-dependent
four-component diffusion equation obtained from the Boltzmann transport
equation assuming linear response and elastic scattering in the channel. We
classify all electronic states in the channel into four groups ($U^+$, $D^+$,
$U^-$, and $D^-$) depending on the spin index (up ($U$), down ($D$)) and the
sign of the $x$-component of the group velocity ($+,-$) and assign an average
electrochemical potential to each of the four groups to obtain the
four-component diffusion equation. For normal metal channels, the model
decouples into the well-known transmission line model for charge and a
time-dependent version of Valet-Fert equation for spin. We first show that in
the steady-state limit our model leads to simple expressions for charge-spin
interconversion in SML channels in good agreement with existing experimental
data on diverse materials. We then use the full time-dependent model to study
spin-charge separation in the presence of SML, a subject that has been
controversial in the past. Our model shows that the charge and spin signals
travel with two distinct velocities resulting in well-known spin-charge
separation which is expected to persist even in the presence of SML. However,
our model predicts that the lower velocity signal is purely spin while the
higher velocity signal is largely charge with an additional spin component
which has not been noted before. Finally, we note that our model can be used
within standard circuit simulators like SPICE to obtain numerical results for
complex geometries.

an unusual square-planar coordination. The latter is key to rationalize the
electronic structure and magnetic property of Na4IrO4, which is here explored
by first-principles density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Due
to the uncommon square-planar crystal field, Ir 5d states adopt
intermediate-spin state with double occupation of dz2 orbital, leading to a
sizable local spin moment, at variance with many other iridates. The
square-planar crystal field splitting is also crucial in opening a robust
insulating gap in Na4IrO4, irrespective of the specific magnetic ordering or
treatment of electronic correlations. Spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role in
shaping the electronic structure, but leads to a strong magnetocrystalline
anisotropy. The easy axis perpendicular to the IrO4 plaquette, well explained
using perturbation theory, is again closely related to the square-planar
coordination. Finally, the large single-ion anisotropy suppresses the spin
frustration and stabilizes a collinear antiferromagnetic long-range magnetic
ordering, as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations predicting a quite low N\'eel
temperature, expected from almost isolated IrO4 square-planar units as
crystalline building blocks.

pseudofractal scale-free [S. N. Dorogovtsev \etal, Phy. Rev. E, 65, 6 (2002)]
networks constitute notable models which simultaneously incorporate the
aforementioned properties. The rules governing the formation of such networks
are completely deterministic. However, real-world networks are presumably
neither completely deterministic, nor perfectly hierarchical. Therefore, we
suggest here perfectly hierarchical scale-free networks with randomly rewired
edges as better representatives of practical networked systems. In particular,
we preserve the scale-free degree distribution of the various deterministic
networks but successively relax the hierarchical structure while rewiring them.
We utilize the framework of master stability function in investigating the
synchronizability of dynamical systems coupled on such rewired networks.
Interestingly, this reveals that the process of rewiring is capable of
significantly enhancing, as well as, deteriorating the synchronizability of the
resulting networks. We investigate the influence of rewiring edges on the
topological properties of the rewired networks and, in turn, their relation to
the synchronizability of the respective topologies. Finally, we compare the
synchronizability of deterministic scale-free and pseudofractcal scale-free

hall conductivity, and applications in various medical treatment. However,
irrespective of the method of preparation, they often exhibit a high-level of
disorder, with properties sensitive to the thermal or magnetic annealing
temperatures. We calculate lattice dynamical properties of Au$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$
alloys using density functional theory methods, where, being a multisite
property, reliable interatomic force constant (IFC) calculations in disordered
alloys remain a challenge. We follow a two fold approach: (1) an accurate IFC
calculation in an environment with nominally zero chemical pair correlations to
mimic the homogeneously disordered alloy; and (2) a configurational averaging
for the desired phonon properties (e.g., dispersion, density of states, and
entropy). We find an anomalous change in the IFC's and phonon dispersion (split
bands) near $x$=0.19, which is attributed to the local stiffening of the Au-Au
bonds when Au is in the vicinity of Fe. Other results based on mechanical and
thermo-physical properties reflect a similar anomaly: Phonon entropy, e.g.,
becomes negative below $x$=0.19, suggesting a tendency for chemical unmixing,
reflecting the onset of miscibility gap in the phase diagram. Our results match
fairly well with reported data, wherever available.

states and sometimes to mislead observers regarding their true emotional
states. Evidence in experimental psychology shows that discriminative facial
responses are short and subtle. This suggests that such behavior would be
easier to distinguish when captured in high resolution at an increased frame
rate. We are proposing SASE-FE, the first dataset of facial expressions that
are either congruent or incongruent with underlying emotion states. We show
that overall the problem of recognizing whether facial movements are
expressions of authentic emotions or not can be successfully addressed by
learning spatio-temporal representations of the data. For this purpose, we
propose a method that aggregates features along fiducial trajectories in a
deeply learnt space. Performance of the proposed model shows that on average it
is easier to distinguish among genuine facial expressions of emotion than among
unfelt facial expressions of emotion and that certain emotion pairs such as
contempt and disgust are more difficult to distinguish than the rest.
Furthermore, the proposed methodology improves state of the art results on CK+

results when classifying facial action units on BP4D datase.

  limits in power flow studies",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new technique is presented for solving the problem of enforcing control
limits in power flow studies. As an added benefit, it greatly increases the
achievable precision at nose points. The method is exemplified for the case of
Mvar limits in generators regulating voltage on both local and remote buses.
Based on the framework of the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM), it
provides a rigorous solution to this fundamental problem by framing it in terms
of \emph{optimization}. A novel Lagrangian formulation of power-flow, which is
exact for lossless networks, leads to a natural physics-based minimization
criterion that yields the correct solution. For networks with small losses, as
is the case in transmission, the AC power flow problem cannot be framed exactly
in terms of optimization, but the criterion still retains its ability to select
the correct solution. This foundation then provides a way to design a HELM
scheme to solve for the minimizing solution. Although the use of barrier
functions evokes interior point optimization, this method, like HELM, is based
on the analytic continuation of a germ (of a particular branch) of the
algebraic curve representing the solutions of the system. In this case, since
the constraint equations given by limits result in an unavoidable singularity
at $s=1$, direct analytic continuation by means of standard Pad\'e
approximation is fraught with numerical instabilities. This has been overcome
by means of a new analytic continuation procedure, denominated
Pad\'e-Weierstrass, that exploits the covariant nature of the power flow
equations under certain changes of variables. One colateral benefit of this
procedure is that it can also be used when limits are not being enforced, in
order to increase the achievable numerical precision in highly stressed cases.

automated without sacrificing the decision making accuracy and thereby reducing
the project completion time and cost of hiring expensive resources. Several
pattern recognition principles and state of art (SoA) ML techniques are
followed to design the overall approach for the proposed automation. Three data
sets are considered to establish the proof-of-concept. Experimental results
show that the proposed automation is able to reduce the time for feature
selection to $2$ days instead of $4-6$ months which would have been required in
absence of the automation. This reduction in time is achieved without any
sacrifice in the accuracy of the decision making process. Proposed method is
also compared against Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as most of the state
of the art works on IoTA uses MLP based Deep Learning. Moreover the feature
selection method is compared against SoA feature reduction technique namely
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. The results obtained show
that the proposed method is effective.

by the superconducting state. The QCP had long been believed to follow a smooth
extrapolation of the characteristic temperature $T^*$ for the strange normal
state well above the superconducting transition temperature. However, recently
the $T^*$ within the superconducting dome was reported to unexpectedly exhibit
back-bending likely in the cuprate Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$.
Here we show that the original and revised phase diagrams can be understood in
terms of weak and moderate competitions, respectively, between
superconductivity and a pseudogap state such as $d$-density-wave or
spin-density-wave, based on both Ginzburg-Landau theory and the realistic
$t$-$t^{\prime}$-$t^{\prime\prime}$-$J$-$V$ model for the cuprates. We further
found that the calculated temperature and doping-level dependence of the
quasiparticle spectral gap and Raman response qualitatively agrees with the
experiments. In particular, the $T^*$ back-bending can provide a simple
explanation of the observed anomalous two-step thermal evolution dominated by
the superconducting gap and the pseudogap, respectively. Our results imply that

10 of each pure geometries. The simulated winds include a wide range of

can be predicted by the dipole component alone or the quadrupolar scaling
utilising the total field strength. The simulation results can be scaled and
apply to all main-sequence cool stars. For Solar parameters, the lowest order

resonance (NQR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on
LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$. There are two superconducting domes in this material.
The first one appears at 0.03 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.2 with $T_{\rm c}$$^{max}$ =
27 K, and the second one at 0.25 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.75 with $T_{\rm
c}$$^{max}$ = 30 K. By NMR and TEM, we demonstrate that a $C4$-to-$C2$
structural phase transition (SPT) takes place above both domes, with the
transition temperature $T_{\rm s}$ varying strongly with $x$. In the first
dome, the SPT is followed by an antiferromagnetic (AF) transition, but neither
AF order nor low-energy spin fluctuations are found in the second dome. In
LaFeAsO$_{0.97}$F$_{0.03}$, we find that AF order and superconductivity coexist
microscopically via $^{75}$As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/$T_1$)
measurements. In the coexisting region, 1/$T_1$ decreases at $T_{\rm c}$ but
becomes to be proportional to $T$ below 0.6$T_{\rm c}$, indicating gapless
excitations. Therefore, in contrast to the early reports, the obtained phase
diagram for $x \leq$ 0.2 is quite similar to the doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$
system. The electrical resistivity in the second dome can be fitted by $\rho =
{{\rho }_{0}}+A{{T}^{n}}$ with $n$ = 1 and a maximal coefficient $A$ at around
$x_{opt}$ = 0.5$\sim$0.55 where $T_{\rm s}$ extrapolates to zero and $T_{\rm
c}$ is the maximal, which suggest the importance of quantum critical
fluctuations associated with the SPT. We have constructed a complete phase
diagram of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$, which provides insight into the relationship
between SPT, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.

and numerically at the mean-field level. The noisy voter model is a
modification of the voter model that includes a second mechanism for
transitions between states: apart from the original herding processes, voters
may change their states because of an intrinsic, noisy in origin source. By
increasing the importance of the noise with respect to the herding, the system
exhibits a finite-size phase transition from a quasi-consensus state, where
most of the voters share the same opinion, to a one with coexistence. Upon
introducing some zealots, or voters with fixed opinion, the latter scenario may
change significantly. We unveil the new situations by carrying out a systematic
numerical and analytical study of a fully connected network for voters, but
allowing different voters to be directly influenced by different zealots. We
show that this general system is equivalent to a system of voters without
zealots, but with heterogeneous values of their parameters characterizing
herding and noisy dynamics. We find excellent agreement between our analytical
and numerical results. Noise and herding/zealotry acting together in the voter
model yields not a trivial mixture of the scenarios with the two mechanisms
acting alone: it represents a situation where the global-local (noise-herding)
competitions is coupled to a symmetry breaking (zealots). In general, the
zealotry enhances the effective noise of the system, which may destroy the
original quasi--consensus state, and can introduce a bias towards the opinion
of the majority of zealots, hence breaking the symmetry of the system and
giving rise to new phases ...

Faraday rotation as they propagate through the interstellar medium, may
harmfully contaminate the 21-cm power spectrum. We develop a formalism to
describe the leakage due to instrumental widefield effects in visibility-based
power spectra measured with redundant arrays, extending the delay-spectrum
approach presented in Parsons et al. (2012). We construct polarized sky models
and propagate them through the instrument model to simulate realistic full-sky
observations with the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization. We
find that the leakage due to a population of polarized point sources is
expected to be higher than diffuse Galactic polarization at any $k$ mode for a
30~m reference baseline. For the same reference baseline, a foreground-free
window at $k > 0.3 \, h$~Mpc$^{-1}$ can be defined in terms of leakage from
diffuse Galactic polarization even under the most pessimistic assumptions. If
measurements of polarized foreground power spectra or a model of polarized
foregrounds are given, our method is able to predict the polarization leakage
in actual 21-cm observations, potentially enabling its statistical subtraction
from the measured 21-cm power spectrum.

be invaluable to attempt to specify when and how planet formation begins in
star-forming regions and to identify what physical processes/quantities are the
most significant to make a link between star and planet formation. To this end,
we have recently developed a couple of projects. These include an observational
project about dust growth in Class 0 YSOs and a theoretical modeling project of
the HL Tauri disk. For the first project, we utilize the archive data of radio
interferometric observations, and examine whether dust growth, a first step of
planet formation, occurs in Class 0 YSOs. We find that while our observational
results can be reproduced by the presence of large ($\sim$ mm) dust grains for
some of YSOs under the single-component modified blackbody formalism, an
interpretation of no dust growth would be possible when a more detailed model
is used. For the second project, we consider an origin of the disk
configuration around HL Tauri, focusing on magnetic fields. We find that
magnetically induced disk winds may play an important role in the HL Tauri
disk. The combination of these attempts may enable us to move towards a
comprehensive understanding of how star and planet formation are intimately
coupled with each other.

from simple geometrical considerations, under the assumption that the drop's

curvature. The resulting prediction is in perfect agreement with the simulation
results, for both convex and concave substrates. In addition, we calculate the
line tension, namely by fitting the contact angle for different size drops to
the modified Young equation. We find that the line tension for concave surfaces

maximum. This feature is found to be correlated with the number of particles in

nodal bulk spectrum and open Fermi arc surface states, have recently sparked
enormous interest in condensed matter physics. Based on the symmetry and
fermiology, it has been proposed that WSMs can be broadly classified into two
types, type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals. While the undoped, conventional,
type-I WSMs have point like Fermi surface and vanishing density of states (DOS)
at the Fermi energy, the type-II Weyl semimetals break Lorentz symmetry
explicitly and have tilted conical spectra with electron and hole pockets
producing finite DOS at the Fermi level. The tilted conical spectrum and finite
DOS at Fermi level in type-II WSMs have recently been shown to produce
interesting effects such as a chiral anomaly induced longitudinal
magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic in direction and a novel
anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we consider the anomalous Nernst effect in
type-II WSMs in the absence of an external magnetic field using the framework
of semi-classical Boltzmann theory. Based on both a linearized model of
time-reversal breaking WSM with a higher energy cut-off and a more realistic
lattice model, we show that the anomalous Nernst response in these systems is
strongly anisotropic in space, and can serve as a reliable signature of type-II
Weyl semimetals in a host of magnetic systems with spontaneously broken time
reversal symmetry.

frictional interfaces is central to a broad range of geophysical, physical and
engineering systems, with particularly far-reaching implications for earthquake

instability of an expanding creep patch upon surpassing a critical length
$L_c$. The critical nucleation length $L_c$ is conventionally obtained from a
spring-block linear stability analysis extended to interfaces separating
elastically-deformable bodies using model-dependent fracture mechanics
estimates. We propose an alternative approach in which the critical nucleation
length is obtained from a related linear stability analysis of homogeneous
sliding along interfaces separating elastically-deformable bodies. For
elastically identical half-spaces and rate-and-state friction, the two
approaches are shown to yield $L_c$ that features the same scaling structure,
but with substantially different numerical pre-factors, resulting in a
significantly larger $L_c$ in our approach. The proposed approach is also shown
to be naturally applicable to finite-size systems and bimaterial interfaces,
for which various analytic results are derived. To quantitatively test the
proposed approach, we performed inertial Finite-Element-Method calculations for
a finite-size two-dimensional elastically-deformable body in rate-and-state
frictional contact with a rigid body under sideway loading. We show that the
theoretically predicted $L_c$ and its finite-size dependence are in reasonably
good quantitative agreement with the full numerical solutions, lending support
to the proposed approach. These results offer a theoretical framework for
predicting rapid slip nucleation along frictional interfaces.

Upon optimizing the kinematics of the final-state particles assumed to be

CC$\nu$ studies of heavy water can effectively yield the cross sections for

distributed representations of its inputs and to be a recognizer of those
inputs; and b) the generic function of the minicolumn is to enforce
macrocolumnar code sparseness. The minicolumn, defined here as a physically
localized pool of ~20 L2/3 pyramidals, does this by acting as a winner-take-all
(WTA) competitive module, implying that macrocolumnar codes consist of ~70
active L2/3 cells, assuming ~70 minicolumns per macrocolumn. I describe an
algorithm for activating these codes during both learning and retrievals, which
causes more similar inputs to map to more highly intersecting codes, a property
which yields ultra-fast (immediate, first-shot) storage and retrieval. The
algorithm achieves this by adding an amount of randomness (noise) into the code
selection process, which is inversely proportional to an input's familiarity. I
propose a possible mapping of the algorithm onto cortical circuitry, and adduce
evidence for a neuromodulatory implementation of this familiarity-contingent
noise mechanism. The model is distinguished from other recent columnar cortical
circuit models in proposing a generic minicolumnar function in which a group of

of most published adversarial attack methods alongside some new ones, all of
which perform internal hyperparameter tuning to find the minimum adversarial

difficult to identify so far. Here, we argue that modern jet substructure
measurements can improve this situation qualitatively since they are sensitive
to the momentum distribution inside the jet. We show that the groomed subjet
shared momentum fraction $z_g$, and the girth of leading and subleading subjets
signal recoil effects with dependencies that are absent in a recoilless
baseline. We find that recoil effects can explain most of the medium
modifications to the $z_g$ distribution observed in data. Furthermore, for jets
passing the Soft Drop Condition, recoil effects induce in the differential
distribution of subjet separation $\Delta R_{12}$ a characteristic increase
with $\Delta R_{12}$, and they introduce a characteristic enhancement of the
girth of the subleading subjet with decreasing $z_g$. We explain why these
qualitatively novel features, that we establish in \textsc{Jewel+Pythia}
simulations, reflect generic physical properties of recoil effects that should
therefore be searched for as telltale signatures of jet-induced medium
response.

infinity. We prove that these conditions are satisfied in the particular case

gravitational waves (GWs) and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts as
powerful cosmic rulers. In the EM domain, it has been suggested that joint
observations of the time delay ($\Delta\tau$) between lensed quasar images and
the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the lensing galaxy (i.e., the combination
$\Delta\tau/\sigma^{2}$) are able to constrain the cosmological parameters more
strongly than $\Delta\tau$ or $\sigma^{2}$ separately. Here, for the first
time, we propose that this $\Delta\tau/\sigma^{2}$ method can be applied to the
strongly lensed systems observed in both GW and EM windows. Combining the
redshifts, images and $\sigma$ observed in the EM domain with the very precise
$\Delta\tau$ derived from lensed GW signals, we expect that accurate
multimessenger cosmology can be achieved in the era of third-generation GW
detectors. Comparing with the constraints from the $\Delta\tau$ method, we
prove that using $\Delta\tau/\sigma^{2}$ can improve the discrimination between
cosmological models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with $\sim50$ strongly
lensed GW-EM systems, we can reach a constraint on the dark energy equation of
state $w$ comparable to the 580 Union2.1 Type Ia supernovae data. Much more

use the reduced density matrices of the directional subspaces along the
polarization of the laser pulse and along the transverse directions as building
blocks for an approximate entanglement entropy. We present our results, based
on accurate numerical simulations, in terms of several of these entropies, for
selected values of the peak electric field strength and the carrier-envelope
phase difference of the laser pulse. The time evolution of the mutual entropy
of the electron and the ion-core motion along the direction of the laser
polarization is similar to our earlier results based on a simple
one-dimensional model. However, taking into account also the dynamics
perpendicular to the laser polarization reveals a surprisingly different
entanglement dynamics above the laser intensity range corresponding to pure
tunneling: the quantum entanglement decreases with time in the over-the-barrier
ionization regime.

  Sciences 13 July 2017",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The current view about the mixing of heat and salt in the ocean is that it
should be parameterised by means of a rotated diffusion tensor based on mixing
directions parallel and perpendicular to the local neutral vector. However, the
impossibility to construct a density variable in the ocean that is exactly
neutral because of the coupling between thermobaricity and density-compensated
temperature/salinity anomalies implies that the effective diapycnal diffusivity
experienced by any possible density variable is partly controlled by isoneutral
diffusion when using neutral rotated diffusion. Here, this effect is quantified
by evaluating the effective diapycnal diffusion coefficient for five widely
used density variables: Jackett and McDougall (1997) $\gamma^n$, Lorenz
reference state density $\rho_{ref}$ of Winters et al. (1996), Saenz et al.
(2015), and three potential density variables $\sigma_0$, $\sigma_2$ and
$\sigma_4$.Computations use the World Ocean Circulation Experiment climatology,
assuming either a uniform value for isoneutral mixing or spatially varying
values inferred from an inverse calculation. Isopycnal mixing contributions to
the effective diapycnal mixing yields values systematically larger than
$10^{-3}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ in the deep ocean for all density variables,
with $\gamma^n$ suffering the least from the isoneutral control of effective
diapycnal mixing, and $\sigma_0$ the most. These high values are due to
spatially localised large values of non-neutrality, mostly in the deep Southern
Ocean. Removing only 5\% of these high values on each density surface reduces
the effective diapycnal diffusivities to less than $10^{-4}$
$\text{m}^2/\text{s}$. This work highlights the potential pitfalls of
estimating diapycnal diffusivities by means of Walin-like water masses analysis
or in using Lorenz reference state for diagnosing spurious numerical diapycnal
mixing.

and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One
direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared
neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer
across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed,
because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making
learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the
different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task
dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint
training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (Distill & transfer
learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we
propose to share a ""distilled"" policy that captures common behaviour across
tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay
close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation
to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process
are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach
supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several
related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust and
more stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.

conventional metals and semiconductors, it remains unclear which mechanism is
mainly responsible for electron dephasing in three-dimensional (3D) topological

measure the dephasing rates in highly tunable (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. As
the transport is varied from a bulk-conducting regime to surface-dominant
transport, the dephasing rate is observed to evolve from a linear temperature
dependence to a sublinear power-law dependence. While the former is consistent
with the Nyquist electron-electron interactions commonly seen in ordinary 2D

and is attributed to the coupling between the surface states and the localized
charge puddles in the bulk of 3D TIs.

with mostly qualitative questions, long and time consuming items, only a few of
them demanding more complex reasoning and assessing some problem solving
skills. The answers of the students were analyzed, using basic statistical
exploration and IRT to draw the ICC of the Physics items. A comparison was made
between the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis for the Physics
questions. The study of student performance reveals the low attaining levels of
Physics learning at the end of high school, with a small percentage of correct
answers; students perform worse in questions that require disciplinary
knowledge or use of basic mathematical reasoning. It is also possible to
observe discrepancies on the results of two subsets of groups: female students
perform worse than male students in most items, and students that come from
federal and private high school perform significantly better that those from
state high school (75% of students in high school attend state or regional

induces an extra current in a normal DNA molecule and leads to its destruction.
By sending crafted electromagnetic signals to normal DNA molecules and inducing
an opposite current with respect to this extra current, we can prevent the
destruction of normal DNA. Finally, we argue that the type of packing of DNA in
chromosomes of men and women are different. This causes radiated waves from
DNAs of men and women to have opposite signs and cancel the effect of each
other in a pair. Using this property, we suggest another mechanism to cancel
the effect of extra waves, which are produced by DNAs in cancer cells of a male
or a female, by extra waves which are produced by DNAs in similar cells of a
female or a male and prevent the progression of the disease.

functionalities of such systems ranging from distributed information fusion,
decision-making, to decentralized control. In order to reach an agreement,
existing consensus algorithms require each agent to exchange explicit state
information with its neighbors. This leads to the disclosure of private state
information, which is undesirable in cases where privacy is of concern. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that enables secure and privacy-preserving
average consensus in a decentralized architecture in the absence of an
aggregator or third-party. By leveraging partial homomorphic cryptography to
embed secrecy in pairwise interaction dynamics, our approach can guarantee
consensus to the exact value in a deterministic manner without disclosing a
node's state to its neighbors. In addition to enabling resilience to passive
attackers aiming to steal state information, the approach also allows easy
incorporation of defending mechanisms against active attackers which try to
alter the content of exchanged messages. Furthermore, in contrast to existing
noise-injection based privacy-preserving mechanisms which have to reconfigure
the entire network when the topology or number of nodes varies, our approach is
applicable to dynamic environments with time-varying coupling topologies. This
secure and privacy-preservation approach is also applicable to weighted average
consensus as well as maximum/minimum consensus under a new update rule. The
approach is light-weight in computation and communication. Implementation
details and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the capability of
our approach.

negative, in sharp contrast with the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. Using the

have illustrated that the difference between the theoretical estimates and the
observational results gets minimized for negative values of the tidal charge
parameter. As a quantitative estimate of this result we concentrate on several
error estimators, including reduced $\chi^{2}$, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency,

classical kinematics by an extra axiom, then the two theories become
definitionally equivalent (i.e., they become equivalent theories in the sense
as the theory of lattices as algebraic structures is the same as the theory of
lattices as partially ordered sets). Furthermore, we show that classical
kinematics is definitionally equivalent to classical kinematics with only
slower-than-light inertial observers, and hence by transitivity of definitional
equivalence that special relativity theory extended with ""Ether"" is
definitionally equivalent to classical kinematics. So within an axiomatic
framework of mathematical logic, we explicitly show that the transition from

the Huang-Rhys theory with non-perturbative calculations, we reach an
estimation of 1.6$\pm$0.1 $\angstrom$ for the spatial extension of the

measured at low temperature lies in the 6 ns-range. The estimation of both
radiative and non-radiative recombination rates as a function of temperature
further demonstrate a constant radiative lifetime. Finally, although G-centers
are shallow levels in silicon, we find a value of the Debye-Waller factor

ratio is $m/n=\frac{1-2\beta}{(1-\beta)^2}$. We also prove that scale-free
random k-SAT instances are unsatisfiable with high probability when the number
of clauses exceeds $\omega(n^{(1-\beta)k})$. %This implies that the SAT/UNSAT
phase transition phenomena vanishes when $\beta>1-1/k$, and formulas are
unsatisfiable due to a small core of clauses. The proof of this result suggests
that, when $\beta>1-1/k$, the unsatisfiability of most formulas may be due to
small cores of clauses. Finally, we show how this model will allow us to
generate random instances similar to industrial instances, of interest for
testing purposes.

Applied 9, 054002 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.9.054002",,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spincaloritronic signal generation due to thermal spin injection and spin
transport is demonstrated in a non-degenerate Si spin valve. The spin-dependent
Seebeck effect is used for the spincaloritronic signal generation, and the
thermal gradient of about 200 mK at an interface of Fe and Si enables
generating a spin voltage of 8 {\mu}V at room temperature. A simple expansion
of a conventional spin drift-diffusion model with taking into account the
spin-dependent Seebeck effect shows semiconductor materials are quite potential
for the spincaloritronic signal generation comparing with metallic materials,
which can allow efficient heat recycling in semiconductor spin devices.

  Multiple-Output System Modelling using Convolved Gaussian Process Models",,,,,"cs.NE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolved Gaussian Process (CGP) is able to capture the correlations not only
between inputs and outputs but also among the outputs. This allows a superior
performance of using CGP than standard Gaussian Process (GP) in the modelling
of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems when observations are missing
for some of outputs. Similar to standard GP, a key issue of CGP is the learning
of hyperparameters from a set of input-output observations. It typically
performed by maximizing the Log-Likelihood (LL) function which leads to an
unconstrained nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. Algorithms such as
Conjugate Gradient (CG) or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) are commonly
used but they often get stuck in local optima, especially for CGP where there
are more hyperparameters. In addition, the LL value is not a reliable indicator
for judging the quality intermediate models in the optimization process. In
this paper, we propose to use enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithms to solve this problem by minimizing the model output error instead.
This optimization criterion enables the quality of intermediate solutions to be
directly observable during the optimization process. Two enhancements to the
standard PSO algorithm which make use of gradient information and the multi-
start technique are proposed. Simulation results on the modelling of both
linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate the effectiveness of minimizing the
model output error to learn hyperparameters and the performance of using
enhanced algorithms.
