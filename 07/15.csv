spectrograph in the optical range HARPS-N, the Italian telescope TNG (La Palma)
became one of the key facilities for the study of the extrasolar planets. In
2014 TNG also offered GIANO to the scientific community, providing a
near-infrared (NIR) cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy covering 0.97 - 2.45
micron at a resolution of 50,000. GIANO, although designed for direct
light-feed from the telescope at the Nasmyth-B focus, was provisionally mounted
on the rotating building and connected via fibers to only available interface
at the Nasmyth-A focal plane. The synergy between these two instruments is
particularly appealing for a wide range of science cases, especially for the
search for exoplanets around young and active stars and the characterisation of
their atmosphere. Through the funding scheme ""WOW"" (a Way to Others Worlds),
the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) proposed to position
GIANO at the focal station for which it was originally designed and the
simultaneous use of these spectrographs with the aim to achieve high-resolution
spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range (0.383-2.45 micron) obtained in a
single exposure, giving rise to the project called GIARPS (GIANO-B & HARPS-N).
Because of its characteristics GIARPS can be considered the first and unique
worldwide instrument providing not only high resolution in a large wavelength
band, but also a high precision radial velocity measurement both in the visible
and in the NIR arm, since in the next future GIANO-B will be equipped with gas
absorption cells.

We are also able to compare the estimates from spectrophotometry to those from
Gaia, and use this to assess the reliability of both catalogues and improve our
distance estimates. We find that the distances to the lowest log g stars are,
on average, overestimated and caution that they may not be reliable. We also
find that it is likely that the Gaia random uncertainties are smaller than the
reported values. As a byproduct we derive ages for the RAVE stars, many with
relative uncertainties less than 20 percent. These results for 219566 RAVE

spin-momentum locking effect which correlates the spin with the linear
momentum. For the surface electrons in three-dimensional topological insulators
(TIs), their spin is locked to the transport direction. For photons in optical
fibers and photonic waveguides, they carry transverse spin angular momentum
(SAM) which is also locked to the propagation direction. A direct connection
between the electronic and the optical spins occurs in TIs with lifted spin
degeneracy, which leads to spin-dependent selection rules of optical
transitions and results in phenomena such as circular photogalvanic effect
(CPGE). Here, we demonstrate an optoelectronic device that integrates a TI with
a photonic waveguide. Interaction between the photons in the
transverse-magnetic (TM) mode of the waveguide, which carries transverse SAM,
and the surface electrons in a Bi2Se3 layer generates a directional,
spin-polarized photocurrent. Because of optical spin-momentum locking, the
device works in a non-reciprocal way such that changing the light propagation
direction reverses the photon spin and thus the direction of the photocurrent
in the TI. This novel device provides a directional interface that directly
converts the photon propagation path to the direction and spin polarization of
the photo-excited surface current in the TI. It represents a new way of
implementing coupled spin-orbit interaction between electrons and photons and
may lead to significant applications in opto-spintronics and quantum
information processing.

magnitude density of the light curves and their Fourier coefficients have been
chosen as features in previous studies. However, some of these features are not
robust to the presence of outliers and the calculation of Fourier coefficients
is computationally expensive for large data sets. We propose and evaluate the
performance of a new robust set of features using supervised classifiers in
order to look for new Be star candidates in the OGLE-IV Gaia south ecliptic
pole field. We calculated the proposed set of features on six types of variable
stars and on a set of Be star candidates reported in the literature. We
evaluated the performance of these features using classification trees and
random forests along with K-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and
gradient boosted trees methods. We tuned the classifiers with a 10-fold
cross-validation and grid search. We validated the performance of the best
classifier on a set of OGLE-IV light curves and applied this to find new Be
star candidates. The random forest classifier outperformed the others. By using
the random forest classifier and colour criteria we found 50 Be star candidates
in the direction of the Gaia south ecliptic pole field, four of which have
infrared colours consistent with Herbig Ae/Be stars. Supervised methods are
very useful in order to obtain preliminary samples of variable stars extracted
from large databases. As usual, the stars classified as Be stars candidates
must be checked for the colours and spectroscopic characteristics expected for
them.

topological features. Network properties such as the degree distribution and
shortest path length have been computed in numerous real-world networks, and
most of them have been shown to be both scale-free and small-world networks.
Graphlets and network motifs are subgraph patterns that capture richer
structural information than aforementioned global network properties, and these
local features are often used for network comparison. However, past work on
graphlets and network motifs is almost exclusively applicable only for static
networks. Many systems are better represented as temporal networks which depict
not only how a system was at a given stage but also how they evolved.
Time-dependent information is crucial in temporal networks and, by disregarding
that data, static methods can not achieve the best possible results. This paper
introduces an extension of graphlets for temporal networks. Our proposed method
enumerates all 4-node graphlet-orbits in each network-snapshot, building the
corresponding orbit-transition matrix in the process. Our hypothesis is that
networks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions
which better identify them than simple static patterns, and this is assessed on
a set of real temporal networks split into categories. In order to perform
temporal network comparison we put forward an orbit-transition-agreement metric
(OTA). OTA correctly groups a set of temporal networks that both static network
motifs and graphlets fail to do so adequately. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable results which we use to uncover characteristic orbit transitions,
and that can be regarded as a network-fingerprint.

path planning of the vehicle since these are pilot-less vehicles. Path
planning, whether offline or online, entails setting up the path as a sequence
of locations in the 3D Euclidean space, whose coordinates happen to be
latitude, longitude and altitude. For the specific application of remote
surveillance of long linear infrastructures in non-urban terrain, the
continuous 3D-ESP problem practically entails two important scalar costs. The
first scalar cost is the distance traveled along the planned path. Since drones
are battery operated, hence it is needed that the path length between fixed
start and goal locations of a mission should be minimal at all costs. The other
scalar cost is the cost of transmitting the acquired video during the mission
of remote surveillance, via a camera mounted in the drone's belly. Because of
the length of surveillance target which is long linear infrastructure, the
amount of video generated is very high and cannot be generally stored in its
entirety, on board. If the connectivity is poor along certain segments of a
naive path, to boost video transmission rate, the transmission power of the
signal is kept high, which in turn dissipates more battery energy. Hence a path
is desired that simultaneously also betters what is known as communication
cost. These two costs trade-off, and hence Pareto optimization is needed for
this 3D bi-objective Euclidean shortest path problem. In this report, we study
the mono-objective offline path planning problem, based on the distance cost,
while posing the communication cost as an upper-bounded constraint. The
bi-objective path planning solution is sketched out towards the end.

recently begun to receive significant attention in studies of galaxy formation

accelerate galactic winds. Microscopic cosmic ray transport processes are
fundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic ray wind driving. Previous
studies focused on modeling of cosmic ray transport either via constant
diffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfven speed.
However, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster
than in the ionized medium and the effective transport can be substantially
larger; i.e., cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic
disks including the effects of cosmic rays. Our simulations include the
decoupling of cosmic rays in the cold, neutral interstellar medium. We find
that, compared to the ordinary diffusive cosmic ray transport case, accounting
for the decoupling leads to significantly different wind properties such as the
gas density and temperature, significantly broader spatial distribution of
cosmic rays, and larger wind speed. These results have implications for X-ray,
gamma-ray and radio emission, and for the magnetization and pollution of the
circumgalactic medium by cosmic rays.

under the framework of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian to describe in a model
independent way the supposedly strong dynamics of these modes. The properties
of the vector resonances, mass, width and couplings to the $W$ and $Z$ gauge
bosons are derived from the inverse amplitude method approach. We implement all
these features into a single model, the IAM-MC, adapted for MonteCarlo, built
in a Lagrangian language in terms of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and a
chiral Lagrangian for the vector resonances, which mimics the resonant behavior
of the IAM and provides unitary amplitudes. The model has been implemented in
MadGraph, allowing us to perform a realistic study of the signal versus
background events at the LHC. In particular, we have focused our study on the
$pp\to WZjj$ type of events, discussing first on the potential of the hadronic

$\ell=e,\mu$, having a very distinctive signature, and showing clearly the

often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons.
Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or
random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general
framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is
lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network
models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the
distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for
fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly
available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine
learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to
evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine
learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how
GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical
neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure
avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g.
the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of
the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters
which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties.
Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint
distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary
statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens
the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly
to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.

noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to
simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure
to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates
communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to
monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this
game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation
is 35\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over
the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the
interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can
motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems
to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender
allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the

yield important clues about the fundamental particle nature of dark matter.
Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing provides a unique way to detect and
characterize dark matter substructures at cosmological distances from the Milky
Way. Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass
subhalos within lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their
contribution to the lensing convergence field is approximately Gaussian and
could thus be described by their power spectrum. We develop here a general
formalism to compute from first principles the substructure convergence power
spectrum for different populations of dark matter subhalos. As an example, we
apply our framework to two distinct subhalo populations: a truncated
Navarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard CDM, and a
truncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM). We study in detail how the subhalo abundance, mass function, internal
density profile, and concentration affect the amplitude and shape of the
substructure power spectrum. We determine that the power spectrum is mostly
sensitive to a specific combination of the subhalo abundance and moments of the
mass function, as well as to the average tidal truncation scale of the largest
subhalos included in the analysis. Interestingly, we show that the asymptotic
slope of the substructure power spectrum at large wave number reflects the
internal density profile of the subhalos. In particular, the SIDM power
spectrum exhibits a characteristic steepening at large wave number absent in
the CDM power spectrum, opening the possibility of using this observable, if at
all measurable, to discern between these two scenarios.

high-dimensional data, but analyses of these data often occur after their
projection to lower-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce a local
two-sample hypothesis test framework that an analyst may directly apply to data
in their native space. In this framework, the analyst defines two classes based
on a response variable of interest (e.g. higher-mass galaxies versus lower-mass
galaxies) and determines at arbitrary points in predictor space whether the
local proportions of objects that belong to the two classes significantly
differs from the global proportion.
  Our framework has a potential myriad of uses throughout astronomy; here, we
demonstrate its efficacy by applying it to a sample of 2487 i-band-selected
galaxies observed by the HST ACS in four of the CANDELS program fields. For
each galaxy, we have seven morphological summary statistics along with an
estimated stellar mass and star-formation rate. We perform two studies: one in
which we determine regions of the seven-dimensional space of morphological
statistics where high-mass galaxies are significantly more numerous than
low-mass galaxies, and vice-versa, and another study where we use SFR in place
of mass. We find that we are able to identify such regions, and show how
high-mass/low-SFR regions are associated with concentrated and undisturbed
galaxies while galaxies in low-mass/high-SFR regions appear more extended
and/or disturbed than their high-mass/low-SFR counterparts.

the aim of finding solution to problems that evade traditional scientific
approaches due to their complexity. In general, an order parameter capable of
identifying two different phases of matter separated by a correspond- ing phase
transition is constructed based on symmetry arguments. This parameter measures
the degree of order as the phase transition proceeds. However, when the two
distinct phases are highly disordered it is not trivial to identify broken
symmetries with which to find an order parameter. This poses an excellent
problem to be addressed using machine learning procedures. Room tem- perature
liquid water is hypothesized to be a supercritical liquid, with fluctuations of
two different molecular orders associated to two parent liquid phases, one with
high density and another one with low density. The validity of this hypothesis
is linked to the existence of an order parameter capable of identifying the two
distinct liquid phases and their fluctuations. In this work we show how two
different machine learning procedures are capable of recognizing local order in
liquid water. We argue that when in order to learn relevant features from this
complexity, an initial, physically motivated preparation of the available data
is as important as the quality of the data set, and that machine learning can
become a successful analysis tool only when coupled to high level physical
information.

can be used to solve constrained optimization problems in a distributed manner.
The optimization setup consists of a set of agents interacting through a
communication graph that have as common goal the minimization of a function
expressed as a sum of (possibly non-convex) differentiable functions. Each
function in the sum corresponds to an agent and each agent has associated an
equality constraint. By re-casting the distributed optimization problem into an
equivalent, augmented centralized problem, we show that distributed algorithms
result naturally from applying standard nonlinear programming techniques. Due
to the distributed formulation, the standard assumptions and convergence
results no longer hold. We emphasize what changes are necessary for convergence
to still be achieved for three algorithms: two algorithms based on Lagrangian
methods, and an algorithm based the method of multipliers. The changes in the
convergence results are necessary mainly due to the fact that the (local)
minimizers of the lifted optimization problem are not regular, as a results of
the distributed formulation. Unlike the standard algorithm based on the method
of multipliers, for the distributed version we cannot show that the theoretical
superlinear convergence rate can be achieved.

ecosystems, they frequently have insufficient observations to provide baseline

experiments rarely have the resolution to include them. Many studies in
observational climatology, climate modeling, and paleoclimate thus depend to
varying degrees on an approximation equating near-surface marine and
terrestrial island climates, often with direct implications for island
societies and resources. Here we investigate the validity of this
approximation, and by extension the viability of offshore moorings to serve as
proxies for island climate variability, by comparing monthly mean observations
on a diverse set of 17 islands across the global tropics with those from ocean
moorings proximate to each island. While some island-mooring pairs exhibit a
mean offset in surface air temperature, these cannot be explained as a simple
function of one parameter including distance from the mooring, station
elevation, or island dimensions. Overall, the seasonal to interannual
variability in near-surface climate at monthly time scales at meteorological
stations on tropical islands is captured remarkably well by moorings positioned
up to 1,000 km offshore.

Our goal is to enable effective simulation and inversion of a large amount of

inverting the wave, we present a rigorous multigrid-based forward approach
which utilizes the finite-difference time-domain method and a nested finite
element grid structure. Based on the multigrid approach, we introduce and
validate a multiresolution algorithm which allows regularization of the unknown
distribution through a coarse-to-fine inversion scheme. In this approach,
sparse signals can be effectively inverted, as the coarse fluctuations are
reconstructed before the finer ones. Furthermore, the number of nonzero entries
in the system matrix can be compressed and thus the inversion procedure can be
speeded up. As a test scenario we investigate satellite-based asteroid interior
reconstruction. We use both full-wave and projected wave data and estimate the
accuracy of the inversion under different error sources: noise and positioning
inaccuracies. The results suggest that the present full-wave inversion approach
allows recovering the interior with a single satellite recording backscattering
data. It seems that robust results can be achieved, when the peak-to-peak
signal-to-noise ratio is above 10 dB. Furthermore, it seems that reconstructing
the deep interior can be enhanced if two satellites can be utilized in the

strong evolution to z = 2.22. We estimate an amplification due to gravitational
lensing of 2.8+0.6-0.5 (1.10 +- 0.23 mag)---compatible with the value estimated

challenging task. Upon recognizing that a network is in fact the union of its
egonets, a novel network representation using multi-way data structures is
advocated in this contribution. The introduced sparse tensor-based
representation exhibits richer structure compared to its matrix counterpart,
and thus enables a more robust approach to community detection. To leverage
this structure, a constrained tensor approximation framework is introduced
using PARAFAC decomposition. The arising constrained trilinear optimization is
handled via alternating minimization, where intermediate subproblems are solved
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to ensure
convergence. The factors obtained provide soft community memberships, which can
further be exploited for crisp, and possibly-overlapping community assignments.
The framework is further broadened to include time-varying graphs, where the
edgeset as well as the underlying communities evolve through time. Performance
of the proposed approach is assessed via tests on benchmark synthetic graphs as
well as real-world networks. As corroborated by numerical tests, the proposed
tensor-based representation captures multi-hop nodal connections, that is,
connectivity patterns within single-hop neighbors, whose exploitation yields a
more robust community identification in the presence of mixing as well as
overlapping communities.

differential combination $\epsilon_\text{W}$ of the three energies was taken in
the original work as a measure of the so-called Wigner term in semi-empirical
mass formulas, and it was found to decrease drastically when the two-nucleon

that the width of the symmetry spectrum experiences an equally drastic
decrease, which can be explained qualitatively in terms of schematic

polynomial-time setting, and a similar result of M\""uller (IWPEC 2006) in the
FPT setting. Using our framework, we obtain such reductions for some of the
most important problems in fine-grained complexity: the Orthogonal Vectors
problem, 3SUM, and the Negative-Weight Triangle problem (which is closely
related to All-Pairs Shortest Path).
  We also provide a fine-grained reduction from approximate #SAT to SAT.
Suppose the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false, so that for
some $1<c<2$ and all $k$ there is an $O(c^n)$-time algorithm for k-SAT. Then we
prove that for all $k$, there is an $O((c+o(1))^n)$-time algorithm for
approximate #$k$-SAT. In particular, our result implies that the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH) is equivalent to the seemingly-weaker statement that
there is no algorithm to approximate #3-SAT to within a factor of $1+\epsilon$
in time $2^{o(n)}/\epsilon^2$ (taking $\epsilon > 0$ as part of the input).

in deep learning, e.g., implementing real-time image recognition and
conversational system. Given a trained deep learning model, applications
usually need to perform a series of matrix operations based on the input data,
in order to infer possible output values. Because of computational complexity
and size constraints, these trained models are often hosted in the cloud. To
utilize these cloud-based models, mobile apps will have to send input data over
the network. While cloud-based deep learning can provide reasonable response
time for mobile apps, it restricts the use case scenarios, e.g. mobile apps
need to have network access. With mobile specific deep learning optimizations,
it is now possible to employ on-device inference. However, because mobile
hardware, such as GPU and memory size, can be very limited when compared to its
desktop counterpart, it is important to understand the feasibility of this new
on-device deep learning inference architecture. In this paper, we empirically
evaluate the inference performance of three Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) using a benchmark Android application we developed. Our measurement and
analysis suggest that on-device inference can cost up to two orders of
magnitude greater response time and energy when compared to cloud-based
inference, and that loading model and computing probability are two performance
bottlenecks for on-device deep inferences.

half-harmonic pulses. Simultons are simultanous bright-dark solitons of a
signal field at frequency $\omega$ and the pump field at $2\omega$ which form
in a quadratic nonlinear medium. The formation of simultons in an OPO is
evidenced by sech$^2$ spectra with broad instantaneous bandwidths which
increase with pump power, and large slope efficiencies. In contrast to
conventional synchronously pumped OPOs, operation in this regime is achieved by
using relatively large parametric gains, and a low finesse resonator detuned to
a slightly longer roundtrip time than the pump repetition period. In the
experiment we achieve sub-50 fs sech$^2$ pulses with a slope efficiency of
570%, and a conversion efficiency of 55% as a result of formation of simultons
in an OPO. We verify the distinct features of OPO operation in the simulton
regime analytically and numerically. These results represent a fundamental
shift in the understanding and design of OPOs, in which the nonlinear dynamics
that arise during asynchronous operation can be used to efficiently generate

destabilize protein native structures. This is in direct contrast to the
bio-preservative nature of its natural counterpart, sucrose, which enhances the
stability of biomolecules against environmental stress. We have further
explored the molecular interactions of sucralose as compared to sucrose to
illuminate the origin of the differences in their bio-preservative efficacy. We
show that the mode of interactions of sucralose and sucrose in bulk solution
differ subtly using hydration dynamics measurement and computational
simulation. Sucralose does not appear to disturb the native state of proteins
for moderate concentrations (<0.2 M) at room temperature. However, as the
concentration increases, or in the thermally stressed state, sucralose appears
to differ in its interactions with protein leading to the reduction of native
state stability. This difference in interaction appears weak. We explored the
difference in the preferential exclusion model using time-resolved
spectroscopic techniques and observed that both molecules appear to be
effective reducers of bulk hydration dynamics. However, the chlorination of
sucralose appears to slightly enhance the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which
reduces the preferential exclusion of sucralose from the protein-water
interface. The weak interaction of sucralose with hydrophobic pockets on the
protein surface differs from the behavior of sucrose. We experimentally
followed up upon the extent of this weak interaction using isothermal titration

solutions for such robots, and exact solutions with unbounded acceleration,
exact solvers to the TOC-ORBA problem have remained elusive until now. In this
paper, we present a real-time solver for true time-optimal control of
omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration. We first derive the general
parameterized form of the solution to the TOC-ORBA problem by application of
Pontryagin's maximum principle. We then frame the boundary value problem of
TOC-ORBA as an optimization problem over the parametrized control space. To
overcome local minima and poor initial guesses to the optimization problem, we
introduce a two-stage optimal control solver (TSOCS): The first stage computes
an upper bound to the total time for the TOC-ORBA problem and holds the time
constant while optimizing the parameters of the trajectory to approach the
boundary value conditions. The second stage uses the parameters found by the
first stage, and relaxes the constraint on the total time to solve for the
parameters of the complete TOC-ORBA problem. We further implement TSOCS as a
closed loop controller to overcome actuation errors on real robots in
real-time. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of TSOCS in simulation
and on real robots, showing that 1) it runs in real time, generating solutions
in less than 0.5ms on average; 2) it generates faster trajectories compared to
an approximate solver; and 3) it is able to solve TOC-ORBA problems with
non-zero final velocities that were previously unsolvable in real-time.

representation of fast algorithms for bilinear functions, which include

communication lower bounds are based on quantifying the minimal matrix ranks of
matching subsets of columns of these matrices. This infrastructure yields new
communication lower bounds for symmetric tensor contraction algorithms, which
provide qualitative new insights. Tensor symmetry (invariance under permutation
of modes) is common to many applications of tensor computations (e.g., tensor
representation of hypergraphs, analysis of high order moments in data, as well
as tensors modelling interactions of electrons in computational chemistry).
Tensor symmetry enables reduction in representation size as well as arithmetic
cost of contractions by factors that scale with the number of equivalent
permutations. However, we derive lower bounds showing that these arithmetic
cost and memory reductions can necessitate increases in data movement by
factors that scale with the size of the tensors.

explicit models to bimanual tasks. In the presence of an external perturbation
on any of the robots, they will both move in synchrony in order to maintain
their relative posture, and thus not exert force on the object they are

stiff in their relative task. To achieve compliant absolute behavior and stiff
relative behavior, we combine joint-space CMPs with the well known symmetric

not to~$p^*$, but to the doping where anti-nodal electron pockets,
characteristic of each model, appear at the Fermi surface shortly before~$p^*$.
While such electron pockets are still to be found in experiments, we discuss
how they could provide distinctive signatures for each model. We also show that
the range of doping where those electron pockets would be found is strongly
affected by the position of the van~Hove singularity.

essential for insights into disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet

  Results: Here we present OhmNet, a hierarchy-aware unsupervised node feature
learning approach for multi-layer networks. We build a multi-layer network,
where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue.
OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes,
to a neural embedding based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet
encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network
neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm
generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues,
by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use
OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction
network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular
functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than
alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about
tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue
hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate
that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively
transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue. Overall,
OhmNet moves from flat networks to multiscale models able to predict a range of
phenotypes spanning cellular subsystems

nonsymmorphic symmetry is preserved even in the presence of the field, the
two-dimensional electronic states change into two distinct topological phases

chiral edge modes accompanying the Hall current, but the other one is an
unconventional topological phase with helical edge modes in the absence of

series is important in many areas, including financial markets, power grid
management, climate and weather modeling, or molecular dynamics. The analysis
of such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we
can often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates
to features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear
Markovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change
collectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional
analysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach
for Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and
optimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key
insight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular
components of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of
score functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be
employed to optimize a Markovian model. In addition, based on the relationship
between the variational scores and approximation errors of Koopman operators,
we propose a new VAMP-E score, which can be applied to cross-validation for
hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in VAMP. VAMP is valid for
both reversible and nonreversible processes and for stationary and
non-stationary processes or realizations.

local spin injection at one edge and damping along the channel establishes a
dissipative exchange flow, sometimes referred to as a spin superfluid. However,
realistic materials exhibit in-plane anisotropy, which breaks the axial
symmetry assumed in current theoretical models. Here, we study dissipative
exchange flows in a ferromagnet with in-plane anisotropy from a dispersive
hydrodynamic perspective. Through the analysis of a boundary value problem for
a damped sine-Gordon equation, dissipative exchange flows in a ferromagnetic
channel can be excited above a spin current threshold that depends on material
parameters and the length of the channel. Symmetry-broken dissipative exchange
flows display harmonic overtones that redshift the fundamental precessional
frequency and lead to a reduced spin pumping efficiency when compared to their
symmetric counterpart. Micromagnetic simulations are used to verify that the
analytical results are qualitatively accurate, even in the presence of nonlocal
dipole fields. Simulations also confirm that dissipative exchange flows can be
driven by spin transfer torque in a finite-sized region. These results
delineate the important material parameters that must be optimized for the
excitation of dissipative exchange flows in realistic systems.

stochastic fluctuations. Analytically tractable models with Gaussian driving
noise have led to important, general insights, but they fail to capture rare,
catastrophic events, which are increasingly observed at scales ranging from
global fisheries to intestinal microbiota. Due to mathematical challenges,
growth processes with random catastrophes are less well characterized and it
remains unclear how their consequences differ from those of Gaussian processes.
In the face of a changing climate and predicted increases in ecological
catastrophes, as well as increased interest in harnessing microbes for
therapeutics, these processes have never been more relevant. To better
understand them, I revisit here a differential equation model of logistic
growth coupled to density-independent catastrophes that arrive as a Poisson
process, and derive new analytic results that reveal its statistical structure.
First, I derive exact expressions for the model's stationary moments, revealing
a single effective catastrophe parameter that largely controls low order
statistics. Then, I use weak convergence theorems to construct its Gaussian
analog in a limit of frequent, small catastrophes, keeping the stationary
population mean constant for normalization. Numerically computing statistics
along this limit shows how they transform as the dynamics shifts from
catastrophes to diffusions, enabling quantitative comparisons. For example, the
mean time to extinction increases monotonically by orders of magnitude,
demonstrating significantly higher extinction risk under catastrophes than
under diffusions. Together, these results provide insight into a wide range of
stochastic dynamical systems important for ecology and conservation.

joint XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST observations. We successfully accomplished
this for NGC 3783 in December 2016. We found heavy X-ray absorption produced by
an obscuring outflow in this AGN. As a result of this obscuration, interesting
absorption features appear in the UV and X-ray spectra, which are not present
in the previous epochs. Namely, the obscuration produces broad and blue-shifted
UV absorption lines of Ly$\alpha$, C IV, and N V, together with a new
high-ionisation component producing Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. In
soft X-rays, only narrow emission lines stand out above the diminished
continuum as they are not absorbed by the obscurer. Our analysis shows that the
obscurer partially covers the central source with a column density of few
$10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, outflowing with a velocity of few thousand km s$^{-1}$.
The obscuration in NGC 3783 is variable and lasts for about a month. Unlike the
commonly-seen warm-absorber winds at pc-scale distances from the black hole,
the eclipsing wind in NGC 3783 is located at about 10 light days. Our results
suggest the obscuration is produced by an inhomogeneous and clumpy medium,
consistent with clouds in the base of a radiatively-driven disk wind at the
outer broad-line region of the AGN.

address this problem through the use of simulators, however, this gives rise to
the problem of policy transfer from simulated to the physical system. Model
mismatch due to systematic parameter shift and unmodelled dynamics error may
cause sub-optimal or unsafe behavior upon direct transfer. We introduce the
Adaptive Policy Transfer for Stochastic Dynamics (ADAPT) algorithm that
achieves provably safe and robust, dynamically-feasible zero-shot transfer of
RL-policies to new domains with dynamics error. ADAPT combines the strengths of
offline policy learning in a black-box source simulator with online tube-based
MPC to attenuate bounded model mismatch between the source and target dynamics.
ADAPT allows online transfer of policy, trained solely in a simulation offline,
to a family of unknown targets without fine-tuning. We also formally show that
(i) ADAPT guarantees state and control safety through state-action tubes under
the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the divergence in dynamics and, (ii)
ADAPT results in a bounded loss of reward accumulation relative to a policy
trained and evaluated in the source environment. We evaluate ADAPT on 2
continuous, non-holonomic simulated dynamical systems with 4 different
disturbance models, and find that ADAPT performs between 50%-300% better on
mean reward accrual than direct policy transfer.

pre-located objects) and the specified task as input and recurrently predicting
action sequences. However, training such a network usually requires large
amounts of annotated samples for covering the semantic space (e.g., diverse
action decomposition and ordering). To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
temporal And-Or graph (AOG) for task description, which hierarchically
represents a task into atomic actions. With this AOG representation, we can
produce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences according with common sense)
by training another auxiliary LSTM network with a small set of annotated
samples. And these generated samples (i.e., task-oriented action sequences)
effectively facilitate training the model for task-oriented action prediction.

pose of an object from a single image. Hitherto, the problem has been addressed
through the application of canonical deep learning methods to regress from the

problematic from two perspectives. First, they are minimizing the error between
3D shapes and pose labels - with little thought about the nature of this label

onerous and ill-posed task of hand labeling natural images with respect to 3D
shape and pose. In this paper we define the new task of pose-aware shape
reconstruction from a single image, and we advocate that cheaper 2D annotations
of objects silhouettes in natural images can be utilized. We design
architectures of pose-aware shape reconstruction which re-project the predicted
shape back on to the image using the predicted pose. Our evaluation on several

the conventional density evolution, there exists another type of discrete

forecasting using forecasted weather data. In this study, the performance of
several commonly used forecasting methods in the presence of weather predictors
with uncertainty is assessed and compared. Accordingly, both observed and

Using observed and forecasted weather data, an analysis on the uncertainty of

the mildly non-linear regime in the presence of massive neutrinos. Neutrinos,
whose free streaming wavenumber ($k_{\rm fs}$) is typically longer than the
non-linear scale ($k_{\rm NL}$) are described by a Boltzmann equation coupled
to the effective fluid-like equations that describe dark matter. We solve the
equations expanding in the neutrino density fraction $(f_\nu)$ and in $k/
k_{\rm NL}$, and add suitable counterterms to renormalize the theory. This
allows us to describe the contribution of short distances to long-distance
observables. Equivalently, we construct an effective Boltzmann equation where
we add additional terms whose coefficients renormalize the contribution from
short-distance physics. We argue that neutrinos with $k_{\rm fs}\gtrsim k_{\rm
NL}$ require an additional counterterm similar to the speed of sound ($c_s$)
for dark matter. We compute the one-loop total-matter power spectrum, and find
that it is roughly equal to $16f_\nu$ times the dark matter one for $k$'s
larger that the typical $k_{\rm fs}$. It is about half of that for smaller
$k$'s. The leading contribution results from the back-reaction of the neutrinos
on the dynamics of the dark matter. The counterterms contribute in a
hierarchical way: the leading ones can either be computed in terms of $c_s$, or
can be accounted for by shifting $c_s$ by an amount proportional to $f_\nu$.

exerts strictly more effort than his low-cost counterpart. The low-cost type

X-shaped structures reside in approximately the same local environments as
field galaxies; (2) the characteristic size of the X-shaped structures is about
2/3 of the bar size; (3) there is a correlation between the X-shaped structure

support the bar-driven scenario for the X-shaped structure formation.

in the extended Falicov-Kimball Model (EFKM). In this theory, charge and spin
(or orbital) degrees are treated as independent degrees of freedom, coupled by
a constraint. Using this formalism in single as well as cluster extension, we
capture the effective many body scales beyond conventional mean-field theory.
While the formation of exciton is favored by the interband hybridization $V$,
it is strongly influenced by the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. Beyond a
critical hybridization, there is a condensation of exciton, effectively giving
rise to a crossover from metal to an excitonic insulator phase. The system goes
from a metal to an excitonic insulating state, with a first order jump in the
excitonic order parameter. Moreover, the behavior of excitonic averages differs
from earlier results from Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. Low-$U$ results show
that excitonic order parameter ($\Delta$) is continuous across the transition
both for single as well as two-site approximation. The transition changes to
weakly first order in the intermediate $U$ for cluster case. On the other hand,
large $U$ limit shows a continuous transition for cluster but remains first
order in the single-site approximation. The slave rotor also indicates an
excitonic metallic region in both single and cluster cases, while there is an
orbital liquid in the insulating regime in the cluster theory. The $\Delta-V$
graph shows step-like behavior when both the bands have the same parity. For
cluster approximation, a second order to first order transition in $\Delta-V$
is obtained by tuning the hopping parameter of the localized band.

an inertia force due to the uniform acceleration acts as the restoring force
for the oscillation. We find that not only the difference in the inertia
between the two fluids separated by the interface but also the pressure at the
interface helps to drive the RTI because of a difference in the Lorenz factor
across the discontinuous surface of the jet. The dispersion relation indicates
that the linear growth rate of each mode becomes maximum when the Lorentz
factor of the jet is much larger than that of the cocoon and the pressure at
the jet interface is relativistic. By comparing the linear growth rates of the
RTI in the analytical model and the numerical simulations, the validity of our

  Quantum Logical Information Theory","Replacement adds much new material",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logical information theory is the quantitative version of the logic of
partitions just as logical probability theory is the quantitative version of
the dual Boolean logic of subsets. The resulting notion of information is about
distinctions, differences, and distinguishability, and is formalized using the
distinctions (`dits') of a partition (a pair of points distinguished by the
partition). All the definitions of simple, joint, conditional, and mutual
entropy of Shannon information theory are derived by a uniform transformation
from the corresponding definitions at the logical level. The purpose of this
paper is to give the direct generalization to quantum logical information
theory that similarly focuses on the pairs of eigenstates distinguished by an
observable, i.e., qudits of an observable. The fundamental theorem for quantum
logical entropy and measurement establishes a direct quantitative connection
between the increase in quantum logical entropy due to a projective measurement
and the eigenstates (cohered together in the pure superposition state being
measured) that are distinguished by the measurement (decohered in the
post-measurement mixed state). Both the classical and quantum versions of
logical entropy have simple interpretations as ""two-draw"" probabilities for
distinctions. The conclusion is that quantum logical entropy is the simple and
natural notion of information for quantum information theory focusing on the
distinguishing of quantum states.

Updated version",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among a set of
agents in a fair and efficient manner. An allocation is said to be fair if it
is envy-free up to one good (EF1), which means that each agent prefers its own
bundle over the bundle of any other agent up to the removal of one good. In
addition, an allocation is deemed efficient if it satisfies Pareto optimality
(PO). While each of these well-studied properties is easy to achieve
separately, achieving them together is far from obvious. Recently, Caragiannis
et al. (2016) established the surprising result that when agents have additive
valuations for the goods, there always exists an allocation that simultaneously
satisfies these two seemingly incompatible properties. Specifically, they
showed that an allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare (NSW)
objective is both EF1 and PO. However, the problem of maximizing NSW is
NP-hard. As a result, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm for
finding a fair and efficient allocation.
  In this paper, we bypass this barrier, and develop a pseudopolynomial time
algorithm for finding allocations that are EF1 and PO; in particular, when the
valuations are bounded, our algorithm finds such an allocation in polynomial
time. Furthermore, we establish a stronger existence result compared to
Caragiannis et al. (2016): For additive valuations, there always exists an
allocation that is EF1 and fractionally PO.
  Another contribution of our work is to show that our algorithm provides a
polynomial-time 1.45-approximation to the NSW objective. This improves upon the
best known approximation ratio for this problem (namely, the 2-approximation

here we present explicit axiomatizations for them and show that they are not

activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual
particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To
go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic
microgel particles ""in silico"". We exploit the self-assembly of a binary
mixture composed of tetravalent (crosslinkers) and bivalent (monomer beads)
patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully-bonded
networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel
configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model
complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our
assembly protocol we focus on a small microgel test-case and show that we can
reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining
sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated
assembly methodologies, e.g. in the case of networks generated from an
underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in
reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function
of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely-used
fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modelling of
microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their
elastic properties and effective interactions.

approach uses the Hamilton-Pontryagin variational principle, constrained by a
stochastic rolling condition, which we show is equivalent to the corresponding
stochastic Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. In the example of the rolling ball,
the stochasticity represents uncertainty in the observation and/or error in the
computational simulation of the angular velocity of rolling. The influence of
the stochasticity on the deterministically conserved quantities is investigated
both analytically and numerically. Our approach applies to a wide variety of
stochastic, nonholonomically constrained systems, because it preserves the
mathematical properties inherited from the variational principle.

on deep learning to reason about code similarities. Code fragments at
well-defined levels of granularity in a codebase can be sorted according to
their similarity to suspicious elements (i.e., code elements that contain
suspicious statements) and statements can be transformed by mapping
out-of-scope identifiers to similar identifiers in scope. We examined these new
search strategies for patch generation with respect to effectiveness from the
viewpoint of a software maintainer. Our comparative experiments were executed
on six open-source Java projects including 374 buggy program revisions and
consisted of 19,949 trials spanning 2,616 days of computation time.
DeepRepair's search strategy using code similarities generally found compilable
ingredients faster than the baseline, jGenProg, but this improvement neither
yielded test-adequate patches in fewer attempts (on average) nor found
significantly more patches than the baseline. Although the patch counts were
not statistically different, there were notable differences between the nature
of DeepRepair patches and baseline patches. The results demonstrate that our
learning-based approach finds patches that cannot be found by existing
redundancy-based repair techniques.

treatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed

extend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems

Hamiltonians are constructed by the use of the discrete phase operators and the
gauge-theoretical structure associated with them. It is shown how the
interaction Hamiltonians stipulated by the gauge symmetry generate the specific
patterns of entanglement that are desired for establishing microcanonical
ensembles. A discussion is also made about the interrelation between random
phases and perfect decoherence in the vanishing-interaction limit.

D 96, 084012 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevD.96.084012",,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We disclose a novel phase transition in black hole physics by investigating
thermodynamics of charged dilaton black holes in an extended phase space where
the charge of the black hole is regarded as a fixed quantity. Along with the
usual critical (second-order) as well as the first-order phase transitions in
charged black holes, we find that a finite jump in Gibbs free energy is
generated by dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant, $\alpha$, for a certain
range of pressure. This novel behavior indicates a small/large black hole
\emph{zeroth-order} phase transition in which the response functions of black
holes thermodynamics diverge e.g. isothermal compressibility. Such zeroth-order
transition separates the usual critical point and the standard first-order
transition curve. We show that increasing the dilaton parameter($\alpha$)
increases the zeroth-order portion of the transition curve. Additionally, we
find that the second-order (critical) phase transition exponents are unaffected
by the dilaton parameter, however, the condition of positive critical
temperature puts an upper bound on the dilaton parameter ($\alpha<1$).

of knowledge for deeper understanding of content where (i) large amounts of

vision, and still remains a challenging task. Modern variations of the
classical (purely bottom-up) approach, involve, e.g., some form of user
assistance (interactive segmentation) or ask for the simultaneous segmentation
of two or more images (co-segmentation). At an abstract level, all these
variants can be thought of as ""constrained"" versions of the original
formulation, whereby the segmentation process is guided by some external source
of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle this kind of
problems in a unified way. Our work is based on some properties of a family of
quadratic optimization problems related to dominant sets, a well-known
graph-theoretic notion of a cluster which generalizes the concept of a maximal
clique to edge-weighted graphs. In particular, we show that by properly
controlling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the
scale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of
dominant-set clusters that are constrained to contain predefined elements. In
particular, we shall focus on interactive segmentation and co-segmentation (in
both the unsupervised and the interactive versions). The proposed algorithm can
deal naturally with several type of constraints and input modality, including
scribbles, sloppy contours, and bounding boxes, and is able to robustly handle
noisy annotations on the part of the user. Experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our approach as compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms on a variety of natural images under several input conditions and
constraints.

  Networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1705.09851",,,,"q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are types of artificial neural networks
(ANNs) that are well suited to forecasting and sequence classification. They
have been applied extensively to forecasting univariate financial time series,
however their application to high frequency trading has not been previously
considered. This paper solves a sequence classification problem in which a
short sequence of observations of limit order book depths and market orders is
used to predict a next event price-flip. The capability to adjust quotes
according to this prediction reduces the likelihood of adverse price selection.
Our results demonstrate the ability of the RNN to capture the non-linear
relationship between the near-term price-flips and a spatio-temporal
representation of the limit order book. The RNN compares favorably with other
classifiers, including a linear Kalman filter, using S&P500 E-mini futures
level II data over the month of August 2016. Further results assess the effect
of retraining the RNN daily and the sensitivity of the performance to trade
latency.

and represents a novel class of self-synchronization processes in which
coupling between nonlinear oscillators is governed by energy and momentum

assembled in two steps from the g_i's, and so on. We describe the process of
modular disassembling of a Lie algebra into a unimodular and a non-unimodular
part. We then study two inverse questions: which Lie algebras can be assembled
from a given family of Lie algebras, and from which Lie algebras can a given
Lie algebra be assembled? We develop some basic assembling and disassembling
techniques that constitute the elements of a new approach to the general theory
of Lie algebras. The main result of our theory is that any finite-dimensional
Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or over R
can be assembled in a finite number of steps from two elementary constituents,
which we call dyons and triadons. Up to an abelian summand, a dyon is a Lie
algebra structure isomorphic to the non-abelian 2-dimensional Lie algebra,
while a triadon is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. As
an example, we describe constructions of classical Lie algebras from triadons.
