a basis for abstract interpretation of higher-order programming languages. As
it turns out, definitional interpreters, especially those written in monadic
style, can provide a nice basis for a wide variety of collecting semantics,
abstract interpretations, symbolic executions, and their intermixings.
  But the real insight of this story is a replaying of an insight from
Reynold's landmark paper, Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order
Programming Languages, in which he observes definitional interpreters enable
the defined-language to inherit properties of the defining-language. We show
the same holds true for definitional abstract interpreters. Remarkably, we
observe that abstract definitional interpreters can inherit the so-called
""pushdown control flow"" property, wherein function calls and returns are
precisely matched in the abstract semantics, simply by virtue of the function
call mechanism of the defining-language.
  The first approaches to achieve this property for higher-order languages
appeared within the last ten years, and have since been the subject of many
papers. These approaches start from a state-machine semantics and uniformly
involve significant technical engineering to recover the precision of pushdown
control flow. In contrast, starting from a definitional interpreter, the
pushdown control flow property is inherent in the meta-language and requires no
further technical mechanism to achieve.

measure the local bispectrum parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc.}$ in a range of
scales inaccessible to either CMB ($T$, $E$) bispectra or $T$-$\mu$
correlations. This is useful e.g. to test scale dependence of primordial
non-Gaussianity. Unfortunately, the primordial $y$-T signal is strongly
contaminated by the late-time correlation between the Integrated Sachs Wolfe
and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects. Moreover, SZ itself generates a large
noise contribution in the $y$-parameter map. We consider two original ways to
address these issues. In order to remove the bias due to the SZ-CMB temperature
coupling, while also adding new signal, we include in the analysis the
cross-correlation between $y$-distortions and CMB {\em polarization}. In order
to reduce the noise, we propose to clean the $y$-map by subtracting a SZ
template, reconstructed via cross-correlation with external tracers (CMB and
galaxy-lensing signals). We combine this SZ template subtraction with the
previously adopted solution of directly masking detected clusters. Our final
forecasts show that, using $y$-distortions, a PRISM-like survey can achieve
$1\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^\text{loc.}) = 300$, while an ideal experiment will achieve
$1\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^\text{loc.}) = 130$, with improvements of a factor $\sim 3$

The
notion of higher order directional derivatives was developed by Huang,

When Johnson and McCarthy established abelian functor calculus, they proved a
chain rule for functors that is analogous to the directional derivative chain
rule when $n = 1$. In joint work with Bauer, Johnson, and Riehl, we defined an
analogue of the iterated directional derivative and provided an inductive proof

the proof given in Bauer et al. as it relies only on properties of cross

  Without privacy concerns, minimum enclosing ball has a polynomial time

in fair division. Envy-free allocations do not always exist with indivisible

envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) property, which states that no player
prefers the bundle of another player following the removal of any single good,

solution to show existence of EFX allocations in several contexts, sometimes in
conjunction with Pareto optimality. For two players with valuations obeying a
mild assumption, one of these results provides stronger guarantees than the
currently deployed algorithm on Spliddit, a popular fair division website.
Unfortunately, finding the leximin solution can require exponential time. We
show that this is necessary by proving an exponential lower bound on the number
of value queries needed to identify an EFX allocation, even for two players
with identical valuations. We consider both additive and more general
valuations, and our work suggests that there is a rich landscape of problems to
explore in the fair division of indivisible goods with different classes of

used its direct focusing optics to produce detailed HXR microflare spectra and
images. The microflare exhibits HXR properties commonly observed in larger
flares, including a fast rise and more gradual decay, earlier peak time with
higher energy, spatial dimensions similar to the RHESSI microflares, and a
high-energy excess beyond an isothermal spectral component during the impulsive
phase. The microflare is small in emission measure, temperature, and energy,
though not in physical size; observations are consistent with an origin via the
interaction of at least two magnetic loops. We estimate the increase in thermal
energy at the time of the microflare to be 2.4x10^27 ergs. The observation

intermetallics follow a generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth relation between p_eff/p_s

the width of spin fluctuation spectrum in energy space, respectively. The same

the relation is not satisfied in a few ferromagnets with T_C/T_0 ~1.0 that

deviation from the theoretical relation may be due to several other effects not
included in the spin fluctuation theory such as the crystalline electric field
effect on the 5f electrons from ligand atoms. The value of the spontaneous
magnetic moment p_s increases linearly as a function of T_C/T_0 in the uranium

orbital and spin angular momenta. We compare experimental data for the

Chemoreception"" which examined how a bacterium can sense a chemical attractant
in the fluid surrounding it. At small scales the attractant molecules move by
Brownian motion and diffusive processes dominate. This example is the archetype
of diffusive signaling problems where an agent moves via a random walk until it
either strikes or eludes a target. Berg & Purcell modeled the target as a
sphere with a set of small circular targets (pores) that can capture a
diffusing agent. They argued that, in the limit of small radii and wide
spacing, each pore could be modeled independently as a circular pore on an
infinite plane. Using a known exact solution, they showed the capture rate to
be proportional to the combined perimeter of the pores. In this paper we study
how to improve this approximation by including inter-pore competition effects
and verify this result numerically for a finite collection of pores on a plane
or sphere. Asymptotically we have found the corrections to the Berg-Purcell
formula that account for enhancement of capture due to the curvature of the
spherical target and inhibition of capture due to spatial interactions of the
pores. Numerically we develop a spectral boundary element method for the
exterior mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary value problem. Our formulation
reduces the problem to a linear integral equation, specifically a Neumann to
Dirichlet map, which is supported only on the individual pores. The difficulty
is that both the kernel and the flux are singular, a notorious obstacle in such
problems. A judicious choice of singular boundary elements allows us to resolve
the flux singularity at the edge of the pore. In biological systems there can
be thousands of receptors whose radii are 0.1% the cell radius. Our numerics
resolve this realistic limit with an accuracy of roughly one part in 10^8.

densely sampled trajectories of moving objects widely available. We consider a
fundamental problem encountered when analysing such data: Given $n$ polygonal
curves $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, preprocess $S$ into a data structure that answers
queries with a query curve $q$ and radius $\rho$ for the curves of $S$ that
have \Frechet distance at most $\rho$ to $q$.
  We initiate a comprehensive analysis of the space/query-time trade-off for
this data structuring problem. Our lower bounds imply that any data structure
in the pointer model model that achieves $Q(n) + O(k)$ query time, where $k$ is
the output size, has to use roughly $\Omega\left((n/Q(n))^2\right)$ space in
the worst case, even if queries are mere points (for the discrete \Frechet
distance) or line segments (for the continuous \Frechet distance). More
importantly, we show that more complex queries and input curves lead to
additional logarithmic factors in the lower bound. Roughly speaking, the number
of logarithmic factors added is linear in the number of edges added to the
query and input curve complexity. This means that the space/query time
trade-off worsens by an exponential factor of input and query complexity. This
behaviour addresses an open question in the range searching literature: whether
it is possible to avoid the additional logarithmic factors in the space and
query time of a multilevel partition tree. We answer this question negatively.
  On the positive side, we show we can build data structures for the \Frechet
distance by using semialgebraic range searching. Our solution for the discrete
\Frechet distance is in line with the lower bound, as the number of levels in
the data structure is $O(t)$, where $t$ denotes the maximal number of vertices
of a curve. For the continuous \Frechet distance, the number of levels
increases to $O(t^2)$.

triage method. Conventional similarity-based clustering techniques, however,
cannot be immediately applied to Android malware analysis due to the excessive
use of third-party libraries in Android application development and the
widespread use of repackaging in malware development. We design and implement
an Android malware clustering system through iterative mining of malicious
payload and checking whether malware samples share the same version of
malicious payload. Our system utilizes a hierarchical clustering technique and
an efficient bit-vector format to represent Android apps. Experimental results
demonstrate that our clustering approach achieves precision of 0.90 and recall
of 0.75 for Android Genome malware dataset, and average precision of 0.98 and
recall of 0.96 with respect to manually verified ground-truth.

traditional pipelines for object segmentation and pose estimation using RGBD
data, but the performance of these DNN pipelines is directly tied to how
representative the training data is of the true data. Hence a key requirement
for employing these methods in practice is to have a large set of labeled data
for your specific robotic manipulation task, a requirement that is not
generally satisfied by existing datasets. In this paper we develop a pipeline
to rapidly generate high quality RGBD data with pixelwise labels and object
poses. We use an RGBD camera to collect video of a scene from multiple
viewpoints and leverage existing reconstruction techniques to produce a 3D
dense reconstruction. We label the 3D reconstruction using a human assisted
ICP-fitting of object meshes. By reprojecting the results of labeling the 3D
scene we can produce labels for each RGBD image of the scene. This pipeline
enabled us to collect over 1,000,000 labeled object instances in just a few
days. We use this dataset to answer questions related to how much training data
is required, and of what quality the data must be, to achieve high performance
from a DNN architecture.

vapor-liquid interface. In some systems, such as $n$-alkanes, this enhancement
is dramatic, and results in the formation of a crystalline layer at the free
interface even at temperatures slightly above the equilibrium bulk freezing
temperature. There are, however, systems in which the enhancement is purely
kinetic, and only involves faster nucleation at or near the interface. The
first, thermodynamic, type of surface freezing is easier to confirm in
experiments, requiring only the verification of the existence of crystalline
order at the interface. The second, kinetic, type of surface freezing is far
more difficult to prove experimentally. One material that is suspected of
undergoing the second type of surface freezing is liquid water. Despite strong
indications that the freezing of liquid water is kinetically enhanced at
vapor-liquid interfaces, the findings are far from conclusive, and the topic
remains controversial. In this perspective, we present a simple thermodynamic
framework to understand conceptually and distinguish these two types of surface
freezing. We then briefly survey fifteen years of experimental and
computational work aimed at elucidating the surface freezing conundrum in
water.

framework for modeling sparse and dense random graphs, short- and long-tailed
degree distributions, covariates, and a wide range of complex dependencies.
Special cases of ERGMs are generalized linear models (GLMs), Bernoulli random
graphs, $\beta$-models, $p_1$-models, and models related to Markov random
fields in spatial statistics and other areas of statistics. While widely used
in practice, questions have been raised about the theoretical properties of
ERGMs. These include concerns that some ERGMs are near-degenerate and that many
ERGMs are non-projective. To address them, careful attention must be paid to
model specifications and their underlying assumptions, and in which inferential
settings models are employed. As we discuss, near-degeneracy can affect
simplistic ERGMs lacking structure, but well-posed ERGMs with additional
structure can be well-behaved. Likewise, lack of projectivity can affect
non-likelihood-based inference, but likelihood-based inference does not require
projectivity. Here, we review well-posed ERGMs along with likelihood-based
inference. We first clarify the core statistical notions of ""sample"" and
""population"" in the ERGM framework, and separate the process that generates the
population graph from the observation process. We then review likelihood-based
inference in finite-, super-, and infinite-population scenarios. We conclude
with consistency results, and an application to human brain networks

asymptotic region - whose dynamics should be responsible for part of the `hair'

difficulty of the information problem: the problem's ties with the quantization
of gravity and subtle boundary dynamics as well as the multilayered techniques
required for its setup and study. We also comment on the implications of the
asymptotic symmetries for the present quantization framework.

$AdS_2$ that preserves all the isometries. It is described in terms of the
unitary irreducible representations, more specifically discrete series
representations, of $so(2,1)$. We write down symmetric differential
representations for the discrete series, and then map them to functions on the
Moyal-Weyl plane. The Moyal-Weyl plane has a large distance limit which can be
identified with the boundary of $ncAdS_2$. Killing vectors can be constructed
on $ncAdS_2$ which reduce to the $AdS_2$ Killing vectors near the boundary. We
therefore conclude that $ncAdS_2$ is asymptotically $AdS_2$, and so the

world applications in robotics and surveillance are related to this predictive
capability. Current methods address this problem by first anticipating visual
representations of future frames and then categorizing the anticipated
representations to actions. However, anticipation is based on a single past
frame's representation, which ignores the history trend. Besides, it can only
anticipate a fixed future time. We propose a Reinforced Encoder-Decoder (RED)
network for action anticipation. RED takes multiple history representations as
input and learns to anticipate a sequence of future representations. One
salient aspect of RED is that a reinforcement module is adopted to provide
sequence-level supervision; the reward function is designed to encourage the
system to make correct predictions as early as possible. We test RED on
TVSeries, THUMOS-14 and TV-Human-Interaction datasets for action anticipation
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.

Reynolds number is difficult to study but important because they are related to

typical fluctuations (the bulk part of an accumulative probability function)
and (ii) the measurement of rare fluctuations (the tail part of the probability
function) by employing dynamics where a feedback control of the Reynolds number
is implemented. We apply this method to a chaotic model of turbulent puffs
proposed by Barkley and confirm that the time-scale of turbulence decay
increases super-exponentially even for high Reynolds numbers up to Re = 2500,
where getting enough statistics by brute-force calculations is difficult. The
method uses a simple procedure of changing Reynolds number that can be applied
even to experiments.

collisions between axion stars and neutron stars generate the bursts. In this
paper, we propose a model of repeating FRBs which shows that they arise from
the several collisions between magnetized accretion disk of a black hole and an
axion star orbiting the black hole. There would be many axions stars condensing
as dark matter in an early stage galaxy so that such collisions arises
repeatedly. The radiations are emitted by coherent oscillations of electrons in
the accretion disk. The oscillations are caused by oscillating electric fields,
which are induced by axion stars under strong magnetic field $\sim
O(10^{11})$G. The emissions are terminated by the thermal fluctuations of the
electrons which result from the thermalization of the oscillation energies.
Although the radiations are monochromatic, the thermal Doppler effects broaden
the spectral lines; their spectra $S(\nu)$ are given by $S(\nu) \propto
\exp(-(\nu-\nu_c)^2/2(\delta\nu)^2)$ with the center frequency $\nu_c$. The
bandwidth $\delta\nu=\nu_c\sqrt{T_c/m_e}$ with electron mass $m_e$ is
determined by the critical temperature $T_c$ at which the thermal fluctuations
terminate the coherent emissions. The observed bandwidths
$(3\sim5)\times10^2$MHz are originated from the strong magnetic fields $\sim
O(10^{11})$G. With such strong magnetic fields, large amount of the burst
energies are produced. Various center frequencies $\nu_c$ of the bursts in the
repeating FRB 121102 come from the various rotation speeds in the disk which
make an intrinsic frequency of the bursts being Doppler shifted. The recent
observation showing an extreme magneto-ionic environment around the source of
FRB 121102 supports our model.

Coulomb potential. These Hamiltonians are singular and require the additional
definition in order for them to be treated as self-adjoint quantum-mechanical

generalized random walk, with the dynamics of the growing length $L(t)$
controlled by a drift term, $\mu(L)$, and a diffusive one, ${\cal D}(L)$. We
apply this interpretation to the one dimensional Ising model with a
ferromagnetic coupling constant decreasing exponentially on the scale $R$. In
the case of non conserved (Glauber) dynamics, both terms are present and their
balance depend on the interplay between $L(t)$ and $R$. In the case of
conserved (Kawasaki) dynamics, drift is negligible, but ${\cal D}(L)$ is
strongly dependent on $L$. The main pre-asymptotic regime displays a speeding
of coarsening for Glauber dynamics and a slowdown for Kawasaki dynamics. We
reason that a similar behaviour can be found in two dimensions.

  Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler Process in Ultra Intense Fields",,,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear Compton scattering (NCS) and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) process
are strongly multi-photon and highly nonlinear processes. In ultra intense
lasers (normalized field amplitude $a_0 \gg 1$), radiation formation length is
much shorter than a period and single NCS/NBW cannot be described as
scatterings of electrons dressing plane waves with $\gamma$ photons for what
they feel is a local constant crossed field. However, present theories in
constant crossed fields are hard to give some important quantum features due to
divergence problems, such as number of laser photons involved, instantaneous
angular distribution and detailed spectrum. As an alternative, present
understanding of single NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers includes several
classical and semi-quantum ideas such as forward emission, recoil reaction and
spectrum cutoff. We investigated multi-photon effects on NCS/NBW in ultra
intense lasers by extracting the number of laser photons involved in a single
process in ultra intense lasers from formulae of existing theories. New
features of single NCS in ultra intense lasers including fixed emission angle
to instantaneous electron momentum, instantaneous deflection of electron, and
disappearance of spectrum cutoff are deduced. Similar features of single NBW in
ultra intense lasers including non-vanishing emission angles to instantaneous
$\gamma$ photon momentum, disappearance of spectrum cutoff and appearance of
spectrum lower limit are also obtained. Simulations show that corresponding
signals of multi-photon effects are significant on $10$PW scale and stronger
lasers.

stability analysis of complete polynomial eigenproblems. These problems are
solved by applying any backward stable algorithm to a block Kronecker pencil,
such as the staircase algorithm for singular pencils or the QZ algorithm for
regular pencils. This stability analysis allows us to identify those block
Kronecker pencils that yield a computed complete eigenstructure which is
exactly that of a slightly perturbed matrix polynomial. The global backward
error analysis in this work presents for the first time the following key
properties: it is a rigurous analysis valid for finite perturbations (i.e., it
is not a first order analysis), it provides precise bounds, it is valid
simultaneously for a large class of linearizations, and it establishes a
framework that may be generalized to other classes of linearizations. These
features are related to the fact that block Kronecker pencils are a particular
case of the new family of ""strong block minimal bases pencils"", which are
robust under certain perturbations and, so, include certain perturbations of
block Kronecker pencils. We hope that this robustness property will allow us to
extend the results in this paper to other contexts.

crystallizes in the LiMgPdSn type structure with lattice parameter 6.14 \AA\ at

magnetization measurements reveal a ferrimagnetic transition near 710 K and a
coercive field of 100 Oe at 3 K. Very low moment and coercive field indicate
fully compensated ferrimagnetism in the alloy. Temperature coefficient of
resistivity is found to be negative, indicating a characteristic of
semiconducting nature. Absence of exponential dependence of resistivity on
temperature indicates a gapless/spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour.
Electronic and magnetic properties of CrVTiAl for three possible
crystallograpic configurations are studied theoretically. All the three
configurations are found to be different forms of semiconductors. Ground state
configuration is a fully compensated ferrimagnet with band gaps 0.58 eV and
0.30 eV for up and down spin bands respectively. The next higher energy
configuration is also ferrimagnetic, but has spin-gapless semiconducting
nature. The highest energy configuration corresponds to a non-magnetic gapless
semiconductor. The energy differences among these configurations are quite
small ($<$ 1 $\mathrm{mRy/atom}$) which hints that at finite temperatures, the
alloy exists in a disordered phase, which is a mixture of the three
configurations. By taking into account the theoretical and the experimental
findings, we conclude that CrVTiAl is a fully compensated ferrimagnet with
predominantly spin gap-less semiconductor nature.

when given query access to the graph.
  We consider the standard query model for general graphs via (1) degree
queries, (2) neighbor queries and (3) pair queries. Let $n$ denote the number
of vertices in the graph, $m$ the number of edges, and $C_k$ the number of
$k$-cliques. We design an algorithm that outputs a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation (with high probability) for $C_k$, whose
expected query complexity and running time are
$O\left(\frac{n}{C_k^{1/k}}+\frac{m^{k/2}}{C_k}\right)\poly(\log
n,1/\varepsilon,k)$.
  Hence, the complexity of the algorithm is sublinear in the size of the graph
for $C_k = \omega(m^{k/2-1})$. Furthermore, we prove a lower bound showing that
the query complexity of our algorithm is essentially optimal (up to the
dependence on $\log n$, $1/\varepsilon$ and $k$).
  The previous results in this vein are by Feige (SICOMP 06) and by Goldreich
and Ron (RSA 08) for edge counting ($k=2$) and by Eden et al. (FOCS 2015) for
triangle counting ($k=3$). Our result matches the complexities of these
results.
  The previous result by Eden et al. hinges on a certain amortization technique
that works only for triangle counting, and does not generalize for larger
cliques. We obtain a general algorithm that works for any $k\geq 3$ by
designing a procedure that samples each $k$-clique incident to a given set $S$
of vertices with approximately equal probability. The primary difficulty is in
finding cliques incident to purely high-degree vertices, since random sampling
within neighbors has a low success probability. This is achieved by an
algorithm that samples uniform random high degree vertices and a careful
tradeoff between estimating cliques incident purely to high-degree vertices and
those that include a low-degree vertex.

networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality (PSL). It occurs when the
simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or
genes is lethal, while the default of the functional reaction or gene in the
pair is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Based on a complex
systems approach and by using computational techniques on bacterial
genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the
functional PSL partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure
viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant
fraction of other interconnected reactions forming what we call a SL cluster.
Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of silent
coessential reactions, which band together to form backup systems, and of other
functional and silent reactions in the metabolic network. This strong overlap,
also detected at the level of genes, mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and
increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided
by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions
and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the
intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient
drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved
strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.

attachment graphs. Graphs with bounded arboricity have been studied extensively
in the past, in particular since for many problems they allow for much more
efficient algorithms and/or better approximation ratios.
  We present a tolerant tester in the sparse-graphs model. The sparse-graphs
model allows access to degree queries and neighbor queries, and the distance is
defined with respect to the actual number of edges. More specifically, our
algorithm distinguishes between graphs that are $\epsilon$-close to having
arboricity $\alpha$ and graphs that $c \cdot \epsilon$-far from having
arboricity $3\alpha$, where $c$ is an absolute small constant. The query
complexity and running time of the algorithm are
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}\cdot \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon} +
\frac{n\cdot \alpha}{m} \cdot

perpendicular to the IrO4 plane, and the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of

mapping the calculated total energy for different spin configurations onto a

from the single-ion anisotropy rather than the anisotropic interatomic spin
exchange. This compound has a large spin gap but very narrow spin-wave

  Path",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we address the problem of computing a sparse subgraph of a
weighted directed graph such that the exact distances from a designated source
vertex to all other vertices are preserved under bounded weight increment.
Finding a small sized subgraph that preserves distances between any pair of
vertices is a well studied problem. Since in the real world any network is
prone to failures, it is natural to study the fault tolerant version of the
above problem. Unfortunately, it turns out that there may not always exist such
a sparse subgraph even under single edge failure [Demetrescu \emph{et al.}
'08]. However in real applications it is not always the case that a link (edge)
in a network becomes completely faulty. Instead, it can happen that some links
become more congested which can easily be captured by increasing weight on the
corresponding edges. Thus it makes sense to try to construct a sparse distance
preserving subgraph under the above weight increment model. To the best of our
knowledge this problem has not been studied so far. In this paper we show that
given any weighted directed graph with $n$ vertices and a source vertex, one
can construct a subgraph that contains at most $e \cdot (k-1)!2^kn$ many edges
such that it preserves distances between the source and all other vertices as
long as the total weight increment is bounded by $k$ and we are allowed to have
only integer valued (can be negative) weight on each edge and also weight of an
edge can only be increased by some positive integer. Next we show a lower bound
of $c\cdot 2^kn$, for some constant $c \ge 5/4$, on the size of the subgraph.
We also argue that restriction of integer valued weight and integer valued
weight increment are actually essential by showing that if we remove any one of
these two restrictions we may need to store $\Omega(n^2)$ edges to preserve
distances.

  We first show that any such compression scheme must be {\em randomized}, if
it gains non-trivially from the prior $\mu$. This stands in contrast to the
symmetric case (when both the encoder and decoder know $\mu$), where the
Huffman code provides a near-optimal deterministic solution. On the other hand,
a rather simple argument shows that, when $|S|=k$, a random linear code
achieves near-optimal communication rate of about $k\cdot H(\mu)$ bits. Alas,
the resulting scheme has prohibitive decoding time: about ${N\choose k} \approx
(N/k)^k$.

model on the concatenation of both labeled and unlabeled data. While ASR
transcribes the unlabeled speech features, TTS attempts to reconstruct the
original speech waveform based on the text from ASR. In the opposite direction,
ASR also attempts to reconstruct the original text transcription given the
synthesized speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep
learning model that integrates human speech perception and production
behaviors. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
significantly improved the performance more than separate systems that were
only trained with labeled data.

adaptive importance sampling algorithms applied to diffusion processes. These
methods, referred to as Adaptive Biasing Potential methods, are designed to
efficiently sample the invariant distribution of the diffusion process, thanks
to the approximation of the associated free energy function (relative to a
reaction coordinate). The bias which is introduced in the dynamics is computed
adaptively; it depends on the past of the trajectory of the process through
some time-averages.
  We give a detailed and general construction of such methods. We prove the
consistency of the approach (almost sure convergence of well-chosen weighted
empirical probability distribution). We justify the efficiency thanks to
several qualitative and quantitative additional arguments. To prove these
results , we revisit and extend tools from stochastic approximation applied to
self-interacting diffusions, in an original context.

a straight path similar to the Resnet is cohered to directly transfer the

Study of the native structures of macromolecular complexes has been extremely

researchers to gain accesses to fully study and understand the macromolecular

structures from CECT is very difficult due to high degree of structural
complexity and practical imaging limitations. Specifically, we proposed a deep
learning based image classification approach for large-scale systematic
macromolecular structure separation from CECT data. However, our previous work
was only a very initial step towards exploration of the full potential of deep

reinforcing nowadays elastic energy harvesting/storage, nondestructive testing,

lower transmission losses and higher degree of freedom in transmission path.
Inspired by topological states of quantum matters, especially quantum spin Hall
effects (QSHEs) providing passive solutions of unique disorder-immune surface
states protected by underlying nontrivial topological invariants of the bulk,
thus solving severe performance trade-offs in experimentally realizable
topologically ordered states. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the first
elastic analogue of QSHE, by a concise phononic crystal plate with only
perforated holes. Strong elastic spin-orbit coupling is realized accompanied by
the first topologically-protected phononic circuits with both robustness and
negligible propagation loss overcoming many circuit- and system-level
performance limits induced by scattering. This elegant approach in a monolithic
substrate opens up the possibility of realizing topological materials for
phonons in both static and time-dependent regimes, can be immediately applied
to multifarious chip-scale devices with both topological protection and massive
integration, such as on-chip elastic wave-guiding, elastic splitter, elastic
resonator with high quality factor, and even (pseudo-)spin filter.

heavy resonance, referred to as true Higgs $H_T$, with mass around $750 \,
GeV$.
  We stress once again that within the Standard Model the true Higgs is the
unique possibility to implement the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the local
gauge symmetry by elementary, relativistic and strictly local scalar fields. We
discuss the most relevant decay modes of the $H_T$ boson and estimate they
partial decay widths and branching ratios. We discuss briefly the experimental
signatures of the $H_T$ Higgs boson and compare with the recent available LHC
data at $\sqrt{s} =13 \,TeV$. We find that the coupling of the $H_T$ Higgs
boson to fermions is strongly suppressed.
  We also compare our theoretical expectations in the so-called golden channel
to the data collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at $\sqrt{s} =13
\,TeV$ with an integrated luminosity of $36.1 \, fb^{-1}$ and $35.9 \, fb^{-1}$
respectively. We find that our theoretical expectations are in fair good
agreement with the experimental observations. Combining the data from both the
LHC Collaborations we obtain an evidence of the heavy Higgs boson in this
channel with an estimated statistical significance of more than three standard
deviations. Finally, we argue that, if the signal is real, by the end of the
Run 2 both the LHC experiments will reach in the golden channel a statistical
significance of about five standard deviations.

applying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal
description of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of
quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical
explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the
structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of Werner Heisenberg's

of a hierarchical Bayesian model with computationally efficient Krylov subspace
linear solver, has been shown to perform well for both superficial and deep
brain sources. However, a systematic study of its sensitivity and specificity
as a function of the activity location is still missing. We propose novel
statistical protocols to quantify the performance of MEG inverse solvers,
focusing in particular on their sensitivity and specificity in identifying
active brain regions. We use these protocols for a systematic study of the
sensitivity and specificity of the IAS MEG inverse solver, comparing the
performance with three standard inversion methods, wMNE, dSPM, and sLORETA. To
avoid the bias of anecdotal tests towards a particular algorithm, the proposed
protocols are Monte Carlo sampling based, generating an ensemble of activity
patches in each brain region identified in a given atlas. The sensitivity is
measured by how much, on average, the reconstructed activity is concentrated in
the brain region of the simulated active patch. The specificity analysis is
based on Bayes factors, interpreting the estimated current activity as data for
testing the hypothesis that the active brain region is correctly identified,
vs. the hypothesis of any erroneous attribution. The methodology allows the
presence of a single or several simultaneous activity regions, without assuming
the knowledge of the number of active regions. The testing protocols suggest
that the IAS solver performs well in terms of sensitivity and specificity both
with cortical and subcortical activity estimation.

all of its possible states, the number of which is exponential in the number of
entities composing the system. The strength of presence of each possible state
in the superposition, i.e., its probability of being observed, is represented
by its probability amplitude coefficient. The assumption that these
coefficients must be represented physically disjointly from each other, i.e.,
localistically, is nearly universal in the quantum theory/computing literature.
Alternatively, these coefficients can be represented using sparse distributed
representations (SDR), wherein each coefficient is represented by small subset
of an overall population of units, and the subsets can overlap. Specifically, I
consider an SDR model in which the overall population consists of Q WTA
clusters, each with K binary units. Each coefficient is represented by a set of
Q units, one per cluster. Thus, K^Q coefficients can be represented with KQ
units. Thus, the particular world state, X, whose coefficient's representation,
R(X), is the set of Q units active at time t has the max probability and the
probability of every other state, Y_i, at time t, is measured by R(Y_i)'s
intersection with R(X). Thus, R(X) simultaneously represents both the
particular state, X, and the probability distribution over all states. Thus,
set intersection may be used to classically implement quantum superposition. If
algorithms exist for which the time it takes to store (learn) new
representations and to find the closest-matching stored representation
(probabilistic inference) remains constant as additional representations are
stored, this meets the criterion of quantum computing. Such an algorithm has
already been described: it achieves this ""quantum speed-up"" without esoteric
hardware, and in fact, on a single-processor, classical (Von Neumann) computer.

the electronic structure as Co and Ir are isovalent. Our work suggests that
although the rigid band model of electronic structure along with Moira's model

phenomenological models for the DM interaction strength are not adequate to
