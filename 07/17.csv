  and Education",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is quite exceptional, if it ever happens, that a new conceptual domain be
built from scratch. Usually, it is developed and mastered in interaction, both
positive and negative, with other more operational existing domains. Few
reasoning mechanisms have been proposed to account for the interplay of
different conceptual domains and the transfer of information from one to
another. Analogical reasoning is one, blending is another. This paper presents
a new mechanism, called 'tunnel effect', that may explain, in part, how
scientists and students reason while constructing a new conceptual domain. One
experimental study with high school students and analyses from the history of
science, particularly about the birth of classical thermodynamics, provide
evidence and illustrate this mechanism. The knowledge organization, processes
and conditions for its appearance are detailed and put into the perspective of
a computational model. Specifically, we put forward the hypothesis that two
levels of knowledge, notional and conceptual, cooperate in the scientific
discovery process when a new conceptual domain is being built. The type of
conceptual learning that can be associated with tunnel effect is discussed and
a thorough comparison is made with analogical reasoning in order to underline
the main features of the new proposed mechanism.

It is shown that not only the existence of the extra dimensions itself but also
the pressure difference between the 3-dimensional hypersurface and the compact

gravity with the same behavior as baryonic matter. Furthermore, the relation
between the coupling constant of the higher-dimensional universe and the

contributing area $(\delta)$ [$P(A\geq \delta) \sim a \delta^{-\epsilon}$]. For
the smallest UDNs ($<2 \>\text{km}^2$), length-area scales linearly ($h\sim
1$), but power-law scaling emerges as the UDNs grow. While $P(A\geq \delta)$
plots for river networks are abruptly truncated, those for UDNs display
exponential tempering [$P(A\geq \delta) \>\text{=}\> a
\delta^{-\epsilon}\exp(-c\delta)$]. The tempering parameter $c$ decreases as
the UDNs grow, implying that the distribution evolves in time to resemble those

tends to be slightly larger than the range reported for river networks.
Differences in generative processes and engineering design constraints
contribute to observed differences in the evolution of UDNs and river networks,

particle-like properties. They can form lattices perpendicular to the magnetic
field and the orientation of these skyrmion lattices with respect to the
crystallographic lattice is governed by spin-orbit coupling. By performing
small angle neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the coupling
between the crystallographic and skyrmion lattices in both Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and
the archetype chiral magnet MnSi. The results reveal that the orientation of
the skyrmion lattice is primarily determined by the magnetic field direction
with respect to the crystallographic lattice. In addition, it is also
influenced by the magnetic history of the sample which can induce metastable
lattices. Kinetic measurements show that these metastable skyrmion lattices may
or may not relax to their equilibrium positions under macroscopic relaxation
times. Furthermore, multidomain lattices may form when two or more equivalent
crystallographic directions are favored by spin-orbit coupling and oriented
perpendicular to the magnetic field.

scatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies
also show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It is
possible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is
correlated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the
mean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extend
the analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting single
S\'{e}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recover
half-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lenses
according to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines for
that stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxy
size relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as $M_{h}(M_{*}) \propto
r_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\eta}(M_{*})$. We find that on average, our lens galaxies
have an $\eta = 0.42\pm0.12$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive dark
matter haloes. The $\eta$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies
(LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulations
suggests that, at a fixed $M_{*}$, satellite galaxies have a larger $\eta$ and
greater scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ relationship
compared to central galaxies.

expectation operator. As an example we consider the backward algorithm as it is
used in Bermudan product valuation, but the method is applicable in full
generality.
  The method relies on three simple properties: 1) a forward or backward
(automatic) differentiation of an algorithm containing a conditional
expectation operator results in a linear combination of the conditional
expectation operators; 2) the differential of an expectation is the expectation
of the differential $\frac{d}{dx} E(Y) = E(\frac{d}{dx}Y)$; 3) if we are only
interested in the expectation of the final result (as we are in all valuation
problems), we may use $E(A \cdot E(B\vert\mathcal{F})) = E(E(A\vert\mathcal{F})
\cdot B)$, i.e., instead of applying the (conditional) expectation operator to
a function of the underlying random variable (continuation values), it may be
applied to the adjoint differential. \end{enumerate}
  The methodology not only allows for a very clean and simple implementation,
but also offers the ability to use different conditional expectation estimators
in the valuation and the differentiation.

investigate this question we use population-based optimisation algorithms to
generate artificial surrogate training data for naive Bayes for regression. We
demonstrate that the generalisation performance of naive Bayes for regression
models is enhanced by training them on the artificial data as opposed to the
real data. These results are important for two reasons. Firstly, naive Bayes
models are simple and interpretable but frequently underperform compared to
more complex ""black box"" models, and therefore new methods of enhancing
accuracy are called for. Secondly, the idea of using the real training data
indirectly in the construction of the artificial training data, as opposed to
directly for model training, is a novel twist on the usual machine learning
paradigm.

requirement for development length ($L^*_{fd}=L/D_{h}$) and the pressure drop
in the entrance region of circular and parallel plate micro-channels have been
critically analysed for a large range of operating conditions ($10^{-2}\le
Re\le 10^{4}$, $10^{-4}\le Kn\le 0.2$ and $0\le C_2\le 0.5$). For this purpose,
the conventional Navier-Stokes equations have been numerically solved using the
finite volume method on non-staggered grid, while employing the second-order
velocity slip condition at the wall with $C_1=1$. The results indicate that
although the magnitude of local velocity slip at the wall is always greater
than that for the fully-developed section, the local wall shear stress,
particularly for higher $Kn$ and $C_2$, could be considerably lower than its
fully-developed value. This effect, which is more prominent for lower $Re$,
significantly affects the local and the fully-developed incremental pressure
drop number $K(x)$ and $K_{fd}$, respectively. As a result, depending upon the
operating condition, $K_{fd}$, as well as $K(x)$, could assume negative values.
This never reported observation implies that in the presence of enhanced
velocity slip at the wall, the pressure gradient in the developing region could
even be less than that in the fully-developed section. From simulated data, it
has been observed that both $L^*_{fd}$ and $K_{fd}$ are characterised by the
low and the high $Re$ asymptotes, using which, extremely accurate correlations
for them have been proposed for both geometries. Although owing to the complex
nature, no correlation could be derived for $K(x)$ and an exact knowledge of
$K(x)$ is necessary for evaluating the actual pressure drop for a duct length
$L^*<L^*_{fd}$, a method has been proposed that provides a conservative
estimate of the pressure drop for both $K_{fd}>0$ and $K_{fd}\le0$.

on use of certain `shifted equivalent sources' which enable FFT acceleration of
a Wood-anomaly-capable quasi-periodic Green function introduced recently (Bruno

strategy additionally incorporates an exponentially convergent shifted version
of the classical spectral series for the Green function. While the
computing-cost asymptotics depend on the asymptotic configuration assumed, the
computing costs rise at most linearly with the size of the problem for a number
of important rough-surface cases we consider. In practice, single-core runs in
computing times ranging from a fraction of a second to a few seconds suffice

the resulting ""hole"" in the overall linear spectral response. The Fano shape of
the hole encodes the incoherent lifetime as well as coherent mixing of the
localized excitations. For the disordered Ising magnet,

amplitude of the ac pump as well as a static external transverse field. The
zero-crossing of $q$ is associated with a dissipationless response at the drive
frequency, implying that the off-diagonal matrix element for the two-level
system also undergoes a zero-crossing. The identification of localized
two-level systems in a dense and disordered dipolar-coupled spin system

of this eigenvalue distinguishes between the cases where there is local
extinction and exponential growth. In this paper, we continue in this vein and
show that, when the number of types is finite, the lead eigenvalue gives the
precise almost sure rate of growth of each type. This result matches perfectly

However, one of the main obstacles to the research on video summarization is
the user subjectivity - users have various preferences over the summaries. The
subjectiveness causes at least two problems. First, no single video summarizer
fits all users unless it interacts with and adapts to the individual users.
Second, it is very challenging to evaluate the performance of a video
summarizer.
  To tackle the first problem, we explore the recently proposed query-focused
video summarization which introduces user preferences in the form of text
queries about the video into the summarization process. We propose a memory
network parameterized sequential determinantal point process in order to attend
the user query onto different video frames and shots. To address the second
challenge, we contend that a good evaluation metric for video summarization
should focus on the semantic information that humans can perceive rather than
the visual features or temporal overlaps. To this end, we collect dense
per-video-shot concept annotations, compile a new dataset, and suggest an
efficient evaluation method defined upon the concept annotations. We conduct
extensive experiments contrasting our video summarizer to existing ones and
present detailed analyses about the dataset and the new evaluation method.

internal gain in the range 10-100 depending on the bias voltage. The sensors
were tested pre-irradiation and post-irradiation with minimum ionizing particle
(MIPs) from a 90Sr based \b{eta}-source. The leakage current, internal gain and
the timing resolution were measured as a function of bias voltage at -20C and
-30C. The timing resolution was extracted from the time difference with a
second calibrated UFSD in coincidence, using the constant fraction method for
both. The dependence of the gain upon the irradiation fluence is consistent
with the concept of acceptor removal and the gain decreases from about 80
pre-irradiation to 7 after a fluence of 6e15 n/cm2. Consequently, the timing
resolution was found to deteriorate from 20 ps to 50 ps. The results indicate
that the most accurate time resolution is obtained at a value of the constant

varying with fluence, from 10% pre-radiation to 60% at the highest fluence. Key
changes to the pulse shape induced by irradiation, i.e. (i) a reduce

formation and long-term evolution of the Kepler-30 planetary system, detected
and announced in 2012 by the KEPLER team. We show that the Kepler-30 system
belongs to a particular class of very compact and quasi-resonant, yet long-term
stable planetary systems. We re-analyse the light curves of the host star
spanning Q1-Q17 quarters of the KEPLER mission. A huge variability of the
Transit Timing Variations (TTV) exceeding 2 days is induced by a massive Jovian
planet located between two Neptune-like companions. The innermost pair is near
to the 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and the outermost pair is close to
higher order MMRs, such as 17:7 and 7:3. Our re-analysis of photometric data
allows us to constrain, better than before, the orbital elements, planets'
radii and masses, which are $9.2 \pm 0.1$, $536 \pm 5$, and $23.7 \pm 1.3$
Earth masses for Kepler-30b, Kepler-30c and Kepler-30d, respectively. The
masses of the inner planets are determined within $\sim 1\%$ uncertainty. We
infer the internal structures of the Kepler-30 planets and their bulk densities
in a wide range from $ (0.19 \pm 0.01)$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$ for Kepler-30d,
$(0.96\pm0.15)$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$ for Kepler-30b, to $(1.71 \pm 0.13)$
g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$ for the Jovian planet Kepler-30c. We attempt to explain the
origin of this unique planetary system and a deviation of the orbits from exact
MMRs through the planetary migration scenario. We anticipate that the
Jupiter-like planet plays an important role in determining the present
dynamical state of this system.

systems with explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians. Within the multistate
Landau-Zener (MLZ) theory, however, there has been a successful alternative
approach to identify and solve complex time-dependent models. Here we compare
both methods by applying them to a new class of exactly solvable MLZ models.
This class contains systems with an arbitrary number $N\ge 4$ of interacting
states and shows a quickly growing with $N$ number of exact adiabatic energy
crossing points, which appear at different moments of time. At each $N$,
transition probabilities in these systems can be found analytically and exactly
but complexity and variety of solutions in this class also grow with $N$
quickly. We illustrate how common features of solvable MLZ systems appear from
quantum integrability and develop an approach to further classification of
solvable MLZ problems.

crust through the liquid nuclear matter interior to the quark regime at higher
densities. We focus in detail on the question of how quark matter appears in
neutron stars, and how it affects the equation of state. After discussing the
crust and liquid nuclear matter in the core we briefly review aspects of
microscopic quark physics relevant to neutron stars, and quark models of dense
matter based on the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio framework, in which gluonic processes
are replaced by effective quark interactions. We turn then to describing
equations of state useful for interpretation of both electromagnetic and
gravitational observations, reviewing the emerging picture of hadron-quark
continuity in which hadronic matter turns relatively smoothly, with at most
only a weak first order transition, into quark matter with increasing density.
We review construction of unified equations of state that interpolate between
the reasonably well understood nuclear matter regime at low densities and the
quark matter regime at higher densities. The utility of such interpolations is
driven by the present inability to calculate the dense matter equation of state
in QCD from first principles. As we review, the parameters of effective quark
models -- which have direct relevance to the more general structure of the QCD
phase diagram of dense and hot matter -- are constrained by neutron star mass
and radii measurements, in particular favoring large repulsive density-density
and attractive diquark pairing interactions. We describe the structure of
neutron stars constructed from the unified equations of states with crossover.
Lastly we present the current equations of state -- called ""QHC18"" for
quark-hadron crossover -- in a parametrized form practical for neutron star
modeling.

USA, and observes ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the Northern
hemisphere. At the highest energies, $E>10$~EeV, the shape of cosmic ray energy
spectrum may carry an imprint of the source density distribution along the line
of sight different in different directions of the sky. In this study, we search
for such directional variations in the shape of the energy spectrum using
events observed with the Telescope Array's surface detector. We divide the TA
field of view into two nearly equal-exposure regions: the ""on-source"" region
which we define as $\pm 30^\circ$ of the supergalactic plane containing mostly
nearby structures, and the complementary ""off-source"" region where the sources
are further away on average. We compare the UHECR spectra in these regions by
fitting them to the broken power law and comparing the resulting parameters. We
find that the off-source spectrum has an earlier break at highest energies. The
chance probability to obtain such or larger difference in statistically
equivalent distributions is estimated as $6.2\pm1.1\times10^{-4}$ ($3.2\sigma$)
by a Monte-Carlo simulation. The observed difference in spectra is in a
reasonable quantitative agreement with a simplified model that assumes that the
UHECR sources trace the galaxy distribution from the 2MRS catalogue, primary
particles are protons and the magnetic deflections can be neglected.

by the Brownian motion filtration including non-Markovian and
non-semimartingale state processes controlled by mutually singular measures.
The main result of this paper is the development of a concrete pathwise method
for characterizing and computing near-optimal controls for abstract controlled
Wiener functionals. The theory does not require ad hoc functional
differentiability assumptions on the value process and elipticity conditions on
the diffusion components. The analysis is pathwise over suitable finite
dimensional spaces and it is based on the weak differential structure
introduced by Le\~ao, Ohashi and Simas jointly with measurable selection
arguments. The theory is applied to stochastic control problems based on
path-dependent SDEs where both drift and possibly degenerated diffusion
components are controlled. Optimal control of drifts for path-dependent SDEs
driven by fractional Brownian motion is also discussed. We finally provide an
application in the context of financial mathematics. Namely, we construct
near-optimal controls in a non-Markovian portfolio optimization problem.

of central/satellite decomposition, halo environment, the cosmic web: \cluster,

there is a strong dependence of the luminosity- or mass-size relation on the
galaxy concentration, morphology, sSFR, and bulge fraction. Compared with
late-type (spiral) galaxies, there is a clear trend of smaller sizes and
steeper slope for early-type (elliptical) galaxies. Similarly, galaxies with
high bulge fraction have smaller sizes and steeper slope than those with low
bulge fraction. Fitting formula of the average luminosity- and mass-size
relations are provided for galaxies of these different intrinsic properties.
Examining galaxies in terms of their large scale environments, we find that the
mass-size relation has some weak dependence on the halo mass and
central/satellite segregation for galaxies within mass range $9.0\le \log
M_{\ast} \le 10.5$, where satellites or galaxies in more massive halos have
slightly smaller sizes than their counterparts. While the cosmic web and local

divided into two stages. In the first stage, which corresponds to the latent

same individuals cannot travel since they are seriously ill. Final size

However, in reaction-diffusion systems, in which the population is treated as a

discontinuous jump is found to be an artifact that occurs owing to an

are covariantized using dual field theories with either complex or real scalar

We argue that a full space-time covariance on a field theory side is dual to
local computations on the information theory side. We define a fully covariant
information-computation tensor and show that it must satisfy conservation
equations. Then we switch to a thermodynamic description and argue that the
(inverse of) space-time metric tensor is a conjugate thermodynamic variable to
the ensemble-averaged information-computation tensor. In the equilibrium the
entropy production vanishes and the metric is not dynamical, but away from
equilibrium the entropy production gives rise to an emergent dynamics of the
metric. This dynamics can be described by expanding the entropy production into
products of generalized forces (derivatives of metric) and conjugate fluxes.
Near equilibrium these fluxes are given by an Onsager tensor contracted with
generalized forces and on the grounds of time-reversal symmetry the Onsager
tensor is expected to be symmetric. We show that a particularly simple and
highly symmetric form of the Onsager tensor gives rise to the Einstein-Hilbert
term. This proves that general relativity is equivalent to a theory of
non-equilibrium (thermo)dynamics of the metric which is expected to break down
far away from equilibrium where the symmetries of the Onsager tensor are to be
broken.

predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph

naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the

handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are
hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation,
in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn
data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's
embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence,
they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification,

reduction, which selects a subset of equations with the aim of using them as
evolution equations for the unknown. If that tensor leads to a strongly
hyperbolic system we call it a hyperbolizer. There might exist many of them or
none.
  A question arises on whether a given system admits any hyperbolization at
all. To sort-out this issue, we look for a condition on the system, such that,
if it is satisfied, there is no hyperbolic reduction. To that purpose we look
at the singular value decomposition of the whole system and study certain one
parameter families ($\varepsilon $) of perturbations of the principal symbol.
We look for the perturbed singular values around the vanishing ones and show
that if they behave as $O\left( \varepsilon ^{l}\right) $, with $l\geq 2$, then
there does not exist any hyperbolizer. In addition, we further notice that the
validity or failure of this condition can be established in a simple and
invariant way.
  Finally we apply the theory to examples in physics, such as Force-Free
Electrodynamics in Euler potentials form and charged fluids with finite

using reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions such as: Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis (SETH), 3SUM and All-Pairs Shortest-Paths (APSP). According to
these assumptions, many graph theoretic problems do not admit truly
subquadratic algorithms, nor even truly subcubic algorithms (Williams and
Williams, FOCS 2010 and Abboud, Grandoni, Williams, SODA 2015). A central
technique used to tackle the difficulty of the above mentioned problems is
fixed-parameter algorithms for polynomial-time problems with polynomial

Abboud, Williams and Wang in SODA 2016 and continued by Husfeldt (IPEC 2016)

technique to clique-width, another important graph parameter, remained to be
done. In this paper we study several graph theoretic problems for which

some of its upper-bounds as parameters (split-width, modular-width and
$P\_4$-sparseness). We believe that our most important result is an ${\cal
O}(k^4 \cdot n + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum matching where $k$
is either the modular-width or the $P\_4$-sparseness. The latter generalizes
many algorithms that have been introduced so far for specific subclasses such
as cographs, $P\_4$-lite graphs, $P\_4$-extendible graphs and $P\_4$-tidy
graphs. Our algorithms are based on preprocessing methods using modular
decomposition, split decomposition and primeval decomposition. Thus they can
also be generalized to some graph classes with unbounded clique-width.

However, there are several assumptions that go into the construction of these

strategy that utilises this method can considerably simplify the problem and is
valid asymptotically, to have a rigorous and fair comparison we need to adopt a
more general approach. In this work we use a methodology based on Bayesian

the estimation of optical phases. We calculate the number of observations and
the minimum prior knowledge that are needed such that the Cram\'er-Rao bound is
a valid approximation. Since these requirements are state-dependent, the usual

the analysis is more carefully performed. These results have important
implications for the analysis of theory and experiments in quantum metrology.

establish a functional Bernstein-von Mises theorem, and perform thorough

observationally quantify the drift direction throughout its profile, and find
that the second component is the only one that exhibits ""bi-drifting"", meaning
that only second component moves in the direction opposite of the others. We
here present a model that shows that the observed bi-drifting phenomenon
follows from the insight that the discharging regions, i.e. sparks, do not
rotate around the magnetic axis per se, but rather around the point of electric
potential extremum at the polar cap: minimum in the pulsar case
($\mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \mathbf{B} < 0$) and maximum in the antipulsar case
($\mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \mathbf{B} > 0$). We show that a purely dipolar surface
magnetic field cannot exhibit bi-drifting behaviour, though certain non-dipolar
configurations can. We can distinguish two types of solutions, with relatively
low ($\sim 10^{12} \,{\rm G}$) and high ($\sim 10^{14} \,{\rm G}$) surface
magnetic fields. Depending on the strength of the surface magnetic field, the
radius of the curvature of magnetic field lines ranges from $10^{5} \,{\rm cm}$

first travel demand simulation model intended for an analysis period of one
week. However, the first version supported only an analysis period of one day.
This paper describes the lessons learned while extending the simulation period
from one day to one week. One important issue is ensuring realistic start times
of activities. Due to differences between the realized trip durations during
the simulation and the trip durations assumed when creating the activity
schedule, the realized activity schedule and the planned activity schedule may
deviate from each other at some point in time during simulation. A suitable
rescheduling strategy is needed to prevent this. Another issue is the different
behavior at weekends, when more joint activities take place than on weekdays,
resulting in an increased share of trips made using the mode car as passenger.
If a mode choice model that takes availability of ride-sharing opportunities
into account is used, it can be difficult to reproduce the correct modal split
without modeling explicitly these joint activities. When modeling travel demand
for a week, it is also important to account for infrequent long-distance trips.
While the share of these trips is low, the total number is not negligible. It
seems that these long-distance trips are not well covered by the destination
choice model used for the day-to-day trips, indicating the need for a
long-distance trip model of infrequent events.

provide an excellent laboratory in which to search for new physics: the
measurement of their properties tests the foundations of the standard model;
and they feature prominently in a variety of exotic signals. The coupling of

vector $(\pi/2,-\pi/2)$. It is also sensitive to next-next nearest neighbor and

limit. Irrespective of the shape of the confining potential, this sharp upper
bound can be achieved through a modification of the Laughlin function by
suitably arranged quasi-holes.

Mobile Byzantine failures to date: agents are moved arbitrarily by an
omniscient adversary from a server to another in order to deviate their
computation in an unforeseen manner. When a server is infected by an Byzantine
agent, it behaves arbitrarily until the adversary decides to move the agent to
another server. Previous approaches considered asynchronous servers with
synchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding impossibility results), and
synchronous servers with synchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding optimal
solutions for regular register implementation, even in the case where servers
and agents periods are decoupled). We consider the remaining open case of
synchronous servers with unsynchronized agents, that can move at their own
pace, and change their pace during the execution of the protocol. Most of our
findings relate to lower bounds, and characterizing the model parameters that
make the problem solvable. It turns out that unsynchronized mobile Byzantine
agent movements requires completely new proof arguments, that can be of
independent interest when studying other problems in this model. Additionally,
we propose a generic server-based algorithm that emulates a regular register in
this model, that is tight with respect to the number of mobile Byzantine agents
that can be tolerated. Our emulation spans two awareness models: servers with
and without self-diagnose mechanisms. In the first case servers are aware that
the mobile Byzantine agent has left and hence they can stop running the
protocol until they recover a correct state while in the second case, servers
are not aware of their faulty state and continue to run the protocol using an
incorrect local state.

intra-cluster medium (ICM) are not well understood. This paper introduces the
CHEmical Enrichment RGS Sample (CHEERS), which is a sample of 44 bright local
giant ellipticals, groups and clusters of galaxies observed with XMM-Newton.
This paper focuses on the abundance measurements of O and Fe using the
reflection grating spectrometer (RGS). The deep exposures and the size of the
sample allow us to quantify the intrinsic scatter and the systematic
uncertainties in the abundances using spectral modeling techniques. We report
the oxygen and iron abundances as measured with RGS in the core regions of all
objects in the sample. We do not find a significant trend of O/Fe as a function
of cluster temperature, but we do find an intrinsic scatter in the O and Fe
abundances from cluster to cluster. The level of systematic uncertainties in
the O/Fe ratio is estimated to be around 20-30%, while the systematic
uncertainties in the absolute O and Fe abundances can be as high as 50% in
extreme cases. We were able to identify and correct a systematic bias in the
oxygen abundance determination, which was due to an inaccuracy in the spectral
model. The lack of dependence of O/Fe on temperature suggests that the
enrichment of the ICM does not depend on cluster mass and that most of the
enrichment likely took place before the ICM was formed. We find that the
observed scatter in the O/Fe ratio is due to a combination of intrinsic scatter
in the source and systematic uncertainties in the spectral fitting, which we
are unable to disentangle. The astrophysical source of intrinsic scatter could
be due to differences in AGN activity and ongoing star formation in the BCG.
The systematic scatter is due to uncertainties in the spatial line broadening,
absorption column, multi-temperature structure and the thermal plasma models.

posed by three groups of scientists some 15 to 30 years ago: by Baeza-Yates,

connections to other, seemingly unrelated, problems, including hybrid
algorithms for on-line problems, and so-called contract algorithms.

associated with some EBs are also visible co-spatial to any QSEBs. We combine
H$\alpha$ and Ca II $8542$ \AA\ line scans at the solar limb with spectral and

Twenty one QSEBs were identified with average lifetimes, lengths, and widths
measured to be around $120$ s, $0.63$"", and $0.35$"", respectively. Three of
these QSEBs displayed clear repetitive flaring through their lifetimes,
comparable to the behaviour of EBs in Active Regions (ARs). Two QSEBs in this
sample occurred co-spatial with increased emission in SDO/AIA $1600$ \AA\ and
IRIS slit-jaw imager $1400$ \AA\ data, however, these intensity increases were
smaller than reported co-spatial to EBs. One QSEB was also sampled by the IRIS
slit during its lifetime, displaying increases in intensity in the Si IV $1393$

analogous to IRIS bursts (IBs). Using RADYN simulations, we are unable to
reproduce the observed QSEB H$\alpha$ and Ca II $8542$ \AA\ line profiles
leaving the question of the temperature stratification of QSEBs open. Our
results imply that some QSEBs could be heated to Transition Region

extended to the 2D case of $L_N$=$a(N$$-$1)-long and $L_{\cal N}$=$a$$({\cal

electron site-energy change from atom to atom in the direction parallel to
$\cal N$ axis by the amount of electric field parameter (efp) $\varepsilon

$\mu$-level in the chain spectrum gives birth to the $\mu$-subband of
field-independent levels due to the electron-transfer interaction in the
direction perpendicular to $E_e$. The level spacing and hence, the width of
$\mu$-subbands $E^0_{\rm bw}$, is dictated by the conductor length, the hopping
integral $t$, and by the lattice constant $a$. Another principal result is that
the levels, which are within the energy interval $0.5E^0_{\rm bw}$ on either
sides of the spectrum (that is the edge spectrum), correspond to the
delocalized states which are extended in the direction perpendicular to the
electric field. In this direction, the electron spectrum width $E^{\perp}_{\rm
bw}$ is larger by $E^0_{\rm bw}$ than the spectrum width in the field direction
$E^{\parallel}_{\rm bw}$. Several special cases of the interrelation between
the electron energy versus applied voltage are identified, when the spacing
between the $\mu$-subband centers is equal either to integer or fraction ($>1$)
portion of dimensionless $\varepsilon$. Otherwise, the level spacing is shown
to be irregular and, depending on $N$, $\cal N$, and $\varepsilon$, it can be
equal to any portion of $\varepsilon$. It is argued that one of straightforward
applications of the presented theory is the quantum-mechanical explanation of
Hall effect in two dimensions.

particles, which induces ultraviolet (UV) divergences that are cured by means
of dimensional regularization combined with a renormalization of the particle's

appearance of a non-local-in-time conservative tail effect at the 4PN order in
the Lagrangian. In turn this implies the appearance of infrared (IR) divergent
integrals which are also regularized by means of dimensional regularization. We
compute the Noetherian conserved energy and periastron advance for circular
orbits at 4PN order, paying special attention to the treatment of the non-local
terms. One ambiguity parameter remaining in the current formalism is determined
by comparing those quantities, expressed as functions of the orbital frequency,
with self-force results valid in the small mass ratio limit.

  arXiv:1702.02312",,,,"math.AC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $ K / k $ be a purely inseparable extension of characteristic $ p> 0 $
and of finite size. We recall that $K/k$ is modular if for every $n \in
\mathbb{N}$,$K^{p^n}$ and $k$ are $k\cap K^{p^ n}$-linearly disjoint. A natural
generalization of this notion is to say that $K/k$ is $lq$-modular if $K$ is
modular over a finite extension of $k$. Our main objective is to extend in
definite form the results and definitions of the $lq$-modularity that have
already been obtained in the case limited by the finiteness condition imposed
on $[k :k^p]$ in a rather general framework (framework of extensions of finite
size called also $q$-finite extensions).First, by means of invariants, we
characterize the $lq$-modularity of a $q$-finite extension. Next, we show that
any intersection of a $q$-finite extensions covering $k$ or $K$ preserves the
$lq$-modularity. We also prove that any $q$-finite extension $ K/k $ contains a
greater $lq$-modular and relatively perfect sub-extension. In particular, this
result is very useful for defining the modularity of order $i$ linked to a
$q$-finite extension $ K/k $.Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for $K/k$ to be $i$-modular. Certainly, the modularity level of $ K /
k $ never exceeds the sizeof $K/k$. Notably, we explicitly describe the
extension $K/k $ whose degree of modularity is the size of $ K / k $. In the
end, we examine a particular decomposition of $ K/k $ defined by inverse
chaining.

auctions where a seller interacts with a single strategic buyer that holds a
fixed private valuation for a good and seeks to maximize his cumulative
discounted surplus. For this setting, first, we propose a novel algorithm that
never decreases offered prices and has a tight strategic regret bound in
$\Theta(\log\log T)$ under some mild assumptions on the buyer surplus
discounting. This result closes the open research question on the existence of
a no-regret horizon-independent weakly consistent pricing. The proposed
algorithm is inspired by our observation that a double decrease of offered
prices in a weakly consistent algorithm is enough to cause a linear regret.
This motivates us to construct a novel transformation that maps a
right-consistent algorithm to a weakly consistent one that never decreases
offered prices.
  Second, we outperform the previously known strategic regret upper bound of
the algorithm PRRFES, where the improvement is achieved by means of a finer
constant factor $C$ of the principal term $C\log\log T$ in this upper bound.
Finally, we generalize results on strategic regret previously known for
geometric discounting of the buyer's surplus to discounting of other types,
namely: the optimality of the pricing PRRFES to the case of geometrically
concave decreasing discounting; and linear lower bound on the strategic regret
of a wide range of horizon-independent weakly consistent algorithms to the case
of arbitrary discounts.

of debate: is it produced by a rare jet-driven core-collapse supernova, or by a
normal supernova that is strongly shaped by its dense environment? Aiming to
uncover the explosion mechanism and origin of the asymmetric, centrally filled
X-ray morphology of W49B, we have performed spatially resolved X-ray
spectroscopy and a search for potential point sources. We report new candidate
point sources inside W49B. The Chandra X-ray spectra from W49B are
well-characterized by two-temperature gas components ($\sim 0.27$ keV +
0.6--2.2 keV). The hot component gas shows a large temperature gradient from
the northeast to the southwest and is over-ionized in most regions with
recombination timescales of 1--$10\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The Fe element
shows strong lateral distribution in the SNR east, while the distribution of
Si, S, Ar, Ca is relatively smooth and nearly axially symmetric. Asymmetric
Type-Ia explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf well-explains the
abundance ratios and metal distribution of W49B, whereas a jet-driven explosion
and normal core-collapse models fail to describe the abundance ratios and large
masses of iron-group elements. A model based on a multi-spot ignition of the
white dwarf can explain the observed high $M_{\rm Mn}/M_{\rm Cr}$ value
(0.8--2.2). The bar-like morphology is mainly due to a density enhancement in
the center, given the good spatial correlation between gas density and X-ray
brightness. The recombination ages and the Sedov age consistently suggest a
revised SNR age of 5--6 kyr. This study suggests that despite the presence of
candidate point sources projected within the boundary of this SNR, W49B is
likely a Type-Ia SNR, which suggests that Type-Ia supernovae can also result in
mixed-morphology SNRs.

of two planar-monopole antenna elements. It is found that isolation of more
than 25 dB can be achieved between two parallel monopole antenna elements. For
the low-frequency isolation, an efficient technique of bending the feed-line
and applying a new protruded ground is introduced. To increase isolation, a
design based on suppressing surface wave, near-field, and far-field coupling is
applied. The simulation and measurement results of the proposed antenna with
the good agreement are presented and show a bandwidth with S 11 < -10 dB, S 12
< -25 dB ranged from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz making the proposed antenna a good
candidate for UWB MIMO systems.

$O(\Delta^*+\log n)$ [Krishnan and Raghavachari, 2001] but the running time is

well-studied parallel randomized greedy MIS algorithm, thus answering the main
open question of Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA'12].
  The parallel/distributed randomized greedy Maximal Independent Set (MIS)
algorithm works as follows. An order of the vertices is chosen uniformly at
random. Then, in each round, all vertices that appear before their neighbors in
the order are added to the independent set and removed from the graph along
with their neighbors. The main question of interest is the number of rounds it
takes until the graph is empty. This algorithm has been studied since 1987,
initiated by Coppersmith, Raghavan, and Tompa [FOCS'87], and the previously
best known bounds were $O(\log n)$ rounds in expectation for
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs by Calkin and Frieze [Random Struc. \& Alg.

Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA'12].
  We prove a high probability upper bound of $O(\log n)$ on the round
complexity of this algorithm in general graphs, and that this bound is tight.

based on a hyperbolic field-space. In the previous work, it was shown that the
field-space angular momentum supported by the negative curvature modifies the
background dynamics and enhances fluctuations of the scalar fields
qualitatively, assuming that the inflationary background is almost de Sitter.
In this work, we confirm and extend the analysis based on the standard approach
of cosmological perturbation in multi-field inflation. At the background level,
to quantify the deviation from de Sitter, we introduce the slow-varying
parameters and show that steep potentials, which usually can not drive
inflation, can drive inflation. At the linear perturbation level, we obtain the
power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral
tilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that
hyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the
recent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent
of order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power
spectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane
inflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra
dimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively
heavy.

for prolate rotation, we report ten CALIFA galaxies in total that show evidence
for such a feature in their stellar kinematics. Prolate rotators correspond to
~9% of the volume-corrected sample of CALIFA ETGs, a fraction much higher than
previously reported. We find that prolate rotation is more common among the
most massive ETGs. We investigate the implications of these findings by
studying N-body merger simulations, and show that a prolate ETG with rotation
around its major axis could be the result of a major polar merger, with the
amplitude of prolate rotation depending on the initial bulge-to-total stellar
mass ratio of its progenitor galaxies. Additionally, we find that prolate ETGs
resulting from this formation scenario show a correlation between their stellar
line-of-sight velocity and higher order moment h_3, opposite to typical oblate
ETGs, as well as a double peak of their stellar velocity dispersion along their
minor axis. Finally, we investigate the origin of prolate rotation in polar
galaxy merger remnants. Our findings suggest that prolate rotation in massive
ETGs might be more common than previously expected, and can help towards a
better understanding of their dynamical structure and formation origin.

resource theory. However, rigorously defined or not, the notion of coherence or
decoherence has already been used by the community for decades since the advent
of quantum theory. Intuitively, the definitions of coherence and decoherence
should be the two sides of the same coin. Therefore, a natural question is
raised: how can the conventional decoherence processes, such as the von
Neumann-L\""{u}ders (projective) measurement postulation or partially dephasing
channels, fit into the bigger picture of the recently established theoretic
framework? Here we show that the state collapse rules of the von Neumann or
L\""{u}ders-type measurements, as special cases of genuinely incoherent
operations (GIO), are consistent with the resource theories of quantum
coherence. New hierarchical measures of coherence are proposed for the
L\""{u}ders-type measurement and their relationship with measurement-dependent
discord is addressed. Moreover, utilizing the fixed point theory for
$C^\ast$-algebra, we prove that GIO indeed represent a particular type of
partially dephasing (phase-damping) channels which have a matrix representation
based on the Schur product. By virtue of the Stinespring's dilation theorem,
the physical realizations of incoherent operations are investigated in detail
and we find that GIO in fact constitute the core of strictly incoherent
operations (SIO) and generally incoherent operations (IO) and the unspeakable
notion of coherence induced by GIO can be transferred to the theories of
speakable coherence by the corresponding permutation or relabeling operators.

distinguishable. We discuss how this behaviour can be understood in view of the
popular coupled-harmonic-oscillator model, while we also provide analytic

matryoshka-like single nanoparticles. Our analysis provides an answer to a so

  An interesting open question is whether this dynamics \emph{always} (i.e.,

We prove that, starting from \textit{any} initial configuration, the process
reaches a monochromatic configuration within $O(\log n)$ rounds, with high
probability. This bound turns out to be tight. Our analysis also shows that, if
the initial configuration has bias $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$, then the dynamics

occur through self-excitation of the arrival process. In this paper, we analyze
an infinite server queueing system in which the arrivals are driven by the
self-exciting Hawkes process and where service follows a phase-type
distribution or is deterministic. In the phase-type setting, we derive
differential equations for the moments and a partial differential equation for
the moment generating function; we also derive exact expressions for the
transient and steady-state mean, variance, and covariances. Furthermore, we
also derive exact expressions for the auto-covariance of the queue and provide
an expression for the cumulant moment generating function in terms of a single
ordinary differential equation. In the deterministic service setting, we
provide exact expressions for the first and second moments and the queue
auto-covariance. As motivation for our Hawkes queueing model, we demonstrate
its usefulness through two novel applications. These applications are trending

are given a set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $\mathcal{B}$ of balls from some
metric space, and a positive integer $U$ that represents the capacity of each
of the balls in $\mathcal{B}$. We would like to compute a subset $\mathcal{B}'
\subseteq \mathcal{B}$ of balls and assign each point in $P$ to some ball in
$\mathcal{B}$ that contains it, such that the number of points assigned to any
ball is at most $U$. The objective function that we would like to minimize is
the cardinality of $\mathcal{B}$.
  We consider this problem in arbitrary metric spaces as well as Euclidean
spaces of constant dimension. In the metric setting, even the uncapacitated
version of the problem is hard to approximate to within a logarithmic factor.
In the Euclidean setting, the best known approximation guarantee in dimensions
$3$ and higher is logarithmic in the number of points. Thus we focus on
obtaining ""bi-criteria"" approximations. In particular, we are allowed to expand
the balls in our solution by some factor, but optimal solutions do not have
that flexibility. Our main result is that allowing constant factor expansion of
the input balls suffices to obtain constant approximations for these problems.
In fact, in the Euclidean setting, only $(1+\epsilon)$ factor expansion is
sufficient for any $\epsilon > 0$, with the approximation factor being a
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. We obtain these results using a unified scheme for
rounding the natural LP relaxation; this scheme may be useful for other
capacitated covering problems. We also complement these bi-criteria
approximations by obtaining hardness of approximation results that shed light
on our understanding of these problems.

various techniques have been proposed. Search-based APR is one of the most
important categories among these techniques. Existing researches focus on the
design of effective mutation operators and searching algorithms to better find
the correct patch. Despite various efforts, the effectiveness of these
techniques are still limited by the search space explosion problem. One of the
key factors attribute to this problem is the quality of fault spaces as
reported by existing studies. This motivates us to study the importance of the
fault space to the success of finding a correct patch. Our empirical study aims
to answer three questions. Does the fault space significantly correlate with
the performance of search-based APR? If so, are there any indicative
measurements to approximate the accuracy of the fault space before applying
expensive APR techniques? Are there any automatic methods that can improve the
accuracy of the fault space? We observe that the accuracy of the fault space
affects the effectiveness and efficiency of search-based APR techniques, e.g.,
the failure rate of GenProg could be as high as $60\%$ when the real fix
location is ranked lower than 10 even though the correct patch is in the search
space. Besides, GenProg is able to find more correct patches and with fewer
trials when given a fault space with a higher accuracy. We also find that the
negative mutation coverage, which is designed in this study to measure the
capability of a test suite to kill the mutants created on the statements
executed by failing tests, is the most indicative measurement to estimate the
efficiency of search-based APR. Finally, we confirm that automated generated
test cases can help improve the accuracy of fault spaces, and further improve
the performance of search-based APR techniques.

  Intervention",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AI systems are increasingly applied to complex tasks that involve interaction
with humans. During training, such systems are potentially dangerous, as they
haven't yet learned to avoid actions that could cause serious harm. How can an
AI system explore and learn without making a single mistake that harms humans
or otherwise causes serious damage? For model-free reinforcement learning,
having a human ""in the loop"" and ready to intervene is currently the only way
to prevent all catastrophes. We formalize human intervention for RL and show
how to reduce the human labor required by training a supervised learner to
imitate the human's intervention decisions. We evaluate this scheme on Atari
games, with a Deep RL agent being overseen by a human for four hours. When the
class of catastrophes is simple, we are able to prevent all catastrophes
without affecting the agent's learning (whereas an RL baseline fails due to
catastrophic forgetting). However, this scheme is less successful when
catastrophes are more complex: it reduces but does not eliminate catastrophes
and the supervised learner fails on adversarial examples found by the agent.
Extrapolating to more challenging environments, we show that our implementation
would not scale (due to the infeasible amount of human labor required). We
outline extensions of the scheme that are necessary if we are to train
model-free agents without a single catastrophe.

  Collaborative Ranking","WWW 2018",,"10.1145/3178876.3186154",,"cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new neural architecture for collaborative ranking with
implicit feedback. Our model, LRML (\textit{Latent Relational Metric Learning})
is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More specifically,
instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose
to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. This helps
to alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learing
approaches. This enables not only better performance but also a greater extent
of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of
interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn
to attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The
memory-based attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction,
making the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this
can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation
for each user-item interaction. The proposed architecture demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML
outperforms other metric learning models by $6\%-7.5\%$ in terms of Hits@10 and
nDCG@10 on large datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens20M. Moreover,
qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able
to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and attribute information
despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the
ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit
datasets.

the weak modular product. We identify cases where isomorphism is tractable
using this approach, which we call Isomorphism via Biclique Enumeration (IvBE).
We find that IvBE is polynomial for bipartite $2K_2$-free graphs and
quasi-polynomial for families of bipartite graphs, where the largest induced
matching and largest induced crown graph grows slowly in $n$, that is,
$O(\mathrm{polylog }\, n)$. Furthermore, as expected a straightforward
corollary of Kozen's theorem and Lov\'{a}sz's sandwich theorem is if the weak
modular product between two graphs is perfect, then checking if the graphs are
isomorphic is polynomial in $n$. However, we show that for balanced, bipartite
graphs this is only true in a few trivial cases. In doing so we define a new
graph product on bipartite graphs, the very weak modular product. The results
pertaining to bicliques in bipartite graphs proved here may be of independent

extracts a specific modular representation of the input and thus performs blind

Alamos was developed for flash radiography of large hydrodynamic
experiments.Both axes now routinely produce radiographic source spot sizes
having full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 1 mm. The beam canonical
angular momentum contributes to spot size, and it is minimized by using a
shielded source of electrons.An ideal shielded source creates the beam in a
region where the axial magnetic field is zero, thus the canonical momentum is
also zero, since the beam is born with no mechanical angular momentum.It then
follows from Busch's theorem that the canonical angular momentum is minimized
at the target, at least in principal.
  In the DARHT accelerators, the axial magnetic field at the cathode is
minimized by using a solenoid with reverse polarity to cancel out whatever
solenoidal beam transport field exists there. This is imperfect in practice,
because of radial variation of the total field across the cathode surface,
solenoid misalignments, and long-term variability of solenoid fields for given
currents. This article quantifies the relative importance of canonical momentum
in determining the focal spot, and establishes a systematic methodology for
tuning the bucking coils for minimum spot size.

sampled at regular intervals is to be encoded so as to minimize distortion in

to enable real-time signaling; and should use no more power than the original
signal. The noise model we consider is an ""atomic norm"" convex relaxation of
the standard (discrete alphabet) Hamming-weight-bounded model: namely,
adversarial $\ell_1$-bounded. In the ""block coding"" (noncausal) setting, such
encoding is possible due to the existence of large almost-Euclidean sections in
$\ell_1$ spaces, a notion first studied in the work of Dvoretzky in 1961. Our
main result is that an analogous result is achievable even causally.
Equivalently, our work may be seen as a ""lower triangular"" version of $\ell_1$
Dvoretzky theorems. In terms of communication, the guarantees are expressed in
terms of certain time-weighted norms: the time-weighted $\ell_2$ norm imposed
on the decoder forces increasingly accurate reconstruction of the distant past
signal, while the time-weighted $\ell_1$ norm on the noise ensures vanishing
interference from distant past noise. Encoding is linear (hence easy to
implement in analog hardware). Decoding is performed by an LP analogous to
those used in compressed sensing.

reversible with respect to the target probability. Nevertheless, it is now
understood that the use of non-reversible Markov chains can be beneficial in
many contexts. In particular, the recently-proposed Bouncy Particle Sampler
leverages a continuous-time and non-reversible Markov process and empirically
shows state-of-the-art performances when used to explore certain probability
densities; however, its implementation typically requires the computation of
local upper bounds on the gradient of the log target density.
  We present the Discrete Bouncy Particle Sampler, a general algorithm based
upon a guided random walk, a partial refreshment of direction, and a
delayed-rejection step. We show that the Bouncy Particle Sampler can be
understood as a scaling limit of a special case of our algorithm. In contrast
to the Bouncy Particle Sampler, implementing the Discrete Bouncy Particle
Sampler only requires point-wise evaluation of the target density and its
gradient. We propose extensions of the basic algorithm for situations when the
exact gradient of the target density is not available. In a Gaussian setting,
we establish a scaling limit for the radial process as dimension increases to
infinity. We leverage this result to obtain the theoretical efficiency of the
Discrete Bouncy Particle Sampler as a function of the partial-refreshment
parameter, which leads to a simple and robust tuning criterion. A further
analysis in a more general setting suggests that this tuning criterion applies
more generally. Theoretical and empirical efficiency curves are then compared
for different targets and algorithm variations.

phonon, has attracted attentions since it may influence the thermal
conductivity and other properties of inner crust of neutron stars. However,
there are limited number of microscopic studies of the AB phonon where the
presence of clusters is explicitly taken into account.\\ Purpose: We intend to
clarify how the presence of clusters affects the AB phonon in order to obtain
microscopic information relevant to the coupling between the AB phonon and the
lattice phonon. \\ Methods: The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model and the
quasiparticle random-phase approximation formulated in a spherical Wigner-Seitz
cell are adopted to describe neutron superfluidity and associated collective
excitations. We perform systematic numerical calculations for dipole excitation
by varying the neutron chemical potential and the number of protons in a cell.
\\ Results:The model predicts systematic emergence of the dipole AB phonon
mode, which however exhibits strong suppression of phonon amplitude inside the
cluster. We find also that the phonon amplitude around the cluster surface
varies as the neutron density. At higher neutron densities the AB phonon mode
exhibits behaviour similar to the pygmy dipole resonance in neutron-rich
nuclei.\\ Conclusions: The dipole AB phonon mode does not penetrate into the
clusters. This suggests that the coupling between the AB phonon and the lattice
phonon may be weak.

features protruding beyond the front of its primary blast shock wave. They

of these pieces of shrapnel (A), located in the northeastern edge of the
remnant, is peculiar because its X-ray spectrum exhibits a high Si abundance,
in contrast to the other observed ejecta fragments, which show enhanced O, Ne,
and Mg abundances. We present the analysis of another fragment located opposite
to shrapnel A with respect to the center of the shell, in the southwestern
boundary of the remnant, named shrapnel G. We thoroughly analyzed a dedicated
XMM-Newton observation of shrapnel G by producing background-subtracted and
exposure-corrected maps in different energy ranges, which we complemented with
a spatially resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray emission. The fragment
presents a bowshock-like shape with its anti-apex pointing to the center of the
remnant. Its X-ray spectrum is best fit by a thermal plasma out of equilibrium
of ionization with low O and Fe, roughly solar Ne and Mg, and a significantly
high Si abundance, which is required to fit a very clear Si line at ~1.85 keV.
Its chemical composition and spectral properties are compatible with those of
shrapnel A, which is located on the opposite side of the remnant. As a
consequence of the nucleosynthesis, pieces of Si-rich shrapnel are expected to
originate in deeper layers of the progenitor star compared to ejecta with
lower-Z elements. A high velocity and density contrast with respect to the
surrounding ejecta are necessary to make shrapnel A and G overtake the forward
shock. The line connecting shrapnel A and G crosses almost exactly the
expansion center of the remnant, strongly suggesting a Si-rich jet-counterjet
structure, reminiscent of that observed in the young remnant Cas A.

three regions of A, corresponding to w < 0, w = 0, and w > 0. Additional models

sets derived from a Joss Waldvogel (JW) disdrometer and DSD data acquired near

stratiform events defined by rainfall rates that did not exceed 10 mm/h at any

not flagged as stratiform. The convective rainfall is further separated into
two groups: A-b pairs that fall to the left of the stratiform pairs and pairs

currently exists for deriving a PID controller (or any other type of
controller, for that matter) with safety and performance guarantees for such a
general class of systems. In particular, we consider hybrid systems with
nonlinear dynamics (Lipschitz-continuous ordinary differential equations) and
random parameters, and we synthesize PID controllers such that the resulting
closed-loop systems satisfy safety and performance constraints given as
probabilistic bounded reachability properties. Our technique leverages SMT
solvers over the reals and nonlinear differential equations to provide formal
guarantees that the synthesized controllers satisfy such properties. These
controllers are also robust by design since they minimize the probability of
reaching an unsafe state in the presence of random disturbances. We apply our
approach to the problem of insulin regulation for type 1 diabetes, synthesizing
controllers with robust responses to large random meal disturbances, thereby
enabling them to maintain blood glucose levels within healthy, safe ranges.

of the large coefficients towards zero. A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a
model-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the
selected support. In this work we formalize the notion of refitting and provide
oracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of
the most widely used refitting techniques which is based on Least-Squares may
bring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator
might be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises
from the fact that the Least-Squares refitting considers only the support of
the Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this
end we define a sign consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure,
preserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle
inequalities for such estimators. Finally, we consider special refitting
strategies: Bregman Lasso and Boosted Lasso. Bregman Lasso has a fruitful
property to converge to the Sign-Least-Squares refitting (Least-Squares with
sign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We
additionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal
design, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method. Boosted
Lasso, in contrast, considers information about magnitudes of the first Lasso
step and allows to develop better oracle rates for prediction. Finally, we
conduct an extensive numerical study to show advantages of one approach over
others in different synthetic and semi-real scenarios.

We derive molecular gas reservoirs of (1-3)x10^10 M_sun in the quasar hosts,
i.e. approximately only 10 times the mass of their central supermassive black
holes. The extrapolated [CII]-to-CO(1-0) luminosity ratio is 2500-4200,
consistent with measurements in galaxies at lower redshift. The detection of

where the goal is to augment a tree with a minimum cost set of edges such that
the graph becomes two edge connected. First we show that in weighted TAP, we
can restrict our attention to trees which are binary and where all the non-tree
edges go between two leaves of the tree. We then give two different top-down
coloring algorithms. Both algorithms differ from known techniques for a
3/2-approximation in unweighted TAP and current attempts to reach a
3/2-approximation for weighted TAP.
  The first algorithm we describe always gives a 2-approximation for any
feasible fractional solution to the natural edge cover LP. When the fractional
solution is such that all the edges with non-zero weight are at least $\alpha$,
then this algorithm achieves a $2/(1+\alpha)$-approximation. We propose a new
conjecture on extreme points of LP relaxations for the problem, which if true,
will lead to a constructive proof of an integrality gap of at most 3/2 for
weighted TAP. In the second algorithm, we introduce simple valid constraints to
the edge cover LP. In this algorithm, we focus on deficient edges, edges
covered to an extent less than 4/3 in the fractional solution. We show that for
fractional feasible solutions, deficient edges occur in node-disjoint paths in
the tree. When the number of such paths is at most two, we give a top-down
coloring algorithm which decomposes 3/2 times the fractional solution into a
convex combination of integer solutions. We believe our algorithms will be
useful in eventually resolving the integrality gap of linear programming
formulations for TAP.
  We also investigate a variant of TAP where each edge in the solution must be
covered by a cycle of length three. We give a $\Theta(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for this problem in the weighted case and a 4-approximation in the
unweighted case.

screening length parameter, $L_{\rm res}$, proportional to the inverse of the
local temperature in the plasma, estimating a range for the value of the
proportionality constant via comparing weakly coupled QCD calculations and
holographic calculations appropriate in strongly coupled plasma. We then modify
the hybrid model so that when a parton in a jet shower splits, its two
offspring are initially treated as unresolved, and are only treated as two
separate partons losing energy independently after they are separated by a
distance $L_{\rm res}$. This modification delays the quenching of partons with
intermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final
state with $p_T$ in the several GeV range. We analyze the consequences of
different choices for the value of the resolution length, $L_{\rm res}$, and
demonstrate that introducing a nonzero $L_{\rm res}$ results in modifications
to the jet shapes and jet fragmentations functions, as it makes it more
probable for particles carrying a small fraction of the jet energy at larger
angles from the jet axis to survive their passage through the quark-gluon
plasma. These effects are, however, small in magnitude, something that we
confirm via checking for effects on missing-$p_T$ observables.

automatic image enhancement. Traditional image enhancement frameworks typically
involve training models in a fully-supervised manner, which require expensive
annotations in the form of aligned image pairs. In contrast to these
approaches, our proposed EnhanceGAN only requires weak supervision (binary
labels on image aesthetic quality) and is able to learn enhancement operators
for the task of aesthetic-based image enhancement. In particular, we show the
effectiveness of a piecewise color enhancement module trained with weak
supervision, and extend the proposed EnhanceGAN framework to learning a deep
filtering-based aesthetic enhancer. The full differentiability of our image
enhancement operators enables the training of EnhanceGAN in an end-to-end
manner. We further demonstrate the capability of EnhanceGAN in learning
aesthetic-based image cropping without any groundtruth cropping pairs. Our
weakly-supervised EnhanceGAN reports competitive quantitative results on
aesthetic-based color enhancement as well as automatic image cropping, and a
user study confirms that our image enhancement results are on par with or even
preferred over professional enhancement.

This method offers the highest sensitivity for frequencies ranging from a few

Multi-granular Acoustic Tokenizer (MAT) was proposed for automatic discovery of
multiple sets of acoustic tokens from the given corpus. Each acoustic token set
is specified by a set of hyperparameters describing the model configuration.
These different sets of acoustic tokens carry different characteristics for the

multiple sets of token labels are then used as the targets of a Multi-target
Deep Neural Network (MDNN) trained on frame-level acoustic features. Bottleneck
features extracted from the MDNN are then used as the feedback input to the MAT
and the MDNN itself in the next iteration. The multi-granular acoustic token
sets and the frame-level speech features can be iteratively optimized in the
iterative deep learning framework. We call this framework the Multi-granular
Acoustic Tokenizing Deep Neural Network (MATDNN). The results were evaluated
using the metrics and corpora defined in the Zero Resource Speech Challenge

explores the implementation of weight matrices in neuromemristive systems via

for the range and distribution of weights in the current-mode design, it is
shown that any weight matrix based on voltage-mode crossbars can be mapped to a

a modified gradient descent rule is derived for the current-mode design that

of trained weight distributions reveals that current-mode and voltage-mode

both our understanding of how neurons process information to achieve biological

Overturning our fundamental assumptions of how the brain works, the recent
exploration of astrocytes is revealing that these long-neglected brain cells
dynamically regulate learning by interacting with neuronal activity at the
synaptic level. Following recent experimental evidence, we designed an
associative, Hopfield-type, neuronal-astrocytic network and analyzed the
dynamics of the interaction between neurons and astrocytes. We show that
astrocytes were sufficient to trigger transitions between learned memories in
the neuronal component of the network. Further, we mathematically derived the
timing of the transitions that was governed by the dynamics of the
calcium-dependent slow-currents in the astrocytic processes. Overall, we
provide a brain-morphic mechanism for sequence learning that is inspired by,
and aligns with, recent experimental findings. To evaluate our model, we
emulated astrocytic atrophy and showed that memory recall becomes significantly
impaired after a critical point of affected astrocytes was reached. This
brain-inspired and brain-validated approach supports our ongoing efforts to
incorporate non-neuronal computing elements in neuromorphic information

the social choice problem consists in deciding whether there exists a socially
acceptable rule that aggregates the individual preferences of the agents into a
social one. We analyze this problem for sets of alternatives defined by
equality constraints and obtain a solution that, in sharp contrast to the
classical ones, is expressed in an elementary language and ultimately reduces
the social choice problem to a standard constrained optimization problem.
  By considering a toy example we shall be able to interpret this general
result in terms of the rationality (in the sense of Economics) of the design of
the set of alternatives rather than, surprisingly, that of the agents involved
in the actual social choice problem.

to get this objective, we will show that, under special conditions, each one of
these algebras is isometrically isomorphic to some space of continuous
functions defined over a compact set. Then, we will identify such compact

will allow us to define a measure which is known as spectral measure. As a

synchronized and desynchronized subpopulations of a network of coupled
oscillators coexist and the appearance of such anomalous behavior has strong
connection to diverse neuronal developments. Most of the previous studies on
chimera states are not extensively done in two-dimensional ensembles of coupled
oscillators by taking neuronal systems with nonlinear coupling function into
account while such ensembles of oscillators are more realistic from a
neurobiological point of view. In this paper, we report the emergence and
existence of chimera states by considering locally coupled two-dimensional
networks of identical oscillators where each node is interacting through
nonlinear coupling function. This is in contrast with the existence of chimera
states in two-dimensional nonlocally coupled oscillators with rectangular
kernel in the coupling function. We find that the presence of nonlinearity in
the coupling function plays a key role to produce chimera states in
two-dimensional locally coupled oscillators. We analytically verify explicitly
in the case of a network of coupled Stuart - Landau oscillators in two
dimensions that the obtained results using Ott-Antonsen approach and our
analytical finding very well matches with the numerical results. Next, we
consider another type of important nonlinear coupling function which exists in
neuronal systems, namely chemical synaptic function, through which the
nearest-neighbor (locally coupled) neurons interact with each other. In
numerical simulations, we consider two paradigmatic neuronal oscillators,
namely Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model and Rulkov map for each node which exhibit
bursting dynamics. The existence of chimera states is confirmed by
instantaneous angular frequency, order parameter and strength of incoherence.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for indoor collaborative and cooperative
networking. A number of works have presentedchallenges for wireless networking
with multiple UAVs such as bandwidth efficiency, security and environment
amongst others. Due to this fact, there is a need to secure information and
data in UAV ad hoc network (FANETs) using a secure transmission medium that
guarantees bandwidth efficiency such as the light fidelity (Li-Fi). Li-Fi
enables data transmission using visible light through a light emitting diode
(LED) and is chosen as against wireless fidelity (Wi- Fi) because it is more
ideal for high density wireless data coverage in confined areas, better at
addressing radio interference related issues and provides better bandwidth,
efficiency, availability and security. Thus, using Light Fidelity as a means of
communication necessitates the need to develop a Link Velocity Based
Connectivity Algorithm (LVCA) that governs communication between the UAVs and
the Li-Fi transmitter and receiver circuits for collaborative and cooperative
networking.

a neutrally stable thin cylindrical shell driven by a multiparameter
piezoelectric actuation. The shell is obtained by plastically deforming an
initially flat copper disk, so as to induce large isotropic and almost uniform
inelastic curvatures. Following the plastic deformation, in a perfectly
isotropic system, the shell is theoretically neutrally stable, owning a
continuous manifold of stable cylindrical shapes corresponding to the rotation
of the axis of maximal curvature. Small imperfections render the actual
structure bistable, giving preferred orientations. A three-parameter
piezoelectric actuation, exerted through micro-fiber-composite actuators,
allows us to add a small perturbation to the plastic inelastic curvature and to
control the direction of maximal curvature. This actuation law is designed
through a geometrical analogy based on a fully non-linear inextensible
uniform-curvature shell model. We report on the fabrication, identification,
and experimental testing of a prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of
the piezoelectric actuators in controlling its shape. The resulting motion is
an apparent rotation of the shell, controlled by the voltages as in a
""gear-less motor"", which is, in reality, a precession of the axis of principal
curvature.

of the electron-beam in the quantum regime, i.e. quantum efficiency parameter
eta > 0.1$. We show that the evolution of the variance may be used as a direct
measure of the quantum stochasticity of the radiation reaction and determine
the parameter regime where this is observable. For example, stochastic emission
results in a 25% increase in the standard deviation of the energy spectrum of a
GeV electron beam, 1 fs after it collides with a laser pulse of intensity 10^21

periodic static potential, typically asymmetric under space inversion, with a
local driving that breaks time-reversal invariance, and are intended to model
metal or semiconductor surfaces irradiated by a collimated laser beam. Their
crucial feature is irregular driven scattering between asymptotic regions
supporting periodic (as opposed to free) motion. With all binary
spatio-temporal symmetries broken, scattering in punchets typically generates
directed currents. We here study the underlying nonlinear transport mechanisms,
from chaotic scattering to the parameter dependence of the currents, in three
types of Hamiltonian models, (i) with spatially periodic potentials where only
in the driven scattering region, spatial and temporal symmetries are broken,
and (ii), spatially asymmetric (ratchet) potentials with a driving that only
breaks time-reversal invariance. As more realistic models of laser-irradiated
surfaces, we consider (iii), a driving in the form of a running wave confined
to a compact region by a static envelope. In this case, the induced current can
even run against the direction of wave propagation, drastically evidencing of
its nonlinear nature. Quantizing punchets is indicated as a viable research
perspective.

Analysis of

functions that primarily address a global network topology. As a result,
networks that are similar in terms of global topological properties may differ
noticeably at a local level. In the context of power grids, this phenomenon of
the impact of local structure has been recently documented in fragility
analysis and power system classification. At the same time, most studies of
power system networks still tend to focus on global topological measures of
power grids, often failing to unveil hidden mechanisms behind vulnerability of
real power systems and their dynamic response to malfunctions. In this paper a
pilot study on motif-based analysis of power grid robustness under various
types of intentional attacks is presented, with the goal of shedding light on
local dynamics and vulnerability of power systems.
