once and cannot be concatenated. In this paper, we study the notions of a
spanning Euler tour and a spanning Euler family, that is, an Euler tour
(family) that also traverses each vertex of the hypergraph at least once. We
examine necessary and sufficient conditions for a hypergraph to admit a
spanning Euler family, most notably, when the hypergraph possesses a vertex cut
consisting of vertices of degree two. Moreover, we characterise hypergraphs
with a vertex cut of cardinality at most two that admit a spanning Euler tour
(family). This result enables us to reduce the problem of existence of a
spanning Euler tour (which is NP-complete), as well as the problem of a
spanning Euler family, to smaller hypergraphs.

operator of the latter follows a known non-Markovian master equation with a
highly non-trivial bath correlation function that we determine and study in
detail. The corresponding damping rate and frequency shift of the particle
oscillations can be read off. We are able to identify a Quantum Landau
criterion for harmonically trapped particles in a superfluid environment: for
frequencies $\omega$ well below the chemical potential, the damping rate is
strongly suppressed by a power law $\omega^4$. This criterion can be seen as
emerging from the classical Landau criterion involving a critical velocity
combined with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for the localized wave packet
of the quantum particle. Furthermore, due to the finite size of the Bose gas,
after some time we observe memory effects and thus non-Markovian dynamics of
the quantum oscillator.

challenge in the real-time systems community. In this paper, we make a case
that a fundamental problem that prevents efficient and predictable real-time
computing on multicore is the lack of a proper memory abstraction to express
memory criticality, which cuts across various layers of the system: the
application, OS, and hardware. We, therefore, propose a new holistic resource
management approach driven by a new memory abstraction, which we call
Deterministic Memory. The key characteristic of deterministic memory is that
the platform - the OS and hardware - guarantees small and tightly bounded
worst-case memory access timing. In contrast, we call the conventional memory
abstraction as best-effort memory in which only highly pessimistic worst-case
bounds can be achieved. We propose to utilize both abstractions to achieve high
time predictability but without significantly sacrificing performance. We
present deterministic memory-aware OS and architecture designs, including
OS-level page allocator, hardware-level cache, and DRAM controller designs. We
implement the proposed OS and architecture extensions on Linux and gem5
simulator. Our evaluation results, using a set of synthetic and real-world
benchmarks, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

ARPES data reveal several puzzles: what is the origin of shallow and the so
called ""replica"" bands near M-point and why the hole-like Fermi surfaces near
$\Gamma$-point are absent. Our extensive LDA+DMFT calculations show that
correlation effects on Fe-3d states can almost quantitatively reproduce rather
complicated band structure, which is observed in ARPES, in close vicinity of
the Fermi level for FeSe/STO and K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$. Rather unusual
shallow electron-like bands around the M(X)-point in the Brillouin zone are
well reproduced. However, in FeSe/STO correlation effects are apparently
insufficient to eliminate the hole-like Fermi surfaces around the
$\Gamma$-point, which are not observed in most ARPES experiments. Detailed
analysis of the theoretical and experimental quasiparticle bands with respect
to their origin and orbital composition is performed. It is shown that for
FeSe/STO system the LDA calculated Fe-3d$_{xy}$ band, renormalized by
electronic correlations within DMFT gives the quasiparticle band almost exactly
in the energy region of the experimentally observed ""replica"" quasiparticle
band at the M-point. For the case of K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ most bands
observed in ARPES can also be understood as correlation renormalized Fe-3d LDA
calculated bands, with overall semi-quantitative agreement with our LDA+DMFT
calculations. Thus the shallow bands near the M-point are common feature for
FeSe-based systems, not just FeSe/STO. We also present some simple estimates of
""forward scattering"" electron-optical phonon interaction at FeSe/STO interface,
showing that it is apparently irrelevant for the formation of ""replica"" band in
this system and significant increase of superconducting $T_c$.

by neutrino mass. In the latter extension, the charged leptons are coupled to
the RHNs via a lepton flavor violating interaction that involves a charged
singlet scalar. After discussing different constraints, we define a set of
kinematical cuts that suppress the background, and generate different
distributions that are useful in identifying the DM nature. The use of
polarized beams (like the polarization $P(e^{-},e^{+})=\left[+0.8,-0.3\right]$
at the International Linear Collider) makes the signal detection easier and the
DM identification more clear, where the statistical significance gets enhanced

expansion rate, prominence downflows, and the profile of the boundary layer
brightness and thickness as a function of time. The largest bubble analyzed
rises into the prominence with a speed of about 1.3 km/s until it is
destabilized by a localized shear flow on the boundary. Boundary layer
thickness grows gradually as prominence downflows deposit plasma onto the
bubble with characteristic speeds of 20 - 35 km/s. Lateral downflows initiate
from the thickened boundary layer with characteristic speeds of 25 - 50 km/s,
""draining"" the layer of plasma. Strong shear flow across one bubble boundary
leads to an apparent coupled Kelvin-Helmholtz Rayleigh-Taylor (KH-RT)
instability. We measure shear flow speeds above the bubble of 10 km/s and infer
interior bubble flow speeds on the order of 100 km/s. Comparing the measured
growth rate of the instability to analytic expressions, we infer a magnetic
flux density across the bubble boundary of ~10^{-3} T (10 gauss) at an angle of
~70 degrees to the prominence plane. The results are consistent with the
hypothesis that prominence bubbles are caused by magnetic flux that emerges

field morphology in OMC 1 is caused by the distortion of a primordial
cylindrically-symmetric magnetic field by the gravitational fragmentation of
the filament and/or the gravitational interaction of the BN/KL and S clumps. We
find that OMC 1 is currently in or near magnetically-supported equilibrium, and

the geometry of the magnetic field in OMC 1, and not vice versa.

superposition of multiple classically distinct states, marks one of the
fundamental departures from classical physics. Quantum coherence has recently
been investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,
the finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into
account the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively
unexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as
the single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for
understanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance
of quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental
groundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence. We prove
that non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as
there is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit
multilevel coherence in any basis. We provide a simple necessary and sufficient
analytical criterion to verify multilevel coherence, which leads to a complete
classification for three-level systems. We present the robustness of multilevel
coherence, a bona fide quantifier which we show to be numerically computable
via semidefinite programming and experimentally accessible via multilevel
coherence witnesses. We further verify and lower-bound the robustness of
multilevel coherence by performing a semi-device-independent phase
discrimination task, implemented experimentally with four-level probes in a
photonic setup. Our results contribute to understanding the operational
relevance of genuine multilevel coherence, also by demonstrating the key role
it plays in enhanced phase discrimination---a primitive for quantum
communication and metrology---and suggest new ways to reliably test the quantum
behaviour of physical systems.

Viber, Telegram, and Signal, have deployed an end-to-end encryption
functionality. To defeat potential MITM attackers against the key exchange
protocol, the approach relies on users to perform a code verification task
whereby each user must compare the code (a fingerprint of the cryptographic
keys) computed by her app with the one computed by the other user's app and
reject the session if the two do not match.
  In this paper, we study the security and usability of this human-centered
code verification task for a setting where the end users are remotely located,
and compare it as a baseline to a less frequent scenario where the users are in
close proximity. We consider several variations of the code presentation and
verification methods, incorporated into representative real-world apps,
including codes encoded as numbers or images, displayed on the screen, and
verbally spoken by the users. We perform a human factors study in a lab setting
to quantify the security and usability of these different methods.
  Our study results expose key weaknesses in the security and usability of the
code verification methods employed in the apps. First, we show that most code
verification methods offer poor security (high false accepts) and low usability
(high false rejects and low user experience ratings) in the remote setting.
Second, we demonstrate that, security and usability under the remote code
verification setting is significantly lower than that in the proximity setting.
We attribute this result to the increased cognitive overhead associated with
comparing the codes across two apps on the same device (remote setting) rather
than across two devices (proximity setting). Overall, our work serves to
highlight a serious vulnerability of Internet-based communication apps in the
remote setting stemming from human errors.

Yet in contrast to these systems, no charge or magnetic ordering has been
observed which could provide the electronic correlations presumed necessary for
an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism - an absence which defies
predictions of first principles models. We report the results of neutron
scattering experiments on polycrystalline $\text{K}_2\text{Cr}_3\text{As}_3$

Neutron diffraction data evidence a strong response of the nuclear lattice to
the onset of superconductivity while inelastic scattering reveals a highly
dispersive column of intensity at the commensurate wavevector $q =
(00\frac{1}{2})$ which loses intensity beneath $T_c$ - indicative of
short-range magnetic fluctuations. Using linear spin-wave theory we model the
observed scattering and suggest a possible structure to the short-range
magnetic order. These observations suggest that
$\text{K}_2\text{Cr}_3\text{As}_3$ is in close proximity to a magnetic
instability and that the incipient magnetic order both couples strongly to the
lattice and competes with superconductivity - in direct analogy with the
iron-based superconductors.

originates at certain nodes and subsequently spreads on the network through
influence. In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the spread of
influence and the identification of influential entities in a complex network
when nodal activation can happen via two different mechanisms. The first
mechanism of activation stems from factors that are intrinsic to the node. The
second mechanism comes from the influence of connected neighbors. After
introducing the model, we provide an algorithm to mine for the influential
nodes in such a scenario by modifying the well-known influence maximization
algorithm to work with our model that incorporates both forms of activation.
Our model can be considered as a variation of the independent cascade diffusion
model. We provide small motivating examples to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of the effect of including the intrinsic activation mechanism. We
sketch a proof of the submodularity of the influence function under the new
formulation and demonstrate the same on larger graphs. Based on the model, we
explain how influential content creators can drive engagement on social media
platforms. Using additional experiments on a Twitter dataset, we then show how
the formulation can be applied to real-world social media datasets. Finally, we
derive a centrality metric that takes into account, both the mechanisms of
activation and provides for an accurate, computationally efficient, alternate
approach to the problem of identifying influencers under intrinsic activation.

the paramagnetic state of GdSbTe. We observe the presence of multiple Fermi
surface pockets including a diamond-shape, an elliptical shape, and small
circular pockets around the zone center and high symmetry M and X points of the
Brillouin zone (BZ), respectively. Furthermore, we observe the presence of a
Dirac-like state at the X point of the BZ. Interestingly, our experimental data
shows a robust Dirac like state both below and above the magnetic transition
temperature (T_N ~ 13 K). Having relatively higher transition temperature,
GdSbTe provides an archetype platform to study the interaction between
magnetism and topological states of matter.

Maxwell's symmetric equations in that the stable magnetic monopole should have
the same charge strength as the electron. We have not found any experiments in

the few experiments at colliders that had no magnetic field might have observed
a signal for these 1e strength magnetic monopoles as an unexpected enhancement
in the mu+mu- production rate. The absence of any such observation leads us to
set a tentative lower mass limit for these unit charge magnetic monopoles at
4.5-5 GeV/c2. Using a MC generator for magnetic charge and tracking these
events through a simplified model of the BELLE II detector, we have found that
the central drift chamber of BELLE II has a remarkably high efficiency for

In these algorithms, the state of the Markov process evolves according to a
deterministic dynamics which is modified using a Markov transition kernel at

ability to update only a subset of the state components while other components
implicitly keep evolving and the ability to use an unbiased estimate of the

deterministic dynamics used so far do not exploit the structure of the target.
Moreover, exact simulation of the event times is feasible for an important yet
restricted class of problems and, even when it is, it is application specific.
This limits the applicability of these techniques and prevents the development
of a generic software implementation of them. We introduce novel MCMC methods
addressing these shortcomings. In particular, we introduce novel
continuous-time algorithms relying on exact Hamiltonian flows and novel
non-reversible discrete-time algorithms which can exploit complex dynamics such
as approximate Hamiltonian dynamics arising from symplectic integrators while
preserving the attractive features of continuous-time algorithms. We
demonstrate the performance of these schemes on a variety of applications.

natural framework for brane-world cosmological scenarios coupled to realistic

new set of canonical actions and angles variables valid in the resonant region.
We then follow the prescription of Binney (2016), assigning to the resonant DF
the time average along the orbits of the axisymmetric DF expressed in the new
set of actions and angles. This boils down to phase-mixing the DF in terms of
the new angles, such that the DF for trapped orbits only depends on the new set

The abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples,
especially in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ~15%. The average
metallicity profile flattens towards the center, where we find a logarithmic
slope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core clusters have more
centrally peaked metallicity profiles (~0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core
systems (~0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial
profiles follow positive gradients. The outer abundance profiles do not evolve
below z~2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards z=0. More than ~80% of
the metals in the intra-cluster medium have been accreted from the
proto-cluster environment, which has been enriched to ~0.1 solar already at
z~2. We conclude that the intra-cluster metal distribution is uniform among our

ratio distribution functions (ERDFs). We assume that black holes can be divided
into two independent groups: those with radiatively efficient accretion,
primarily hosted by optically blue and green galaxies, and those with
radiatively inefficient accretion, which are mainly found in red galaxies. With
observed galaxy stellar mass functions as input, we show that the observed AGN
luminosity functions can be reproduced by using mass independent, broken power
law shaped ERDFs. We use the observed hard X-ray and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity
functions to constrain the ERDF for radiatively efficient and inefficient AGN,
respectively. We also test alternative ERDF shapes and mass dependent models.
Our results are consistent with a mass independent AGN fraction and AGN hosts
being randomly drawn from the galaxy population. We argue that the ERDF is not
shaped by galaxy-scale effects, but by how efficiently material can be
transported from the inner few parsecs to the accretion disc. Our results are
incompatible with the simplest form of mass quenching where massive galaxies
host higher accretion rate AGN. Furthermore, if reaching a certain Eddington
ratio is a sufficient condition for maintenance mode, it can occur in all red
galaxies, not just the most massive ones.

a small sample of four local mergers: the early-stage mergers IC1623, NGC6090,
and the Mice, and the more advanced merger NGC2623, by analyzing IFS data from
the CALIFA survey and PMAS in LArr mode. Full spectral fitting techniques are
applied to the datacubes to obtain the spatially resolved mass growth
histories, the time evolution of the star formation rate intensity
($\Sigma_{SFR}$), and the local specific star formation rate, over three
different timescales (30 Myr, 300 Myr, and 1 Gyr). The results are compared
with non-interacting Sbc--Sc galaxies, to quantify if there is an enhancement
of the star formation and to trace its time scale and spatial extent. Our
results for the three LIRGs (IC1623W, NGC6090, and NGC2623) show that a major
phase of star formation is occurring in time scales of 10$^{7}$ yr to few
10$^{8}$ yr, with global SFR enhancements of $\sim$2--6 with respect to
main-sequence star forming (MSSF) galaxies. In the two early-stage mergers
IC1623W and NGC6090, which are between first pericenter passage and
coalescence, the most remarkable increase of the SFR with respect to
non-interacting spirals occurred in the last 30 Myr, and it is spatially
extended, with enhancements of factors 2--7 both in the centres ($r <$ 0.5 half
light radius, HLR), and in the disks ($r >$ 1 HLR). In the more advanced merger
NGC 2623 an extended phase of star formation occurred on a longer time-scale of
$\sim$1 Gyr, with a SFR enhancement of a factor $\sim$2--3 larger than the one
in Sbc--Sc MSSF galaxies over the same period, probably relic of the first
pericenter passage epoch. A SFR enhancement in the last 30 Myr is also present,
but only in NGC2623 centre, by a factor 3. In general, the spatially resolved
SFHs of the LIRG-mergers are consistent with the predictions from high spatial

galaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor
branches, distinguishing between main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main
findings are as follows. (i) At M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun, the evolution of the
median main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median
size before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size
continuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies.
This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched
z=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the
overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched
galaxies with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun experience a steep size growth on the
size-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception of galaxies
with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{11}Msun, the size growth after quenching is small in
absolute terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched
galaxies (and its variation among them) occurs while they are still on the
main-sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth rate of quenched
galaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that
of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z=0.

$^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratio is seen, meaning that extrapolations
from $J \geq 2$ CO lines can result in very uncertain molecular gas mass
determinations. Our sources with $^{12}$CO(1-0) detections follow the dust--gas

of AGNs, with no clear dependence on the density of the environment. The
variability properties of high-z AGNs, over different temporal timescales, are
most consistent with a Power Spectral Density (PSD) described by a broken (or
bending) power-law, similar to nearby AGNs. We confirm the presence of an
anti-correlation between luminosity and variability, resulting from the
dependence of variability on BH mass and accretion rate. We explore different
models, finding that our acceptable solutions predict that BH mass influences
the value of the PSD break frequency, while the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{Edd}$
affects the PSD break frequency and, possibly, the PSD amplitude as well. We
derive the evolution of the average $\lambda_{Edd}$ as a function of redshift,
finding results in agreement with measurements based on different estimators.
The large statistical uncertainties make our results consistent with a constant
Eddington ratio, although one of our models suggest a possible increase of
$\lambda_{Edd}$ with lookback time up to $z\sim 2-3$. We conclude that

composite SEDs in bins of redshift and AGN luminosity. We perform SED fitting
to measure the mean infrared luminosity due to star formation, removing the
contamination from AGN emission. We find that the mean SFRs show a weak
positive trend with increasing AGN luminosity. However, we demonstrate that the
observed trend could be due to an increase in black hole (BH) mass (and a
consequent increase of inferred stellar mass) with increasing AGN luminosity.
We compare to a sample of X-ray selected AGN and find that the two populations
have consistent mean SFRs when matched in AGN luminosity and redshift. On the
basis of the available virial BH masses, and the evolving BH mass to stellar
mass relationship, we find that the mean SFRs of our QSO sample are consistent
with those of main sequence star-forming galaxies. Similarly, the
radio-luminous QSOs have mean SFRs that are consistent with both the overall
QSO sample and with star-forming galaxies on the main sequence. In conclusion,
on average QSOs reside on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and the

brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of 13 CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova
survey with Hubble) clusters at $0.18<z<0.69$ with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (JVLA). Radio emission is clearly detected and characterized for 11
BCGs, while for two of them we obtain only upper limits to their radio flux
($<0.1$ mJy at 5$\sigma$ confidence level). We also consider five additional
clusters whose BCG is detected in FIRST or NVSS. We find radio powers in the
range from $2\times 10^{23}$ to $\sim 10^{26}$ $W~Hz^{-1}$ and radio spectral
indices $\alpha_{1.5}^{30}$ (defined as the slope between 1.5 and 30 GHz)
distributed from $\sim -1$ to $-0.25$ around the central value $\langle \alpha
\rangle= - 0.68$. The radio emission from the BCGs is resolved in three cases
(Abell 383, MACS J1931, and RX J2129), and unresolved or marginally resolved in
the remaining eight cases observed with JVLA. In all the cases the BCGs are
consistent with being powered by active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio power
shows a positive correlation with the BCG star formation rate, and a negative
correlation with the central entropy of the surrounding intracluster medium
(ICM) except in two cases (MACS J1206 and CL J1226). Finally, over the
restricted range in radio power sampled by the CLASH BCGs, we observe a
significant scatter between the radio power and the average mechanical power
stored in the ICM cavities.

allowed by quantum theory but still physically conceivable in post-quantum
theories, in the sense of respecting the basic no-faster-than-light
communication principle. While supraquantum correlations are relatively well
understood for finite-dimensional systems, little is known in the
infinite-dimensional case. Here, we study supraquantum nonlocality for
bipartite systems with two measurement settings and infinitely many outcomes
per subsystem. We develop a formalism for generic no-signaling black-box
measurement devices with continuous outputs in terms of probability measures,
instead of probability distributions, which involves a few technical
subtleties. We show the existence of a class of supraquantum Gaussian
correlations, which violate the Tsirelson bound of an adequate
continuous-variable Bell inequality. We then introduce the continuous-variable
version of the celebrated Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes, as a limiting case of
the above-mentioned Gaussian ones. Finally, we perform a characterisation of
the geometry of the set of continuous-variable no-signaling correlations.
Namely, we show that that the convex hull of the continuous-variable PR boxes
is dense in the no-signaling set. We also show that these boxes are extreme in
the set of no-signaling behaviours and provide evidence suggesting that they
are indeed the only extreme points of the no-signaling set. Our results lay the
grounds for studying generalized-probability theories in continuous-variable
systems.

Bell, in his seminal 1964 work, proved that local-realism imposes a bound on

Surpassing this bound rules out local-realistic description of microscopic
phenomena, establishing the presence of nonlocal correlation. To manifest
nonlocality, it requires, in the simplest scenario, two measurements performed
randomly by each of two distant observers. In this work, we propose a novel
framework where three measurements, two on Alice's side and one on Bob's side,
suffice to reveal quantum nonlocality and hence does not require all-out

task in quantum information theory, namely, the minimal error state

is a choice of scheme, this represents a theoretical uncertainty; ideally, we
would like to see minimal dependence on this parameter. For the transition
across the charm quark (from $N_{F}=3$ to $4$), we find a large $\mu_m=\mu_{c}$
dependence of the global fit $\chi^2$ at NLO, but this is significantly reduced

environment. Here, using a Darwin particle-in-cell method, the excitation of
electrostatic and whistler instabilities by a gyrating electron beam is studied
in support of recent laboratory experiments. It is assumed that the total
plasma frequency $\omega_{pe}$ is larger than the electron cyclotron frequency
$\Omega_e$. The fast-growing electrostatic beam-mode waves saturate in a few
plasma oscillations by slowing down and relaxing the electron beam parallel to
the background magnetic field. Upon their saturation, the finite amplitude
electrostatic beam-mode waves can resonate with the tail of the background
thermal electrons and accelerate them to the beam parallel velocity. The
slower-growing whistler waves are excited in primarily two resonance modes: (a)
through Landau resonance due to the inverted slope of the beam electrons in the
parallel velocity; (b) through cyclotron resonance by scattering electrons to
both lower pitch angles and smaller energies. It is demonstrated that, for a
field-aligned beam, the whistler instability can be suppressed by the
electrostatic instability due to a faster energy transfer rate between beam
electrons and the electrostatic waves. Such a competition of growth between
whistler and electrostatic waves depends on the ratio of
$\omega_{pe}/\Omega_e$. In terms of wave propagation, beam-generated
electrostatic waves are confined to the beam region whereas beam-generated
whistler waves transport energy away from the beam.

oscillated into a sterile state, a depletion in the neutral-current data sample
is expected since they do not interact with the $Z$ boson. This channel offers
a direct avenue to probe the mixing between a sterile neutrino and the tau

study the potential of the DUNE experiment to constrain the mixing angle which
parametrizes this mixing, $\theta_{34}$, through the observation of

explosion and radiation transport simulations for spherically-symmetric
delayed-detonation models(DDT) producing normal-bright and subluminous SNe~Ia.
Empirical LC-relations can be understood as having the same physical
underpinnings: i.e. the opacities, ionization balances in the photosphere, and
radioactive energy deposition changing with time from below to above the
photosphere. Some 3-4 weeks past maximum, the photosphere recedes to
${}^{56}$Ni-rich layers of similar density structure, leading to a similar
color evolution. An important secondary parameter is the central density
$\rho_c$ of the WD because at higher densities more electron capture elements
are produced at the expense of ${}^{56}$Ni production. This results in a
$\Delta m_{15}$ spread of 0.1 mag for normal-bright and 0.7 mag in sub-luminous
SNe~Ia and $\approx0.2$ mag in the Lira-relation. We show why color-magnitude
diagrams emphasize the transition between physical regimes, and allow to
construct templates depend mostly on $\Delta m_{15}$ with little dispersion in
both the CSP-I sample and our DDT-models. This allows to separate intrinsic
SN~Ia variations from the interstellar reddening characterized by $E(B-V)$ and
$R_{B}$. Mixing of different explosion scenarios causes a wide spread in
empirical relations which may suggest one dominant scenario.

frequent assumption is that the HCN ($J=1$--0) transition is unambiguously
associated with gas at $\rm{}H_2$ densities $\gg{}10^4~\rm{}cm^{-3}$. If so,
the mass of gas at densities $\gg{}10^4~\rm{}cm^{-3}$ could be inferred from

$A_V\approx{}6~\rm{}mag$. We also find that cold and dense gas in a cloud like
Orion produces too little HCN emission to explain $L_{\rm{}HCN\,(1\text{--}0)}$

the most detailed joint radio and millimeter observations of a GRB afterglow at

normality, yet many incomplete variables are skewed. We find that imputing
skewed continuous variables under a normal model can lead to bias; the bias is
usually mild for popular estimands such as means, standard deviations, and
linear regression coefficients, but the bias can be severe for more
shape-dependent estimands such as percentiles or the coefficient of skewness.
We test several methods for adapting a normal imputation model to accommodate
skewness, including methods that transform, truncate, or censor (round)
normally imputed values, as well as methods that impute values from a quadratic
or truncated regression. None of these modifications reliably reduces the
biases of the normal model, and some modifications can make the biases much
worse. We conclude that, if one has to impute a skewed variable under a normal
model, it is usually safest to do so without modifications -- unless you are
more interested in estimating percentiles and shape that in estimated means,
variance, and regressions. In the conclusion, we briefly discuss promising
developments in the area of continuous imputation models that do not assume

VLC networks is that they can use the existing lighting infrastructure in
indoor environments, which may have large number of LEDs for illumination.
While LEDs used for lighting typically have limited bandwidth, presence of many
LEDs can be exploited for indoor VLC networks, to serve each user by multiple
LEDs for improving link quality and throughput. In this paper, LEDs are grouped
and assigned to the users based on received signal strength from each LED, for
which different solutions are proposed to achieve maximum throughput,
proportional fairness and quality of service (QoS). Additionally, power
optimization of LEDs for a given assignment is investigated, and Jacobian and
Hessian matrices of the corresponding optimization problem are derived.
Moreover, for multi-element receivers with LED grouping at the transmitter, an
improved optimal combining method is proposed. This method suppresses
interference caused by simultaneous data transfer of LEDs and improves the
overall signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) by 2 dB to 5 dB. Lastly,
an efficient calculation of channel response is presented to simulate multipath
VLC channel with low computational complexity.

of a ""fine-tuning"" problem than do torsional waves. In closed field regions, we
study the fractionations produced by Alfven waves with photospheric and coronal
origins. Waves with a coronal origin, at or close to resonance with the coronal
loop, offer a significantly better match to observed abundances than do
photospheric waves, with shear and torsional waves in such a case giving
essentially indistinguishable fractionations. Such coronal waves are likely the
result of a nanoflare coronal heating mechanism, that as well as heating
coronal plasmas releases Alfven waves that can travel down to loop footpoints
and cause FIP fractionation through the ponderomotive force as they reflect
from the chromosphere back into the corona.

testing stability of some coefficients in a linear regression model. In this
paper, we propose a different procedure for estimating non time-varying
parameters at the rate root n, in the spirit of the method introduced by
Robinson (1988) for partially linear models. When the errors in the model are
martingale differences, this approach can lead to more effcient estimates than
the method considered in Zhang and Wu (2012). For a time-varying AR process
with exogenous covariates and conditionally Gaussian errors, we derive a notion
of efficient information matrix from a convolution theorem adapted to
triangular arrays. For independent but non identically distributed Gaussian

problem (TSP), we study the problem of {\em uniform covers}. A graph $G=(V,E)$
has an $\alpha$-uniform cover for TSP (2EC, respectively) if the everywhere
$\alpha$ vector (i.e. $\{\alpha\}^{E}$) dominates a convex combination of

implies that a 3-edge-connected, cubic graph has a 1-uniform cover for TSP.
Seb\H{o} asked if such graphs have $(1-\epsilon)$-uniform covers for TSP for
some $\epsilon > 0$. Indeed, the four-thirds conjecture implies that such
graphs have 8/9-uniform covers. We show that these graphs have 18/19-uniform

  To extend our approach to input graphs that are 2-edge-connected, we present
a procedure to decompose an optimal solution for the subtour relaxation for TSP

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.NI math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed network optimization has been studied for well over a decade.
However, we still do not have a good idea of how to design schemes that can
simultaneously provide good performance across the dimensions of utility
optimality, convergence speed, and delay. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework with all these metrics
approaching optimality. The salient features of our new algorithm are
three-fold: (i) fast convergence: it converges with only $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
iterations that is the fastest speed among all the existing algorithms; (ii)
low delay: it guarantees optimal utility with finite queue length; (iii) simple
implementation: the control variables of this algorithm are based on virtual
queues that do not require maintaining per-flow information. The new technique
builds on a kind of inexact Uzawa method in the Alternating Directional Method
of Multiplier, and provides a new theoretical path to prove global and linear
convergence rate of such a method without requiring the full rank assumption of
the constraint matrix.

gases in one- and two-dimensional optical lattices in the presence of the
disorder leading to the Anderson localization. The disorder is created by
interaction of the main fraction of atoms with the second immobilized fraction
distributed randomly over the lattice.
  In low-dimensional systems there is no transition from the Anderson localized
to the conducting phase, although in the presence of correlations a discrete
set of extended states can exist. The first part of the thesis is devoted to
properties of such states. In the finite size lattices, the presence of those
states results in the appearance of `windows of transport' -- energy ranges, in
which the localization length is longer than the system size.The analytical
method of determining the extended states energies for correlations of
generalized $N$-mers type is presented, along with a proof that indeed those
states are extended in the infinite system. Subsequently, the way of
experimental creation of this type of correlations is proposed, as well as the
technique of generation of the disorder in the tunneling amplitudes, which
significantly enhances tunability of the proposed energy filters.
  The second part of the thesis describes the method which allows to simulate a
specific type of the disorder: random magnetic field. Systems of such a class,
created in a two dimensional lattice using simultaneous fast periodic
modulation of the lattice height and interactions with immobilized species, may
allow in future to investigate the range of topics from the condensed matter
physics, for example fractional quantum Hall effect at half-filling. In the
thesis, the most interesting features observed upon investigation of such
systems are presented. Especially, the anomalously low localization length for
correlated disorder is explained.

of Parameterized Complexity. We conduct the first study of these problems with
respect to the parameter treewidth. First, we study the treewidth $\mathtt{tw}$
of the primal graph. We establish that all four problems are W[1]-hard. In
particular, while it is easy to show that all four problems admit algorithms
that run in time $n^{O(\mathtt{tw})}$, we prove that all of these algorithms
are likely to be essentially optimal. Next, we study the treewidth
$\mathtt{tw}$ of the rotation digraph. In this context, the max-SMT and min-SMT

nuclei (as indicated by existing data), then the pointing of cosmic rays to
their nearest extragalactic sources is expected for 10^10.6 < E/GeV < 10^11.
This is because for a nucleus of charge Ze and baryon number A, the bending of
the cosmic ray decreases as Z/E with rising energy, so that pointing to nearby
sources becomes possible at highest energies. In addition, the maximum energy
of acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly in Z, while the energy
loss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two
points tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional
bi-dimensional analyses, which simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the
spectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable of incorporating the
relative importance of these phenomena. In this paper we propose a
multi-dimensional reconstruction of the individual emission spectra (in E,
direction, and cross-correlation with nearby putative sources) to study the
hypothesis that primaries are heavy nuclei subject to GZK photo-disintegration,
and to determine the nature of the extragalactic sources. More specifically, we
propose to combine information on nuclear composition and arrival direction to
associate a potential clustering of events with a 3-dimensional position in the
sky. Actually, both the source distance and maximum emission energy can be
obtained through a multi-parameter likelihood analysis to accommodate the
observed nuclear composition of each individual event in the cluster. We show
that nucleus-emitting-sources exhibit a cepa stratis structure on Earth which
could be pealed off by future space-missions, such as POEMMA. We also show that
metal-rich starburst galaxies are highly-plausible candidate sources, and we
use them as an explicit example of our proposed multi-dimensional analysis.

(NIR) wavelengths for a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z=0.840,
SDSS~J110006.07+442144.3 (hereafter, J1100+4421), which was identified during a
flare phase in late February, 2014. The campaigns consist of three intensive
observing runs from the discovery to March, 2015, mostly within the scheme of
the OISTER collaboration. Optical-NIR light curves and simultaneous spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) are obtained. Our measurements show the strongest
brightening in March, 2015. We found that the optical-NIR SEDs of J1100+4421
show an almost steady shape despite the large and rapid intranight variability.
This constant SED shape is confirmed to extend to $\sim5~\mu$m in the observed
frame using the archival WISE data. Given the lack of absorption lines and the
steep power-law spectrum of $\alpha_{\nu}\sim-1.4$, where
$f_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha_{\nu}}$, synchrotron radiation by a relativistic jet
with no or small contributions from the host galaxy and the accretion disk
seems most plausible as an optical-NIR emission mechanism. The steep
optical-NIR spectral shape and the large amplitude of variability are
consistent with this object being a low $\nu_{\rm{peak}}$ jet-dominated AGN. In
addition, sub-arcsec resolution optical imaging data taken with Subaru Hyper
Suprime-Cam does not show a clear extended component and the spatial scales are
significantly smaller than the large extensions detected at radio wavelengths.
The optical spectrum of a possible faint companion galaxy does not show any
emission lines at the same redshift and hence a merging hypothesis for this
AGN-related activity is not supported by our observations.

structure observed in, or adopted by, many research areas, such as: text mining
(author-paper-word) and multi-label classification (label-instance-feature).
Renowned Bayesian approaches for cooperative hierarchical structure modeling
are mostly based on topic models. However, these approaches suffer from a
serious issue in that the number of hidden topics/factors needs to be fixed in
advance and an inappropriate number may lead to overfitting or underfitting.
One elegant way to resolve this issue is Bayesian nonparametric learning, but
existing work in this area still cannot be applied to cooperative hierarchical
structure modeling.
  In this paper, we propose a cooperative hierarchical Dirichlet process (CHDP)
to fill this gap. Each node in a cooperative hierarchical structure is assigned
a Dirichlet process to model its weights on the infinite hidden factors/topics.
Together with measure inheritance from hierarchical Dirichlet process, two
kinds of measure cooperation, i.e., superposition and maximization, are defined
to capture the many-to-many relationships in the cooperative hierarchical
structure. Furthermore, two constructive representations for CHDP, i.e.,
stick-breaking and international restaurant process, are designed to facilitate
the model inference. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data with
cooperative hierarchical structures demonstrate the properties and the ability
of CHDP for cooperative hierarchical structure modeling and its potential for
practical application scenarios.

connect the seen and unseen classes. Recently, distributed word embeddings
(DWE) pre-trained from large text corpus have become a popular choice to draw
such a connection. Compared with human defined attributes, DWEs are more
scalable and easier to obtain. However, they are designed to reflect semantic
similarity rather than visual similarity and thus using them in ZSL often leads
to inferior performance. To overcome this visual-semantic discrepancy, this
work proposes an objective function to re-align the distributed word embeddings
with visual information by learning a neural network to map it into a new
representation called visually aligned word embedding (VAWE). Thus the
neighbourhood structure of VAWEs becomes similar to that in the visual domain.
Note that in this work we do not design a ZSL method that projects the visual
features and semantic embeddings onto a shared space but just impose a
requirement on the structure of the mapped word embeddings. This strategy
allows the learned VAWE to generalize to various ZSL methods and visual
features. As evaluated via four state-of-the-art ZSL methods on four benchmark
datasets, the VAWE exhibit consistent performance improvement.

results of Aoki and Fukaya, but using the nonperturbatively-valid chiral theory
worked out by Golterman, Sharpe and Singleton, and by Sharpe and Shoresh. We

forecasting, decision making, and to help unravel the processes that explain
the observed data. These data are some deterministic and/or stochastic
transformations of the underlying parameters. A key task is then to summarize
the posterior distribution of these parameters. When models become too
difficult to analyze analytically, Monte Carlo methods can be used to
approximate the target distribution. Of these, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods are particularly powerful. Such methods generate a random walk through
the parameter space and, under strict conditions of reversibility and
ergodicity, will successively visit solutions with frequency proportional to
the underlying target density. This requires a proposal distribution that
generates candidate solutions starting from an arbitrary initial state. The
speed of the sampled chains converging to the target distribution deteriorates
rapidly, however, with increasing parameter dimensionality. In this paper, we
introduce a new proposal distribution that enhances significantly the
efficiency of MCMC simulation for highly parameterized models. This proposal
distribution exploits the cross-covariance of model parameters, measurements
and model outputs, and generates candidate states much alike the analysis step
in the Kalman filter. We embed the Kalman-inspired proposal distribution in the
DREAM algorithm during burn-in, and present several numerical experiments with
complex, high-dimensional or multi-modal target distributions. Results
demonstrate that this new proposal distribution can greatly improve simulation
efficiency of MCMC. Specifically, we observe a speed-up on the order of 10-30
times for groundwater models with more than one-hundred parameters.

frequently been cited as a probe of these correlated motions, with significant
potential to advance our understanding of biological dynamics. However, recent
work challenged this prevailing view, suggesting instead that diffuse
scattering primarily originates from rigid body motions and could therefore be
applied to improve structure determination. To investigate the nature of the
disorder giving rise to diffuse scattering, and thus the potential applications
of this signal, a diverse repertoire of disorder models was assessed for its
ability to reproduce the diffuse signal reconstructed from three protein
crystals. This comparison revealed that multiple models of intramolecular
conformational dynamics, including ensemble models inferred from the Bragg
data, could not explain the signal. Models of rigid body or short-range
liquid-like motions, in which dynamics are confined to the biological unit,
showed modest agreement with the diffuse maps, but were unable to reproduce
experimental features indicative of long-range correlations. Extending a model
of liquid-like motions to include disorder across neighboring proteins in the
crystal significantly improved agreement with all three systems and highlighted
the contribution of intermolecular correlations to the observed signal. These
findings anticipate a need to account for intermolecular disorder in order to
advance the interpretation of diffuse scattering to either extract biological
motions or aid structural inference.

debate about the value, meaning and interpretation of 'tunnelling time'. Until
recently the debate was purely theoretical, with the process considered to be
instantaneous for all practical purposes. This changed with the development of
ultrafast lasers and in particular, the 'attoclock' technique that is used to
probe the attosecond dynamics of electrons. Although the initial attoclock
measurements hinted at instantaneous tunnelling, later experiments contradicted
those findings, claiming to have measured finite tunnelling times. In each case
these measurements were performed with multi-electron atoms. Atomic hydrogen
(H), the simplest atomic system with a single electron, can be 'exactly'
(subject only to numerical limitations) modelled using numerical solutions of
the 3D-TDSE with measured experimental parameters and acts as a convenient
benchmark for both accurate experimental measurements and calculations. Here we
report the first attoclock experiment performed on H and find that our
experimentally determined offset angles are in excellent agreement with
accurate 3D-TDSE simulations performed using our experimental pulse parameters.
The same simulations with a short-range Yukawa potential result in zero offset
angles for all intensities. We conclude that the offset angle measured in the
attoclock experiments originates entirely from electron scattering by the
long-range Coulomb potential with no contribution from tunnelling time delay.
That conclusion is supported by empirical observation that the electron offset
angles follow closely the simple formula for the deflection angle of electrons
undergoing classical Rutherford scattering by the Coulomb potential. Thus we
confirm that, in H, tunnelling is instantaneous (with an upperbound of 1.8 as)
within our experimental and numerical uncertainty.

Street defined wreaths. A biwreath is then a system containing a wreath, a
cowreath and their mixed versions, but also a 2-cell $\lambda$ in $\bEM(\K)$
governing the compatibility of the monad and the comonad structure of the
biwreath. We deduce that the monad laws encode 2-(co)cycles and the comonad
laws so called 3-(co)cycles, while the 2-cell conditions of the (co)monad
structure 2-cells of the biwreath encode (co)actions twisted by these 2- and
3-(co)cycles. The compatibilities of $\lambda$ deliver concrete expressions of
the latter structure 2-cells. We concentrate on the examples of biwreaths in
the 2-category induced by a braided monoidal category $\C$ and take for the
distributive laws in a biwreath the braidings of the different categories of
Yetter-Drinfel'd modules in $\C$. We prove that the before-mentioned properties
of a biwreath specified to the latter setting recover on the level of $\C$
different algebraic constructions known in the category ${}_R\M$ of modules
over a commutative ring $R$, such as Radford biproduct, Sweedler's crossed
product algebra, comodule algebras over a quasi-bialgebra and the Drinfel'd
twist. In this way we obtain that the known examples of (mixed) wreaths coming
from ${}_R\M$ are not merely examples, rather they are consequences of the
structure of a biwreath, and that the form of their structure morphisms
originates in the laws inside of a biwreath. Choosing different distributive
laws and different 2-cells $\lambda$ in a biwreath, leads to different and
possibly new algebraic constructions.

blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries,
protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish
off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral
funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without
interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury
failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state
of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with
threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction
throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine
Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.

computationally costly for large problem instances that contain many image

the possibility that each satellite could have formed through pebble accretion

measures to evaluate creativity. This is necessary mainly for the reason of
having an objective and automatic way of quantifying creative artifacts. In
this work, we propose a regression-based learning framework which takes into
account quantitatively the essential criteria for creativity like novelty,
influence, value and unexpectedness. As it is often the case with most creative
domains, there is no clear ground truth available for creativity. Our proposed
learning framework is applicable to all creative domains; yet we evaluate it on
a dataset of movies created from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes due to availability
of audience and critic scores, which can be used as proxy ground truth labels
for creativity. We report promising results and observations from our
experiments in the following ways : 1) Correlation of creative criteria with
critic scores, 2) Improvement in movie rating prediction with inclusion of
various creative criteria, and 3) Identification of creative movies.

we report on NMR experiments on liquid and biological entities immersed in

fabrication of high spatial resolution 3D printed microfluidic structures,
specifically conceived to guide and confine sub-nL samples in the sub-nL most
sensitive volume of a single-chip integrated NMR probe. The microfluidic
structures are fabricated using two-photon polymerization 3D printing. This
technique has a resolution better than 1 ${\mu}$m$^3$ and allows to rapidly
fabricate complex microfluidic structures tailored to position, hold, and feed
biological samples, with a design that maximizes the NMR signals amplitude and
minimizes the static magnetic field inhomogeneities. The NMR probe consists of
an electronic transceiver and a 150 ${\mu}$m diameter excitation/detection
microcoil, co-integrated on a single silicon chip of about 1 mm$^2$. To
demonstrate the potential of this approach, we report NMR experiments on sub-nL
intact biological entities in liquid media, specifically ova of the tardigrade
Richtersius coronifer and sections of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. We show
a sensitivity of 2.5x10$^{13}$ spins/Hz$^{1/2}$ on 1H nuclei at 7 T, sufficient
to detect highly concentrated endogenous compounds in active volumes down to
100 pL in a measurement time of 3 hours. Spectral resolutions of 0.01 ppm in
liquids and of 0.1 ppm in the investigated biological entities are
demonstrated. The obtained results indicate a promising route for NMR studies

unfortunately. This paper introduces and addresses the task of coherent story
generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.

as the medium by means of which neurons in the uncoupled layer share
information in spite of the absent physical connections among them. Neurons in
the coupled layer are connected with electrical synapses, while across the two
layers neurons are connected through chemical synapses. In both layers the
dynamics of each neuron is described by the Hindmarsh-Rose square wave bursting

synapses within and between the two layers, together with the multilayer
network structure, plays a key role in the emergence of between-layer
synchronous chimera states and patterns of synchronous clusters. In particular,
we find that these chimera states can emerge in the coupled layer regardless of
the range of electrical synapses. Even in all-to-all and nearest-neighbor
coupling within the coupled layer, we observe qualitatively identical
between-layer chimera states. Moreover, we show that the role of information
transmission delay between the two layers must not be neglected, and we obtain
precise parameter bounds at which chimera states can be observed. The expansion
of the chimera region and annihilation of cluster and fully coherent states in
the parameter plane for increasing values of inter-layer chemical synaptic time
delay are illustrated using effective range measurement. These results are
discussed in the light of neuronal evolution, where the coexistence of coherent

we reduce Cheeger-Tian's $\epsilon$-regularity conjecture to a backward

self-assemblies. New results are presented, in particular concerning the
possible development of future applications. These self-organizing structures
possess the notable ability to move along an interface when powered by an
oscillatory, uniform magnetic field. The system is constructed as follows. Soft
magnetic particles are placed on a liquid interface, and submitted to a
magnetic induction field. An attractive force due to the curvature of the
interface around the particles competes with an interaction between magnetic
dipoles. Ordered structures can spontaneously emerge from these conditions.
Furthermore, time-dependent magnetic fields can produce a wide range of dynamic
behaviours, including non-time-reversible deformation sequences that produce
translational motion at low Reynolds number. In other words, due to a
spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the assembly can turn into a
surface microswimmer. Trajectories have been shown to be precisely
controllable. As a consequence, this system offers a way to produce microrobots
able to perform different tasks. This is illustrated in this paper by the
capture, transport and release of a floating cargo, and the controlled mixing
of fluids at low Reynolds number.

of the progress made by standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI) and
harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC)), significant
questions remain unanswered towards deploying a VPKI. Deep understanding of the
VPKI, a central building block of secure and privacy-preserving VC systems, is
still lacking. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap. We present
SECMACE, a VPKI system, which is compatible with the IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI

security and privacy protection, and efficiency. SECMACE facilitates
multi-domain operations in the VC systems and enhances user privacy, notably
preventing linking pseudonyms based on timing information and offering
increased protection even against honest-but-curious VPKI entities. We propose
multiple policies for the vehicle-VPKI interactions, based on which and two

acausal mode in the sigma mesonic channel, found in the previous work by the
present authors, when the system approaches the $\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ critical
point. The functional renormalization group method is applied to the
two--flavor quark--meson model with varying current quark mass $m_q$ even away
from the physical value at which the pion mass is reproduced. We first
determine the whole phase structure in the three-dimensional space $(T, \mu,
m_q)$ consisting of temperature $T$, quark chemical potential $\mu$ and $m_q$,
with the tricritical point, $\mathrm{O}(4)$ and $\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ critical lines
being located; they altogether make a wing-like shape quite reminiscent of
those known in the condensed matters with a tricritical point. We then
calculate the spectral functions $\rho_{\sigma, \pi}(\omega, p)$ in the scalar
and pseudoscalar channel around the critical points. We find that the sigma
mesonic mode becomes tachyonic with a superluminal velocity at finite momenta
before the system reaches the $\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ point from the lower density,
even for $m_q$ smaller than the physical value. One of the possible
implications of the appearance of such a tachyonic mode at finite momenta is
that the assumed equilibrium state with a uniform chiral condensate is unstable
toward a state with an inhomogeneous $\sigma$ condensate. No such an anomalous
behavior is found in the pseudoscalar channel. We find that the
$\sigma$-to-$2\sigma$ coupling due to finite $m_q$ play an essential role for
the drastic modification of the spectral function.

Monte Carlo simulations to access the large-distance properties, accounting for
quantum fluctuations beyond mean-field-theory approaches to edge magnetism. For
certain chiral nanoribbons, antiferromagnetic inter-edge couplings were
previously found to induce a gapped quantum disordered ground state of the
effective spin model. We find that the extended nature of the intra-edge

phase transition at a large, finite value of the inter-edge coupling. This
quantum critical point separates the quantum disordered region from a gapless
phase of stable edge magnetism at weak intra-edge coupling, which includes the
ground states of spin-ladder models for wide zigzag nanoribbons. To study the
quantum critical behavior, the effective spin model can be related to a model
of two antiferromagnetically coupled Haldane-Shastry spin-half chains with
long-ranged ferromagnetic intra-chain couplings. The results for the critical
exponents are compared also to several recent renormalization group

obscuration hiding the continuum source and the broad line region, and that the
quasar is seen close to the system axis. Our results thus support the idea that
the vanishing of the broad emission lines in J1011+5442 is due to an intrinsic
dimming of the ionizing continuum source that is most likely caused by a rapid
decrease in the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole.

This numerical version of RG method, dubbed as the numerical RG (nRG)

corresponds to the self-similar dynamics of the equations. In this paper, we
carefully examine and validate this class of algorithms by comparing the

that we present several examples to demonstrate that this class of nRG

statistically-steady state, the accretion rate presents some variability. For a

to increase the accretion rate about 50% over the accretion rate without

transport. We consider purely advective transport in heterogeneity scenarios
characterized by broad distributions of heterogeneity length scales and point
values. Particle transport is characterized in terms of the stochastic
properties of equidistantly sampled Lagrangian velocities, which are determined
by the flow and conductivity statistics. The persistence length scales of flow
and transport velocities are imprinted in the spatial disorder and reflect the
distribution of heterogeneity length scales. Particle transitions over the
velocity length scales are kinematically coupled with the transition time
through velocity. We show that the average particle motion follows a coupled
continuous time random walk (CTRW), which is fully parameterized by the
distribution of flow velocities and the medium geometry in terms of the
heterogeneity length scales. The coupled CTRW provides a systematic framework
for the investigation of the origins of anomalous dispersion in terms of
heterogeneity correlation and the distribution of heterogeneity point values.
Broad distributions of heterogeneity point values and lengths scales may lead
to very similar dispersion behaviors in terms of the spatial variance. Their
mechanisms, however are very different, which manifests in the distributions of
particle positions and arrival times, which plays a central role for the
prediction of the fate of dissolved substances in heterogeneous natural and
engineered porous materials.

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a challenge. We
investigate the reported failure of state of the art (SOTA) SLAM techniques on

shown to be fooled by image agnostic perturbations, called universal

generalize across multiple networks trained on the same target data. However,
these algorithms require training data on which the CNNs were trained and

its unreasonable for an attacker to have access to the training data. In this

facilities call for a new design.
  We aim to develop an interactive software tool with a graphical user
interface (GUI) for the reduction of single-dish radio continuum maps. Special
effort is given on the reduction of distortions along the scanning direction
(scanning effects) by combining maps scanned in orthogonal directions or dual-
or multiple-horn observations that need to be processed in a restoration
procedure. The package should also process polarisation data and offer the
possibility to include special tasks written by the individual user.
  Based on the ideas of the NOD2 package we developed NOD3, which includes all
necessary tasks from the raw maps to the final maps in total intensity and
linear polarisation. Furthermore, plot routines and several methods for map
analysis are available. The NOD3 package is written in Python which allows to
extend the package by additional tasks. The required data format for the input
maps is FITS.
  NOD3 is a sophisticated tool to process and analyse maps from single-dish
observations that are affected by 'scanning effects' due to clouds, receiver
instabilities, or radio-frequency interference (RFI). The 'basket-weaving' tool
combines orthogonally scanned maps to a final map that is almost free of
scanning effects. The new restoration tool for dual-beam observations reduces
the noise by a factor of about two compared to the NOD2 version. Combining
single-dish with interferometer data in the map plane ensures the full recovery
of the total flux density.

identification model with imbalanced training data. This problem naturally
exists in many real scenarios including large-scale celebrity recognition,
movie actor annotation, etc. Our solution contains two components. First, we
build a face feature extraction model, and improve its performance, especially
for the persons with very limited training samples, by introducing a
regularizer to the cross entropy loss for the multi-nomial logistic regression
(MLR) learning. This regularizer encourages the directions of the face features
from the same class to be close to the direction of their corresponding
classification weight vector in the logistic regression. Second, we build a
multi-class classifier using MLR on top of the learned face feature extraction
model. Since the standard MLR has poor generalization capability for the
one-shot classes even if these classes have been oversampled, we propose a
novel supervision signal called underrepresented-classes promotion loss, which
aligns the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes (a.k.a.
underrepresented-classes) to those of the normal classes. In addition to the
original cross entropy loss, this new loss term effectively promotes the
underrepresented classes in the learned model and leads to a remarkable
improvement in face recognition performance.

find that across the superradiant transition, the cavity light can be emitted
in any superposition of these two cavity modes. This indicates an additional
$U(1)$ symmetry that does not exist in the full Hamiltonian. In this letter we
show that this symmetry is an emergent symmetry in the vicinity of the phase
transition. We identify all the necessary conditions that are required for this
emergent $U(1)$ symmetry and show that the ETH experiment is a special case
that satisfies these conditions. We further show that the superradiant
transition in this system can also be driven to a first order one when the
system is tuned away from the point having the emergent symmetry.

performed under fine pressure tuning find that, as the Mott transition is
approached, the Fermi-liquid coherence temperature continuously falls to the

the charge gap gradually closes in the insulator side. The Clausius-Clapeyron

counter-rotating circular fields with frequency ratio 2:1, has recently
permitted to generate high harmonics with essentially circular polarization,
opening the way for ultrafast chiral studies. This scheme produces harmonic
lines at 3N + 1 and 3N + 2 multiples of the fundamental driving frequency,
while the 3N lines are forbidden owing to the three-fold symmetry of the field.
It is generally established that the routinely observed signals at these
forbidden harmonic lines come from a slight ellipticity in the driving fields,
which breaks the three-fold symmetry. We find that this is neither the only nor
it is the dominant mechanism responsible. The forbidden lines can be observed
even for perfectly circular, long driving pulses. We show that they encode rich
information on the sub-cycle electronic dynamics that occur during the
generation process. By varying the time delay and relative intensity between
the two drivers, we demonstrate that when the second harmonic either precedes
or is more intense than the fundamental field, the dynamical symmetry of the
system is broken by electrons trapped in Rydberg orbits (i.e., Freeman
resonances), and that the forbidden harmonic lines are a witness of this.

short-range repulsive correlations between the hot spots systematically
decreases the values of NSC(2,3) and NSC(2,4) in mid-to-ultra central

floods. Some of these have been attributed to tsunami events. Doggerland in the
southern North Sea is a submerged landscape thought to have been heavily
affected by a tsunami such that it was abandoned by Mesolithic human
populations at the time of the event. The tsunami was generated by the Storegga
submarine landslide off the Norwegian coast which failed around 8150 years ago.
At this time there were also rapid changes in sea level associated with
deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet and drainage of its large proglacial
lakes, with the largest sea level jumps occurring just prior to the Storegga
event. The tsunami affected a large area of the North Atlantic leaving
sedimentary deposits across the region, from Greenland, through the Faroes, the
UK, Norway and Denmark. From these sediments, run-up heights of up to 20 metres
have been estimated in the Shetland Isles and several metres on mainland
Scotland. However, sediments are not preserved everywhere and so reconstructing
how the tsunami propagated across the North Atlantic before inundating the
landscape must be performed using numerical models. These models can also be
used to recreate the tsunami interactions with now submerged landscapes, such
as Doggerland. Here, the Storegga submarine slide is simulated, generating a
tsunami which is then propagated across the North Atlantic and used to
reconstruct the inundation on the Shetlands, Moray Firth and Doggerland. The
uncertainty in reconstructing palaeobathymetry and the Storegga slide itself
results in lower inundation levels than the sediment deposits suggest. Despite
these uncertainties, these results suggest Doggerland was not as severely
affected as previous studies implied. It is suggested therefore that the
abandonment of Doggerland was primarily caused by rapid sea level rise prior to
the tsunami event.

narrowing computations in Maude. The most recent version of Maude, version
2.7.1, provides quite sophisticated unification features, including
order-sorted equational unification for convergent theories modulo axioms such
as associativity, commutativity, and identity (ACU). This novel equational
unification relies on built-in generation of the set of 'variants' of a term
$t$, i.e., the canonical form of $t \sigma$ for a computed substitution
$\sigma$. Variant generation relies on a novel narrowing strategy called
'folding variant narrowing' that opens up new applications in formal reasoning,
theorem proving, testing, protocol analysis, and model checking, especially
when the theory satisfies the 'finite variant property', i.e., there is a
finite number of most general variants for every term in the theory. However,
variant narrowing computations can be extremely involved and are simply
presented in text format by Maude, often being too heavy to be debugged or even
understood. The GLINTS system provides support for (i) determining whether a
given theory satisfies the finite variant property, (ii) thoroughly exploring
variant narrowing computations, (iii) automatic checking of node 'embedding'
and 'closedness' modulo axioms, and (iv) querying and inspecting selected parts
of the variant trees. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

to detect possible post-outburst 'rebrightenings', similar to those seen after
its 2008 outburst. We did not detect any rebrightening behaviour, suggesting
that the physical mechanism behind the rebrightening events is not always
active after each outburst of the source. Any model attempting to explain these
rebrightenings should thus be able to reproduce the different outburst profiles
of the source at different times. Surprisingly, our Swift/XRT observations were
unable to detect the source, contrary to previous Swift/XRT observations in
quiescence. We determined a temperature upper limit of $\leq$ 106 eV, much
colder than the post 2008 outburst value of $\sim$ 145 eV. We also report on an
archival Chandra observation of the source after its 2011 outburst and found a
temperature of $\sim$ 126 eV. These different temperatures, including the
non-detection very close after the end of the 2015/2016 outburst, are difficult
to explain in any model assuming we observe the cooling emission from a neutron
star core or an accretion-heated crust. We discuss our observations in the
context of a change in envelope (the outer $\sim$ 100 m of the crust)
composition and (possibly in combination with) a cooling crust. Both hypotheses
cannot explain our results unless potentially unrealistic assumptions are made.
Irrespective of what causes the temperature variability, it is clear that the
neutron star in SAX J1750.8-2900 may not be as hot as previously assumed.

ill-understood. In order to get a good grasp of the physical picture and to
draw guidelines for thermoelectric enhancement, we use a tight-binding model
containing a conduction band hybridized with a flat band. We find that the
conductivity is suppressed in a wide energy range near the resonance, but that
the Seebeck coefficient can be boosted for strong enough hybridization, thus
allowing for a significant increase of the power factor. The Seebeck
coefficient can also display a sign change as the Fermi level crosses the
resonance. Our results suggest that in order to boost the power factor, the
hybridization strength must not be too low, the resonant level must not be too
close to the conduction (or valence) band edge, and the Fermi level must be
located around, but not inside, the resonant peak.

regime if the persistence length is larger than the potential range, and (iii)
for finite polymers, a novel crossover to a rigid rod regime if the deflection

finite size corrections arise because the correlation length exceeds the
contour length. In the rigid rod regime, however, it is essential how the
global orientational or translational degrees of freedom are restricted by
grafting or confinement. We discuss finite size corrections for polymers
grafted to the adsorbing surface and for polymers confined by a second

network pervading a tissue to provide a uniform supply of nutrients, minerals,

scaling argument and numerical simulations on how flow dynamics and network
architecture control active spread and uniform supply of metabolites by
studying the example of xylem vessels in plants. We identify the fluid inflow
rate as the key factor for uniform supply. While at low inflow rates
metabolites are already exhausted close to flow inlets, too high inflow flushes
metabolites through the network and deprives tissue close to inlets of supply.
In between these two regimes, there exists an optimal inflow rate that yields a
uniform supply of metabolites. We determine this optimal inflow analytically in
quantitative agreement with numerical results. Optimizing network architecture
by reducing the supply variance over all network tubes, we identify patterns of
tube dilation or contraction that compensate sub-optimal supply for the case of
too low or too high inflow rate.

function system (GIFS in short), a particular extension of classical IFS.
Instead of families of selfmaps of a metric space $X$, they considered families
of mappings defined on finite Cartesian product $X^m$. It turned out that a
great part of the classical Hutchinson--Barnsley theory has natural counterpart
in this GIFSs' case. Recently, Secelean extended these considerations to
mappings defined on the space $\ell_\infty(X)$ of all bounded sequences of
elements of $X$ and obtained versions of the Hutchinson--Barnsley theorem for
appropriate families of such functions. In the paper we study some further
aspects of Secelean's setting. In particular, we introduce and investigate a
bit more restrictive framework and we show that some problems of the theory
have more natural solutions within such a case. Finally, we present an example
which shows that this extended theory of GIFSs gives us fractal sets that
cannot be obtained by any IFSs or even by any GIFSs.%In a recent paper of the
authors and Jachymski we itroduced fixed point theory for mappings defined on
$\ell_\infty(X)$ product of a metric space $X$. In this note we use this
approach to study a version of Hutchinson--Barnsley theory of fractals for
function systems consisting of such mappings. In particular, we generalize the
earlier concept of generalized generated function systems introduced by Mihail

the tangent bundle by smooth subbundles which is compatible with the Lie
bracket of vector fields in a certain sense. The Lie bracket of vector fields
then induces a bilinear operation on the associated graded of each tangent
space of $M$ making it into a nilpotent graded Lie algebra. Assuming that these
symbol algebras are the same for all points, one obtains a natural frame bundle
for the associated graded to the tangent bundle, and filtered G--structures are
defined as reductions of structure group of this bundle.
  Generalizing the case of parabolic geometries, this article is devoted to the
question of whether a filtered G-structure of given type determines a canonical
Cartan connection on an extended bundle. As for existence, the result are
roughly as general as Morimoto's theorem from 1993, but it has several specific
features. First, we allow for general candidates for a homogeneous model and a
general version of normalization conditions. Second, the construction is
entirely phrased in terms of Lie algebra valued forms and leads to an explicit
characterization of the canonical Cartan connection. To verify that the
procedure can be applied to a given type of filtered G-structures, only finite
dimensional algebraic verifications have to be carried out.

one hand the two-body potential has a strong repulsion at short distances. On
the other hand, the extremely weak binding of the helium dimer locates this
system very close to the unitary limit allowing for a description based on an
effective theory. At leading order of this theory a two- and a three-body term
appear, each one characterized by a low energy constant. In a potential model
this description corresponds to a soft potential model with a two-body term
purely attractive plus a three-body term purely repulsive constructed to
describe the dimer and trimer binding energies. Here we analyse the capability
of this model to describe the saturation properties making a direct link
between the low energy scale and the short-range correlations. We will show
that the energy per particle, $E_N/N$, can be obtained with reasonable accuracy

dispersion. In this problem, $n$ robots are placed in an $n$ node graph
arbitrarily and must coordinate with each other to reach a final configuration
such that exactly one robot is at each node. We study this problem through the
lenses of minimizing the memory required by each robot and of minimizing the
number of rounds required to achieve dispersion.
  Dispersion is of interest due to its relationship to the problems of
scattering on a graph, exploration using mobile robots, and load balancing on a
graph. Additionally, dispersion has an immediate real world application due to
its relationship to the problem of recharging electric cars, as each car can be
considered a robot and recharging stations and the roads connecting them nodes
and edges of a graph respectively. Since recharging is a costly affair relative
to traveling, we want to distribute these cars amongst the various available
recharge points where communication should be limited to car-to-car
interactions.
  We provide lower bounds on both the memory required for robots to achieve
dispersion and the minimum running time to achieve dispersion on any type of
graph. We then analyze the trade-offs between time and memory for various types
of graphs. We provide time optimal and memory optimal algorithms for several
types of graphs and show the power of a little memory in terms of running time.

When a large number of pairs are given, we show that every rotated spin-J Bell

one-half Bell states, at a rate determined by the quantum Fisher information.
This result provides the foundation for the definition of an elementary unit of
information about rotations in space, which we call the Cartesian refbit. In
the finite copy scenario, we design machines that approximately break down Bell
states of higher spins into Cartesian refbits, as well as machines that
approximately implement the inverse process. In addition, we establish a
quantitative link between the conversion of Bell states and the simulation of
unitary gates, showing that the fidelity of probabilistic state conversion
provides upper and lower bounds on the fidelity of deterministic gate
simulation. The result holds not only for rotation gates, but also to all sets

excitonic, spin and superconducting order form an epitomic material class in
this respect. Theoretical studies of materials like NbS$_2$ have focused on the
electron-phonon coupling whereas the Coulomb interaction, particularly strong
in the monolayer limit, remained essentially untouched. Here, we analyze the
interplay of short- and long-range Coulomb as well as electron-phonon
interactions in NbS$_2$ monolayers. The combination of these interactions
causes electronic correlations that are fundamentally different to what would
be expected from the interaction terms separately. The fully interacting
electronic spectral function resembles the non-interacting band structure but
with appreciable broadening. An unexpected coexistence of strong charge and
spin fluctuations puts NbS$_2$ close to spin and charge order, suggesting
monolayer NbS$_2$ as a platform for atomic scale engineering of electronic
quantum phases.

${\sim}1.4\times10^{36}$ erg/s and ${\sim}5\times10^{35}$ erg/s which are
complemented by 9 Swift observations. The data clearly confirm indications seen
in earlier data that the source's spectral shape softens as it becomes fainter.
The smooth, exponential rollover at high energies present in the first
observation evolves to a much more abrupt steepening of the spectrum at $20-30$
keV. The continuum evolution can be well described with emission from a
magnetized accretion column, modeled using the compmag model modified by an
additional Gaussian emission component for the fainter observation. Between the
two observations, the optical depth changes from $0.75\pm0.04$ to
$0.56^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$, the electron temperature remains constant, and there is
an indication that the column decreases in radius. Since the energy resolved
pulse profiles remain virtually unchanged in shape between the two
observations, the emission properties of the accretion column, however, reflect
the same accretion regime. This conclusion is also confirmed by our result that
the energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at ${\sim}45$
keV is independent of the luminosity, implying that the magnetic field in the
region in which the observed radiation is produced is the same in both
observations. Finally, we also constrain the evolution of the continuum
parameters with rotational phase of the neutron star. The width of the CRSF
could only be constrained for the brighter observation. Based on Monte-Carlo
simulations of CRSF formation in single accretion columns, its pulse phase
dependence supports a simplified fan beam emission pattern. The evolution of
the CRSF width is very similar to that of the CRSF depth, which is in
disagreement with expectations.

freely accessible knowledge that can be accessed via LOD, exploiting LOD for

graph-based or using different machine learning models with LOD-enabled
features. Many of the previous approaches require construction of an additional
graph to run graph-based algorithms or to extract path-based features by
combining user- item interactions (e.g., likes, dislikes) and background
knowledge from LOD. In this paper, we investigate Factorization Machines (FMs)
based on particularly lightweight LOD-enabled features which can be directly
obtained via a public SPARQL Endpoint without any additional effort to
construct a graph. Firstly, we aim to study whether using FM with these
lightweight LOD-enabled features can provide competitive performance compared
to a learning-to-rank approach leveraging LOD as well as other well-established
approaches such as kNN-item and BPRMF. Secondly, we are interested in finding
out to what extent each set of LOD-enabled features contributes to the
recommendation performance. Experimental evaluation on a standard dataset shows
that our proposed approach using FM with lightweight LOD-enabled features
provides the best performance compared to other approaches in terms of five
evaluation metrics. In addition, the study of the recommendation performance
based on different sets of LOD-enabled features indicate that property-object
lists and PageRank scores of items are useful for improving the performance,
and can provide the best performance through using them together for FM. We
observe that subject-property lists of items does not contribute to the
recommendation performance but rather decreases the performance.

al. who studied relaxation dynamics of a small lattice system of interacting

  Approach in Unconstrained Poses","International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2017",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facial alignment involves finding a set of landmark points on an image with a
known semantic meaning. However, this semantic meaning of landmark points is
often lost in 2D approaches where landmarks are either moved to visible
boundaries or ignored as the pose of the face changes. In order to extract
consistent alignment points across large poses, the 3D structure of the face
must be considered in the alignment step. However, extracting a 3D structure
from a single 2D image usually requires alignment in the first place. We
present our novel approach to simultaneously extract the 3D shape of the face
and the semantically consistent 2D alignment through a 3D Spatial Transformer
Network (3DSTN) to model both the camera projection matrix and the warping
parameters of a 3D model. By utilizing a generic 3D model and a Thin Plate
Spline (TPS) warping function, we are able to generate subject specific 3D
shapes without the need for a large 3D shape basis. In addition, our proposed
network can be trained in an end-to-end framework on entirely synthetic data
from the 300W-LP dataset. Unlike other 3D methods, our approach only requires
one pass through the network resulting in a faster than real-time alignment.
Evaluations of our model on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW)

are a three-dimensional counterpart to the characteristic random behaviour of

around one another to give distinctly different large scale behaviours. By
tracing numerically the structure of the vortices, their conformations are
shown to follow recent analytical predictions for random vortex tangles with
periodic boundaries, where the local disorder of the model `averages out' to
produce large scale power law scaling relations whose universality classes do
not depend on the local physics. These results explain previous numerical
measurements in terms of an explicit effect of the periodic boundaries, where
the statistics of the vortices are strongly affected by the large scale
connectedness of the system even at arbitrarily high energies. The statistics
are investigated primarily for static (monochromatic) wavefields, but the
analytical results are further shown to directly describe the reconnection

independent of the reference unit. The addits of a pointed inclusion system are
shown to be in natural correspondence with the addits of the generated pointed
product system. The theory of amalgamated products is developed using addits
and roots, and an explicit formula for the amalgamation of pointed Arveson

$\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p_i$. The $k$'th power of this distribution, for $k$ in a
range $[m]$, is the distribution of $P_k = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{(k)}$, where each
Bernoulli random variable $X_i^{(k)}$ has $\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(k)}] = (p_i)^k$.
The learning algorithm can query any power $P_k$ several times and succeeds in
learning all powers in the range, if with probability at least $1- \delta$:
given any $k \in [m]$, it returns a probability distribution $Q_k$ with total
variation distance from $P_k$ at most $\epsilon$. We provide almost matching
lower and upper bounds on query complexity for this problem. We first show a
lower bound on the query complexity on PBD powers instances with many distinct
parameters $p_i$ which are separated, and we almost match this lower bound by
examining the query complexity of simultaneously learning all the powers of a
special class of PBD's resembling the PBD's of our lower bound. We study the
fundamental setting of a Binomial distribution, and provide an optimal
algorithm which uses $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Diakonikolas, Kane and Stewart
[COLT'16] showed a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{1/\epsilon})$ samples to learn the
$p_i$'s within error $\epsilon$. The question whether sampling from powers of
PBDs can reduce this sampling complexity, has a negative answer since we show
that the exponential number of samples is inevitable. Having sampling access to
the powers of a PBD we then give a nearly optimal algorithm that learns its
$p_i$'s. To prove our two last lower bounds we extend the classical minimax
risk definition from statistics to estimating functions of sequences of
distributions.

has reported its first result of the total CR $e^\pm$ spectrum from $25
\,\mathrm{GeV}$ to $4.6 \,\mathrm{TeV}$ with high precision. In this work, we
study the DM annihilation and pulsar interpretations of the DAMPE high energy
$e^\pm$ spectrum. In the DM scenario, the leptonic annihilation channels to
$\tau^+\tau^-$, $4\mu$, $4\tau$, and mixed charged lepton final states can well
fit the DAMPE result, while the $\mu^+\mu^-$ channel has been excluded. In
addition, we find that the mixed charged leptons channel would lead to a sharp
drop at $\sim$ $\mathrm{TeV}$. However, these DM explanations are almost
excluded by the observations of gamma-ray and CMB, unless some complicated DM
models are introduced. In the pulsar scenario, we analyze 21 nearby known
pulsars and assume that one of them is the primary source of high energy CR
$e^\pm$.Considering the constraint from the Fermi-LAT observation of the
$e^\pm$ anisotropy, we find that two pulsars are possible to explain the DAMPE

annihilation and single pulsar explanations of high energy $e^\pm$ with the

deformations of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) is well
understood, and can be defined by comparing the partition function of the
massive model to that of a CFT. This temperature-dependent effective charge
interpolates monotonically between the central charge values corresponding to
the IR and UV fixed points at low and high temperatures, respectively. We
propose a non-equilibrium, time-dependent generalization of the effective
central charge for integrable models after a quantum quench, $c_{\rm eff}(t)$,
obtained by comparing the return amplitude to that of a CFT quench. We study
this proposal for a large mass quench of a free boson, where the charge is seen
to interpolate between $c_{\rm eff}=0$ at $t=0$, and $c_{\rm eff}\sim 1$ at
$t\to\infty$, as is expected. We use our effective charge to define an ""Ising
to Tricritical Ising"" quench protocol, where the charge evolves from $c_{\rm
eff}=1/2$ at $t=0$, to $c_{\rm eff}=7/10$ at $t\to\infty$, the corresponding
values of the first two unitary minimal CFT models. We then argue that the
inverse ""Tricritical Ising to Ising"" quench is impossible with our methods.
These conclusions can be generalized for quenches between any two adjacent
unitary minimal CFT models. We finally study a large mass quench into the
""staircase model"" (sinh-Gordon with a particular complex coupling). At short
times after the quench, the effective central charge increases in a discrete
""staircase"" structure, where the values of the charge at the steps can be
computed in terms of the central charges of unitary minimal CFT models. When
the initial state is a pure state, one always finds that $c_{\rm
eff}(t\to\infty)\geq c_{\rm eff}(t=0)$, though $c_{\rm eff}(t)$, generally
oscillates at finite times. We explore how this constraint may be related to RG
flow irreversibility.

HI distribution in direction of two WSRT fields, Horologium and Auriga; both
are well known for their prominent radio-polarimetric depolarization canals. At
349 MHz the observed pattern in total intensity is insignificant but polarized
intensity and polarization angle show prominent ubiquitous structures with so
far unknown origin. Apodizing the HI survey data by applying a rotational
symmetric 50 percent Tukey window, we derive average and position angle
dependent power spectra. We fit power laws and characterize anisotropies in the
power distribution. We use a Gaussian analysis to determine relative abundances
for the cold and warm neutral medium. For the analyzed radio-polarimetric
targets significant anisotropies are detected in the HI power spectra; their
position angles are aligned to the prominent depolarization canals, initially
detected by WSRT. HI anisotropies are associated with steep power spectra.
Steep power spectra, associated with cold gas, are detected also in other
fields. Radio-polarimetric depolarization canals are associated with
filamentary HI structures that belong to the cold neutral medium (CNM).
Anisotropies in the CNM are in this case linked to a steepening of the
power-spectrum spectral index, indicating that phase transitions in a turbulent

marginally bound spherical orbit. This critical geodesic represents the
innermost spherical orbit which is bound to the central black hole. The radii
$r_{\text{mb}}({\bar a})$ of the marginally bound {\it equatorial} circular
geodesics of rotating Kerr black holes were found analytically by Bardeen {\it
et. al.} more than four decades ago (here $\bar a\equiv J/M^2$ is the
dimensionless angular-momentum of the black hole). On the other hand, no
closed-form formula exists in the literature for the radii of generic ({\it
non}-equatorial) marginally bound geodesics of the rotating Kerr spacetime. In
the present study we analyze the critical (marginally bound) orbits of rapidly
rotating Kerr black holes. In particular, we derive a simple {\it analytical}
formula for the radii $r_{\text{mb}}(\bar a\simeq 1;\cos i)$ of the marginally
bound spherical orbits, where $\cos i$ is an effective inclination angle (with
respect to the black-hole equatorial plane) of the geodesic. We find that the
marginally bound spherical orbits of rapidly-rotating black holes are
characterized by a critical inclination angle, $\cos i=\sqrt{{2/3}}$, above
which the coordinate radii of the geodesics approach the black-hole radius in
the extremal $\bar a\to1$ limit. It is shown that this critical inclination
angle signals a transition in the physical properties of the orbits: in
particular, it separates marginally bound spherical geodesics which lie a
finite proper distance from the black-hole horizon from marginally bound
geodesics which lie an infinite proper distance from the horizon.

monotonic versions of count and sum aggregates proposed in (Mazuran et al.

positive numbers, are monotonic in the lattice of set-containment, they
preserve the fixpoint semantics of Horn Clauses. However, in many applications
of practical interest, their use can lead to inefficiencies, that can be
eliminated by combining them with max, whereby mcount and msum become the
standard count and sum. Therefore, the semantics and optimization techniques of
Datalog are extended to recursive programs with min, max, count and sum, making

same. Therefore, instead of the actual fields, the potentials are equally
employed and their gauge invariance results in an infinite-dimensional
equivalence algebra, which nevertheless projects to finite-dimensional symmetry
algebras. Subsequently, optimal systems of equivalence subalgebras are obtained

an eroded surface whose dynamics are ruled by cellular automaton. Starting from
the automaton, we obtain the time evolution of the height average and height
variance (roughness). We apply this method to the etching model in 1 + 1
dimensions, and then we obtain the roughness exponent. Using this in
conjunction with the Galilean invariance we obtain the other exponents, which
perfectly match the numerical results obtained from simulations. These
exponents are exact, and they are the same as those exhibited by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model for this dimension. Therefore, our results
provide proof for the conjecture that the etching and KPZ models belong to the
same universality class. Moreover, the method is general, and it can be applied
to other cellular automata models.

generating an outfit with multimodal (images/text) specifications from a user.
To this end, we propose to jointly learn a visual-semantic embedding and the

specifically, we consider a fashion outfit to be a sequence (usually from top

Given the fashion items in an outfit, we train a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
model to sequentially predict the next item conditioned on previous ones to
learn their compatibility relationships. Further, we learn a visual-semantic
space by regressing image features to their semantic representations aiming to
inject attribute and category information as a regularization for training the

BP-CNN architecture for channel decoding under correlated noise. This
architecture concatenates a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with a
standard belief-propagation (BP) decoder. The standard BP decoder is used to
estimate the coded bits, followed by a CNN to remove the estimation errors of
the BP decoder and obtain a more accurate estimation of the channel noise.
Iterating between BP and CNN will gradually improve the decoding SNR and hence
result in better decoding performance. To train a well-behaved CNN model, we
define a new loss function which involves not only the accuracy of the noise
estimation but also the normality test for the estimation errors, i.e., to
measure how likely the estimation errors follow a Gaussian distribution. The
introduction of the normality test to the CNN training shapes the residual
noise distribution and further reduces the BER of the iterative decoding,
compared to using the standard quadratic loss function. We carry out extensive
experiments to analyze and verify the proposed framework. The iterative BP-CNN
decoder has better BER performance with lower complexity, is suitable for
parallel implementation, does not rely on any specific channel model or
encoding method, and is robust against training mismatches. All of these
features make it a good candidate for decoding modern channel codes.

research tool in this field of social science using a large set of micro-data

research question is the following: to what extent did/do global Japanese
business networks mirror organizational models existing in Japan? In
particular, we would like to assess how much the links building such business
networks are shaped by the structure of big-size industrial conglomerates of
firms headquartered in Japan, also described as HK. The major part of the
academic community in the fields of management and industrial organization
considers that formal links can be identified among firms belonging to HK. Miwa
and Ramseyer (Miwa and Ramseyer 2002; Ramseyer 2006) challenge this claim and
argue that the evidence supporting the existence of HK is weak. So far,
quantitative empirical investigation has been conducted exclusively using data
for firms incorporated in Japan. Our study tests the Miwa-Ramseyer hypothesis
(MRH) at the global level using information on the network of Japanese
subsidiaries overseas. The results obtained lead us to reject the MRH for the
global dataset, as well as for subsets restricted to the two main
regions/countries of destination of Japanese foreign investment. The results
are robust to the weighting of the links, with different specifications, and
are observed in most industrial sectors. The global Japanese network became
increasingly complex during the late 20th century as a consequence of increase
in the number of Japanese subsidiaries overseas but the key features of the
structure remained rather stable. We draw implications of these findings for

Phylogenies are commonly estimated from molecular sequences, such as DNA
sequences, collected from the species of interest. At a high level, the idea
behind this inference is simple: the further apart in the Tree of Life are two
species, the greater is the number of mutations to have accumulated in their
genomes since their most recent common ancestor. In order to obtain accurate
estimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ
statistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a

about the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are
insertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.
  Properly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a

thus, merits study for its own sake. The analysis of neural synchronization
naturally leads to the study of repetitive spiking and consequently to the
analysis of coupled neural oscillators. Coupled oscillator theory thus informs
the synchronization of spiking neuronal networks. A crucial aspect of coupled
oscillator theory is the phase response curve (PRC), which describes the impact
of a perturbation to the phase of an oscillator. In neural terms, the
perturbation represents an incoming synaptic potential which may either advance
or retard the timing of the next spike. The phase response curves and the form
of coupling between reciprocally coupled oscillators defines the phase
interaction function, which in turn predicts the synchronization outcome
(in-phase versus anti-phase) and the rate of convergence. We review the two
classes of PRC and demonstrate the utility of the phase model in predicting
synchronization in reciprocally coupled neural models. In addition, we compare
the rate of convergence for all combinations of reciprocally coupled Class I
and Class II oscillators. These findings predict the general synchronization
outcomes of broad classes of neurons under both inhibitory and excitatory

of such codes has been given under both the Euclidean and Hermitian products.
However, in each case, the formula for self-dual cyclic codes of length $n$
over a finite field contains a characteristic function which is not easily
computed. In this paper, we focus on more efficient ways to enumerate self-dual
cyclic codes of lengths $2^\nu p^r$ and $2^\nu p^rq^s$, where $\nu$, $r$, and
$s$ are positive integers. Some number theoretical tools are established. Based
on these results, alternative formulas and efficient algorithms to determine
the number of self-dual cyclic codes of such lengths are provided.

coefficient between the X-ray and optical radiation is close to 0.5. Such poor
correlation can be explained by the influence of an SN 1a explosion in close
proximity to the nucleus of NGC 7469. The SN manifests itself in the optical
band but does not affect the X-ray variability pattern. Comparison of the
variability data in 2009 reveals a good correlation between the optical (U

about 0.93. The correlation coefficient and the lag depend on the wavelength in

uniform to homeotropic anchoring as a function of the anchoring strength and
the particle size. In the presence of a flow field, in addition to fluid
viscous stresses on the particle, nematic-induced elastic stresses are exerted
as a result of the anchoring conditions. The resulting forces are shown to
offer the possibility of size-based separation of individual particles. For
multi-particle systems, the nematic forces induce inter-particle attraction

of increasing their over-segmentations to 16%. According to our occlusion

data, each of which characterizes the data from a distinct aspect. Several
previous algorithms have demonstrated that one can achieve better clustering
accuracy by integrating information from all views appropriately than using
only an individual view. Owing to the effectiveness of spectral clustering,
many multi-view clustering methods are based on it. Unfortunately, they have
limited applicability to large-scale data due to the high computational
complexity of spectral clustering. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view
spectral clustering method for large-scale data. Our approach is structured
under the guided co-training scheme to fuse distinct views, and uses the
sampling technique to accelerate spectral clustering. More specifically, we
first select $p$ ($\ll n$) landmark points and then approximate the
eigen-decomposition accordingly. The augmented view, which is essential to
guided co-training process, can then be quickly determined by our method. The
proposed algorithm scales linearly with the number of given data. Extensive
experiments have been performed and the results support the advantage of our

introduce young students on advanced concepts in Physics. Atm is an
old-fashioned device. However, it allows us to speak about relativity of
motion, principle of equivalence, inertial and non-inertial frames of
reference, general covariance and invariance under coordinate transformations.
Besides, it also provides experimental support for our theoretical models. We
have started with coordinate transformations and inertial and non inertial
reference frames followed by the principle of equivalence. The composed Atm was
worked out in the following. We calculate the acceleration in the machine
applying Newton's Laws to describe its dynamics in an inertial frame on the
fixed pulley center and in a non-inertial one on the moving pulley center.
Coordinate transformations mapping inertial frame solutions in non-inertial
ones and vice-versa allow students catch on relativity concepts and the role
played by general covariance. A comparison between these solutions showed the
importance of the principle of equivalence in the evaluation of the intensity
of gravity locally. In addition, according to this coordinate transformation
the non-inertial reference frame equations of motion are equivalent to one
single Atm plus one falling mass. Our results have also shown, in agreement
with experimental outcomes, that after movement starts single Atm becomes
lighter than $m_{3}$ mass, consequently $m_{3}$ mass is falling. It is a
non-intuitive experimental result first observed for the 1854 Poggendorff's
fall machine. A measure of single Atm's mass reduction was reported in 2016's
last issue of Physics Education.

this paper we propose a machine intelligent approach for heart-rate estimation
from electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected using wearable devices. The novelty
of our approach lies in (1) encoding spatio-temporal properties of ECG signals
directly into spike train and using this to excite recurrently connected
spiking neurons in a Liquid State Machine computation model; (2) a novel
learning algorithm; and (3) an intelligently designed unsupervised readout
based on Fuzzy c-Means clustering of spike responses from a subset of neurons
(Liquid states), selected using particle swarm optimization. Our approach
differs from existing works by learning directly from ECG signals (allowing
personalization), without requiring costly data annotations. Additionally, our
approach can be easily implemented on state-of-the-art spiking-based
neuromorphic systems, offering high accuracy, yet significantly low energy
footprint, leading to an extended battery life of wearable devices. We
validated our approach with CARLsim, a GPU accelerated spiking neural network
simulator modeling Izhikevich spiking neurons with Spike Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic scaling. A range of subjects are considered
from in-house clinical trials and public ECG databases. Results show high
accuracy and low energy footprint in heart-rate estimation across subjects with
and without cardiac irregularities, signifying the strong potential of this
approach to be integrated in future wearable devices.

Fourier analysis of the first harmonic to study networks subjected to pendular
behavior. In this context, pendular behavior is characterized by the phenomenon
of people's dislocation from their homes to work in the morning and people's
dislocation in the opposite direction in the afternoon. Pendular behavior is a
relevant phenomenon that takes place in public transport networks because it
may reduce the overall efficiency of the system as a result of the asymmetric
utilization of the system in different directions. We apply this methodology to
the bus transport system of Brasilia, which is a city that has commercial and
residential activities in distinct boroughs. We show that this methodology can
be used to characterize the pendular behavior of this system, identifying the
most critical nodes and times of the day when this system is in more severe
demanded.

context of predicative point-free topology using the constructive notion of
located subset. We present the patch topology of a stably locally compact
formal topology by a geometric theory whose models are the points of the given
topology that are located, and the Lawson topology of a continuous lattice by a
geometric theory whose models are the located subsets of the given lattice. We
also give a predicative presentation of the frame of perfect nuclei on a stably
locally compact formal topology, and show that it is essentially the same as
our geometric presentation of the patch topology. Moreover, the construction of
Lawson topologies naturally induces a monad on the category of compact regular
formal topologies, which is shown to be isomorphic to the Vietoris monad.
