individuals is very relevant information in population studies. It has been
modeled by the Langevin and the Fokker- Planck equations. A major problem with
these equations is that they allow the physiological age to move back in time.
This paper proposes an Infinitesimally ratcheted random walk as a way to solve
that problem. Two mathematical representations are proposed. One of them uses a
non-local scalar field. The other one is local, but involves a multi-component
field of speed states. These two formulations are compared to each other and to
the Fokker-Planck equation. The relevant properties are discussed. The dynamics
of the mean and variance of the population age resulting from the two proposed
formulations are obtained.

interact with robots. This paper presents a robot system that retrieves
everyday objects with unconstrained natural language descriptions. A core issue
for the system is semantic and spatial grounding, which is to infer objects and
their spatial relationships from images and natural language expressions. We
introduce a two-stage neural-network grounding pipeline that maps natural
language referring expressions directly to objects in the images. The first
stage uses visual descriptions in the referring expressions to generate a
candidate set of relevant objects. The second stage examines all pairwise
relationships between the candidates and predicts the most likely referred
object according to the spatial descriptions in the referring expressions. A
key feature of our system is that by leveraging a large dataset of images
labeled with text descriptions, it allows unrestricted object types and natural
language referring expressions. Preliminary results indicate that our system
outperforms a near state-of-the-art object comprehension system on standard
benchmark datasets. We also present a robot system that follows voice commands
to pick and place previously unseen objects.

relationships. However complex evolutionary events, such as genetic
reassortments or hybrid speciations which occur commonly in viruses, bacteria
and plants, do not fit into this elementary framework. Alternatively, various
network representations have been developed. Circular networks are a natural
generalization of leaf-labeled trees interpreted as split systems, that is,
collections of bipartitions over leaf labels corresponding to current species.
Although such networks do not explicitly model specific evolutionary events of
interest, their straightforward visualization and fast reconstruction have made
them a popular exploratory tool to detect network-like evolution in genetic
datasets.
  Standard reconstruction methods for circular networks, such as Neighbor-Net,
rely on an associated metric on the species set. Such a metric is first
estimated from DNA sequences, which leads to a key difficulty: distantly
related sequences produce statistically unreliable estimates. This is
problematic for Neighbor-Net as it is based on the popular tree reconstruction
method Neighbor-Joining, whose sensitivity to distance estimation errors is
well established theoretically. In the tree case, more robust reconstruction
methods have been developed using the notion of a distorted metric, which
captures the dependence of the error in the distance through a radius of
accuracy. Here we design the first circular network reconstruction method based
on distorted metrics. Our method is computationally efficient. Moreover, the
analysis of its radius of accuracy highlights the important role played by the
maximum incompatibility, a measure of the extent to which the network differs
from a tree.

BO is characterized by the sample efficiency with which it can optimize

to the learning to learn methods: surrogate models (typically in the form of
Gaussian processes) learn the target function and perform intelligent sampling.
This surrogate model can be applied even in the presence of noise; however, as

recognition. This network is capable of selectively focusing on the informative

In dimension two we give a complete characterisation of blow-up solutions
depending on the coefficients of the polynomials $p^1, p^2$. In particular, we
see that there exists a new type of blow-ups, that we call double-cone
solutions since the coincidence sets $\{u=p^1\}$ and $\{u=p^2\}$ are cones with
a common vertex. We prove the uniqueness of blow-up limits, and analyse the
regularity of the free boundary in dimension two. In particular we show that if
the solution to the double obstacle problem has a double-cone blow-up limit at
the origin, then locally the free boundary consists of four
$C^{1,\gamma}$-curves, meeting at the origin. In the end we give an example of
a three-dimensional double-cone solution.

around a massive O or Be star, with their gamma-ray emission powered by pulsar
spindown. The number of such systems in our Galaxy is not known. We aim to
estimate the total number of gamma-ray binaries in our Galaxy and to evaluate
the prospects for new detections in the GeV and TeV energy range, taking into
account that their gamma-ray emission is modulated on the orbital period. We
model the population of gamma-ray binaries and evaluate the fraction of
detected systems in surveys with the Fermi-LAT (GeV), HESS, HAWC and CTA (TeV)
using observation-based and synthetic template lightcurves. The detected
fraction depends more on the orbit-average flux than on the lightcurve shape.
Our best estimate for the number of gamma-ray binaries is 101$_{-52}^{+89}$
systems. A handful of discoveries are expected by pursuing the Fermi-LAT
survey. Discoveries in TeV surveys are less likely. However, this depends on
the relative amounts of power emitted in GeV and TeV domains. There could be as
many as $\approx$200 HESS J0632+057-like systems with a high ratio of TeV to
GeV emission compared to other gamma-ray binaries. Statistics allow for as many
as three discoveries in five years of HAWC observations and five discoveries in
the first two years of the CTA Galactic Plane survey. Continued Fermi-LAT
observations are favoured over ground-based TeV surveys to find new gamma-ray
binaries. Gamma-ray observations are most sensitive to short orbital period
systems with a high spindown pulsar power. Radio pulsar surveys (SKA) are
likely to be more efficient in detecting long orbital period systems, providing
a complementary probe into the gamma-ray binary population.

inflated semi-parametric statistical approach relies on the flexibility and
modularity of additive models with the ability of panel data to deal with

the same is not true in higher dimensions. Here we present the experimental

1.0-4.0keV band are measured, indicative of reverberation off the inner
accretion disc. The reverberation lag time is seen to vary as a step function
in frequency; across lower frequency components of the variability, 3e-4 to
1.2e-3Hz a lag of 160s is measured, but the lag shortens to (59 +/- 4)s above
1.2e-3Hz. The lag-energy spectrum reveals differing profiles between these
ranges with a change in the dip showing the earliest arriving photons. The low
frequency signal indicates reverberation of X-rays emitted from a corona
extended at low height over the disc while at high frequencies, variability is
generated in a collimated core of the corona through which luminosity
fluctuations propagate upwards. Principal component analysis of the variability
supports this interpretation, showing uncorrelated variation in the spectral
slope of two power law continuum components. The distinct evolution of the two
components of the corona is seen as a flare passes inwards from the extended to
the collimated portion. An increase in variability in the extended corona was
found preceding the initial increase in X-ray flux. Variability from the
extended corona was seen to die away as the flare passed into the collimated
core leading to a second sharper increase in the X-ray count rate.

intra-search compatibility, and two are especially interesting: they are
largely overlapping between the jets+MET searches and are characterized by low
jet multiplicity, zero $b$-jets, and low MET and $H_T$. We find that resonant
color-triplet production decaying to a quark plus an invisible particle
provides an excellent fit to these two excesses and all other data -- including
the ATLAS jets+MET search, which actually sees a correlated excess. We discuss
the additional constraints coming from dijet resonance searches, monojet

wide-spread view that the LHC data contains no interesting excesses is greatly
exaggerated.

implicitly assumed that the dayside is the hottest hemisphere and the nightside
is the coldest hemisphere. For a given eclipse depth and phase amplitude, an
orbital lag between a planet's peak brightness and its eclipse---a phase
offset---implies that planet's nightside emits greater flux. To quantify how
phase offsets impact the energy budgets of short-period planets, we compile all
infrared observations of the nine planets with multi-band eclipse depths and
phase curves. Accounting for phase offsets shifts planets to lower Bond albedo
and greater day--night heat transport, usually by $\lesssim 1\sigma$. For
WASP-12b, the published phase variations have been analyzed in two different
ways, and the inferred energy budget depends sensitively on which analysis one

$0.27^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$, significantly higher than the published optical
geometric albedo, and a recirculation efficiency of $0.03^{+0.07}_{-0.02}$,

  Methods: We report 7 mm (43 GHz) radio and R-band polarimetric observations
of PKS1510-089. The radio observations were performed at the Itapetinga Radio
Observatory, while the polarimetric data were obtained at the Pico dos Dias
Observatory. The 7 mm observations cover the period between 2011 and 2013,
while the optical polarimetric observations were made between 2009 and 2012.
  Results: At 7 mm, we detected a correlation between four radio and
$\gamma$-ray flares with a delay of about 54 days between them; the higher
frequency counterpart occurred first. Using optical polarimetry, we detected a
large variation in polarization angle (PA) within two days associated with the
beginning of a $\gamma$-ray flare. Complementing our data with other data
obtained in the literature, we show that PA presented rotations associated with
the occurrence of flares.
  Conclusions: Our results can be explained by a shock-in-jet model, in which a
new component is formed in the compact core producing an optical and/or
$\gamma$-ray flare, propagates along the jet, and after some time becomes
optically thin and is detected as a flare at radio frequencies. The variability
in the polarimetric parameters can also be reproduced; we can explain large
variation in both PA and polarization degree (PD), in only one of them, or in
neither, depending on the differences in PA and PD between the jet and the new
component.

function proportional to $M^{-2}$ and a column density distribution with a
power law tail of $\mathrm{d} A/\mathrm{d} \ln\Sigma\propto\Sigma^{-1}$. In the
case where structure formation is controlled by gravity the two-point
correlation becomes $\xi_{2D}\propto R^{-1}$. Furthermore, structures formed by
such processes (e.g. young star clusters, DM halos) tend to a $\rho\propto
R^{-3}$ density profile. We compare these predictions with observations,
analytical fragmentation cascade models, semi-analytical models of
gravito-turbulent fragmentation and detailed ""full physics"" hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that these power-laws are good first order descriptions in
all cases.

new and more efficient approaches to data transfer, computing, and storage
[1-3]. These ideas have been inspiring analogous approaches in photonics, where
the manipulation of an artificially engineered pseudo-spin degrees of freedom
is enabled by synthetic gauge fields acting on light [4,5,6]. The ability to
control these additional degrees of freedom can significantly expand the
landscape of available optical responses, which may revolutionize optical
computing and the basic means of controlling light in photonic devices across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Here we demonstrate a new class of
photonic systems, described by effective Hamiltonians in which competing
synthetic gauge fields engineered in pseudo-spin, chirality/sublattice and
valley subspaces result in band gap opening at one of the valleys, while the
other valley exhibits Dirac-like conical dispersion. It is shown that such
effective response has dramatic implications on photon transport, among which:
(i) spin-polarized and valley-polarized one-way Klein tunneling and (ii)
topological edge states that coexist within the Dirac continuum for opposite
valley and spin polarizations. These phenomena offer new ways to control light
in photonics, in particular for on-chip optical isolation, filtering and
wave-division multiplexing by selective action on their pseudo-spin and valley
degrees of freedom.

stabilized premixed flame. This configuration was studied experimentally under
the Volvo Flygmotor AB program. Two cases are considered in this study: a
non-reacting case with an inlet flow speed of 16.6 m/s and a reacting case with
equilibrium ratio of 0.65 and inflow speed of 17.3 m/s. The characteristic
vortex shedding in the wake behind the bluff body is present in the
non-reacting case, while two oscillation modes are intermittently present in
the reacting case. A series of large-eddy simulations are performed on this
configuration using two solvers, one using a high-resolution finite-volume (FV)
scheme and the other featuring a high-order discontinuous-Galerkin (DG)
discretization. The FV calculations are conducted on hexahedral meshes with
three different resolution (4mm, 2mm, and 1mm). The DG calculations are
performed using two different polynomial orders on the same tetrahedral mesh.
For the non-reacting cases, good agreement with respect to the experimental
data is achieved by both solvers at high numerical resolution. The reacting
cases are calculated using a two-step global mechanism in combination with the
thickened-flame model. Reasonable agreement with experiments is obtained by
both solvers at higher resolution. Models for combustion-turbulence interaction
are necessary for the reacting case as it contains the length scale of the
flame, which is smaller than the grid resolution in all calculations. The
impact of such models on the flame stability and flow/flame dynamics is the
subject of future research.

revealed a detailed cold gas distribution within a $\sim 100$ pc of this LLAGN.
In contrast to the luminous Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, where a $\sim 7$ pc cold
molecular torus was recently revealed, a distinctively dense and compact torus
is missing in our CO(3-2) integrated intensity map of NGC 1097. Based on the
CO(3-2) flux, the gas mass of the torus of NGC 1097 would be a factor of
$\gtrsim 2-3$ less than that found for NGC 1068 by using the same CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor, which implies less active nuclear star formation and/or
inflows in NGC 1097. Our dynamical modeling of the CO(3-2) velocity field
implies that the cold molecular gas is concentrated in a thin layer as compared
to the hot gas traced by the 2.12 $\mu$m H$_2$ emission in and around the
torus. Furthermore, we suggest that NGC 1097 hosts a geometrically thinner
torus than NGC 1068. Although the physical origin of the torus thickness
remains unclear, our observations support a theoretical prediction that
geometrically thick tori with high opacity will become deficient as AGNs evolve

Those were based on a sharpened version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture as
applied to compactifications of the SM to lower dimensions. We argue that the
same line of reasoning implies that for fixed values of $\Lambda_4$ and the
Yukawa coupling of the lightest neutrino $Y_{\nu_1}$, the EW scale is bounded
above. This is a trivial consequence of neutrino masses depending on the Higgs
vev. In the case of massive Majorana neutrinos with a see-saw mechanism
associated to a large scale $M\simeq 10^{10-14}$ GeV and $Y_{\nu_1}\simeq
10^{-3}$, one obtains that the EW scale cannot exceed $M_{EW}\lesssim
10^2-10^4$ GeV. From this point of view, the delicate fine-tuning required to
get a small EW scale would be a mirage, since parameters yielding higher EW
scales would be in the swampland and would not count as possible consistent
theories. This would bring a new perspective into the issue of the EW
hierarchy.

decision-making in medical and environmental studies. However, other research
areas, such as bioinformatics, do not have a specific step-by-step to guide

the most traditional guides to produce SLRs adapted to bioinformatics. To
evaluate our method, we propose a case study to detect and summarize SLRs

amplitude, short term (seconds-days) variability spanning ~ 2 magnitudes, with
an increasing trend of the mean flux from 2012 to 2017 that is steeper than in
any other X-ray binary found to date (0.17 mag/yr). We detected the initial
optical rise of the 2017 outburst of Swift J1357.2-0933, and we report that the
outburst began between April 1 and 6, 2017. Such a steep optical flux rise
preceding an outburst is expected according to disk instability models, but the
high amplitude variability in quiescence is not. Previous studies have shown
that the quiescent spectral, polarimetric and rapid variability properties of
Swift J1357.2-0933 are consistent with synchrotron emission from a weak compact
jet. We find that a variable optical/infrared spectrum is responsible for the
brightening: a steep, red spectrum before and soon after the 2011 outburst
evolves to a brighter, flatter spectrum since 2013. The evolving spectrum
appears to be due to the jet spectral break shifting from the infrared in 2012
to the optical in 2013, then back to the infrared by 2016-2017 while the
optical remains relatively bright. Swift J1357.2-0933 is a valuable source to

identical distributions, the hypothesis that all agents seek a common action is
violated, and thus the hypothesis upon which consensus constraints are

constraints which incentivize nearby nodes to make decisions which are close to
one another but not necessarily coincide. Moreover, agents are not assumed to
receive their sequentially arriving observations on a common time index, and
thus seek to learn in an asynchronous manner. An asynchronous stochastic
variant of the Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point method is proposed to solve this
problem which operates by alternating primal stochastic descent steps and
Lagrange multiplier updates which penalize the discrepancies between agents.
This tool leads to an implementation that allows for each agent to operate
asynchronously with local information only and message passing with neighbors.
Our main result establishes that the proposed method yields convergence in
expectation both in terms of the primal sub-optimality and constraint violation

dictated by the inter-layer exchange. Unbiased Monte Carlo simulations and
simple stabilization arguments reveal face centered cubic and hexagonal close
packed skyrmion crystals for different choices of the inter-layer exchange, in

coupling of the inflaton and moduli fields to electromagnetism via the photon

We demonstrate that the strong coupling problem of inflationary magnetogenesis
can be avoided by incorporating the destabilization of moduli fields after
inflation. The magnetic field always dominates over the electric one, and thus
the severe constraints on the latter from backreaction, which are the demanding
obstacles in the case of a decreasing coupling function, do not apply to the
current scenario. However, we show that this loophole to the strong coupling
problem comes at a price: the normalization of the amplitude of magnetic fields
is determined by this coupling term and is therefore suppressed by a large
factor after the moduli destabilization completes. From this we conclude that
there is no self-consistent and generic realization of primordial
magnetogenesis producing scale-invariant fields in the case of an increasing
kinetic coupling.

In recent years, data on the mix

economic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and
predict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of
economic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy
corrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973
to 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI),
and Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and
20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects
model. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict
economic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most
econometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+
is associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4% to 5%. We then
combine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and
institutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to
predict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls.
Also, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of
corruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that
income is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional
growth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions
for the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained
using ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate

studies or image analysis, nominal $p$-values are often adjusted to improve
control over the family-wise error rate (FWER). When the majority of tests are
null, procedures controlling the False discovery rate (Fdr) can be improved by
replacing the theoretical global null with its empirical estimate. However,
these other adjustment procedures remain sensitive to the working model
assumption. Here we propose two key ideas to improve inference in this space.
First, we propose $p$-values that are standardized to the empirical null
distribution (instead of the theoretical null). Second, we propose model
averaging $p$-values by bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) to account for model
uncertainty and selection procedures. The combination of these two key ideas
yields bagged empirical null $p$-values (BEN $p$-values) that often
dramatically alter the rank ordering of significant findings. Moreover, we find
that a multidimensional selection criteria based on BEN $p$-values and bagged
model fit statistics is more likely to yield reproducible findings. A
re-analysis of the famous Golub Leukemia data is presented to illustrate these
ideas. We uncovered new findings in these data, not detected previously, that
are backed by published bench work pre-dating the Gloub experiment. A
pseudo-simulation using the leukemia data is also presented to explore the
stability of this approach under broader conditions, and illustrates the
superiority of the BEN $p$-values compared to the other approaches.

h2 degrades the PLT. We devise a new domain-sharding technique that isolates

for Fractional Random Walks on $d$-dimensional infinite lattices: The
Fractional Random Walk is transient for dimensions $d > \alpha$ (recurrent for
$d\leq\alpha$) of the lattice. As a consequence for $0<\alpha< 1$ the
Fractional Random Walk is transient for all lattice dimensions $d=1,2,..$ and
in the range $1\leq\alpha < 2$ for dimensions $d\geq 2$. Finally, for
$\alpha=2$ Polya's classical recurrence theorem is recovered, namely the walk
is transient only for lattice dimensions $d\geq 3$. The generalization of
Polya's recurrence theorem remains valid for the class of random walks with
L\'evy flight asymptotics for long-range steps. We also analyze for the
Fractional Random Walk mean first passage probabilities, mean first passage

1D lattice (infinite ring) we obtain for the transient regime $0<\alpha<1$
closed form expressions for the fractional lattice Green's function matrix

probabilities fulfill Riesz potential power law decay asymptotic behavior for

cooperative parameter estimation in a system comprising two information-sharing
agents. The underlying assumption is that the overall two-agent scheme can
reach desired performance level even if only one of the agents performs
satisfactorily, hence there exist two independent opportunities to estimate.
The notion of altruism motivates a new definition of cooperative estimation
optimality that generalizes the common definition of minimum mean squared error
optimality. Fundamental equations are derived for two types of altruistic
cooperative estimation problems, corresponding to heterarchical and
hierarchical setups. Although these equations are, generally, hard to solve,
their solution in the Gaussian case is straightforward and only entails the
computation of the largest eigenvalue of the conditional covariance matrix and
its corresponding eigenvector. Moreover, in the Gaussian case the performance
improvement of the two altruistic cooperative estimation techniques over the
conventional (egoistic) estimation approach is shown to depend on the problem's
dimensionality and statistical distribution. In particular, the performance
improvement grows with the dispersion of the spectrum of the conditional
covariance matrix, rendering the new estimation approach especially appealing
in ill-conditioned problems. The validity of the solution in the Gaussian case
is illustrated numerically.

wavelength routing can be used to route a signal to destination by univocally
associating a routing path to the wavelength of the optical carrier. Such
wavelengths should be chosen so to minimize interferences among optical
channels and to avoid routing faults. As a result, physical parameter selection
of such networks requires the solution of complex constrained optimization
problems. In previous work, published in the proceedings of the International
Conference on Computer-Aided Design, we proposed and solved the problem of
computing the maximum parallelism obtainable in the communication between any
two endpoints while avoiding misrouting of optical signals. The underlying
technology, only quickly mentioned in that paper, is Answer Set Programming
(ASP). In this work, we detail the ASP approach we used to solve such problem.
  Another important design issue is to select the wavelengths of optical
carriers such that they are spread across the available spectrum, in order to
reduce the likelihood that, due to imperfections in the manufacturing process,
unintended routing faults arise. We show how to address such problem in

Kerr-Newman black hole by causing it to absorb matter with sufficient charge
and/or angular momentum as compared with energy that it cannot remain a black
hole. It was previously shown by one of us that such gedanken experiments
cannot succeed for test particle matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black
hole. We generalize this result here to arbitrary matter entering an extremal
Kerr-Newman black hole, provided only that the non-electromagnetic contribution
to the stress-energy tensor of the matter satisfies the null energy condition.
We then analyze the gedanken experiments proposed by Hubeny and others to
over-charge and/or over-spin an initially slightly non-extremal Kerr-Newman
black hole. Analysis of such gedanken experiments requires that we calculate
all effects on the final mass of the black hole that are second-order in the
charge and angular momentum carried into the black hole, including all
self-force effects. We obtain a general formula for the full second order
correction to mass, $\delta^2 M$, which allows us to prove that no gedanken
experiments of the generalized Hubeny type can ever succeed in over-charging
and/or over-spinning a Kerr-Newman black hole, provided only that the
non-electromagnetic stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition.
Our analysis is based upon Lagrangian methods, and our formula for the
second-order correction to mass is obtained by generalizing the canonical
energy analysis of Hollands and Wald to the Einstein-Maxwell case. Remarkably,
we obtain our formula for $\delta^2 M$ without having to explicitly compute
self-force or finite size effects. Indeed, in an appendix, we show explicitly
that our formula incorporates both the self-force and finite size effects for
the special case of a charged body slowly lowered into an uncharged black hole.

dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable physical properties resulting from
their reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetry. The family of semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenides is an especially promising platform for
fundamental studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, with potential
applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics due to their direct band gap
in the monolayer limit and highly efficient light-matter coupling. A crystal
lattice with broken inversion symmetry combined with strong spin-orbit
interactions leads to a unique combination of the spin and valley degrees of
freedom. In addition, the 2D character of the monolayers and weak dielectric
screening from the environment yield a significant enhancement of the Coulomb
interaction. The resulting formation of bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons,
dominates the optical and spin properties of the material. Here we review
recent progress in our understanding of the excitonic properties in monolayer
TMDs and lay out future challenges. We focus on the consequences of the strong
direct and exchange Coulomb interaction, discuss exciton-light interaction and
effects of other carriers and excitons on electron-hole pairs in TMDs. Finally,
the impact on valley polarization is described and the tuning of the energies

follow a disordered long-range-correlated sequence with power-law spectrum.
Depending on the degree of correlations of the disorder, a set of extended
modes emerge in the middle of the band yielding an interplay between
localization and delocalization. As a consequence, a rich variety of
entanglement distribution patterns arises, which we evaluate here through the
concurrence between two spins. We show that, even in the presence of disorder,
the entanglement wave can be pushed to spread out reaching distant sites and
also enhance pairwise entanglement between the initial site and the rest of the
chain. We also study the propagation of an initial maximally-entangled state
through the chain and show that correlated disorder improves the transmission
quite significantly when compared with the uncorrelated counterpart. Our work

whichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where it
appears and its neighbors in $G_N$. Tasks have unit-mean exponential service
times and leave the system upon service completion.
  The above model has been extensively investigated in the case $G_N$ is a

process is quite tractable, and it has been proved that for any $\lambda < 1$,
the fraction of servers with two or more tasks vanishes in the limit as $N \to

complicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than

$\sqrt{N}$-optimal when the occupancy process on $G_N$ is equivalent to that on
a clique on an $N$-scale or $\sqrt{N}$-scale, respectively.
  We prove that if $G_N$ is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with average

$\sqrt{N}$-optimal if $d(N) \to \infty$ and $d(N) / (\sqrt{N} \log(N)) \to

be maintained at $N$-scale and $\sqrt{N}$-scale while reducing the number of
connections by nearly a factor $N$ and $\sqrt{N} / \log(N)$ compared to a
clique, provided the topology is suitably random. It is further shown that if
$G_N$ contains $\Theta(N)$ bounded-degree nodes, then it cannot be $N$-optimal.
In addition, we establish that an arbitrary graph $G_N$ is $N$-optimal when its
minimum degree is $N - o(N)$, and may not be $N$-optimal even when its minimum
degree is $c N + o(N)$ for any $0 < c < 1/2$.

projections of changes in extreme precipitation at relevant space-time scales.
Here we propose an empirical Bayesian model that extends an existing skill and
consensus based weighting framework and test the hypothesis that nontrivial,
physics-guided measures of ESM skill can help produce reliable probabilistic
characterization of climate extremes. Specifically, the model leverages
knowledge of physical relationships between temperature, atmospheric moisture
capacity, and extreme precipitation intensity to iteratively weight and combine
ESMs and estimate probability distributions of return levels. Out-of-sample
validation shows evidence that the Bayesian model is a sound method for
deriving reliable probabilistic projections. Beyond precipitation extremes, the

probability distributions of climate variables in general, extremes or
otherwise.

relaxation, under simplifying assumptions of near-thermodynamic equilibrium and

frequency-dependent bulk viscosity model which, under such assumptions,
accurately captures wave attenuation rates from infrasonic to ultrasonic
frequencies in Navier--Stokes and lattice Boltzmann simulations. The proposed
model can be extended to any gas mixture for which molecular relaxation
timescales and attenuation measurements are available. The performance of the
model is assessed for air by varying the base temperature, pressure, relative

timescales of oxygen and nitrogen are a function of humidity, for certain
frequencies an intermediate value of $h_r$ can be found which maximizes
$\mu_B$. The contribution to bulk viscosity due to rotational relaxation is
verified to be a function of temperature, confirming recent findings in the
literature. While $\mu_B$ decreases with higher frequencies, its effects on
wave attenuation become more significant, as shown via a dimensionless
analysis. The proposed bulk viscosity model is designed for frequency-domain

the parameter regime near the Hopf bifurcation, where small amplitude
oscillations exist as stable dynamics in the absence of noise. In this regime,
the stochastic model admits noise-driven mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), which
capture the intermediate dynamics between two cycles of population outbreaks.
We perform numerical simulations to calculate the distribution of the random

intensities and distance to the Hopf bifurcation. We also study the effect of
noise on a suitable Poincar\'e map. Finally, we prove that the stochastic model

to recent results on the interplay between deterministic and stochastic small
amplitude oscillations. The normal form can also be used to study the parameter

  We show that well-justified configurations satisfy the DRF theorem: in any
data-race free program, all well-justified configurations are sequentially
consistent. We also show that rely-guarantee reasoning is sound for
well-justified configurations, but not for justified configurations. For
example, well-justified configurations are type-safe.
  Well-justification allows many, but not all reorderings performed by relaxed
memory. In particular, it fails to validate the commutation of independent
reads. We discuss variations that may address these shortcomings.

  Particulate Layers",,,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BRDF of most real world materials has two components, the surface BRDF due to
the light reflecting at the surface of the material and the subsurface BRDF due
to the light entering and going through many scattering events inside the
material. Each of these events modifies light's path, power, polarization
state. Computing polarized subsurface BRDF of a material requires simulating
the light transport inside the material. The transport of polarized light is
modeled by the Vector Radiative Transfer Equation (VRTE), an
integro-differential equation. Computing solution to that equation is
expensive. The Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM) is a common approach to solving
the VRTE. Such solvers are very time consuming for complex uses such as BRDF
computation, where one must solve VRTE for surface radiance distribution due to
light incident from every direction of the hemisphere above the surface. In
this paper, we present a GPU based DOM solution of the VRTE to expedite the
subsurface BRDF computation. As in other DOM based solutions, our solution is
based on Fourier expansions of the phase function and the radiance function.
This allows us to independently solve the VRTE for each order of expansion. We
take advantage of those repetitions and of the repetitions in each of the
sub-steps of the solution process. Our solver is implemented to run mainly on
graphics hardware using the OpenCL library and runs up to seven times faster
than its CPU equivalent, allowing the computation of subsurface BRDF in a
matter of minutes. We compute and present the subsurface BRDF lobes due to
powders and paints of a few materials. We also show the rendering of objects
with the computed BRDF. The solver is available for public use through the
authors' web site.

intermediate to high-amplitude fluctuations (related to moderate or severe

intermittent or as clusters depending on their recurrences. We study the

binary covariate and outcome, even when outcomes may be dependent.
Investigations of infectious disease outcomes in cohort studies of individuals
embedded within clusters -- households, villages, or small groups -- often
report risk ratios. Epidemiologists have warned that risk ratios may be
misleading when outcomes are contagious, but the nature and severity of this
error is not well understood. In this study, we assess the epidemiologic
meaning of the risk ratio when outcomes are contagious. We first give a
structural definition of infectious disease transmission within clusters, based
on the canonical susceptible-infective epidemic model. From this standard
characterization, we define the individual-level ratio of instantaneous risks
(hazard ratio) as the inferential target, and evaluate the properties of the
risk ratio as an estimate of this quantity. We exhibit analytically and by
simulation the circumstances under which the risk ratio implies an effect whose
direction is opposite that of the true individual-level hazard ratio. In
particular, the risk ratio can be greater than one even when the covariate of
interest reduces both individual-level susceptibility to infection, and
transmissibility once infected. We explain these findings in the epidemiologic
language of confounding and relate the direction bias to Simpson's paradox.

setting---has been a mystery ever since Anderson discovered disorder-induced
localization. Nonetheless, together these revolutionized materials science and
technology and led to new physics far beyond the solid state. We introduce a
broad family of structurally complex materials---chaotic crystals---that
interpolate between these organizational extremes---systematically spanning
periodic structures and random disorder. Within the family one can tune the
degree of disorder to sweep through an intermediate structurally disordered
region between two periodic lattices. This reveals new transport and
localization phenomena reflected in a rich array of energy-dependent
localization degree and density of states. In particular, strong localization
is observed even with a very low degree of disorder. Moreover, markedly
enhanced localization and delocalization coexist in a very narrow range of
energies. Most notably, beyond the simply smoothed bands found in previous
disorder studies, islands of transport emerge in band gaps and sharp band
boundaries persist in the presence of substantial disorder. Finally, the family
of materials comes with rather direct specifications of how to assemble the
requisite material organizations.

reveals the presence of the non-gravitational component, especially for AGNs
with a wing component in H-alpha. The large H-alpha velocity dispersion and
velocity shift of luminous AGNs are clear evidence of AGN outflow impacts on

approximation is not applicable to turbulence at small scales. In this Letter,
we propose the extension of the theory of reconnection-mediated turbulence to

find that the transition scale to reconnection-mediated turbulence depends on
the plasma beta and on the assumptions of the plasma turbulence model. However,

paper investigates the possibility of finding a differential formulation of the
gyrokinetic Landau collision operator. It is observed that, while a
differential formulation is possible in the gyrokinetic phase space, reduction
of the resulting system of partial differential equations to five dimensions
via gyroaveraging poses a challenge. Based on the present work, it is likely
that the gyrocentre analogues of the Rosenbluth-MacDonald-Judd potential
functions must be kept gyroangle dependent.

out of equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body bosonic and fermionic systems.
Our approach is based on constructing variational wavefunctions which extend
Gaussian states by including generalized canonical transformations between the
fields. The key advantage of such states compared to simple Gaussian states is
presence of non-factorizable correlations and the possibility of describing
states with strong entanglement between particles. In contrast to the commonly
used canonical transformations, such as the polaron or Lang-Firsov
transformations, we allow parameters of the transformations to be time
dependent, which extends their regions of applicability. We derive equations of
motion for the parameters characterizing the states both in real and imaginary
time using the differential structure of the variational manifold. The ground
state can be found by following the imaginary time evolution until it converges
to a steady state. Collective excitations in the system can be obtained by
linearizing the real-time equations of motion in the vicinity of the imaginary
time steady-state solution. Our formalism allows us not only to determine the
energy spectrum of quasiparticles and their lifetime, but to obtain the
complete spectral functions and to explore far out of equilibrium dynamics such
as coherent evolution following a quantum quench. We illustrate and benchmark
this framework with several examples: a single polaron in the Holstein and
Su-Schrieer-Heeger models, non-equilibrium dynamics in the spin-boson and Kondo
models, the superconducting to charge density wave phase transitions in the
Holstein model.

conditional plan in parallel using an ASP solver. In particular, thanks to
external atoms, continuous feasibility checks (like collision checks) are
embedded into formal representations of actuation actions and sensing actions

execution of actions to reach their goals. Utilizing nonmonotonic constructs
and nondeterministic choices, partial knowledge about states and
nondeterministic effects of sensing actions can be explicitly formalized in
ASP; and thus each branch of a conditional plan can be computed by an ASP

structures in dynamically aligned Alfv\'enic turbulence are destroyed by the
onset of magnetic reconnection in a low-$\beta$ collisionless plasma. The
scaling of $\lambda_{\rm D}$ depends on the order of the statistics being
considered, with more intense structures being disrupted at larger scales. The
disruption scale for the structures that dominate the energy spectrum is
$\lambda_{\rm D}\sim L_\perp^{1/9}(d_e\rho_s)^{4/9}$, where $d_e$ is the
electron inertial scale, $\rho_s$ is the ion sound scale, and $L_\perp$ is the
outer scale of the turbulence. When $\beta_e$ and $\rho_s/L_\perp$ are
sufficiently small, the scale $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is larger than $\rho_s$ and
there is a break in the energy spectrum at $\lambda_{\rm D}$, rather than at
$\rho_s$. We propose that the fluctuations produced by the disruption are
circularised flux ropes, which may have already been observed in the solar
wind. We predict the relationship between the amplitude and radius of these
structures and quantify the importance of the disruption process to the cascade
in terms of the filling fraction of undisrupted structures and the fractional
reduction of the energy contained in them at the ion sound scale $\rho_s$. Both
of these fractions depend strongly on $\beta_e$, with the disrupted structures
becoming more important at lower $\beta_e$. Finally, we predict that the energy
spectrum between $\lambda_{\rm D}$ and $\rho_s$ is steeper than $k_\perp^{-3}$,
when this range exists. Such a steep ""transition range"" is sometimes observed
in short intervals of solar-wind turbulence. The onset of collisionless
magnetic reconnection may therefore significantly affect the nature of plasma

considered, one of them free but moving with an initial velocity, and the other
confined by a harmonic potential. The two particles interact via a repulsive
Gaussian potential. While it represents in a straightforward manner a tip
substrate system in the real world, no analytical solutions can be found for
its motion. Because of the interaction, the free particle (tip) may overcome
the bound particle (substrate) losing part of its kinetic energy. We solve the
Newton's equations of the two particles numerically and calculate the net
exchange of energy in the asymptotic state in terms of the relevant parameters
of the problem. The effective dissipation that emerges from this simple,
classical model with no ad hoc terms shows, surprisingly, a range of rich,
non-trivial, behavior. We give theoretical reasoning which provides a
satisfactory qualitative description. The essential ingredient of that
reasoning is that the transfer of energy from the incoming particle to the
confined one can be regarded as the source of the emergent dissipation force,
the friction experienced by the incoming particle.

link. The technical difficulty in analysing enzymatic reaction cycles is that
their reaction rates are nonlinear. We deal with this by assuming that the

to simplify the problem further, we use singular perturbation to study a
particular operating regime of the enzymatic reaction cycles. This allows us to
derive a closed-form expression of the channel gain. This expression suggests
that we can improve the channel gain by increasing the total amount of
substrate in the enzymatic reaction cycle. By using numerical calculations, we
show that the effect of the enzymatic reaction cycle is to increase the channel
gain and to reduce the noise, which results in a better signalto- noise ratio

economic development, we model an evolving input--output network in which

that a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by
producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of
poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers
rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction
consistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic

first method is based on pilot-assisted least minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimation, the second one is based on line-of-sight (LOS) part. The respective

to the existence of pilot contamination, the uplink data rate of pilot-assisted
LMMSE estimation method approaches to a finite value (we name it as asymptotic
rate in the paper) when the BS antenna number is very large. However, the data
rate of LOS method goes linearly with the number of BS antennas. The expression
of the uplink rate of LOS method also show that for Ricean channel, the spacial
correlation between the BS antennas may not only decrease the rate, but also
increase the rate, which depends on the locations of the users. This conclusion
explains why the spacial correlation may increase, rather than decrease the
data rate of pilot-assisted LMMSE. We also discuss the power scaling law of the
two methods, and the asymptotic expressions of the two methods are the same and

propose two new weak memory models: WMM and WMM-S, which balance definitional
simplicity and implementation flexibility differently. Both allow all
instruction reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show that
this restriction has little impact on performance and it considerably
simplifies operational definitions. It also rules out the out-of-thin-air
problem that plagues many definitions. WMM is simple (it is similar to the
Alpha memory model), but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared store
buffers and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER processors).
WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and allows these behaviors. We give
the operational definitions of both models using Instantaneous Instruction
Execution (I2E), which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO. We also
show how both models can be implemented using conventional cache-coherent
memory systems and out-of-order processors, and encompasses the behaviors of

using specialized models for different verticals is not scalable and expensive
to deploy. This paper addresses the problem of learning one unified embedding

sacrificing accuracy. The problem is tackled from two aspects: training data
and training difficulty. On the training data aspect, we figure out that for a
single model trained with triplet loss, there is an accuracy sweet spot in
terms of how many verticals are trained together. To ease the training
difficulty, a novel learning scheme is proposed by using the output from
specialized models as learning targets so that L2 loss can be used instead of
triplet loss. This new loss makes the training easier and make it possible for
more efficient use of the feature space. The end result is a unified model
which can achieve the same retrieval accuracy as a number of separate

halo. We construct control samples of normal star-forming low-redshift galaxies
from the COS/HST archive that match the starbursts in terms of galaxy stellar
mass and impact parameter.
  We find clear evidence that the CGM around the starbursts differs
systematically compared to the control galaxies. The Ly$\alpha$, Si III, C IV,
and possibly O VI absorption-lines are stronger as a function of impact
parameter, and the ratios of the equivalent widths of C IV/Ly$\alpha$ and Si
III/Ly$\alpha$ are both larger than in normal star-forming galaxies. We also
find that the widths and the velocity offsets (relative to $v_{sys}$) of the
Ly$\alpha$ absorption-lines are significantly larger in the CGM of the
starbursts, implying velocities of the absorbing material that are roughly
twice the halo virial velocity.
  We show that these properties can be understood as a consequence of the
interaction between a starburst-driven wind and the pre-existing CGM. These
results underscore the importance of winds driven from intensely star-forming
galaxies in helping drive the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic
medium. They also offer a new probe of the properties of starburst-driven winds

partial differential equation (PDE) that emerges in the study of waveguide
quantum electrodynamics (QED) by adapting the finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) method. The delay term is spatially non-local, rendering conventional
approaches such as the method of lines inapplicable. We show that by properly
designing the grid and by supplying the (partial) exact solution as the
boundary condition, the delay PDE can be numerically solved. In addition, we
demonstrate that while the delay imposes strong data dependency, multi-thread
parallelization can nevertheless be applied to such a problem. Our code
provides a numerically exact solution to the time-dependent multi-photon
scattering problem in waveguide QED.

subspace metrics. Our main contribution is to construct a class of array codes
with locality constraints in the rank metric. Our motivation for constructing
such codes stems from designing codes for efficient data recovery from
correlated and/or mixed (i.e., complete and partial) failures in distributed
storage systems. Specifically, the proposed local rank-metric codes can recover
locally from 'crisscross errors and erasures', which affect a limited number of
rows and/or columns of the storage system. We also derive a Singleton-like
upper bound on the minimum rank distance of (linear) codes with 'rank-locality'
constraints. Our proposed construction achieves this bound for a broad range of
parameters. The construction builds upon Tamo and Barg's method for
constructing locally repairable codes with optimal minimum Hamming distance.
Finally, we construct a class of constant-dimension subspace codes (also known
as Grassmannian codes) with locality constraints in the subspace metric. The
key idea is to show that a Grassmannian code with locality can be easily
constructed from a rank-metric code with locality by using the lifting method
proposed by Silva et al. We present an application of such codes for
distributed storage systems, wherein nodes are connected over a network that
can introduce errors and erasures.

FOC(P) was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS'17), who showed that query
evaluation for this logic is fixed-parameter tractable on classes of structures

fixed-parameter tractability of FOC(P) cannot even be generalised to very
simple classes of structures of unbounded degree such as unranked trees or
strings with a linear order relation.
  Then we identify a fragment FOC1(P) of FOC(P) which is still sufficiently
strong to express standard applications of SQL's COUNT operator. Our main
result shows that query evaluation for FOC1(P) is fixed-parameter tractable
with almost linear running time on nowhere dense classes of structures. As a
corollary, we also obtain a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for counting
the number of tuples satisfying a query over nowhere dense classes of

  Viewpoints",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Algorithm-dependent generalization error bounds are central to statistical
learning theory. A learning algorithm may use a large hypothesis space, but the
limited number of iterations controls its model capacity and generalization
error. The impacts of stochastic gradient methods on generalization error for
non-convex learning problems not only have important theoretical consequences,
but are also critical to generalization errors of deep learning.
  In this paper, we study the generalization errors of Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) with non-convex objectives. Two theories are proposed
with non-asymptotic discrete-time analysis, using Stability and PAC-Bayesian
results respectively. The stability-based theory obtains a bound of
$O\left(\frac{1}{n}L\sqrt{\beta T_k}\right)$, where $L$ is uniform Lipschitz
parameter, $\beta$ is inverse temperature, and $T_k$ is aggregated step sizes.
For PAC-Bayesian theory, though the bound has a slower $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate,
the contribution of each step is shown with an exponentially decaying factor by
imposing $\ell^2$ regularization, and the uniform Lipschitz constant is also
replaced by actual norms of gradients along trajectory. Our bounds have no
implicit dependence on dimensions, norms or other capacity measures of
parameter, which elegantly characterizes the phenomenon of ""Fast Training
Guarantees Generalization"" in non-convex settings. This is the first
algorithm-dependent result with reasonable dependence on aggregated step sizes
for non-convex learning, and has important implications to statistical learning
aspects of stochastic gradient methods in complicated models such as deep
learning.

which are invariant to general projective transformations. By using RPDIs and
the structural frame of integral invariant, projective weighted moment
invariants (PIs) can be constructed very easily. It is first proved that a kind
of projective invariants exists in terms of weighted integration of images,
with relative differential invariants as the weight functions. Then, some
simple instances of PIs are given. In order to ensure the stability and
discriminability of PIs, we discuss how to calculate partial derivatives of
discrete images more accurately. Since the number of pixels in discrete images
before and after the geometric transformation may be different, we design the
method to normalize the number of pixels. These ways enhance the performance of
PIs. Finally, we carry out some experiments based on synthetic and real image
datasets. We choose commonly used moment invariants for comparison. The results
indicate that PIs have better performance than other moment invariants in image
retrieval and classification. With PIs, one can compare the similarity between
images under the projective transformation without knowing the parameters of
the transformation, which provides a good tool to shape analysis in image
processing, computer vision and pattern recognition.

great practical importance to the application of such methods. Despite the fact
that tensor representations are widely used in Computer Vision to capture
multi-linear relationships that affect the data, most existing DA methods are
applicable to vectors only. This renders them incapable of reflecting and
preserving important structure in many problems. We thus propose here a
learning-based method to adapt the source and target tensor representations
directly, without vectorization. In particular, a set of alignment matrices is
introduced to align the tensor representations from both domains into the
invariant tensor subspace. These alignment matrices and the tensor subspace are
modeled as a joint optimization problem and can be learned adaptively from the
data using the proposed alternative minimization scheme. Extensive experiments
show that our approach is capable of preserving the discriminative power of the
source domain, of resisting the effects of label noise, and works effectively
for small sample sizes, and even one-shot DA. We show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art on the task of cross-domain visual recognition
in both efficacy and efficiency, and particularly that it outperforms all
comparators when applied to DA of the convolutional activations of deep

hinder the improvement of user experience and system performance. In this
paper, we adopt multi-antenna techniques to overcome the bottleneck and
investigate the performance of single-user beamforming, an effective method to
enhance desired signal power, in small cell networks from the perspective of
user coverage probability (CP) and network spatial throughput (ST).
Pessimistically, it is proved that, even when multi-antenna techniques are
applied, both CP and ST would be degraded and even asymptotically diminish to
zero with the increasing base station (BS) density. Moreover, the results also
reveal that the increase of ST is at the expense of the degradation of CP.
Therefore, to balance the tradeoff between user and system performance, we
further study the critical density, under which ST could be maximized under the
CP constraint. Accordingly, the impact of key system parameters on critical
density is quantified via the derived closed-form expression. Especially, the
critical density is shown to be inversely proportional to the square of antenna
height difference between BSs and users. Meanwhile, single-user beamforming,
albeit incapable of improving CP and ST scaling laws, is shown to significantly
increase the critical density, compared to the single-antenna regime.

a multiplicative function for Segre products.
  This yields explicit computation of $\varphi_D$ (and hence the limit), for
smooth Fano toric surfaces with respect to anticanonical divisor. In general,
due to this formulation in terms of the polytope $P_D$, one can explicitly
compute the limit for two dimensional toric pairs and their Segre products.
  We further show that (Theorem~6.3) the renormailzed limit takes the minimum
value if and only if the polytope $P_D$ tiles the space $M_{\mathbb R} =

in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$
standard-deviation (SD) = 73 $\pm$ 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4
$\pm$ 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$ SD =
74 $\pm$ 8 years, MMS = 27.3 $\pm$ 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13
males, 12 females, age $\pm$ SD = 64 $\pm$ 8 years), using leave-one-out
cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate
of 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we
obtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of
84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is
comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods,
which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool
to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Smoluchowski-type equation that characterizes the evolution of a number density
function, depending upon both particle position $x\in \mathbb{R}^d(d=2,3)$ and
orientation vector $m\in\mathbb{S}^2$ (the unit sphere). We prove that, when
the Deborah number tends to zero, the family of solutions with rough initial
data near local equilibria will converge strongly to a local equilibrium
distribution prescribed by a weak solution of the harmonic map heat flow into
$\mathbb{S}^2$. This flow is a special case of the gradient flow to the
Oseen-Frank energy functional for nematic liquid crystals. The key ingredient
is to show the strong compactness of the family of number density functions and
the proof relies on the strong compactness of the corresponding second moment
(or the $Q$-tensor), a spectral decomposition of the linearized operator near
the limit local equilibrium distribution, as well as the energy dissipation

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) were used to study the sources of the solar mean magnetic field, SMMF,
defined as the net line-of-sight magnetic flux divided over the solar disk
area. To evaluate the contribution of different regions to the SMMF, we
separated all the pixels of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into three subsets: weak
(B_W), intermediate (B_I), and strong (B_S) fields. The B_W component
represents areas with magnetic flux densities below the chosen threshold; the
B_I component is mainly represented by network fields, remains of decayed
active regions (ARs), and ephemeral regions. The B_S component consists of
magnetic elements in ARs. To derive the contribution of a subset to the total
SMMF, the linear regression coefficients between the corresponding component
and the SMMF were calculated. We found that: i) when the threshold level of 30
Mx cm^-2 is applied, the B_I and B_S components together contribute from 65% to
95% of the SMMF, while the fraction of the occupied area varies in a range of
2-6% of the disk area; ii) as the threshold magnitude is lowered to 6 Mx cm^-2,
the contribution from B_I+B_S grows to 98%, and the fraction of the occupied
area reaches the value of about 40% of the solar disk. In summary, we found
that regardless of the threshold level, only a small part of the solar disk
area contributes to the SMMF. This means that the photospheric magnetic
structure is an intermittent, inherently porous medium, resembling a
percolation cluster. These findings suggest that the long-standing concept that
continuous vast unipolar areas on the solar surface are the source of the SMMF
may need to be reconsidered.

study the converse of this procedure. Starting from an integral variation of
Hodge structures of weight $\pm 1$, we give a criterion for when its associated
family of complex tori carries a Lagrangian structure, i.e. for when it can be
given the structure of an integrable system. This sheaf-theoretic approach to
(the smooth parts of) complex integrable systems enables us to apply powerful
tools from Hodge and sheaf theory to study complex integrable systems. We
exemplify the usefulness of this viewpoint by proving that the degree zero

complex Lie group $G$ is isomorphic to a non-compact Calabi-Yau integrable
system over a Zariski-open and dense subset in the corresponding Hitchin base.

noise, which is produced during medical operations, such as MRI, CT, and
angiography, by their image capturing devices. An embeddable hardware module
which is able to denoise medical images before and during surgical operations
could be very helpful. In this paper an accurate algorithm is proposed for
real-time removal of impulse noise in medical images. All image blocks are
divided into three categories of edge, smooth, and disordered areas. A
different reconstruction method is applied to each category of blocks for the
purpose of noise removal. The proposed method is tested on MR images.
Simulation results show acceptable denoising accuracy for various levels of
noise. Also an FPAG implementation of our denoising algorithm shows acceptable
hardware resource utilization. Hence, the algorithm is suitable for embedding

radiation and a molecular cloud under relatively benign conditions, that is,
intermediate densities and an intermediate UV radiation field. Contrary to the
well-studied Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC1), which hosts much harsher
conditions, L1630 has little star formation. We aim to relate the [CII]
fine-structure line emission to the physical conditions predominant in L1630
and compare it to studies of OMC1. The [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ emission from
an area of $12' \times 17'$ in L1630 was observed using the upGREAT instrument
onboard SOFIA. Of the [CII] emission from the mapped area 95%, $13\,L_{\odot}$,
originates from the molecular cloud; the adjacent HII region contributes only
5%, that is, $1\,L_{\odot}$. From comparison with other data (CO (1-0)-line
emission, far-infrared (FIR) continuum studies, emission from polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), we infer a gas density of the molecular cloud of
$n_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 3\cdot 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, with surface layers,
including the Horsehead Nebula, having a density of up to $n_{\mathrm{H}}\sim
4\cdot 10^4\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The temperature of the surface gas is $T\sim
100\,\mathrm{K}$. The average [CII] cooling efficiency within the molecular
cloud is $1.3\cdot 10^{-2}$. The fraction of the mass of the molecular cloud
within the studied area that is traced by [CII] is only $8\%$. Our PDR models
are able to reproduce the FIR-[CII] correlations and also the CO (1-0)-[CII]
correlations. Finally, we compare our results on the heating efficiency of the

observing 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=1-0 lines simultaneously. The mapping regions
are a part of the 1st quadrant (10d < l < 50d, |b| < 1d) and the 3rd quadrant

with the virial theorem, the Jeans equation, and the caustic method using
wide-field VIMOS spectroscopy. We investigated the role of colour selection and
the impact of substructures on the dynamical estimators. The Jeans and caustic
methods give consistent results, whereas the virial theorem leads to masses
$\sim15\%$ larger. The Jeans, caustic, and virial masses are respectively
$\sim20\%$, $\sim30\%$, and $\sim50\%$ larger than the hydrostatic values.
Large scatters of $\gtrsim50\%$ are mainly due to the two outliers RXCJ0014 and
RXCJ1347; excluding the latter increases the mass ratios by $\sim10\%$, giving
a fractional mass bias significant at $\gtrsim2\sigma$. We found a correlation
between the dynamical-to-hydrostatic mass ratio and two substructure
indicators, suggesting a bias in the dynamical measurements. The velocity
dispersions of blue galaxies are $\sim15\%$ ($\sim25\%$ after removing the
substructures) larger than that of the red-sequence galaxies; using the latter
leads to dynamical masses $\sim10\%-15\%$ smaller. Discarding the galaxies part
of substructures reduces the masses by $\sim15\%$; the effect is larger for the
more massive clusters, owing to a higher level of substructures. After the
substructure analysis, the dynamical masses are in perfect agreement with the
hydrostatic values and the scatters around the mean ratios are divided by

that the phenomenon of complexity matching, which is the theme of an increasing

sensitivity of a complex system to environmental multi-fractality; another is
the level of information transfer, between two complex networks at criticality.
The cross-correlation function is evaluated in the ergodic long-time limit, but
its delayed maximal value is the signature of information transfer occurring in

2.08% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected
rapidly rotating giants in the field. The remaining stars do not show enough

the stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can
infer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively
evaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of
mass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881
intermediate-mass stars, M>2.0 M$_\odot$ from our full red giant sample, we do
not find the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum

we examine the 575 low-mass (M<1.1 M$_\odot$) red clump stars in our sample,

problems in planar graphs. Unfortunately, results based on them are
non-constructive, as their proofs inherently use an induction on overlapping
subgraphs and these overlaps hinder to bound the running time to a polynomial.
For special cases however, computational results of Tutte paths are known: For
4-connected planar graphs, Tutte paths are in fact Hamiltonian paths and Chiba
and Nishizeki showed how to compute such paths in linear time. For 3-connected
planar graphs, Tutte paths have a more complicated structure, and it has only
recently been shown that they can be computed in polynomial time. However,
Tutte paths are defined for general 2-connected planar graphs and this is what
most applications need. Unfortunately, no computational results are known. We
give the first efficient algorithm that computes a Tutte path (for the general
case of 2-connected planar graphs). One of the strongest existence results
about such Tutte paths is due to Sanders, which allows to prescribe the end
vertices and an intermediate edge of the desired path. Encompassing and
strengthening all previous computational results on Tutte paths, we show how to
compute this special Tutte path efficiently. Our method refines both, the
results of Thomassen and Sanders, and avoids overlapping subgraphs by using a
novel iterative decomposition along 2-separators. Finally, we show that our
algorithm runs in quadratic time.

lattice QCD, aiming at a possible solution of the sign problem. In this method,
we consider matter and anti-matter systems on two parallel ${\bf R}^4$-sheets
in five-dimensional Euclidean space-time. For the matter system $M$ with a
chemical potential $\mu \in {\bf C}$ on a ${\bf R}^4$-sheet, we also prepare
the anti-matter system $\bar M$ with $-\mu^*$ on the other ${\bf R}^4$-sheet
shifted in the fifth direction. In the lattice QCD formalism, we introduce a
correlation term between the gauge variables $U_\nu \equiv e^{iagA_\nu}$ in $M$
and $\tilde U_\nu \equiv e^{iag \tilde A_\nu}$ in $\bar M$, such as $S_\lambda
\equiv \sum_{x,\nu} 2\lambda \{N_c-{\rm Re~tr} [U_\nu(x) \tilde
U_\nu^\dagger(x)]\} \simeq \sum_x \frac{1}{2}\lambda a^2 \{A_\nu^a(x)-\tilde
A_\nu^a(x)\}^2$ with a real parameter $\lambda$. In the limit of $\lambda
\rightarrow \infty$, a strong constraint $\tilde U_\nu(x)=U_\nu(x)$ is
realized, and the total fermionic determinant is real and non-negative. In the
limit of $\lambda \rightarrow 0$, this system goes to two separated ordinary
QCD systems with the chemical potential of $\mu$ and $-\mu^*$. On a
finite-volume lattice, if one takes an enough large value of $\lambda$, $\tilde
U_\nu(x) \simeq U_\nu(x)$ is realized and there occurs a phase cancellation
approximately between two fermionic determinants in $M$ and $\bar M$, which is
expected to suppress the sign problem and to make the lattice calculation
possible. For the obtained gauge configurations of the coexistence system,
matter-side quantities are evaluated through their measurement only for the
matter part $M$. By the calculations with gradually decreasing $\lambda$ and
their extrapolation to $\lambda=0$, physical quantities in finite density QCD
are expected to be estimated.

detected H$_2$S towards five AGB stars, all of which have high mass-loss rates
of $\dot{M}\geq 5\times 10^{-6}M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and are oxygen-rich. H$_2$S
was not detected towards the carbon or S-type stars that fall in a similar
mass-loss range. For the stars in our sample with detections, we find peak
o-H$_2$S abundances relative to H$_2$ between $4\times 10^{-7}$ and $2.5\times

oxygen-rich AGB stars with higher mass-loss rates, but is unlikely to play a
key role in stars of other chemical types or the lower mass-loss rate
oxygen-rich stars. For two sources, V1300 Aql and GX Mon, H$_2$S is most likely

that the subgroup has purely exponential growth. By Roblin's work, we obtain
that the set of hyperbolic elements is generic in any discrete group action on

string, called the label, to every node of a tree, so that given the labels of
two nodes (and no further information about the topology of the tree) we can
compute the label of their nearest common ancestor. The goal is to make the
labels as short as possible. Alstrup, Gavoille, Kaplan, and Rauhe [Theor.
Comput. Syst. 37(3):441-456 2004] showed that $O(\log n)$-bit labels are
enough. More recently, Alstrup, Halvorsen, and Larsen [SODA 2014] refined this
to only $2.772\log n$, and provided a lower bound of $1.008\log n$.
  We connect designing a labeling scheme for nearest common ancestors to the
existence of a tree, called a minor-universal tree, that contains every tree on
$n$ nodes as a topological minor. Even though it is not clear if a labeling
scheme must be based on such a notion, we argue that the existing schemes can
be reformulated as such, and it allows us to obtain clean and good bounds on
the length of the labels. As the main upper bound, we show that $2.318\log
n$-bit labels are enough. Surprisingly, the notion of a minor-universal tree
for binary trees on $n$ nodes has been already used in a different context by
Hrubes et al. [CCC 2010], and Young, Chu, and Wong [J. ACM 46(3):416-435, 1999]
introduced a closely related notion of a universal tree. On the lower bound
side, we show that the size of any minor-universal tree for trees on $n$ nodes
is $\Omega(n^{2.174})$. This highlights a natural limitation for all approaches
based on such trees. Our lower bound technique also implies that the size of
any universal tree in the sense of Young et al. is $\Omega(n^{2.185})$, thus
dramatically improves their lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$. We complement the
existential results with a generic transformation that decreases the query time
to constant in any scheme based on a minor-universal tree.

depending on the location of their emission peaks within the core. Furthermore,
to systematically study the correlations among different molecules, we have
performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated emission
maps. The PCA allows us to reduce the amount of variables in our dataset.
Finally, we compare the maps of the first three principal components with the
H$_2$ column density map, and the T$_{dust}$ map of the core. The results of
our qualitative analysis is the classification of the molecules in our dataset

energy functional: the ferromagnetic state, the conical helix, the conical
helicoid, and the skyrmion lattice, is studied by solving the corresponding
spectral problem. The only stable points are the ferromagnetic state at high
magnetic field and the conical helix at low field, and there is no metastable
state. Thermal fluctuations around the stationary point, included to quadratic
order in the saddle point expansion, destabilize the conical helix in a region
where the ferromagnetic state is unstable. Thus, a new intermediate phase
appears which, in a region of the phase diagram, is a skyrmion lattice
stabilized by thermal fluctuations. The skyrmion lattice lost the stability by
lowering temperature, and a new intermediate phase of unknown type, presumably
with three dimensional modulations, appears in the lower temperature region.

of imaginary quadratic fields has been studied by several authors, starting
from the works of Bertolini-Darmon and Iovita-Spiess, under the crucial
assumption that the prime $p$ is unramified in $K$. We start in this article
the systematic study of anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions when $p$ is
ramified in $K$. In particular, when $f$ is a weight $2$ modular form attached
to an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ having multiplicative reduction at $p$, and
$p$ is ramified in $K$, we show an analogue of the exceptional zeroes
phenomenon investigated by Bertolini-Darmon in the setting when $p$ is inert in
$K$. More precisely, we consider situations in which the $p$-adic $L$-function
$L_p(E/K)$ of $E$ over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$ does
not vanish identically but, by sign reasons, has a zero at certain characters
$\chi$ of the Hilbert class field of $K$. In this case we show that the value
at $\chi$ of the first derivative of $L_p(E/K)$ is equal to the formal group
logarithm of the specialization at $p$ of a global point on the elliptic curve
(actually, this global point is a twisted sum of Heegner points). This
generalizes similar results of Bertolini-Darmon, available when $p$ is inert in

Nambu-Goldstone coset containing the Higgs field, or Higgs coset, is either

predictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the
gravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the
electromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational
coupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine
structure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the
detection of gravitons -- the hypothetical quanta of energy of the
gravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals -- is deemed
to be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different,
quantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that
quantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness
quantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses
each in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any
system (e.g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum
systems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on
any specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the
entanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our
argument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an indirect witness
of the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this
experiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself. It is also
closer to realisation than other proposals, such as detecting gravitons or
detecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations.

that describes the mean-field limit behavior of a homogeneous network of
excitatory point spiking neurons. Contrary to other models, here noise is
intrinsic to the neurons through a membrane-potential dependent spiking rate
probability, that we assume to be given by a power law. This allows one to
collapse several sources of neural noise into a single function, which aids for
a more treatable mathematical and comptuational analysis. In particular, we
give pseudo-analytical expressions for the invariant distributions of membrane
potentials across the population and study their stability computationally. The
neurons are assumed to be connected both by chemical and possibly electrical
(gap junction) synapses and can also undergo a leakage of ions with the
extracellular medium. The distributions are of compact support whenever leakage
or gap junction rates are non-zero and an infinite discontinuity appears at the
maximum potential in the population. This happens invariably for the leakage
(with no gap junctions) and gap junction (without leakage) cases. However,
these discontinuous distributions might only be stable for linear spiking rate
functions. It was recently shown how the network can present highly synchronous
states of global oscillations in its activity when leakage is not present and
gap junctions are strong enough. Here we confirm how oscillations persist also
when weak leakage is considered. Thus, these dendritic (rather than axonal) gap
junctions could play a role in the high levels of neural synchrony necessary
for the development of neural systems at young ages. The model, thus, presents
a rich phenomenology and capability to reproduce several biological features of
neural networks despite of its mathematical simplicity, hence presenting a
powerful tool for high performance computing.

studying onset of plasticity, phase transition or melting in crystals. And size
effects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs to
account for contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient
based higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well
established to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids
directly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher
order elastic instabilities is established and justified by developing an
equivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical
instability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is
determined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain
gradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the
higher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be
directly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of
the stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals,
i.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression
technique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed
to study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted
critical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with the results from the
NEMD simulations for all the metals. Since the only inputs for the established
higher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations, i.e., atomic
potentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely
equivalent to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least,
for crystals.

great challenges in modern physics. Along this line, a prime question is to
find whether gravity is a quantum entity subject to the rules of quantum
mechanics. It is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test the
quantum coherent behaviour of gravity directly in a laboratory experiment.
Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two
objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite
the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational
interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave
interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far
apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription
for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent
mediator, through simple correlation measurements between two spins: one
embedded in each test mass. Fundamentally, the above entanglement is shown to
certify the presence of non-zero off-diagonal terms in the coherent state basis
of the gravitational field modes.

Yet whether it is a recurrent feature of terrestrial bodies orbiting other

stagnant-lid planet can be habitable, i.e. host liquid water at its surface, we
model the thermal evolution of the mantle, volcanic outgassing of H$_2$O and
CO$_2$, and resulting climate of an Earth-like planet lacking plate tectonics.
We used a 1D model of parameterized convection to simulate the evolution of
melt generation and the build-up of an atmosphere of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ over 4.5
Gyr. We then employed a 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model to calculate
the global mean atmospheric temperature and the boundaries of the habitable
zone (HZ). The evolution of the interior is characterized by the initial
production of a large amount of partial melt accompanied by a rapid outgassing
of H$_2$O and CO$_2$. At 1 au, the obtained temperatures generally allow for
liquid water on the surface nearly over the entire evolution. While the outer
edge of the HZ is mostly influenced by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, the
inner edge presents a more complex behaviour that is dependent on the partial
pressures of both gases. At 1 au, the stagnant-lid planet considered would be
regarded as habitable. The width of the HZ at the end of the evolution, albeit
influenced by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, can vary in a non-monotonic way
depending on the extent of the outgassed H$_2$O reservoir. Our results suggest
that stagnant-lid planets can be habitable over geological timescales and that
joint modelling of interior evolution, volcanic outgassing, and accompanying
climate is necessary to robustly characterize planetary habitability.

Palatini and unimodular gravity. The basic idea is to employ a relationship
between unified formalism for a Griffiths variational problem and its classical
Lepage-equivalent variational problem. As a way to understand from an intuitive
viewpoint the Griffiths variational problem approach considered here, we may
say the variations of the Palatini Lagrangian are performed in such a way that
the so called metricity condition, i.e. (part of) the condition ensuring that
the connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric specified by the
vielbein, is preserved. From the same perspective, the classical
Lepage-equivalent problem is a geometrical implementation of the Lagrange
multipliers trick, so that the metricity condition is incorporated directly
into the Palatini Lagrangian. The main geometrical tools involved in these
constructions are canonical forms living on the first jet of the frame bundle
for the spacetime manifold $M$. These forms play an essential r\^ole in
providing a global version of the Palatini Lagrangian and expressing the
metricity condition in an invariant form; with their help, it was possible to
formulate an unified formalism for Palatini gravity in a geometrical fashion.
Moreover, we were also able to find the associated equations of motion in
invariant terms and, by using previous results from the literature, to prove
their involutivity. As a bonus, we showed how this construction can be used to
provide a unified formalism for the so called unimodular gravity by employing a
reduction of the structure group of the principal bundle $LM$ to the special
linear group $SL\left(m\right),m=\mathop{\text{dim}}{M}$.

the functionalities of optical elements, lies at the heart of modern optics,
and has been widely applied to optical information processing, imaging,
holography etc. While a simple thin lens is capable of resolving Fourier
components of an arbitrary optical wavefront, its operation is limited to near
normal light incidence, i.e. the paraxial approximation, which put a severe
constraint on the resolvable Fourier domain. As a result, high-order Fourier
components are lost, resulting in extinction of high-resolution information of
an image. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dielectric metasurface
consisting of high-aspect-ratio silicon waveguide array, which is capable of
performing Fourier transform for a large incident angle range and a broad
operating bandwidth. Thus our device significantly expands the operational
Fourier space, benefitting from the large numerical aperture (NA), and
negligible angular dispersion at large incident angles. Our Fourier metasurface
will not only facilitate efficient manipulation of spatial spectrum of
free-space optical wavefront, but also be readily integrated into micro-optical
platforms due to its compact size.

property grants quantum bit immunity to some operations in order to achieve the
irreversible goal of discarding a message, resulting in a one-out-of-two

quantum resources, rather than on a two-level structure which must first create
two classical keys using the quantum resources (all-or-nothing QOT), and then
build the one-out-of-two protocol from there. Furthermore, the proposed

results. Moreover, the relationship with the no-go theorem is discussed in
detail; this relationship is often overlooked in other studies. The no-go
theorem discussion and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed protocol
does not belong to the no-go theorem constraint, and is secure against both
external and internal attacks. In addition, the efficacy analysis shows that
the proposed protocol is more efficient than other two-level structure

on one side of the bipartition are given, and the vertices on the other side
arrive one by one with all their incident edges. The goal is to maintain a
maximum matching while minimizing the number of changes (replacements) to the
matching. We show that the greedy algorithm that always takes the shortest
augmenting path from the newly inserted vertex (denoted the SAP protocol) uses
at most amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ replacements per insertion, where $n$ is the
total number of vertices inserted. This is the first analysis to achieve a
polylogarithmic number of replacements for \emph{any} replacement strategy,
almost matching the $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound. The previous best strategy
known achieved amortized $O(\sqrt{n})$ replacements [Bosek, Leniowski,
Sankowski, Zych, FOCS 2014]. For the SAP protocol in particular, nothing better
than then trivial $O(n)$ bound was known except in special cases.
  Our analysis immediately implies the same upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$
reassignments for the capacitated assignment problem, where each vertex on the
static side of the bipartition is initialized with the capacity to serve a
number of vertices.
  We also analyze the problem of minimizing the maximum server load. We show
that if the final graph has maximum server load $L$, then the SAP protocol
makes amortized $O( \min\{L \log^2 n , \sqrt{n}\log n\})$ reassignments. We
also show that this is close to tight because $\Omega(\min\{L, \sqrt{n}\})$
reassignments can be necessary.

separation with flow. We study coarsening - the growth of extended domains
wherein the binary mixture phase separates into its component parts. The
coarsening is characterized by two competing effects: flow, and the
Cahn-Hilliard diffusion term, which drives the phase separation. Based on
extensive two-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we construct a
flow-pattern map outlining the relative strength of these effects in different
parts of the parameter space. The map reveals large regions of parameter space
where a standard theory applies, and where the domains grow algebraically in
time. However, there are significant parts of the parameter space where the
standard theory does not apply. In one region, corresponding to low values of
viscosity and diffusion, the coarsening is accelerated compared to the standard
theory. Previous studies involving Stokes flow report on this phenomenon; we
complete the picture by demonstrating that this anomalous regime occurs not
only for Stokes flow, but also, for flows dominated by inertia. In a second
region, corresponding to arbitrary viscosities and high Cahn-Hilliard
diffusion, the diffusion overwhelms the hydrodynamics altogether, and the
latter can effectively be ignored, in contrast to the prediction of the
standard scaling theory. Based on further high-resolution simulations in three
dimensions, we find that broadly speaking, the above description holds there
also, although the formation of the anomalous domains in the
low-viscosity-low-diffusion part of the parameter space is delayed in three
dimensions compared to two.

quantum dynamics. It can solve time-independent or time-dependent linear
Schr\""odinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions.
Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g., to simulate
molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within
the semi-classical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate
experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or
chemistry. Being highly versatile and offering visualization of quantum
dynamics 'on the fly', WavePacket is well suited for teaching or research
projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics as well as in physical or
theoretical chemistry. Building on the previous Part I which dealt with closed
quantum systems and discrete variable representations, the present Part II
focuses on the dynamics of open quantum systems, with Lindblad operators
modeling dissipation and dephasing. This part also describes the WavePacket
function for optimal control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid
monotonically convergent iteration methods. Furthermore, two different
approaches to dimension reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented
here. In the first one, a balancing transformation based on the concepts of
controllability and observability Gramians is used to identify states that are
neither well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either
truncated or averaged out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given
reduced dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal model reduction techniques,
utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.

vector fields used to control the particle distribution function, a function of

modes of a dimer depend on the initial magnetic configuration, changing
drastically by going from a ferromagnetic metastable state to the

damping into their resonant frequencies, we reveal that an important
contribution arises for strongly biaxial systems and specially for the

our results indicate that the magnetic damping influences the quantum

relations between attributes, recent research treats it as a multi-label image
classification task. The visual cues hinting at attributes can be strongly
localized and inference of person attributes such as hair, backpack, shorts,

paper we assert this dependence in an end-to-end learning framework and show
that a view-sensitive attribute inference is able to learn better attribute

pedestrian and learns specialized view-specific multi-label attribute
predictions. We show in an extensive evaluation on three challenging datasets

epitaxially grown onto the Au core surface. The Au/Fe_3O_4 core-shell structure
was demonstrated by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission
electron microscopy analysis. The magnetite shell grown on top of the Au
nanoparticle displayed a thermal blocking state at temperatures below T_B = 59
K and a relaxed state well above T_B. Remarkably, an exchange bias effect was
observed when cooling down the samples below room temperature under an external
magnetic field. Moreover, the exchange bias field (H_{EX}) started to appear at
T~40 K and its value increased by decreasing the temperature. This effect has
been assigned to the interaction of spins located in the magnetically
disordered regions (in the inner and outer surface of the Fe_3O_4 shell) and
spins located in the ordered region of the Fe_3O_4 shell.

The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and
analyze a patient's gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical
decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of
complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted
a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel
Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis
(KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data
derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and
interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs
of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows
externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes
this information available for others, supporting the process of data
inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting
expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait
is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex
gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians.

studies of galaxy clusters have become common. Whereas many previous SZ studies
have parameterized the pressure profiles of galaxy clusters, non-parametric
reconstructions will provide insights into the thermodynamic state of the
intracluster medium (ICM). Aims: We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure
profiles of the high redshift ($z=0.89$) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as
inferred from SZ data from the MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and Planck instruments,
which all probe different angular scales. Methods: Our non-parametric algorithm
makes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of
ellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam
we derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good
agreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric
profiles are consistent with a fitted gNFW profile. Given the ability of Planck
to constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton Y
parameter as determined by Planck. Results: For a given instrument, constraints
on the pressure profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap
in spatial scales probed by these four datasets is therefore critical in
checking for consistency between instruments. By using multiple instruments,
our analysis of CLJ 1226.9+3332 covers a large radial range, from the central
regions to the cluster outskirts: $0.05 R_{500} < r < 1.1 R_{500}$. This is a
wider range of spatial scales than is typical recovered by SZ instruments.
Similar analyses will be possible with the new generation of SZ instruments

been observed that the current flow through the tungsten film results in an
appreciable asymmetry in the tunneling current with respect to the change in
the polarity of the tunneling voltage. It is reasoned that the cause of this
asymmetry is the accumulation of spin polarized electrons on the tungsten film
surface due to the spin Hall effect. This asymmetry is not affected by the
change of the direction of the bias current through the film. However, in the
case of iron coated tungsten tips, it has been observed that a change in the

  Nanocrystals: Quantum and Classical Mechanisms","90 pages, 21 figures, including Supplementary Information",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generation of energetic (hot) electrons is an intrinsic property of any
plasmonic nanostructure under illumination. Simultaneously, a striking
advantage of metal nanocrystals over semiconductors lies in their very large
absorption cross sections. Therefore, metal nanostructures with strong and
tailored plasmonic resonances are very attractive for photocatalytic
applications. However, the central questions regarding plasmonic hot electrons
are how to quantify and extract the optically-excited energetic electrons in a
nanocrystal. We develop a theory describing the generation rates and the
energy-distributions of hot electrons in nanocrystals with various geometries.
In our theory, hot electrons are generated owing to surfaces and hot spots. The
formalism predicts that large optically-excited nanocrystals show the
excitation of mostly low-energy Drude electrons, whereas plasmons in small
nanocrystals involve mostly hot electrons. The energy distributions of
electrons in an optically-excited nanocrystal show how the quantum many-body
state in small particles evolves towards the classical state described by the
Drude model when increasing nanocrystal size. We show that the rate of surface
decay of plasmons in nanocrystals is directly related to the rate of generation
of hot electrons. Based on a detailed many-body theory involving kinetic
coefficients, we formulate a simple scheme describing the plasmon's dephasing.
In most nanocrystals, the main decay mechanism of a plasmon is the Drude
friction-like process and the secondary path comes from generation of hot
electrons due to surfaces and electromagnetic hot spots. This latter path
strongly depends on the size, shape and material of the nanocrystal,
correspondingly affecting its efficiency of hot-electron production. The
results in the paper can be used to guide the design of plasmonic nanomaterials
for photochemistry and photodetectors.

Furthermore, one can combine these mechanisms in different ways: by

shown how to experimentally realize one example of each class of possible

transitions between these classes. In particular, for each of the two distinct
types of coherence that can exist in mixtures of common-cause and cause-effect

Alternatively, it can consist of two sets connected by a line. The problem then

need to be compact. To control the effect of the large velocities, we identify
and exploit several structural properties of the Vlasov equation to prove that
the worst non-linear terms in the Vlasov equation either enjoy a form of the
null condition or can be controlled using the wave coordinate gauge. The basic
propagation estimates for the Vlasov field are then obtained using only weak
interior decay for the metric components. Since some of the error terms are not
time-integrable, several hierarchies in the commuted equations are exploited to
close the top order estimates. For the Einstein equations, we use wave
coordinates and the main new difficulty arises from the commutation of the
energy-momentum tensor, which needs to be rewritten using the modified vector

the experimental result, showing that the self-pace boosted network

an expected word. In order to obtain the expected word, we use Context2Vec, a
sentence completion library based on Bidirectional LSTM. However, since the
exact word where such an incongruity occurs may not be known in advance, we
present two approaches: an All-words approach (which consults sentence
completion for every content word) and an Incongruous words-only approach
(which consults sentence completion for the 50% most incongruous content
words). The approaches outperform reported values for tweets but not for
discussion forum posts. This is likely to be because of redundant consultation
of sentence completion for discussion forum posts. Therefore, we consider an
oracle case where the exact incongruous word is manually labeled in a corpus
reported in past work. In this case, the performance is higher than the
all-words approach. This sets up the promise for using sentence completion for

facilitates powerful extensions to many well-known algorithms. While the kernel
matrix involves inner products in the feature space, the sample covariance
matrix of the data requires outer products. Therefore, their spectral
properties are tightly connected. This allows us to examine the kernel matrix
through the sample covariance matrix in the feature space and vice versa. The
use of kernels often involves a large number of features, compared to the
number of observations. In this scenario, the sample covariance matrix is not
well-conditioned nor is it necessarily invertible, mandating a solution to the
problem of estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices under small sample
size conditions. We tackle this problem through the use of a shrinkage
estimator that offers a compromise between the sample covariance matrix and a
well-conditioned matrix (also known as the ""target"") with the aim of minimizing
the mean-squared error (MSE). We propose a distribution-free kernel matrix
regularization approach that is tuned directly from the kernel matrix, avoiding
the need to address the feature space explicitly. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that the proposed regularization is effective in classification

distribution can be constructed. However, without phase space trajectories, the
task of constructing a work probability distribution in the quantum regime has
proven elusive. Here we use quantum trajectories in phase space and define
fluctuating work as power integrated along the trajectories, in complete

distribution is valid for any quantum evolution, including cases with

distribution and its properties with an exactly solvable example of a driven

its dependence on the initial statistical mixture of pure states, which is

expected. At higher ${\phi}$ dimers become caged by their neighboring
particles, and both rotational and translational diffusion slow. For short
dimers we observe rapid reorientations so that the rotational diffusion is
faster than translational diffusion: the two modes of diffusion are decoupled
and have different ${\phi}$ dependence. Longer dimers do not exhibit fast
rotations, and we find translational and rotational diffusion stay coupled for
all ${\phi}$. Our results bridge prior results that used spheres (very fast
rotation) and long ellipsoids (very slow rotation).

conditions future real and imagined actions. The agent can even decide how to
imagine: testing out alternative imagined actions, chaining sequences of

flexibly among the previously imagined states using a learned policy. And our
agent can learn to plan economically, jointly optimizing for external rewards

formation over large-scale structure since it is one of the brightest emission
lines from galaxies. Redshifted CII emission appears in the submillimeter
regime, meaning it could potentially be present in the higher frequency
intensity data from the Planck satellite used to measure the cosmic infrared
background (CIB). We search for CII emission over redshifts z=2-3.2 in the
Planck 545 GHz intensity map by cross-correlating the 3 highest frequency
Planck maps with spectroscopic quasars and CMASS galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), which we then use to jointly fit for CII
intensity, CIB parameters, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) emission. We
report a measurement of an anomalous emission
$\mathrm{I_\nu}=6.6^{+5.0}_{-4.8}\times10^4$ Jy/sr at 95% confidence, which
could be explained by CII emission, favoring collisional excitation models of
CII emission that tend to be more optimistic than models based on CII
luminosity scaling relations from local measurements; however, a comparison of
Bayesian information criteria reveal that this model and the CIB & SZ only
model are equally plausible. Thus, more sensitive measurements will be needed
to confirm the existence of large-scale CII emission at high redshifts.
Finally, we forecast that intensity maps from Planck cross-correlated with
quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) would increase our
sensitivity to CII emission by a factor of 5, while the proposed Primordial
Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) could increase the sensitivity further.

phase lags at the QPO frequency are always positive (hard), and show very
different behavior between QPOs with frequencies below and above $\sim1.7$ Hz:
when the QPO frequency is below $\sim1.7$ Hz, the phase lags increase both with
QPO frequency and energy, while when the QPO frequency is above $\sim1.7$ Hz,
the phase lags remain more or less constant. When the QPO frequency is higher
than $\sim1.7$ Hz, a broad feature is always present in the lag-energy spectra
at around 6.5 keV, suggesting that the reflection component may have a
significant contribution to the phase lags. Below $\sim1.7$ Hz, the QPO rms
first decreases with energy and then turns to almost flat, while above
$\sim1.7$ Hz, the QPO rms increases with energy. During the transition from the
low-hard state to the hard-intermediate state, the second harmonic and
subharmonic of this QPO appear in the power density spectra. The
second-harmonic and subharmonic phase lags show very similar evolution with
their centroid frequencies. However, the energy dependence of the
second-harmonic and subharmonic phase lags are quite different. Our results
suggest that, at different phases of the outburst, different mechanisms may be

mediating the nonlinear transfer of energy from large-scale electromagnetic
fields and plasma flows to small scales at which the energy may be ultimately

tangling of the magnetic field that threads through the plasma. The resulting
wander of the magnetic field lines may significantly impact a number of
important physical processes, including the propagation of cosmic rays and
energetic particles, confinement in magnetic fusion devices, and the
fundamental processes of turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and particle
acceleration. The various potential impacts of magnetic field line wander are
reviewed in detail, and a number of important theoretical considerations are
identified that may influence the development and saturation of magnetic field
line wander in astrophysical plasma turbulence. The results of nonlinear
gyrokinetic simulations of kinetic Alfven wave turbulence of sub-ion length
scales are evaluated to understand the development and saturation of the
turbulent magnetic energy spectrum and of the magnetic field line wander. It is
found that turbulent space and astrophysical plasmas are generally expected to
contain a stochastic magnetic field due to the tangling of the field by strong
plasma turbulence. Future work will explore how the saturated magnetic field
line wander varies as a function of the amplitude of the plasma turbulence and
the ratio of the thermal to magnetic pressure, known as the plasma beta.

In this paper, we show that such strong magnetic field and energy dependency of

examine the variations of maximum mass and related radius, Schwarzschild
radius, average density, gravitational redshift, Kretschmann scalar and
Buchdahl theorem due to magnetic field and also energy dependency of metric.
First, it will be shown that the maximum mass and radius of neutron stars are
increasing function of magnetic field while average density, redshift, the
strength of gravity and Kretschmann scalar are decreasing functions of it.
These results are due to a repulsive-like force behavior for the magnetic

be shown that by increasing the rainbow function, the neutron stars could enjoy
an expansion in their structures. Then, we obtain a new relation for the upper
mass limit of a static spherical neutron star with uniform density in gravity's
rainbow (Buchdahl limit) in which such upper limit is modified as
$M_{eff}<\frac{4c^{2}R}{9G}$. In addition, stability and energy conditions for
the equation of state of neutron star matter are also investigated and a
comparison with empirical results is done. It is notable that the numerical
study in this paper is conducted by using the lowest order constrained
variational (LOCV) approach in the presence of magnetic field employing AV18

solves the label permutation problem observed in the deep learning based

theoretical equivalence are also cases of physical equivalence. The scheme is
applied to gauge/gravity dualities. I expound what I argue to be their
contribution to questions about: (iii) the nature of spacetime in quantum
gravity; (iv) broader philosophical and physical discussions of spacetime.
(i)-(ii) proceed by analysing duality through four contrasts. A duality will be
a suitable isomorphism between models: and the four relevant contrasts are as
follows:
  (a) Bare theory: a triple of states, quantities, and dynamics endowed with
appropriate structures and symmetries; vs. interpreted theory: which is endowed
with, in addition, a suitable pair of interpretative maps.
  (b) Extendable vs. unextendable theories: which can, respectively cannot, be
extended as regards their domains of application.
  (c) External vs. internal intepretations: which are constructed,
respectively, by coupling the theory to another interpreted theory vs. from
within the theory itself.
  (d) Theoretical vs. physical equivalence: which contrasts formal equivalence
with the equivalence of fully interpreted theories.
  I apply this scheme to answering questions (iii)-(iv) for gauge/gravity
dualities. I argue that the things that are physically relevant are those that
stand in a bijective correspondence under duality: the common core of the two
models. I therefore conclude that most of the mathematical and physical
structures that we are familiar with, in these models, are largely, though
crucially never entirely, not part of that common core. Thus, the
interpretation of dualities for theories of quantum gravity compels us to
rethink the roles that spacetime, and many other tools in theoretical physics,
play in theories of spacetime.

of natural laws. Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured
by different clocks depends on their relative motion and on the strength of the
gravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the time
parameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks (i.e., clocks at rest with
respect to the expanding space). This proper time is assumed to flow at a
constant rate throughout the whole history of the universe. We make the
alternative hypothesis that the rate at which the cosmological time flows
depends on the dynamical state of the universe. In thermodynamics, the arrow of
time is strongly related to the second law, which states that the entropy of an
isolated system will always increase with time or, at best, stay constant.
Hence, we assume that the time measured by fundamental clocks is proportional
to the entropy of the region of the universe that is causally connected to
them. Under that simple assumption, we find it possible to build toy
cosmological models that present an acceleration of their expansion without any
need for dark energy while being spatially closed and finite, avoiding the need

  experiment",,,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Young double-slit interference pattern produced by quantum objects, like
photons, that move through a double-slit is regarded, by the conventional
Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as the evidence of the
wave-like behaviour potentially contained in the wave function. On the
contrary, a more realistic view of this phenomenon considers the quantum object
a particle accompanied by a pilot wave which would be the cause of the
interference fringes. This paper proposes a feasible experiment, based on an
easy variation of the nowadays common double-slit experimental set-ups, aimed
at detecting the effects of the pilot wave once 'detached' from the particles
that it steers. Besides, a further realistic idea, based on the geometrical
violation of Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI), is put forward as to the intrinsic
nature of the photon. This new idea along with the possibly positive results of
the experiment would allow us to shed new light on the real nature of quantum
objects in term of the geometrical violation of LLI.

multivariate data analysis techniques have been considered in the literature,
such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis
(ICA), factor analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).
Nevertheless, these conventional approaches neglect any possible nonlinear
variations in the time activity curves describing the kinetic behavior of
tissues with specific binding, which limits their ability to recover a
reliable, understandable and interpretable description of the data. This paper
proposes an alternative analysis paradigm that accounts for spatial
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the tracer between a free compartment and
a specifically bound ligand compartment. The method relies on the concept of
linear unmixing, usually applied on the hyperspectral domain, which combines
NMF with a sum-to-one constraint that ensures an exhaustive description of the
mixtures. The spatial variability of the signature corresponding to the
specific binding tissue is explicitly modeled through a perturbed component.
The performance of the method is assessed on both synthetic and real data and
is shown to compete favorably when compared to other conventional analysis
methods. The proposed method improved both factor estimation and proportions
extraction for specific binding. Modeling the variability of the specific
binding factor has a strong potential impact for dynamic PET image analysis.

  Space-time Popularities",,,"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2787979",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small basestations (SBs) equipped with caching units have potential to handle
the unprecedented demand growth in heterogeneous networks. Through low-rate,
backhaul connections with the backbone, SBs can prefetch popular files during
off-peak traffic hours, and service them to the edge at peak periods. To
intelligently prefetch, each SB must learn what and when to cache, while taking
into account SB memory limitations, the massive number of available contents,
the unknown popularity profiles, as well as the space-time popularity dynamics
of user file requests. In this work, local and global Markov processes model
user requests, and a reinforcement learning (RL) framework is put forth for
finding the optimal caching policy when the transition probabilities involved
are unknown. Joint consideration of global and local popularity demands along
with cache-refreshing costs allow for a simple, yet practical asynchronous
caching approach. The novel RL-based caching relies on a Q-learning algorithm
to implement the optimal policy in an online fashion, thus enabling the cache
control unit at the SB to learn, track, and possibly adapt to the underlying
dynamics. To endow the algorithm with scalability, a linear function
approximation of the proposed Q-learning scheme is introduced, offering faster
convergence as well as reduced complexity and memory requirements. Numerical
tests corroborate the merits of the proposed approach in various realistic
settings.

out-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a manifestation
of the former. Basically, this is a feature of three-dimensional bodies. At
variance, two-dimensional bodies have more freedom to deform than
three-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this peculiarity and propose a
two-dimensional honeycomb structure with out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite
to the in-plane one. With a suitable choice of the lattice constitutive
parameters, in its continuum description such a structure can achieve the whole
range of values for the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a
membranal Poisson coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can
reach the extreme values, $-1$ and $+1$, of the bending Poisson coefficient.
Analytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing the
accuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the discrete
structure.

While many of the recently developed technologies no longer use a mechanism
that follows the strict definition of the term ""capacitive"", these methods
nevertheless share many common elements that encourage treating them with
similar metrics and analyses. Specifically, they all involve electrically
driven removal of ions from a feed stream, storage in an electrode (i.e., ion
electrosorption) and release, in charge/discharge cycles. Grouping all these
methods in the technology class of CDI makes it possible to treat evolving new
technologies in standardized terms and compare them to other technologies in

concept is employed to efficiently generate arbitrarily large, statistically
consistent realizations of investigated microstructures. Second, benefiting
from the regular structure inherent to the tiling concept, the Partition
theorem, and statistical sampling, we construct confidence intervals of the
apparent properties related to the size of a microstructure specimen. Based on
the interval width and the upper and lower bounds on the apparent properties,
we adaptively generate additional microstructure realizations in order to
arrive at an RVE satisfying the prescribed tolerance. The methodology is
illustrated with the homogenization of thermo-mechanical properties of three
two-dimensional microstructure models: a microstructure with mono-disperse
elliptic inclusions, foam, and sandstone.

functional decline observed in AD. As of today there are few FDA approved drugs
in the market for treatment, but their cholinergic adverse effect, potentially
distressing toxicity and limited targets in AD pathology limits their use.
Therefore, it is crucial to find an effective compounds to combat AD. We choose
45 plant derived natural compounds that have antioxidant properties to slow
down disease progression by quenching free redicals or promoting endogenous
antioxidant capacity. However, we performed molecular docking studies to
investigate the binding interactions between natural compounds and 13 various
anti Alzheimer drug targets. Three known Cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil,
Galantamine and Rivastigmine) were taken as reference drugs over natural
compounds for comparison and drug likeness studies. Few of these compounds
showed good inhibitory activity besides anti oxidant activity. Most of these
compounds followed pharmacokinetics properties that make them potentially
promising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
