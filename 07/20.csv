potential energy is zero), except for a half-line barrier. On the barrier, both
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are considered. The half-line barrier
yields one of the simplest cases of diffraction. Using the exact time-dependent
propagator found by Schulman, the trajectories are computed numerically for
different initial Gaussian wave packets. In particular, it is found that
different boundary conditions may lead to qualitatively different sets of
trajectories. In the Dirichlet case, the particles tend to be more strongly
repelled. The case of an incoming plane wave is also considered. The
corresponding Bohmian trajectories are compared with the trajectories of an oil
drop hopping on the surface of a vibrating bath.

responsive nanoreactors, catalytically active nanoparticles coated by a
stimuli-responsive 'gating' shell, whose permeability controls the activity of
the process. We address two archetypal scenarios encountered in this system:
The first, where two species diffusing from a bulk solution react at the
catalyst's surface; the second where only one of the reactants diffuses from
the bulk while the other one is produced at the nanoparticle surface, e.g., by
light conversion. We find that in both scenarios the total catalytic rate has
the same mathematical structure, once diffusion rates are properly redefined.
Moreover, the diffusional fluxes of the different reactants are strongly
coupled, providing a richer behavior than that arising in unimolecular
reactions. We also show that in stark contrast to bulk reactions, the
identification of a limiting reactant is not simply determined by the relative
bulk concentrations but controlled by the nanoreactor shell permeability.
Finally, we describe an application of our theory by analyzing experimental
data on the reaction between hexacyanoferrate (III) and borohydride ions in
responsive hydrogel-based core-shell nanoreactors.

elastic medium. By using a semi-discrete model, we are able to investigate two
specific aspects of the dynamics, namely (i) the interaction with free
boundaries and collision events and (ii) the confinement inside the domain when
a suitable Dirichlet-type boundary condition is imposed.
  In the first case, we analytically prove that free boundaries attract
dislocations and we provide an expression for the Peach--Koehler force on a
dislocation near the boundary. Moreover, we use this to prove an upper bound on
the collision time of a dislocation with the boundary, provided certain
geometric conditions are satisfied. An upper bound on the collision time for
two dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors hitting each other is also
obtained.
  In the second case, we turn to domains whose boundaries are subject to an
external stress. In this situation, we prove that dislocations find it
energetically favourable to stay confined inside the material instead of
getting closer to the boundary. The result first proved for a single
dislocation in the material is extended to a system of many dislocations, for
which the analysis requires the careful treatments of the interaction terms.

corresponding eigenvalues are equally spaced and form the well-known
Wannier-Stark ladder, the spacing being independent of the second-order

Bloch oscillations. Frequency doubling of the fundamental Bloch frequency sets
up at finite values of the second-order coupling. On the contrary when a single

H30$\alpha$ (231.90 GHz) emission from the low metallicity dwarf galaxy NGC
5253 to measure the star formation rate (SFR) within the galaxy and to test the
reliability of SFRs derived from other commonly-used metrics. The H30$\alpha$
emission, which originates mainly from the central starburst, yields a
photoionizing photon production rate of (1.9$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{52}$ s$^{-1}$
and an SFR of 0.087$\pm$0.013 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based on conversions that
account for the low metallicity of the galaxy and for stellar rotation. Among
the other star formation metrics we examined, the SFR calculated from the total
infrared flux was statistically equivalent to the values from the H30$\alpha$
data. The SFR based on previously-published versions of the H$\alpha$ flux that
were extinction corrected using Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ lines were lower than
but also statistically similar to the H30$\alpha$ value. The mid-infrared (22
$\mu$m) flux density and the composite star formation tracer based on H$\alpha$
and mid-infrared emission give SFRs that were significantly higher because the
dust emission appears unusually hot compared to typical spiral galaxies.
Conversely, the 70 and 160 $\mu$m flux densities yielded SFR lower than the
H30$\alpha$ value, although the SFRs from the 70 $\mu$m and H30$\alpha$ data
were within 1-2$\sigma$ of each other. While further analysis on a broader
range of galaxies are needed, these results are instructive of the best and
worst methods to use when measuring SFR in low metallicity dwarf galaxies like
NGC 5253.

time-dependent phoneme posterior probabilities from word lattices, followed by
their smoothing. For the PPB features we developed a special novel very fast,
simple and efficient OOV decoder. Experimental results are presented on the
Georgian language from the IARPA Babel Program, which was the test language in
the OpenKWS 2016 evaluation campaign. The results show that in terms of maximum
term weighted value (MTWV) metric and computational speed, for single ASR
systems, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
approach based on using in-vocabulary proxies for OOV keywords in the indexed
database. The comparison of the two OOV KWS approaches on the fusion results of
the nine different ASR systems demonstrates that the proposed OOV decoder
outperforms the proxy-based approach in terms of MTWV metric given the
comparable processing speed. Other important advantages of the OOV decoder
include extremely low memory consumption and simplicity of its implementation

high-energy X-ray and even $\gamma$-ray emissions, is closely associated with
magnetic reconnection of a large-scale loop in the aftermath of the eruption.
The reconnection inflow of the loop leg is observed in the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304 \r{A} passband and
accelerates towards the reconnection region to a speed as high as $\sim$130
km/s. Simultaneously the corresponding outflow jets are observed in the AIA hot
passbands with a speed of $\sim$740 km/s and mean temperature of $\sim$14 MK.
RHESSI observations show a strong burst of hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray

soft-hard-harder behavior. A distinct altitude decrease of the HXR loop-top
source coincides with the inward swing of the loop leg observed in the AIA 304

fast inflow of magnetic flux contained in the loop leg greatly enhances the
reconnection rate and results in very efficient particle acceleration in the

solvable problem class in combinatorial optimization with a multitude of
applications in various fields. Surprisingly, there is only very little known
about constraint types under which SFM remains efficiently solvable. The
arguably most relevant non-trivial constraint class for which polynomial SFM
algorithms are known are parity constraints, i.e., optimizing only over sets of
odd (or even) cardinality. Parity constraints capture classical combinatorial
optimization problems like the odd-cut problem, and they are a key tool in a
recent technique to efficiently solve integer programs with a constraint matrix
whose subdeterminants are bounded by two in absolute value.
  We show that efficient SFM is possible even for a significantly larger class
than parity constraints, by introducing a new approach that combines techniques
from Combinatorial Optimization, Combinatorics, and Number Theory. In
particular, we can show that efficient SFM is possible over all sets (of any

This covers generalizations of the odd-cut problem with open complexity status,

represent the geometry of the data set. Functionals which model the task reward
the regularity of the estimator function and impose or reward the agreement

changes the orientation of the molecules and affects the capacitance. By using
Frank-Oseen elastic theory the molecular reorientation is simulated. The
influence of various parameters on capacitance such beam width, anchoring
condition, externally applied voltage, beam power and launching position is
presented. For instance, the maximum tuning range is achieved for wide beams
and the molecules initially aligned close to the propagation axis. It is also
proved that launching position, especially for narrow beams, has limited
influence on capacitance. The proposed component can be used, for instance, in
optical power meters, as a feedback in laser or diode systems or just as a

away from the disk along magnetic field lines. Because the Alfv\'en speed
varies with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,
and counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade
to small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an
Elsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the
theory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then
derive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent
heating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs
propagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating
toward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and
time-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and
$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded
by a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\sim
(\rho_{\rm b}/\rho_{\rm d})^{1/2} \beta_{\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's
radiative flux, where $\rho_{\rm b}$ and $\rho_{\rm d}$ are the mass densities
at the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\beta_{\rm net,d}$ is
the ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to
the pressure of the average vertical magnetic field. This energy flux could
have a significant impact on disk coronae and outflows. To lay the groundwork

these permutation-based models, unlike their parametric counterparts, do not
admit consistent estimation for most comparison topologies used in practice. We
then demonstrate that consistent estimation is possible when the assignment of
items to the topology is randomized, thus establishing a dichotomy between
worst-case and average-case designs. We propose two estimators in the
average-case setting and analyze their risk, showing that it depends on the
comparison topology only through the degree sequence of the topology. The rates
achieved by these estimators are shown to be optimal for a large class of
graphs. Our results are corroborated by simulations on multiple comparison
topologies.

Loops (MCCL) to overcome these effects using a forward modeling approach. We
focus here on one of the control loops in this method, the task of which is the
calibration of the shear measurement. For this purpose, we first consider the
requirements on the shear systematics for a given survey and propagate them to
different systematics terms. We use two one-point statistics to calibrate the
shear measurement and six further one-point statistics as diagnostics. We also
propagate the systematics levels that we estimate from the one-point functions
to the two-point functions for the different systematic error sources. This
allows us to assess the consistency between the systematics levels measured in
different ways. To test the method, we construct synthetic sky surveys with an
area of 1,700 deg$^2$. With some simplifying assumptions, we are able to meet
the requirements on the shear calibration for this survey configuration.
Furthermore, we account for the total residual shear systematics in terms of
the contributing sources. We discuss how this MCCL framework can be applied to
current and future weak lensing surveys.

Their interaction with the surrounding media is critical as it determines the
jet evolution, observable signature, and feedback on the environment. During
its motion the interaction of the jet with the ambient media inflates a highly
pressurized cocoon, which under certain conditions collimates the jet and
strongly affects its propagation. Recently, Bromberg et al. (2011) derived a
general simplified (semi)analytic solution for the evolution of the jet and the
cocoon in case of an unmagnetized jet that propagates in a medium with a range
of density profiles. In this work we use a large suite of 2D and 3D
relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in order to test the validity and
accuracy of this model. We discuss the similarities and differences between the
analytic model and numerical simulations and also, to some extent, between 2D
and 3D simulations. Our main finding is that although the analytic model is
highly simplified, it properly predicts the evolution of the main ingredients
of the jet-cocoon system, including its temporal evolution and the transition
between various regimes (e.g., collimated to uncollimated). The analytic
solution predicts a jet head velocity that is faster by a factor of about 3
compared to the simulations, as long as the head velocity is Newtonian. We use
the results of the simulations to calibrate the analytic model which
significantly increases its accuracy. We provide an applet that calculates

SPHERE, using the imaging mode (IRDIS+IFS) and the long-slit spectroscopy mode
(IRDIS-LSS). The data were reduced using the dedicated SPHERE pipeline, and
algorithms such as PCA and TLOCI were applied to reduce the speckle pattern.
The IFS images revealed a previously unknown low-mass (~0.16$M_{\odot}$)
stellar companion (HD 294149 B) at ~0.1$^{\prime\prime}$, compatible with
previously observed radial velocity differences, as well as proper motion
differences between Gaia and Tycho-2 measurements. The known brown dwarf
companion (HD 284149 b) is clearly visible in the IRDIS images. This allowed us
to refine both its photometry and astrometry. The analysis of the medium
resolution IRDIS long slit spectra also allowed a refinement of temperature and
spectral type estimates. A full reassessment of the age and distance of the
system was also performed, leading to more precise values of both mass and
semi-major axis. As a result of this study, HD 284149 ABb therefore becomes the
latest addition to the (short) list of brown dwarfs on wide circumbinary
orbits, providing new evidence to support recent claims that object in such

introduced the idea of using a finite number of sampled states with the bounds
of the stability inequalities near the samples. However, high-order bounds with
respect to the distance between the samples are essential to decrease the
number of sampling. From the standpoint of control theory, the requirement is
not only evaluating stability but also simultaneously designing a controller.
This paper overcomes theses two issues to stabilize GP-based dynamical systems.
Second-order bounds of the stability inequalities are derived whereas existing
approaches use first-order bounds. The proposed method obtaining the bounds are
widely applicable to various functions such as polynomials, Gaussian processes,
Gaussian mixture models, and sum/product functions of them. Unifying the
derived bounds and nonlinear optimal control theory yields a stabilizing
(sub-)optimal controller for GP dynamics. A numerical simulation demonstrates
the stability performance of the proposed approach.

velocity transit through the intracluster medium (ICM), the hydrodynamical
interactions with the ICM produce a ~ 100 kpc tail of ionized gas that we map
with a mosaic of five MUSE pointings up to 60 kpc from the galaxy. CGCG 97087N,
a small companion that lies at few arcminutes in projection from UGC 6697, is
also suffering from the hydrodynamic action of the ICM of the cluster. Along
the whole extent of the tail we detect diffuse H$\alpha$ emission and, to a
lesser extent, H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda5007$, and [OI]$\lambda6300$. By
comparing the kinematics and distribution of gas and stars (as traced by the
CaII triplet) for both galaxies, we separate the ionized gas, as traced by the
H$\alpha$ line, in a component still bound to the galaxy and a component that
is stripped. We find that the ""onboard"" component shows low velocity dispersion
and line ratios consistent with photoionization by hot stars. The stripped gas
is more turbulent, with velocity dispersions up to > 100 km/s}, and is excited
by shocks as traced by high values of [OI]/H$\alpha$ and [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratio.
In the tail of UGC 6697 we identify numerous bright compact knots with line
ratios typical of HII regions. These are distributed along the only streams of
stripped gas retaining low velocity dispersions (< 35 km/s). Despite being in
the stripped gas, their physical properties do not differentiate from normal
HII regions in galactic disks. We find evidence of a past fast encounter
between the two galaxies in the form of a double tail emerging from CGCG 97087N
that connects with UGC 6697. This encounter might have increased the efficiency
of the stripping process, leaving the stellar distribution and kinematics
unaltered.

global measurements. Moreover, for many estimation problems separable states
and local measurements are optimal, and can achieve the ultimate quantum limit
on the estimation uncertainty. This immediately implies that there are broad
conditions under which simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters cannot
outperform individual, independent estimations. Our results apply to any
situation in which spatially localized sensors are unitarily encoded with
independent parameters, such as when estimating multiple linear or non-linear
optical phase shifts in quantum imaging, or when mapping out the spatial

magnetic field parallel to the direction of an applied current, has recently
been experimentally verified in Weyl semimetals and topological insulators in
the bulk conduction limit. The appearance of negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance in topological semimetals is understood as an effect of
chiral anomaly, whereas it is not well-defined in topological insulators.
Another intriguing phenomenon, planar Hall effect - appearance of a transverse
voltage in the plane of applied co-planar electric and magnetic fields not
perfectly aligned to each other, a configuration in which the conventional Hall
effect vanishes, has recently been suggested to exist in Weyl semimetals. In
this paper we present a quasi-classical theory of planar Hall effect of a
three-dimensional topological insulator in the bulk conduction limit. Starting
from Boltzmann transport equations we derive the expressions for planar Hall
conductivity and longitudinal magnetoconductivity in topological insulators and
show the important roles played by the orbital magnetic moment for the
appearance of planar Hall effect. Our theoretical results predict specific
experimental signatures for topological insulators that can be directly checked

The challenge is to find the optimal relative weighting (or parameters) of

Hand-tuning these parameters would result in sub optimal solutions and quickly
become infeasible as the number of metrics increases. Furthermore, such

stellar mass function of satellite galaxies at $z\simeq0$ with observations.
Our results depend on the mass of the stars that form in satellite galaxies
after the entry time. A model in which star formation shuts down completely as
soon a galaxy enters a group environment is ruled out because it underpredicts
the stellar masses of satellite galaxies even in the absence of tidal
stripping. The greater is the stellar mass that is allowed to form, the greater
the fraction that needs to be tidally stripped. The stellar mass fraction lost
by satellite galaxies after entering a group or cluster environment is
consistent with any value in the range $0-40\%$. To place stronger constraints,
we consider a more refined model of tidal stripping of galaxies on elongated
orbits (where stripping occurs at orbit pericentres). Our model predicts less
tidal stripping: satellite galaxies lose $\sim 20-25\%$ of their stellar mass
since their entry into the group. This finding is consistent with a
slow-starvation delayed-quenching picture, in which galaxies that enter a group

representation of speech. We then transform nuisance attributes of speech that
are irrelevant to recognition by modifying the latent representations, in order
to augment labeled training data with additional data whose distribution is
more similar to the target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on the

use PCA analysis to derive a linear shape basis across the spatially

the PCA reconstruction error. Even with the spatial sorting, the point clouds

The optimal precoding and power allocation schemes that maximize the achievable

this hypothetical planet sits at the boundary between planets for which we
expect that tidal forces should have aligned their rotation axes with their
orbital axes (i.e., ones with zero obliquity) and planets whose timescale for
tidal alignment is longer than the typical age of an exoplanet system. In line
with observational progress, which is pushing atmospheric characterization to
planets on longer orbital periods, we calculate the observable signatures of
obliquity for a transiting warm Jupiter: in orbital phase curves of thermal
emission and in the hemispheric flux gradients that could be measured by
eclipse mapping. For both of these predicted measurements, the signal that we
would see depends strongly on our viewing geometry relative to the orientation
of the planet's rotation axis, and we thoroughly identify the degeneracies that
result. We compare these signals to the predicted sensitivities of current and

able to constrain the obliquities of nearby warm Jupiters to be small (if less
than or equal to 10 degrees) or to directly measure them if significantly
non-zero (greater than or equal to 30 degrees), using the technique of eclipse
mapping. For a bright target and assuming photon-limited precision, this could

that they can accrete within an impact-generated disk. However, the detailed
structure and initial thermodynamic properties of the disk are poorly
understood. In this paper, we perform high-resolution SPH simulations of the
Martian moon-forming giant impact that can also form the Borealis basin. This
giant impact heats up the disk material (around $\sim 2000$ K in temperature)
with an entropy increase of $\sim 1500$ J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$. Thus, the disk
material should be mostly molten, though a tiny fraction of disk material ($<
5\%$) would even experience vaporization. Typically, a piece of molten disk
material is estimated to be meter sized due to the fragmentation regulated by
their shear velocity and surface tension during the impact process. The disk
materials initially have highly eccentric orbits ($e \sim 0.6-0.9$) and
successive collisions between meter-sized fragments at high impact velocity
($\sim 3-5$ km s$^{-1}$) can grind them down to $\sim100 \mu$m-sized particles.
On the other hand, a tiny amount of vaporized disk material condenses into
$\sim 0.1 \mu$m-sized grains. Thus, the building blocks of the Martian moons
are expected to be a mixture of these different sized particles from
meter-sized down to $\sim 100 \mu$m-sized particles and $\sim 0.1 \mu$m-sized
grains. Our simulations also suggest that the building blocks of Phobos and
Deimos contain both impactor and Martian materials (at least 35%), most of
which come from the Martian mantle (50-150 km in depth; at least 50%). Our
results will give useful information for planning a future sample return
mission to Martian moons, such as JAXA's MMX (Martian Moons eXploration)
mission.

different locations. It is challenging for the current service providers to
cope with the increasing content demand from a large number of collocated
mobile users. In-network caching to offload content at nodes closer to users
alleviate the issue, though efficient cache management is required to find out
who should cache what, when and where in an urban environment, given nodes
limited computing, communication and caching resources. To address this, we
first define a novel relation between content popularity and availability in
the network and investigate a node's eligibility to cache content based on its
urban reachability. We then allow nodes to self-organize into mobile fogs to
increase the distributed cache and maximize content availability in a
cost-effective manner. However, to cater rational nodes, we propose a coalition
game for the nodes to offer a maximum ""virtual cache"" assuming a monetary
reward is paid to them by the service/content provider. Nodes are allowed to
merge into different spatio-temporal coalitions in order to increase the
distributed cache size at the network edge. Results obtained through
simulations using realistic urban mobility trace validate the performance of
our caching system showing a ratio of 60-85% of cache hits compared to the
30-40% obtained by the existing schemes and 10% in case of no coalition.

e.g. using everything your phone measures about you for diagnostics or

baselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an
algorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with
medically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the
literature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find
that the bulk of the literature ($\sim$77%) uses meaningless comparisons that
ignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone
data to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to
over 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply
guessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific
baseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it
usually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely
useless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on
the perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the
field. To solve this problem we propose ""user lift"" that reduces these
systematic errors in the evaluation of personalized medical monitoring.

utilizing geometric features that can be localized more repeatably. The outer

the convex geometry of the underlying sets of resource-free states. We
establish easily verifiable criteria for a measure to possess desirable
properties such as faithfulness and strong monotonicity under relevant free
operations, and show that many quantifiers obtained in this framework indeed
satisfy them for any considered quantum resource. We derive various bounds and
relations between the measures, generalising and providing significantly
simplified proofs of results found in the resource theories of quantum
entanglement and coherence. We also prove that the quantification of resources
in this framework simplifies for pure states, allowing us to obtain more easily
computable forms of the considered measures and show that several of them are
equal on pure states. Further, we investigate the dual formulation of resource
quantifiers, characterising sets of resource witnesses.

entanglement, as well as magic states, providing insight into the

subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity
to constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass
contained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity
subpopulations. Walker and Penarrubia have used this approach to argue that
data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their
inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high
statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the
validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of
Simulating The Local Environment) Lambda cold dark matter cosmological
hydrodynamics simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all
have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct
metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a
method analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia to a sample of 53 simulated
dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant
detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although
multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of
the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based.
The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly
elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different
asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the

photoreactivity and dihedral angle conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in
cEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization occurs mainly in cEc
rotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone to
previtamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a
cyclobutene-toxisterol in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong
absorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol acts mainly as a sun shield
suppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol
formation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc
rotamer can lead to previtamin D formation. Our study reinforces a recent
hypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D source when only low
energy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the
morning and evening hours of the day.

insulator (TI)-ferromagnetic metal (FM) bilayers have generated a great deal of
excitement due to their potential applications in spintronics. The source of
the observed spin-transfer torque, however, remains unclear. This is because
the large charge transfer from the FM to TI layer would prevent the Dirac cone
at the interface from being anywhere near the Fermi level to contribute to the
observed spin-transfer torque. Moreover, there is yet little understanding of
the impact on the Dirac cone at the interface from the metallic bands
overlapping in energy and momentum, where strong hybridization could take
place. Here, we build a simple microscopic model and perform
first-principles-based simulations for such a TI-FM heterostructure,
considering the strong hybridization and charge transfer effects. We find that
the original Dirac cone is destroyed by the hybridization as expected. Instead,
we find a new interface state which we dub 'descendent state' to form near the
Fermi level due to the strong hybridization with the FM states at the same
momentum. Such a `descendent state' carries a sizable weight of the original
Dirac interface state, and thus inherits the localization at the interface and
the same Rashba-type spin-momentum locking. We propose that the `descendent
state' may be an important source of the experimentally observed large
spin-transfer torque in the TI-FM heterostructure.

comprise a sub-continuum of the lives of the field. Each life carries an
internal memory containing a local relative wavefunction, which is a local
piece of a pure universal wavefunction, but only the relative wavefunctions are
physically real in PL, and not the universal wavefunction in configuration
space. Furthermore, while the universal wavefunction tracks the average
behavior of the lives of a system, it fails to track their individual dynamics
and trajectories. There is always a preferred separable basis, and for an
irreducible physical system, each orthogonal term in this basis is a different
relative world - each containing some fraction of the lives of the system. The
relative wavefunctions in the lives' internal memories govern which lives of
different systems can meet during future local interactions, and thereby
enforce entanglement correlations - including Bell inequality violations.

present two implementations of LPMLN, $\text{LPMLN2ASP}$ and
$\text{LPMLN2MLN}$. System $\text{LPMLN2ASP}$ translates LPMLN programs into
the input language of answer set solver $\text{CLINGO}$, and using weak
constraints and stable model enumeration, it can compute most probable stable
models as well as exact conditional and marginal probabilities. System
$\text{LPMLN2MLN}$ translates LPMLN programs into the input language of Markov
Logic solvers, such as $\text{ALCHEMY}$, $\text{TUFFY}$, and $\text{ROCKIT}$,
and allows for performing approximate probabilistic inference on LPMLN
programs. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the LPMLN systems for computing
other languages, such as ProbLog and Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to
be translatable into LPMLN. (Under consideration for acceptance in TPLP)

mass implies, in addition to the electroweak vacuum, the existence of a new
vacuum where the Higgs field value is around the Planck scale. We explore two-

compactifications of the electroweak vacuum as well as this high scale vacuum,
in the presence of Majorana/Dirac neutrinos and/or axions. We point out
potential sources of instability for these lower dimensional critical points in
the standard model landscape. We also point out that a high scale $AdS_4$
vacuum of the Standard Model, if exists, would be at odd with the conjecture
that all non-supersymmetric $AdS$ vacua are unstable. We argue that, if we
require a degeneracy between three- and four-dimensional vacua as suggested by
the multiple point principle, the neutrinos are predicted to be Dirac, with the

exiting fiber-optic telecom networks with the commercial data transmission.
Previously, we proposed a time transfer scheme based on bidirectional time
division multiplexing transmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength
(BTDM-SFSW), and an optical amplification scheme of single-fiber
bidirectional-transmission unidirectional optical amplifier (SFBT-UOA). The
effects of excess noises like Rayleigh backscattering etc. on the received time
signals can be efficiently suppressed for an accepted timing jitter.
Simultaneously, the bidirectional propagation delay symmetry can be guaranteed
for an expected uncertainty without requiring complicated and expensive link
calibration. In this paper, we propose a high-precision joint BTDM-SFSW based
time and unidirectional frequency transfer over conventional telecom networks.
A stable frequency signal is achieved by compensating the fiber temperature
dependent phase variation according to the time transfer. The proposed joint
transfer scheme is demonstrated over a 320 km fiber-optic telecom testbed with
two 10 Gb/s data transmission channels. The time transfer stabilities (time
deviation, TDEV) of 23.2 ps/s and 5.4 ps/10^5 s, respectively, and the
frequency transfer stabilities (Allan deviation, ADEV) of 5.4X10^(-13)/s and

the 95 GHz continuum was observed to extend from the center at a position angle

show spectral indices of $\alpha\leq -0.6$ and $-0.2$ along the jets and in the

HCN(1-0), HCN(4-3), HCO$^+$(1-0), HCO$^+$(4-3), CS(2-1), and CS(7-6) in both

derived from $J=1-0$ and $4-3$ lines of HCN and HCO$^+$ and $J=2-1$ and $7-6$

that the kinetic temperature of $T_{\rm k}=350-550$ K in the CND is higher than
$T_{\rm k}=80-300$ K in the ring, utilizing the intensity ratios of HCN,
HCO$^+$, and CS. The star-formation efficiency in the CND is almost an order of
magnitude lower than those at the spots in the star-forming ring, while the
dominant activity of the central region is the star formation rather than
active galactic nuclei. We determined that the large velocity dispersion of CO
extending toward the north side of the CND and decomposing into blueshifted and
redshifted features is probably explained by the effect of the radio jets.
These results strongly suggest that the jets heat the gas in the CND, in which
the feedback prevents star formation.

challenging task in unconstrained conditions due to significant variations in
scale, pose, expressions, and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a
multi-branch fully convolutional network (MB-FCN) for face detection, which
considers both efficiency and effectiveness in the design process. Our MB-FCN
detector can deal with faces at all scale ranges with only a single pass
through the backbone network. As such, our MB-FCN model saves computation and
thus is more efficient, compared to previous methods that make multiple passes.
For each branch, the specific skip connections of the convolutional feature
maps at different layers are exploited to represent faces in specific scale
ranges. Specifically, small faces can be represented with both shallow
fine-grained and deep powerful coarse features. With this representation,
superior improvement in performance is registered for the task of detecting
small faces. We test our MB-FCN detector on two public face detection
benchmarks, including FDDB and WIDER FACE. Extensive experiments show that our
detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all these datasets in general
and by a substantial margin on the most challenging among them (e.g. WIDER FACE
Hard subset). Also, MB-FCN runs at 15 FPS on a GPU for images of size 640 x 480

estimate the response time use the first two central moments of the probability
density function associated with the transition from the initial condition, at
$t=0$, to the steady state condition that arises in the long time limit, as $t
\to \infty$. This previous approach leads to a computationally convenient
estimation of the response time, but the accuracy can be poor. Here, we outline
a powerful extension using the first $k$ raw moments, showing how to produce an
extremely accurate estimate by making use of asymptotic properties of the
cumulative distribution function. Results are validated using an existing
laboratory-scale data set describing flow in a homogeneous porous medium. In
addition, we demonstrate how the results also apply to flow in heterogeneous
porous media. Overall, the new method is: (i) extremely accurate; and (ii)
computationally inexpensive. In fact, the computational cost of the new method
is orders of magnitude less than the computational effort required to study the
response time by solving the transient flow equation. Furthermore, the approach
provides a rigorous mathematical connection with the heuristic argument that
the response time for flow in a homogeneous porous medium is proportional to
$L^2/D$, where $L$ is a relevant length scale, and $D$ is the aquifer
diffusivity. Here, we extend such heuristic arguments by providing a clear
mathematical definition of the proportionality constant.

ADCs are limited in dynamic range. Whenever a signal exceeds some preset
threshold, the ADC saturates, resulting in aliasing due to clipping. The goal
of this paper is to analyze an alternative approach that does not suffer from
these problems. Our work is based on recent developments in ADC design, which
allow for ADCs that reset rather than to saturate, thus producing modulo
samples. An open problem that remains is: Given such modulo samples of a
bandlimited function as well as the dynamic range of the ADC, how can the
original signal be recovered and what are the sufficient conditions that
guarantee perfect recovery? In this paper, we prove such sufficiency conditions
and complement them with a stable recovery algorithm. Our results are not
limited to certain amplitude ranges, in fact even the same circuit architecture
allows for the recovery of arbitrary large amplitudes as long as some estimate
of the signal norm is available when recovering. Numerical experiments that
corroborate our theory indeed show that it is possible to perfectly recover

state-of-the-art. We also show the performance of ThiNet on ILSVRC-12
benchmark. ThiNet achieves 3.31$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 16.63$\times$
compression on VGG-16, with only 0.52$\%$ top-5 accuracy drop. Similar
experiments with ResNet-50 reveal that even for a compact network, ThiNet can
also reduce more than half of the parameters and FLOPs, at the cost of roughly
1$\%$ top-5 accuracy drop. Moreover, the original VGG-16 model can be further
pruned into a very small model with only 5.05MB model size, preserving AlexNet
level accuracy but showing much stronger generalization ability.

show with first-principles calculations that the tetragonal CuO (T-CuO)

renormalized mean-field theory. We argue that one CuO$_2$ sublattice is hole
doped while the other sublattice remains half filled and may have
antiferromagnetic (AF) order. The doped Cu sublattice can show d-wave SC;
however, its proximity to the AF Cu sublattice induces a spin-dependent
hopping, which splits the Fermi surface and may lead to a full SC gap.
Therefore, the nodeless SC gap observed in the experiment could be accounted
for by the d-wave SC proximity to an AF order, thus it is extrinsic rather than
intrinsic to the CuO$_2$ layers.

allocation, including power allocation and channel assignment, for all users,

power allocation has only been found in some special cases, while the joint
optimization of power allocation and channel assignment generally requires
exhaustive search. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation in
downlink NOMA systems. As the main contribution, we analytically characterize
the optimal power allocation with given channel assignment over multiple
channels under different performance criteria. Specifically, we consider the
maximin fairness, weighted sum rate maximization, sum rate maximization with
quality of service (QoS) constraints, energy efficiency maximization with
weights or QoS constraints in NOMA systems. We also take explicitly into
account the order constraints on the powers of the users on each channel, which
are often ignored in theexisting works, and show that they have a significant
impact on SIC in NOMA systems. Then, we provide the optimal power allocation
for the considered criteria in closed or semi-closed form. We also propose a
low-complexity efficient method to jointly optimize channel assignment and
power allocation in NOMA systems by incorporating the matching algorithm with
the optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the joint resource

present within these structures derives from the complexity of the composite

stages of composite SNR evolution. Of particular interest are systems
characterized by blastwave expansion within a nonuniform interstellar medium
(ISM), which contain an active pulsar having a substantial ""kick"" velocity
(upward of 300 km s$^{-1}$ ), because these systems tend to produce complex
morphologies. We present a numerical model that employs these and several other
factors in an effort to generate asymmetry similar to that seen in various
X-ray and radio observations. We find that the main parameters driving
structure are ISM uniformity and total pulsar spin- down energy, with secondary
contributions from factors such as pulsar trajectory and initial spin-down
luminosity. We also investigate the dynamics behind PWN ""tails,"" which may form
to link active pulsars to a crushed, relic nebula as the reverse shock passes.

graphene nanoribbons. By focusing on the interplay between this feature and
non-trivial topology in the domain of the Dirac confinement problem, this paper
proposes to examine how effects associated with edge shape manifest themselves
in conjunction with the topological signature typical of M\""{o}bius strips
within a low-energy regime. Aiming to provide an alternative to prevailing
tight-binding approaches, zigzag and armchair M\""{o}bius strips are modeled by
proposing compatible sets of boundary conditions, prescribing profiles of
terminations in both transverse and longitudinal directions which are
demonstrated to be coherent in describing consistently transverse edge patterns
in combination with a proper M\""{o}bius periodicity. Of particular importance
is the absence of constraints on the solution, in contrast with infinite mass
analogues, as well as an energy spectrum with a characteristic dual structure
responding exclusively to the parity associated with the transverse quantum
number. Zigzag ribbons are predicted to possess an intrinsic mechanism for
parity inversion, while the armchair ones carry the possibility of a coexistent
gapless and gapped band structure. We also inspect the influence of the edge
structure on persistent currents. In zigzag-edged configurations they are found
to be sensitive to a length-dependent term which behaves as an effective flux.
Armchair rings show a quite distinctive property: alternation of constant and
flux-dependent currents according to the width of the ring, for a fixed
transverse quantum number. In the flux-free case the effects of topology are

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the physical properties of strongly

mass and redshift distributions similar to barred galaxies. We find that the
star formation activity of strongly barred galaxies probed by starburstiness,
$\it{g-r}$, NUV$-r$, and mid-infrared [3.4]$-$[12] colors is, on average, lower
than that of non-barred galaxies. However, weakly barred galaxies do not show
such a difference between barred and non-barred galaxies. The amounts of atomic
and molecular gas in strongly barred galaxies are smaller than those of
non-barred galaxies, and the gas metallicity is higher in strongly barred
galaxies than in non-barred galaxies. The gas properties of weakly barred
galaxies again show no difference from those of non-barred galaxies. We stack
the optical spectra of barred and non-barred galaxies in several mass bins and
fit to the stacked spectra with a spectral fitting code, STARLIGHT. We find no
significant difference in stellar populations between barred and non-barred
galaxies for both strongly and weakly barred galaxies. Our results are
consistent with the idea that the star formation activity of barred galaxies is
enhanced in the past along with significant gas consumption, and is currently
lower than or similar to that of non-barred galaxies. The past star formation
enhancement depends on the strength of bars.

regular) weighted graphs: if $G$ is an $n$-node weighted undirected graph of
average combinatorial degree $d$ (that is, $G$ has $dn/2$ edges) and girth $g>
2d^{1/8}+1$, and if $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \lambda_n$ are the
eigenvalues of the (non-normalized) Laplacian of $G$, then \[ \frac
{\lambda_n}{\lambda_2} \geq 1 + \frac 4{\sqrt d} - O \left( \frac 1{d^{\frac

$d$-regular, then $\frac {\lambda_n}{\lambda_2} \geq 1 + \frac 4{\sqrt d} -
O\left( \frac 1 d \right)$ if the diameter is at least $d^{1.5}$.)
  Our result implies a lower bound for spectral sparsifiers. A graph $H$ is a
spectral $\epsilon$-sparsifier of a graph $G$ if \[ L(G) \preceq L(H) \preceq
(1+\epsilon) L(G) \] where $L(G)$ is the Laplacian matrix of $G$ and $L(H)$ is
the Laplacian matrix of $H$. Batson, Spielman and Srivastava proved that for
every $G$ there is an $\epsilon$-sparsifier $H$ of average degree $d$ where
$\epsilon \approx \frac {4\sqrt 2}{\sqrt d}$ and the edges of $H$ are a
(weighted) subset of the edges of $G$. Batson, Spielman and Srivastava also
show that the bound on $\epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\approx \frac
2{\sqrt d}$ when $G$ is a clique; our Alon-Boppana-type result implies that
$\epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\approx \frac 4{\sqrt d}$ when $G$ comes
from a family of expanders of super-constant degree and super-constant girth.
  The method of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava proves a more general result,
about sparsifying sums of rank-one matrices, and their method applies to an

transitions (also known as ""disorder lines"" or geometric phase transitions).
The phase transition is signalled by a change of asymptotic behavior of the
nonlocal string-string correlation functions when their monotonous decay
becomes modulated by incommensurate oscillations. The transitions occur for
rarefied ($m$-periodic) strings with arbitrary odd $m$. We propose a duality
transformation which maps the Ising chain onto the $m$-leg Ising tube with
nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs and the plaquette four-spin
interactions of adjacent legs. Then the $m$-string correlation functions of the
Ising chain are mapped onto the two-point spin-spin correlation functions along
the legs of the $m$-leg tube. We trace the origin of these cascades of phase
transitions to the lines of the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising chain in
$m$-periodic complex magnetic field, allowing us to relate these zeros to the
observable (and potentially measurable) quantities.

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-3881/aa8174",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite decades of inquiry, the origin of giant planets residing within a few
tenths of an astronomical unit from their host stars remains unclear.
Traditionally, these objects are thought to have formed further out before
subsequently migrating inwards. However, the necessity of migration has been
recently called into question with the emergence of in-situ formation models of
close-in giant planets. Observational characterization of the transiting
sub-sample of close-in giants has revealed that ""warm"" Jupiters, possessing
orbital periods longer than roughly 10 days more often possess close-in,
co-transiting planetary companions than shorter period ""hot"" Jupiters, that are
usually lonely. This finding has previously been interpreted as evidence that
smooth, early migration or in situ formation gave rise to warm Jupiter-hosting
systems, whereas more violent, post-disk migration pathways sculpted hot
Jupiter-hosting systems. In this work, we demonstrate that both classes of
planet may arise via early migration or in-situ conglomeration, but that the
enhanced loneliness of hot Jupiters arises due to a secular resonant
interaction with the stellar quadrupole moment. Such an interaction tilts the
orbits of exterior, lower mass planets, removing them from transit surveys
where the hot Jupiter is detected. Warm Jupiter-hosting systems, in contrast,
retain their coplanarity due to the weaker influence of the host star's
quadrupolar potential relative to planet-disk interactions. In this way, hot
Jupiters and warm Jupiters are placed within a unified theoretical framework
that may be readily validated or falsified using data from upcoming missions
such as TESS.

rings. The problem of dispersion of $n$ robots on an $n$ node graph, introduced
by Augustine and Moses Jr. [1], requires robots to coordinate with each other
and reach a configuration where exactly one robot is present on each node. This
problem has real world applications and applies whenever we want to minimize
the total cost of $n$ agents sharing $n$ resources, located at various places,
subject to the constraint that the cost of an agent moving to a different
resource is comparatively much smaller than the cost of multiple agents sharing
a resource (e.g. smart electric cars sharing recharge stations). The study of
this problem also provides indirect benefits to the study of scattering on
graphs, the study of exploration by mobile robots, and the study of load
balancing on graphs.
  We solve the problem of dispersion in the presence of two types of dynamism
in the underlying graph: (i) vertex permutation and (ii) 1-interval
connectivity. We introduce the notion of vertex permutation dynamism and have
it mean that for a given set of nodes, in every round, the adversary ensures a
ring structure is maintained, but the connections between the nodes may change.
We use the idea of 1-interval connectivity from Di Luna et al. [10], where for
a given ring, in each round, the adversary chooses at most one edge to remove.
  We assume robots have full visibility and present asymptotically time optimal
algorithms to achieve dispersion in the presence of both types of dynamism when
robots have chirality. When robots do not have chirality, we present
asymptotically time optimal algorithms to achieve dispersion subject to certain
constraints. Finally, we provide impossibility results for dispersion when
robots have no visibility.

spatial encoding in the brain is definitively known to be performed using a

paradoxically, one of the main encoding centers - the grid cells - represents
the world using a highly aliased, repetitive encoding structure where one
neuron represents an unbounded number of places in the world. Inspired by this

localization algorithms, by developing a novel place recognition algorithm that
seeks out and leverages repetitive, mutually complementary landmark frequencies
in the world. The combinatorial encoding capacity of multiple different
frequencies enables not only the ability to achieve efficient data storage, but
also the potential for sub-linear storage growth in a learning and recall

the EOS for uniform nuclear matter that two of the authors derived recently,
applying a variational method to realistic two- and there-body nuclear forces.
We utilize an extended liquid drop model of heavy nuclei and a
quantum-theoretical mass evaluation for light nuclei. In addition to realistic
nuclear forces, the inclusion of in-medium effects on the full ensemble of
nuclei makes the new EOS one of the most realistic EOS's for supernova
simulations. We make comparisons with the FYSS EOS, which is based on the same
formulation for the nuclear ensemble but adopts the relativistic mean field
(RMF) theory with the TM1 parameter set for uniform nuclear matter. The new EOS
is softer than the FYSS EOS around and above nuclear saturation densities. We
find that neutron-rich nuclei with small mass numbers are more abundant in the
new EOS than in the FYSS EOS because of the larger saturation densities and
smaller symmetry energy of nuclei in the former. We apply the two EOS's to 1D
supernova simulations and find that the new EOS gives lower electron fractions
and higher temperatures in the collapse phase owing to the smaller symmetry
energy. As a result, the inner core has smaller masses for the new EOS. It is
more compact, on the other hand, due to the softness of the new EOS and bounces
at higher densities. The ensuing outward propagations of the shock wave in the
outer core are very similar in the two simulations, which may be an artifact,
though, caused by the use of the same tabulated electron capture rates for
heavy nuclei ignoring differences in the nuclear composition between the two
EOS's in these computations.

black hole swallowing up noncanonical global defects. Even in the absence of

extremal black hole is only Nariai. For $\Lambda<0$ we only have black hole

3.5 keV line excess. The warmness of such 7 keV DM produced from the thermal
bath, in general, appears in tension with Ly-$\alpha$ forest data, although a
direct comparison is not straightforward. This is because the Ly-$\alpha$
forest constraints are usually reported on the mass of the conventional warm
dark matter (WDM), where large entropy production is implicitly assumed to
occur in the thermal bath after WDM particles decouple. The phase space
distribution of freeze-in axino DM varies depending on production processes and
axino DM may alleviate the tension with the tight Ly-$\alpha$ forest
constraints. By solving the Boltzmann equation, we first obtain the resultant
phase space distribution of axinos produced by 2-body decay, 3-body decay, and
2-to-2 scattering, respectively. The reduced collision term and resultant phase
space distribution are useful for studying other freeze-in scenarios as well.
We then calculate the resultant linear matter power spectra for such axino DM
and directly compare them with the linear matter power spectra for the
conventional WDM. In order to demonstrate realistic axino DM production, we
consider benchmark points with the Higgsino next-to-lightest supersymmetric
particle (NLSP) and wino NLSP. In the case of the Higgsino NLSP, the phase
space distribution of axinos is colder than that in the conventional WDM case,
so the most stringent Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraint can be evaded with mild
entropy production from saxion decay inherent in the supersymmetric DFSZ axion
model.

conditions of Landau-level crossing, caused by enhanced spin susceptibility in
combination with the tilting of the magnetic field, the transition between two
rivaling phases- paramagnetic and ferromagnetic- is traced in terms of optical
spectra reconstruction. Synchronous sharp transformations are observed both in
the photoluminescence structure and parameters of collective excitations upon
transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. Based on these
measurements, a phase diagram is constructed in terms of the 2D electron
density and tilt angle of the magnetic field. Apart from stable paramagnetic
and ferromagnetic phases, an instability region is found at intermediate
parameters with the Stoner transition occurring at $\nu\approx 2$. The spin
configuration in all cases is unambiguously determined by means of inelastic
light scattering by spin-sensitive collective excitations. One indicator of the
spin ordering is the intra-Landau-level spin exciton, which acquires a large
spectral weight in the ferromagnetic phases. The other - is an abrupt energy
shift of the intersubband charge density excitation due to change in the
many-particle energy contribution upon spin rearrangement. From our analysis of

XMM-Newton with a regular cadence of 6 months from 2001 to 2016 and
representing one of the longest available observational baseline ($\sim 15$~yr)
for a solar-like star with a well-studied chromospheric cycle (with a period of
$\sim 8$~yr). We investigate the modulation of coronal luminosity and
temperature and its relation with the chromospheric cycle. We interpret the
data in terms of a mixture of solar-like coronal regions, adopting a
methodology originally proposed to study the Sun as an X-ray star. Results. The
observations show a well-defined regular cyclic modulation of the X-ray
luminosity that reflects the activity level of HD 81809. The data covers
approximately two cycles of coronal activity; the modulation has an amplitude
of a factor of $\sim 5$ (excluding evident flares, as in the June 2002
observation) and a period of $7.3\pm 1.5$~yr, consistent with that of the
chromospheric cycle. We demonstrate that the corona of HD 81809 can be
interpreted as an extension of the solar case and it can be modeled with a
mixture of solar-like coronal regions along the whole cycle. The activity level
is mainly determined by a varying coverage of very bright active regions,
similar to cores of active regions observed in the Sun. Evidence of unresolved
significant flaring activity is present especially in proximity of cycle
maxima.

repulsive eigenvalues sensitively depend on the details of the regularization
scheme of the short- and long-range parts of the interactions. We demonstrate
that a direct comparison of numerical cutoff values of different interactions
is in general misleading due to the different analytic form of regulators; for
example, a cutoff value of $R=0.8$ fm for the semilocal interactions
corresponds to about $R=1.2$ fm for the local interactions. Our detailed
comparison of Weinberg eigenvalues provides various insights into
idiosyncrasies of chiral potentials for different orders and partial waves.

scheme when constructing new interactions.

flavor branes, to describe the heavy-light baryons as heavy mesons bound to a
flavor instanton. The background geometry of this model corresponds to an
excited state in the dual field theory with nonzero glue condensate
$\left\langle \mathrm{Tr}\mathcal{F}\wedge\mathcal{F}\right\rangle

proportional to the number density of the D0-brane charge. At strongly coupled
limit, this model shows that the heavy meson is always bound in the form of the
zero mode of the flavor instanton in the fundamental representation. We
systematically study the quantization for the effective Lagrangian of
heavy-light baryons by employing the soliton picture, and derive the mass
spectrum of heavy-light baryons in the situation with single- and double-heavy
baryon. We find the difference in the mass spectrum becomes smaller if the
density of D0-brane charge increases and the constraint of stable states of the
heavy-light baryons is $1<b<3$. It indicates that baryon can not stably exist
for sufficiently large density of D0 charge which is in agreement with the
conclusions in the previous study of this model.

novel space-time geometric representation. We describe the temporal evolution
of facial landmarks as parametrized trajectories on the Riemannian manifold of
positive semidefinite matrices of fixed-rank. Our representation has the
advantage to bring naturally a second desirable quantity when comparing shapes
-- the spatial covariance -- in addition to the conventional affine-shape
representation. We derive then geometric and computational tools for
rate-invariant analysis and adaptive re-sampling of trajectories, grounding on
the Riemannian geometry of the manifold. Specifically, our approach involves
three steps: 1) facial landmarks are first mapped into the Riemannian manifold
of positive semidefinite matrices of rank 2, to build time-parameterized
trajectories; 2) a temporal alignment is performed on the trajectories,
providing a geometry-aware (dis-)similarity measure between them; 3) finally,
pairwise proximity function SVM (ppfSVM) is used to classify them,
incorporating the latter (dis-)similarity measure into the kernel function. We
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on four publicly available
benchmarks (CK+, MMI, Oulu-CASIA, and AFEW). The results of the proposed
approach are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods when

influenced by another agent over an adaptive diffusion network. Agent i
influences agent j if they are connected (according to the network topology),
and if agent j uses the data from agent i to update its online statistic. The
solution of this inference task is challenging for two main reasons. First,
only the output of the diffusion learning algorithm is available to the
external observer that must perform the inference based on these indirect
measurements. Second, only output measurements from a fraction of the network
agents is available, with the total number of agents itself being also unknown.
The main focus of this article is ascertaining under these demanding conditions
whether consistent tomography is possible, namely, whether it is possible to
reconstruct the interaction profile of the observable portion of the network,
with negligible error as the network size increases. We establish a critical
achievability result, namely, that for symmetric combination policies and for
any given fraction of observable agents, the interacting and non-interacting
agent pairs split into two separate clusters as the network size increases.
This remarkable property then enables the application of clustering algorithms
to identify the interacting agents influencing the observations. We provide a
set of numerical experiments that verify the results for finite network sizes
and time horizons. The numerical experiments show that the results hold for

a complex frequency correction to the time-domain light curve, allowing for the
aperiodic modulation of the pulse amplitude to be robustly extracted in the
frequency domain. We discuss the statistical properties of the resulting
modulation spectrum and show how it can be correlated with the non-pulsed
emission to determine if the periodic and aperiodic variability are coupled
processes. Using this method, we study the 598.88 Hz coherent pulsations of the
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 as observed with the Rossi

confirms the known coupling between the pulsations and a strong 8 mHz QPO in
XMM-Newton observations. Applying our method to the RXTE observations, we
further show, for the first time, that the much weaker 20 mHz QPO and its

properties of the universal equation of state of the $\phi^4$ theory, which
describes the critical behavior of the Ising model and ubiquitous critical
points of the liquid-gas type. We focus on the relation between spinodal points
that limit the domain of metastability for temperatures below the critical
temperature, i.e., $T < T_{\rm c}$, and Lee-Yang edge singularities that
restrict the domain of analyticity around the point of zero magnetic field $H$
for $T > T_{\rm c}$. The extended analyticity conjecture (due to Fonseca and
Zamolodchikov) posits that, for $T < T_{\rm c}$, the Lee-Yang edge
singularities are the closest singularities to the real $H$ axis. This has
interesting implications, in particular, that the spinodal singularities must
lie off the real $H$ axis for $d < 4$, in contrast to the commonly known result
of the mean-field approximation. We find that the parametric representation of
the Ising equation of state obtained in the $\varepsilon = 4-d$ expansion, as
well as the equation of state of the ${\rm O}(N)$-symmetric $\phi^4$ theory at
large $N$, are both nontrivially consistent with the conjecture. We analyze the
reason for the difficulty of addressing this issue using the $\varepsilon$
expansion. It is related to the long-standing paradox associated with the fact
that the vicinity of the Lee-Yang edge singularity is described by Fisher's
$\phi^3$ theory, which remains nonperturbative even for $d\to 4$, where the
equation of state of the $\phi^4$ theory is expected to approach the mean-field
result. We resolve this paradox by deriving the Ginzburg criterion that
determines the size of the region around the Lee-Yang edge singularity where
mean-field theory no longer applies.

reflects this biphasic aspect of menstrual cycle and tends to be relatively low
during the follicular phase. In the present study, we proposed a state-space

in which the probability density distributions for the advancement of the
menstrual phase and that for BBT switch depend on a latent state variable. Our
model derives the predictive distribution of the day of the next menstruation

sequentially. It also enables us to obtain conditional probabilities of the
woman being in the early or late stages of the cycle, which can be used to
identify the duration of follicular and luteal phases, as well as to estimate
the day of ovulation. By applying the model to real BBT and menstruation data,
we show that the proposed model can properly capture the biphasic
characteristics of menstrual cycles, providing a good prediction of the
menstruation onset in a wide range of age groups. An application to a large
data set containing 25,622 cycles provided by 3,533 woman subjects further
highlighted the between-age differences in the population characteristics of

finite-width pixels in a square array. This paper examines the effects of such
pixellation, using computed simulations to illustrate the effects which most
concern the astronomer end-user. Coarse sampling increases the random noise
errors in wavelength by typically 10 - 20% at 2 pixels/FWHM, but with wide
variation depending on the functional form of the instrumental Line Spread
Function (LSF) and on the pixel phase. Line widths are even more strongly
affected at low sampling frequencies. However, the noise in fitted peak
amplitudes is minimally affected. Pixellation has a substantial but complex
effect on the ability to see a relative minimum between two closely-spaced
peaks (or relative maximum between two absorption lines). The consistent scale
of resolving power presented by Robertson (2013) is extended to cover
pixellated spectra. The systematic bias errors in wavelength introduced by
pixellation are examined. While they may be negligible for smooth well-sampled
symmetric LSFs, they are very sensitive to asymmetry and high spatial frequency
substructure. The Modulation Transfer Function for sampled data is shown to
give a useful indication of the extent of improperly sampled signal in an LSF.
The common maxim that 2 pixels/FWHM is the Nyquist limit is incorrect and most
LSFs will exhibit some aliasing at this sample frequency. While 2 pixels/FWHM
is often an acceptable minimum for moderate signal/noise work, it is preferable
to carry out simulations for any actual or proposed LSF to find the effects of
sampling frequency. Where end-users have a choice of sampling frequencies,
through on-chip binning and/or spectrograph configurations, the instrument user
manual should include an examination of their effects. (Abridged)

mechanism that suppresses the effect of the symmetron field at high densities

with gravitational strength at low density on the cosmological scale. We
elucidate the screening mechanism by showing that in the quasi-static Newtonian
limit there are precise analogies between symmetron gravity and electrostatics
for both strong and weak screening. For strong screening we find that large
dense bodies behave in a manner analogous to perfect conductors in
electrostatics. Based on this analogy we find that the symmetron field exhibits
a lightning rod effect wherein the field gradients are enhanced near the ends
of pointed or elongated objects. An ellipsoid placed in a uniform symmetron
gradient is shown to experience a torque. By symmetry there is no gravitational
torque in this case. Hence this effect unmasks the symmetron and might serve as
the basis for future laboratory experiments. The symmetron force between a
point mass and a large dense body includes a component corresponding to the
interaction of the point mass with its image in the larger body. None of these
effects have counterparts in the Newtonian limit of Einstein gravity. We

number of $G$ is the minimum size of a dominating set of $G$ and it is denoted

each vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ is adjacent to either one or two vertices in

$G_{m,n}$ where $m,n\geq 16$ in $O(\text{size of answer})$. In addition, we

distribution genuinely compatible with the given causal structure. Furthermore,
we show that for many causal structures, the (unrelaxed) causal compatibility

of injection, and analyse how the spatial inhomogeneities of the concentration

Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, whereby the underlying velocity field
is assumed to be shortly correlated in time, we explicitly identify scaling
regions for the statistics of the mass contained within a shell of radius $r$
and located at a distance $\rho$ away from the source. The two key parameters
are found to be (i) the ratio $s^2$ between the absolute and the relative
timescales of dispersion and (ii) the ratio $\Lambda$ between the size of the
cloud and its distance away from the source. When the injection is random, only
the former is relevant, as previously shown by Celani, Martins-Afonso $\&$
Mazzino, $J. Fluid. Mech$, 2007 in the case of an incompressible fluid. It is
argued that the space partition in terms of $s^2$ and $\Lambda$ is a robust
feature of the injection mechanism itself, which should remain relevant beyond
the Kraichnan model. This is for instance the case in a generalised version of
the model, where the absolute dispersion is prescribed to be ballistic rather
than diffusive.

Using our cosmological, chemodynamical simulations that include both detailed
chemical enrichment and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find
that stellar metallicity gradients in the most massive galaxies
($\sim3\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$) are made flatter by mergers and are unable to
regenerate due to the quenching of star formation by AGN feedback. The fitting
range is chosen on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis in order to mask satellite
galaxies. The evolutionary paths of the gradients can be summarised as follows;
i) creation of initial steep gradients by gas-rich assembly, ii) passive
evolution by star formation and/or stellar accretion at outskirts, iii) sudden
flattening by mergers. There is a significant scatter in gradients at a given
mass, which originates from the last path, and therefore from galaxy type. Some
variation remains at given galaxy mass and type because of the complexity of
merging events, and hence we find only a weak environmental dependence. Our
early-type galaxies (ETGs), defined from the star formation main sequence
rather than their morphology, are in excellent agreement with the observed
stellar metallicity gradients of ETGs in the SAURON and ATLAS3D surveys. We
find small positive [O/Fe] gradients of stars in our simulated galaxies,
although they are smaller with AGN feedback. Gas-phase metallicity and [O/Fe]
gradients also show variation, the origin of which is not as clear as for
stellar populations.

Using the PBE and HSE06 functionals, as well as the G$_0$W$_0$ method and the
Bethe-Salpeter equation, we systematically explored electronic and optical
properties of 2D CEY. In particular, we investigated the change of band-gap and
optical properties under uniaxial and biaxial strain. Ab-initio molecular
dynamics simulations confirm that CEY is stable at temperatures as high as 1500
K. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the thermal
conductivity of CEY was predicted to be anisotropic and three orders of
magnitude smaller than that of graphene. We found that in the visible range,
the optical conductivity under high strain levels is larger than that of
graphene. This enhancement in optical conductivity may allow CEY to be used in
photovoltaic cells. Moreover, CEY shows anisotropic optical responses for x-
and y- polarized light, which may be suitable as an optical linear polarizer.
The comprehensive insight provided by the present investigation should serve as
a guide for possible applications of CEY in nanodevices.

a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of these data here to study the

The H-alpha data show that the circumstellar disk of the Be-star is still
present. We measure equivalent widths similar to values found during more
active phases in the past, indicating that the low-luminosity state is not
simply triggered by a smaller Be disk. The NuSTAR data, taken at a 3-78 keV
luminosity of ~6.8e35 erg/s (for a distance of 7.1 kpc), are well described by
standard accreting pulsar models, such as an absorbed power-law with a
high-energy cutoff. We find that pulsations are still clearly visible at these
luminosities, indicating that accretion is continuing despite the very low mass
transfer rate. In phase-resolved spectroscopy we find a peculiar variation of
the photon index from ~1.5 to ~2.5 over only about 3% of the rotational period.
This variation is similar to that observed with XMM-Newton at much higher
luminosities. It may be connected to the accretion column passing through our
line of sight. With Swift/XRT we observe luminosities as low as 1e34 erg/s
during which the data quality did not allow us to search for pulsations, but
the spectrum is much softer and well described by either a blackbody or soft
power-law continuum. This softer spectrum might be due to the fact that
accretion has been stopped by the propeller effect and we only observe the
neutron star surface cooling.

edge-weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $\mathcal{D}\subseteq V\times V$ of $k$
demand pairs. The aim is to compute the cheapest network $N\subseteq G$ for
which there is an $s\to t$ path for each $(s,t)\in\mathcal{D}$. It is known
that this problem is notoriously hard as there is no
$k^{1/4-o(1)}$-approximation algorithm under Gap-ETH, even when parametrizing
the runtime by $k$ [Dinur & Manurangsi, ITCS 2018]. In light of this, we
systematically study several special cases of DSN and determine their
parameterized approximability for the parameter $k$.
  For the bi-DSN$_\text{Planar}$ problem, the aim is to compute a solution
$N\subseteq G$ whose cost is at most that of an optimum planar solution in a
bidirected graph $G$, i.e., for every edge $uv$ of $G$ the reverse edge $vu$
exists and has the same weight. This problem is a generalization of several
well-studied special cases. Our main result is that this problem admits a
parameterized approximation scheme (PAS) for $k$. We also prove that our result
is tight in the sense that (a) the runtime of our PAS cannot be significantly
improved, and (b) it is unlikely that a PAS exists for any generalization of
bi-DSN$_\text{Planar}$, unless FPT=W[1].
  One important special case of DSN is the Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph
(SCSS) problem, for which the solution network $N\subseteq G$ needs to strongly
connect a given set of $k$ terminals. It has been observed before that for SCSS
a parameterized $2$-approximation exists when parameterized by $k$ [Chitnis et
al., IPEC 2013]. We give a tight inapproximability result by showing that for
$k$ no parameterized $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm exists under
Gap-ETH. Additionally we show that when restricting the input of SCSS to
bidirected graphs, the problem remains NP-hard but becomes FPT for $k$.

by allowing, for instance, equalization among different information routes in
the network, as well as high-frequency transmission of complex time-dependent
signals constructed via several parallel routes. In addition, this kind of hubs
adaptively eliminate very noisy neurons from the dynamics of the network,
preventing masking of information transmission. The timescales for these
features are several seconds at most, as opposed to the imprint of information
by the synaptic plasticity, a process which exceeds minutes. Results open the

theoretical works and cited as evidence for a proton ""bubble"" in $^{34}$Si
causing an explicit weakening of the spin-orbit interaction. The results

More interestingly, the cell state reversibility is probably crucial in the
adaptation of population phenotypic heterogeneity to environmental fluctuations
by evolving bet-hedging strategy, which might confer to cancer cells resistance
to therapy. In this article, we propose a formalization of the evolution of
highly reversible states in the environments of periodic variability. Two
interrelated models of heterogeneous cell populations are proposed and their
behavior is studied. The first model captures selection dynamics of the cell
clones for the respective levels of phenotypic reversibility. The second model
focuses on the interplay between reversibility and drug resistance in the
particular case of cancer. Overall, our results show that the threshold
dependencies are emergent features of the investigated model with eventual
therapeutic relevance. Presented examples demonstrate importance of taking into
account cell to cell heterogeneity within a system of clones with different
reversibility quantified by appropriately chosen genetic and epigenetic entropy
measures.

reduce, by orders of magnitude, the number of simulated datasets that are
required to estimate the covariance matrix required for the analysis of
gaussian-distributed data. This is relevant when the covariance matrix cannot
be calculated directly. The compression is especially valuable when the
covariance matrix varies with the model parameters. In this case, it may be
prohibitively expensive to run enough simulations to estimate the full
covariance matrix throughout the parameter space. This compression may be
particularly valuable for the next-generation of weak lensing surveys, such as
proposed for Euclid and LSST, for which the number of summary data (such as
band power or shear correlation estimates) is very large, $\sim 10^4$, due to
the large number of tomographic redshift bins that the data will be divided
into. In the pessimistic case where the covariance matrix is estimated
separately for all points in an MCMC analysis, this may require an unfeasible
$10^9$ simulations. We show here that MOPED can reduce this number by a factor
of 1000, or a factor of $\sim 10^6$ if some regularity in the covariance matrix
is assumed, reducing the number of simulations required to a manageable $10^3$,
making an otherwise intractable analysis feasible.

especially in the light of the rapid development of quantum technologies.
Device-independent self-testing is one desirable approach, as it makes minimal
assumptions on the devices being tested. In this work, we address the question
of which states can be self-tested. This has been answered recently in the
bipartite case [Nat. Comm. 8, 15485 (2017)], while it is largely unexplored in
the multipartite case, with only a few scattered results, using a variety of
different methods: maximal violation of a Bell inequality, numerical SWAP
method, stabilizer self-testing etc. In this work, we investigate a simple, and
potentially unifying, approach: combining projections onto two-qubit spaces
(projecting parties or degrees of freedom) and then using maximal violation of
the tilted CHSH inequalities. This allows to obtain self-testing of Dicke
states and partially entangled GHZ states with two measurements per party, and
also to recover self-testing of graph states (previously known only through
stabilizer methods). Finally, we give the first self-test of a class
multipartite qudit states: we generalize the self-testing of partially
entangled GHZ states by adapting techniques from [Nat. Comm. 8, 15485 (2017)],
and show that all multipartite states which admit a Schmidt decomposition can
be self-tested with few measurements.

studied for discrete R&S problems, which sample the one-step Bayes-optimal
point. When used over continuous domains, previous work on the knowledge
gradient [Scott et al., 2011, Wu and Frazier, 2016, Wu et al., 2017] often rely
on a discretized finite approximation. However, the discretization introduces
error and scales poorly as the dimension of domain grows. In this paper, we
develop a fast discretization-free knowledge gradient method for Bayesian
optimization. Our method is not restricted to the fully sequential setting, but
useful in all settings where knowledge gradient can be used over continuous
domains. We show how our method can be generalized to handle (i) batch of
points suggestion (parallel knowledge gradient); (ii) the setting where
derivative information is available in the optimization process
(derivative-enabled knowledge gradient). In numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that the discretization-free knowledge gradient method finds global
optima significantly faster than previous Bayesian optimization algorithms on
both synthetic test functions and real-world applications, especially when
function evaluations are noisy; and derivative-enabled knowledge gradient can
further improve the performances, even outperforming the gradient-based
optimizer such as BFGS when derivative information is available.

standard model. In particular, discrete $A_4$ symmetry is used to realize
lepton flavor structures, and some scalars which are called flavon are
introduced to break this symmetry. In many models, flavons are assumed to be
much heavier than the electroweak scale. However, our previous work showed that
flavon mass around 100 GeV is allowed by experimental constraints in the $A_4$
symmetric model with residual $Z_3$ symmetry. In this paper, we discuss
collider search of such a light flavon $\varphi_T$. We find that an electron -
photon collision, as a considerable option at the international linear
collider, has advantages to search for the signals. At the electron - photon
collider flavons are produced as $e^-\gamma \to l^- \varphi_T$ and decay into
two charged leptons. Then we analyze signals of flavor-conserving final-state
$\tau^+ \tau^- e^-$, and flavor-violating final-states $\tau^+ \mu^- \mu^-$ and
$\mu^+ \tau^- \tau^-$ by carrying out numerical simulation. For the former
final-state, SM background can be strongly suppressed by imposing cuts on the
invariant masses of final-state leptons. For the later final-states, SM
background is extremely small, because in the SM there are no such
flavor-violating final-states. We then find that sufficient discovery
significance can be obtained, even if flavons are heavier than the lower limits

combining the latest BAO results with WMAP, Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT),

$2.4-3.1\sigma$ lower than the distance ladder, independent of Planck, and that
this downward pull was less apparent in some earlier analyses that used only
angle-averaged BAO scale constraints rather than full anisotropic information.
At the same time, the combination of BAO and CMB data also disfavors the lower
values of $H_0$ preferred by the Planck high-multipole temperature power
spectrum. Combining galaxy and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (Ly$\alpha$) BAO with a
precise estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance produces
$H_0=66.98\pm1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. This
value is completely independent of CMB anisotropy constraints and is
$3.0\sigma$ lower than the latest distance ladder constraint, although
$2.4\sigma$ tension also exists between the galaxy BAO and Ly$\alpha$ BAO.
These results show that it is not possible to explain the $H_0$ disagreement
solely with a systematic error specific to the Planck data. The fact that
tensions remain even after the removal of any single data set makes this
intriguing puzzle all the more challenging to resolve.

internal pressure. At the final stage the polymer escapes the capsid by
diffusion. For the driven part there is a cross-over from essentially
exponential growth of $t$ with $s$ of the fully flexible polymers to a
scale-invariant form. In addition, a clear dependence of $t$ on $N_0$ was
found. These findings combined give the dependence $t(s) \propto N_0^{0.55}

resulting clustering of galaxy or galaxy cluster tracers using an excursion set
approach; doing so accounts for the variation of both the underlying clustering
and the tracer bias. Based on the predicted variation of the clustering of
tracers, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the galaxy clustering amplitude

detect this signal with higher than $3\sigma$ significance if the asymmetry

which correspond to a $\pm4\%$ difference of the temperature fluctuation along

Additionally, we investigate a modulation of the power spectrum that exhibits
asymmetry only for large scales. This modulation is potentially detectable. For
Milky Way galaxy mass tracers, the scale-dependent modulation yields a larger
change in the large scale power spectrum than does a scale-independent
modulation, because the former does not alter the bias.

is a reliable automatic detection of possibly dangerous situations from video

detecting atypical trajectories. However, due to ethical considerations it is
better to develop such a system on data without people being threatened or even

$\beta_{\mathrm{M}} = 0.36^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. This result does not depend on
redshift or on the details of the halo shape measurement. The analysis is
repeated on observational data, obtaining a significantly higher value,
$\beta_{\mathrm{M}} = 0.56^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. There are also small but
significant deviations from our simple model in the simulation signals at both
the high- and low-mass end. We discuss possible reasons for these
discrepancies, and argue that they can be attributed to physical processes not
captured in the model or in the dark matter-only simulations.

elemental abundances, compared with theoretical predictions via nucleosynthesis

a solar-metallicity, 2.25-3.0 Msun initial-mass star. We derive the best-fit

distance and effective temperature of the central star) with the adopted
post-AGB evolutionary tracks. Our excitation energy diagram analysis indicate
high excitation temperatures in the photodissociation region (PDR) beyond the
ionized part of the nebula, suggesting extra heating by shock interactions
between the slow AGB wind and the fast PN wind. Through iterative fitting using
the Cloudy code with empirically-derived constraints, we find the best-fit
dusty photoionization model of the object that would inclusively reproduce all
of the adopted panchromatic observational data. The estimated total gas mass

fibers has seen increased attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose
a novel guidance system for intra-arterial procedures using a distributed
strain sensing device based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to
track the shape of a catheter. Tracking enhancement is provided by exposing a
fiber triplet to a focused ultraviolet beam, producing high scattering
properties. Contrary to typical quasi-distributed strain sensors, we propose a
truly distributed strain sensing approach, which allows to reconstruct a fiber
triplet in real-time. A 3D roadmap of the hepatic anatomy integrated with a 4D
MR imaging sequence allows to navigate the catheter within the
pre-interventional anatomy, and map the blood flow velocities in the arterial
tree. We employed Riemannian anisotropic heat kernels to map the sensed data to
the pre-interventional model. Experiments in synthetic phantoms and an in vivo
model are presented. Results show that the tracking accuracy is suitable for
interventional tracking applications, with a mean 3D shape reconstruction
errors of 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm. This study demonstrates the promising potential of
MR-compatible UV-exposed OFDR optical fibers for non-ionizing device guidance
in intra-arterial procedures.

marine food webs responsive to changes in structure and function. To measure
this food web property using data arising from routine fisheries surveys, a
simple metric known as Typical Length has been proposed as more suitable than
the Large Fish Indicator, which has been highly engineered to be responsive to
fishing pressure. Typical Length avoids the inherent dependence of the Large
Fish Indicator on a parameter that requires case-by-case adjustments. Using
IBTS survey time series for five spatial subdivisions of the Greater North Sea,
we show that the Typical Length can provide information equivalent to the Large
Fish Indicator when fishing is likely the strongest driver, but differences can
also arise. In this example, Typical Length exhibits smaller random
fluctuations (""noise"") than the Large Fish Indicator. Typical Length is also
more adaptable than the Large Fish Indicator and can be easily applied to
monitor pelagic fish in addition to demersal fish, and together with
information on the potential growth of the fish community, a proxy of which can
be derived from the Mean Maximum Length indicator, it is possible to partition
change in community composition from change in size structure. This suggests
that Typical Length is an improvement over the Large Fish Indicator as a food
web indicator with the potential to offer further insight when considered in
conjunction with indicators of community composition.

to graphene, proposals pivot around shape asymmetry induced by using
hetero-structures of nano-patterned or defected sections of pristine graphene.
Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) we show that it suffices to split a graphene
nano-ribbon into two unequal strained sections using external force which leads
to large asymmetry in the forward and reverse heat fluxes. We find that the
corresponding rectification ratio is enhanced by up to 60 %. Also, and more
importantly, the polarity is controllable on-the-fly, i.e. by changing the
position where force is applied. Based upon our results we propose a
thermo-electric device which obviates the complex nano-patterning and
lithography required to pattern graphene every time a new rectification value

exoplanetology survey program of close-in gas giants conducted with GMOS.
WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K and is favorable to study in
transmission due to a large scale height (370 km). We derive the transmission
spectrum of WASP-4b using 4 transits observed with the MOS technique. We
demonstrate repeatable results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a
combined transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise,
which is roughly equal to to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission
spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of wavelength. The
uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from molecular hydrogen suggest
that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds with condensate grain size of ~1 um.
This result is consistent with previous observations of hot Jupiters since
clouds have been seen in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to
WASP-4b. We describe a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS

correlated with the bolometric luminosity. (ii) Ranking from the higher
significance of the reliability to lower one the six estimators are the the
$5GHz$ luminosity+the $\gamma$-ray luminosity, the 1keV luminosity+the
$\gamma$-ray luminosity, $\gamma$-ray luminosity, the $5GHz$ luminosity+the
1keV luminosity, the $5GHz$ luminosity and the 1keV luminosity. (iii) We
suggest that the bolometric luminosity can be well estimated by the
$\gamma$-ray luminosity using the best linear equation that given in this paper
for Fermi FSRQs. (iv) According to the linear regressions obtained in the
analysis, we provide calibration for each estimator.

changing target zone, embedded in a static inhomogeneous medium. We introduce
an efficient method which predicts reflection responses at the earth's surface
for different target-zone scenarios, from a single reflection response at the
surface and a model of the changing target zone. The proposed process consists
of two main steps. In the first step, the response of the original target zone
is removed from the reflection response, using the Marchenko method. In the
second step, the modelled response of a new target zone is inserted between the
overburden and underburden responses. The method fully accounts for all orders
of multiple scattering and, in the elastodynamic case, for wave conversion. For
monitoring purposes, only the second step needs to be repeated for each
target-zone model. Since the target zone covers only a small part of the entire
medium, the proposed method is much more efficient than repeated modelling of
the entire reflection response.

galaxies are NGC6946 and M83. Those infrared spectrum were compared with that
of a model molecule (C23H12)2+ having hydrocarbon two pentagons combined with
five hexagons. Observed major infrared bands of 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3
micrometer were successfully reproduced as 6.4, 7.7, 8.5, and 11.2 micrometer.
Even observed weaker bands of 12.0, 12.7, 14.2 micrometer were predicted well
by computed bands as 12.0, 12.6, and 13.9 micrometer. IR intensity ratio was
compared to check theoretical validity. Calculated intensity ratio between 7.7
versus 11.3 micrometer (PAH7.7/11.3) was 4.0, whereas observed ratio was in a
range of 2~6, also calculated PAH6.2/11.3 was 1.4 for observed range of
0.9~2.6. Especially, every calculated ratio was so close to that of M83 arm
region. It should be noted that both calculated wavelength and intensity could
reproduce observed galaxy scale infrared spectrum. Hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon

types of non-volatile random access memories. Any practical implementation of
such a memory cell calls for a strong miniaturization, at which point
fluctuations start playing a role that cannot be neglected. A detailed
understanding of switching mechanisms and reliability is essential. For this
reason, we formulate a particle model based on the stochastic motion of oxygen
vacancies. It allows us to investigate fluctuations in the resistance states of
a switch with two active zones. The vacancies' dynamics is governed by a master
equation. Upon the application of a voltage pulse, the vacancies travel
collectively through the switch. By deriving a generalized Burgers equation we
can interpret this collective motion as nonlinear traveling waves, and
numerically verify this result. Further, we define binary logical states by
means of the underlying vacancy distributions, and establish a framework of
writing and reading such memory element with voltage pulses. Considerations
about the dis- criminability of these operations under fluctuations together
with the markedness of the resistive switching effect itself lead to the
conclusion, that an intermediate vacancy number is optimal for performance.

of massive stars. The exact nature of their progenitors is a matter of debate.
Here we present the analysis of the light curves of 34 SE SNe published by the
Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I), which are unparalleled in terms of
photometric accuracy and wavelength range. Light-curve parameters are estimated
through the fits of an analytical function and trends are searched for among
the resulting fit parameters. We found a tentative correlation between the peak
absolute $B$-band magnitude and $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, as well as a correlation
between the late-time linear slope and $\Delta m_{15}$. Making use of the full
set of optical and near-IR photometry, combined with robust host-galaxy
extinction corrections, bolometric light curves are constructed and compared to
both analytic and hydrodynamical models. From the hydrodynamical models we
obtained ejecta masses of $1.1-6.2$ $M_{\odot}$, $^{56}$Ni masses of
$0.03-0.35$ $M_{\odot}$, and explosion energies (excluding two SNe Ic-BL) of
$0.25-3.0\times10^{51}$ erg. Our analysis indicates that adopting $\kappa =
0.07$ cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$ as the mean opacity serves to be a suitable assumption
when comparing Arnett-model results to those obtained from hydrodynamical
calculations. We also find that adopting He I and O I line velocities to infer
the expansion velocity in He-rich and He-poor SNe, respectively, provides
ejecta masses relatively similar to those obtained by using the Fe II line
velocities. The inferred ejecta masses are compatible with intermediate mass
($M_{ZAMS} \leq 20$ $M_{\odot}$) progenitor stars in binary systems for the
majority of SE SNe. Furthermore, the majority of our SNe is affected by
significant mixing of $^{56}$Ni, particularly in the case of SNe Ic.

of stripped-envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe). To this end the Carnegie Supernova
Project (CSP-I) SE SNe photometry data release, consisting of nearly three
dozen objects, is used to identify a minimally reddened sub-sample for each
traditionally defined spectroscopic sub-types (i.e, SNe~IIb, SNe~Ib, SNe~Ic).
Inspection of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) colors and color evolution of
the minimally reddened sub-samples reveals a high degree of homogeneity,
particularly between 0d to +20d relative to B-band maximum. This motivated the
construction of intrinsic color-curve templates, which when compared to the
colors of reddened SE SNe, yields an entire suite of optical and NIR color
excess measurements. Comparison of optical/optical vs. optical/NIR color excess
measurements indicates the majority of the CSP-I SE SNe suffer relatively low
amounts of reddening and we find evidence for different R_(V)^(host) values
among different SE SN. Fitting the color excess measurements of the seven most
reddened objects with the Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law model provides
robust estimates of the host visual-extinction A_(V)^(host) and R_(V)^(host).
In the case of the SE SNe with relatively low amounts of reddening, a preferred
value of R_(V)^(host) is adopted for each sub-type, resulting in estimates of
A_(V)^(host) through Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law model fits to the
observed color excess measurements. Our analysis suggests SE SNe reside in
galaxies characterized by a range of dust properties. We also find evidence SNe
Ic are more likely to occur in regions characterized by larger R_(V)^(host)
values compared to SNe IIb/Ib and they also tend to suffer more extinction.
These findings are consistent with work in the literature suggesting SNe Ic
tend to occur in regions of on-going star formation.

multiply the capital of a venture capital firm by at least 47 times, without
requiring access to the Federal Reserve or other central bank apart from
settlement. This concept rests on obtaining default swap instruments on loans
in order to create the capital required, and expand Tier 1 and 2 base capital.
Profitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of equity
default swaps, cost of default swap, and the multiple of original capital (MOC)
adopted by the venture bank. A new derivative financial instrument, the equity
default swap (EDS), to cover loans made as venture investments. An EDS is
similar to a credit default swap (CDS) but with some unique features. The
features and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along
with audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry
exchanges with special features to ensure orderly operation of the market. It
is the creation of public markets for EDSs that makes possible the use of
public market pricing to indirectly provide a potential market capitalization
for the underlying venture-bank investment. Full coverage insulates the
venture-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite
dramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 20X are attainable.
Further, a new feature for EDS derivatives, a clawback lien, closes out the
equity default swap. Here it is optimized at 77%, and is to be paid back to the
underwriter at a future date to prevent perverse incentive to deliberately
fail. This new feature creates an Equity Default Clawback Swap (EDCS) which can
be used safely. This proposal also solves an old problem in banking, because it
matches the term of the loan with the term of the investment. I show that the
venture-bank investment and the EDCS underwriting business are profitable.

measurements of the intensity of light scattered off-axis by a Poisson cloud of
small particles. Starting from the wave equation, we analyze the microscopic
coherence of the scattered intensity and show that it is possible to determine
the laser beam from the speckle pattern captured by a group of CCD cameras. Two
groups of cameras are sufficient when the particles are either small or large
with respect to the wavelength. For general particle sizes the accuracy of the
laser localization with two groups of cameras is subject to knowing the
scattering properties of the cloud. However, three or more groups of cameras
allow accurate localization that is robust to uncertainty of the type, size,
shape and concentration of the particles in the cloud. We introduce a novel
laser beam localization algorithm and give some numerical illustrations in a
regime relevant to the application of imaging high energy lasers in a maritime
atmosphere.

surface waves (ESWs), guided by the planar interface of a homogeneous isotropic
temperature-sensitive material (namely, InSb) and a temperature-insensitive
structurally chiral material (SCM) was numerically investigated in the
terahertz frequency regime. As the temperature rises, InSb transforms from a
dissipative dielectric material to a dissipative plasmonic material.
Correspondingly, the ESWs transmute from Dyakonov-Tamm surface waves into
surface-plasmon-polariton waves. The effects of the temperature change are
clearly observed in the phase speeds, propagation distances, angular existence
domains, multiplicity, and spatial profiles of energy flow of the ESWs.
Remarkably large propagation distances can be achieved; in such instances the
energy of an ESW is confined almost entirely within the SCM. For certain
propagation directions, simultaneous excitation of two ESWs with (i) the same
phase speeds but different propagation distances or (ii) the same propagation
distances but different phase speeds are also indicated by our results.

results, which identify how much an individual possesses a certain trait.
Examples of traits could be a stress resistance, the readiness to take a risk,
the ability to concentrate on certain complicated work. The most common way of
studying psychological characteristics of each individual is testing.
Additionally, the overall estimation is usually based on personal experiences
and the subjective perception of a psychologist or a group of psychologists

addition, the intra- or inter-systems for the spread of information about
infectious diseases and the transmission of infectious diseases are often not
random, but with direction. Hence, in this paper, we build epidemic model based
on an interconnected directed network, which can be considered as the
generalization of undirected networks and bipartite networks. By using the
mean-field approach, we establish the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible model
on this network. We theoretically analyze the model, and obtain the basic
reproduction number, which is also the generalization of the critical number
corresponding to undirected or bipartite networks. And we prove the global
stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria via the basic reproduction
number as a forward bifurcation parameter. We also give a condition for
epidemic prevalence only on a single subnetwork. Furthermore, we carry out
numerical simulations, and find that the independence between each node's in-
and out-degrees greatly reduce the impact of the network's topological
structure on disease spread.

rearrangement both the electron and vibrational energy spectra of a dissipative
system. For instance, the optically coupled electron levels become split in the
conditions of the ac Stark effect that gives rise to appearance of the
nonadiabatic coupling between the electron and vibrational motions. The
nonadiabatic coupling exerts a substantial impact on the electron and phonon
dynamics and must be taken into account to determine the system wave functions.
In this paper, the vibronic coupling induced by the ac Stark effect is
considered. It is shown that the interaction between the electron states
dressed by an electromagnetic field and the forced vibrations of reservoir
oscillators under the action of rapid changing of the electron density with the
Rabi frequency is responsible for establishment of the photoinduced vibronic
coupling. However, if the resonance conditions for the optical phonon frequency
and the transition frequency of electrons in the dressed state basis are
satisfied, the vibronic coupling is due to the electron-phonon interaction.
Additionally, photoinduced vibronic coupling results in appearance of the
doubly dressed states which are formed by both the electron-photon and
electron-vibrational interactions.

both the Rabi oscillations and the Stark splitting of the electron density.
Changing of the electron density gives rise to nonadiabatic effects due to

this Letter, the mechanism of energy transfer between the electron system and
the phonon reservoir is presented. This mechanism is based on establishment of
the coupling between the electron states dressed by the electromagnetic field
and the forced vibrations of reservoir oscillators under the action of rapid
changing of the electron density with the Rabi frequency. The photoinduced
vibronic coupling results in appearance of the states that are doubly dressed
by interaction, first time due to the electron-photon interaction, and second
time due to the electron-vibrational interaction. Moreover, this coupling opens
the way to control energy which can be transferred to (heating) or removed from
(cooling) the phonon reservoir depending on the parameters of the
electromagnetic pulse.
