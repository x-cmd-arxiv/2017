that the entropy is non-decreasing for the class of unital physical processes.
However, in general, the entropy does not exhibit monotonic behavior. This has
restricted the use of entropy change in characterizing evolution processes.
Recently, a lower bound on the entropy change was provided in the work of
Buscemi, Das, and Wilde~[Phys.~Rev.~A~93(6),~062314~(2016)]. We explore the
limit that this bound places on the physical evolution of a quantum system and
discuss how these limits can be used as witnesses to characterize quantum

for memoryless quantum dynamics, and we argue that it provides a witness of
non-unitality. This limit on the rate of entropy change leads to definitions of
several witnesses for testing memory effects in quantum dynamics. Furthermore,
from the aforementioned lower bound on entropy change, we obtain a measure of
non-unitarity for unital evolutions.

models, particularly because of the difficulty of measuring polarization in
these bands. The CZT Imager (CZTI) onboard {\em AstroSat} is primarily an X-ray
spectroscopic instrument that also works as a wide angle GRB monitor due to the
transparency of its support structure above 100 keV. It also has experimentally
verified polarization measurement capability in the 100 $-$ 300 keV energy
range and thus provides a unique opportunity to attempt spectro-polarimetric
studies of GRBs. Here we present the polarization data for the brightest 11

show polarization signatures with $\gtrapprox$3$\sigma$, and 1 GRB shows

point and a high-frequency turnover. Both are due to the central component seen
in the VLBI images, and both are progressing downward in frequency with time.
The optically-thin spectral index of the central component is almost the same

an optically-thin shell and a partly-absorbed central component. The evolution
of the SED is consistent with that of a homologously expanding system. Both

component being due to interaction of the shock with the dense and
highly-structured circumstellar medium that resulted from a period of

various information retrieval tasks. However as shown by recent studies,
adapting the embedding models for the needs of IR tasks can bring considerable
further improvements. The embedding models in general define the term
relatedness by exploiting the terms' co-occurrences in short-window contexts.
An alternative (and well-studied) approach in IR for related terms to a query
is using local information i.e. a set of top-retrieved documents. In view of
these two methods of term relatedness, in this work, we report our study on
incorporating the local information of the query in the word embeddings. One
main challenge in this direction is that the dense vectors of word embeddings
and their estimation of term-to-term relatedness remain difficult to interpret
and hard to analyze. As an alternative, explicit word representations propose
vectors whose dimensions are easily interpretable, and recent methods show
competitive performance to the dense vectors. We introduce a neural-based
explicit representation, rooted in the conceptual ideas of the word2vec
Skip-Gram model. The method provides interpretable explicit vectors while
keeping the effectiveness of the Skip-Gram model. The evaluation of various
explicit representations on word association collections shows that the newly
proposed method out- performs the state-of-the-art explicit representations
when tasked with ranking highly similar terms. Based on the introduced ex-
plicit representation, we discuss our approaches on integrating local documents

class of multi-agent social dilemma includes the problems of ensuring
sustainable use of fresh water, common fisheries, grazing pastures, and
irrigation systems. Abstract models of common-pool resource appropriation based
on non-cooperative game theory predict that self-interested agents will
generally fail to find socially positive equilibria---a phenomenon called the
tragedy of the commons. However, in reality, human societies are sometimes able
to discover and implement stable cooperative solutions. Decades of behavioral
game theory research have sought to uncover aspects of human behavior that make
this possible. Most of that work was based on laboratory experiments where
participants only make a single choice: how much to appropriate. Recognizing
the importance of spatial and temporal resource dynamics, a recent trend has
been toward experiments in more complex real-time video game-like environments.
However, standard methods of non-cooperative game theory can no longer be used
to generate predictions for this case. Here we show that deep reinforcement
learning can be used instead. To that end, we study the emergent behavior of
groups of independently learning agents in a partially observed Markov game
modeling common-pool resource appropriation. Our experiments highlight the
importance of trial-and-error learning in common-pool resource appropriation
and shed light on the relationship between exclusion, sustainability, and
inequality.

onset of a `pseudogap' below a temperature $T^*$. Recent experiments suggest
that there may be a connection between the existence of the pseudogap and the
topology of the Fermi surface. Here, we address this issue by studying the
two-dimensional Hubbard model with two distinct numerical methods. We find that
the pseudogap only exists when the Fermi surface is hole-like and that, for a
broad range of parameters, its opening is concomitant with a Fermi surface
topology change from electron- to hole-like. We identify a common link between
these observations: the pole-like feature of the electronic self-energy
associated with the formation of the pseudogap is found to also control the
degree of particle-hole asymmetry, and hence the Fermi surface topology
transition. We interpret our results in the framework of an SU(2) gauge theory
of fluctuating antiferromagnetism. We show that a mean-field treatment of this
theory in a metallic state with U(1) topological order provides an explanation
of this pole-like feature, and a good description of our numerical results. We
discuss the relevance of our results to experiments on cuprates.

recent developments in the use of IT-mediated technologies, such as

similarities and differences, and the challenges regarding their effective use
in developing countries. We first examine each individually and highlight
different forms of each IT-mediated technology. Given that crowdsourcing and
sharing economy share aspects such as the use of IT, a reliance on crowds,
monetary exchange, and the use of reputation systems, we systematically compare
the similarities and differences of different types of crowdsourcing with the
sharing economy, thus addressing a gap in the current literature. Using this
knowledge, we examine the different challenges faced by developing countries
when using crowdsourcing and the sharing economy, and highlight the differences
in the applicability of these IT-mediated technologies when faced with specific

coupled to $U(N)$ Chern-Simons gauge theory at the level of the three-sphere
partition function, or equivalently entanglement entropy across a circle. The
duality relation between the sphere free energies of the large $N$ bosonic and
fermionic conformal theories is sensitive to certain shifts in the Chern-Simons
level already at order $N$. We first study a similar duality in a ${\cal N}=2$
supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theory, where it can be checked exactly
using localization. At large $N$, the free energies of supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric theories are related in a simple way, and we use this fact
to obtain an explicit solution for the scalar and fermion free energies which
obey the duality map and have the expected weak and strong coupling behaviors.
We also suggest that a worldline representation of the free energy allows to
relate its calculation to a sum of Wilson loops in pure Chern-Simons theory. In
the supersymmetric case, we find that this approach precisely reproduces the
localization prediction. In the non-supersymmetric case, we observe that a
result consistent with the boson/fermion duality can be obtained using a
certain framing prescription, which remains to be understood. We also briefly
discuss the case of massive theories, and compare the small mass expansion of
the free energy to previously known results for the correlation functions of
bilinear operators in flat space.

means of the computational homogenization of a representative volume element of
the microstructure using a crystal-plasticity finite element model. The
microstructure-based model was applied to predict the low cyclic fatigue
behavior of IN718 at 400$^\circ$C which exhibits a bilinear Coffin-Manson
relationship under the assumption that this behavior is triggered by a
transition from highly localized plasticity at low cyclic strain amplitudes to
more homogeneous deformation at high cyclic strain amplitudes. The model
predictions were in very good agreement with the experimental results for a
wide range of cyclic strain amplitudes and two strain ratios ($R_\epsilon$ = 0

micromechanical explanation for the influence of the strain ratio on the

languages, a fundamental family of context-free languages, comprised of
well-balanced strings of parentheses. In this problem we are given a string of
length $n$ in the alphabet of parentheses of $m$ types and must decide if it is
well-balanced. We consider this problem in the property testing setting, where
one would like to make the decision while querying as few characters of the
input as possible.
  Property testing of strings for Dyck language membership for $m=1$, with a
number of queries independent of the input size $n$, was provided in [Alon,
Krivelevich, Newman and Szegedy, SICOMP 2001]. Property testing of strings for
Dyck language membership for $m \ge 2$ was first investigated in [Parnas, Ron
and Rubinfeld, RSA 2003]. They showed an upper bound and a lower bound for
distinguishing strings belonging to the language from strings that are far (in
terms of the Hamming distance) from the language, which are respectively (up to
polylogarithmic factors) the $2/3$ power and the $1/11$ power of the input size
$n$.
  Here we improve the power of $n$ in both bounds. For the upper bound, we
introduce a recursion technique, that together with a refinement of the methods
in the original work provides a test for any power of $n$ larger than $2/5$.
For the lower bound, we introduce a new problem called Truestring Equivalence,
which is easily reducible to the $2$-type Dyck language property testing
problem. For this new problem, we show a lower bound of $n$ to the power of
$1/5$.

theory. Their natural analogues are self-similar nil Lie $p$-algebras. In
characteristic zero, similar examples of Lie algebras do not exist (Martinez
and Zelmanov). The second author recently constructed a 3-generated
self-similar nil finely graded Lie superalgebra, which showed that an extension
of Martinez-Zelmanov's result for Lie superalgebras of characteristic zero is
not valid.
  Now, we suggest a more handy example. We construct a 2-generated self-similar
Lie superalgebra $\mathbf{R}$ over arbitrary field. It has a clear monomial
basis, unlike many examples studied before, we find a clear monomial basis of
its associative hull $\mathbf{A}$, the latter has a quadratic growth. The
algebras $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ are $\mathbb{Z}^2$-graded by multidegree
in generators, positions of their $\mathbb{Z}^2$-components are bounded by
pairs of logarithmic curves on plane. The $\mathbb{Z}^2$-components of
$\mathbf{R}$ are at most one-dimensional, thus, the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-grading of
$\mathbf{R}$ is fine. As an analogue of periodicity, we establish that
homogeneous elements of the grading $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{R}_{\bar
0}\oplus\mathbf{R}_{\bar 1}$ are $\mathrm{ad}$-nilpotent. In case of
$\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras, a close analogue to being simple is being
just-infinite. We prove that $\mathbf{R}$ is just infinite, but not hereditary
just infinite. Our example is close to a smallest possible example, because
$\mathbf{R}$ has a linear growth with a growth function
$\gamma_\mathbf{R}(m)\approx 3m$, $m\to\infty$. Moreover, its degree
$\mathbb{N}$-gradation is of width 4 ($\mathrm{char} K\ne 2$). In case
$\mathrm{char}\, K=2$, we obtain a Lie algebra of width 2 that is not thin. Our
example also shows that an extension of the result of Martinez and Zelmanov for
Lie superalgebras of characteristic zero is not valid.

direction, and misalignment between the accretion disc and BH spin is expected
to be common. However, the physics of tilted discs (e.g., angular momentum
transport and jet formation) is poorly understood. Using our new
GPU-accelerated code H-AMR, we performed 3D general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted thick accretion discs around rapidly
spinning BHs, at the highest resolution to date. We explored the limit where
disc thermal pressure dominates magnetic pressure, and showed for the first
time that, for different magnetic field strengths on the BH, these flows launch
magnetized relativistic jets propagating along the rotation axis of the tilted
disc (rather than of the BH). If strong large-scale magnetic flux reaches the
BH, it bends the inner few gravitational radii of the disc and jets into
partial alignment with the BH spin. On longer time scales, the simulated
disc-jet system as a whole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession and approaches
alignment, demonstrating for the first time that jets can be used as probes of
disc precession. When the disc turbulence is well-resolved, our isolated discs
spread out, causing both the alignment and precession to slow down.

the reconstruction of operators behind causal horizons in time dependent
geometries obtained by acting with shockwaves on pure states or thermal states.
These geometries admit a natural basis of gauge invariant operators, namely
those geodesically dressed to the boundary along geodesics which emanate from
the bifurcate horizon at constant Rindler time. We outline a procedure for
obtaining operators behind the causal horizon but inside the entanglement wedge
by exploiting the equality between bulk and boundary time evolution, as well as
the freedom to consider the operators evolved by distinct Hamiltonians. This
requires we carefully keep track of how the operators are gravitationally
dressed and that we address issues regarding background dependence. We compare
this procedure to reconstruction using modular flow, and illustrate some formal
points in simple cases such as AdS$_2$ and AdS$_3$.

after a quench from a domain wall initial state in the XXZ spin chain, focusing
mainly on the region with anisotropy $|\Delta|< 1$. We establish exact Fredholm
determinant formulas for those, by exploiting a connection to the six vertex
model with domain wall boundary conditions. In imaginary time, we find the
expected scaling for a partition function of a statistical mechanical model of
area proportional to $\tau^2$, which reflects the fact that the model exhibits
the limit shape phenomenon. In real time, we observe that in the region
$|\Delta|<1$ the decay for large times $t$ is nowhere continuous as a function
of anisotropy: it is either gaussian at root of unity or exponential otherwise.
As an aside, we also determine that the front moves as $x_{\rm
f}(t)=t\sqrt{1-\Delta^2}$, by analytic continuation of known arctic curves in
the six vertex model. Exactly at $|\Delta|=1$, we find the return probability
decays as $e^{-\zeta(3/2) \sqrt{t/\pi}}t^{1/2}O(1)$. It is argued that this
result provides an upper bound on spin transport. In particular, it suggests
that transport should be diffusive at the isotropic point for this quench.

linear codes with dual distance $d$, the covering radius $R$ is at most
$\frac{n}{2}-(\frac{1}{2}-o(1))\sqrt{dn}$ and typically at least
$\frac{n}{2}-\Theta(\sqrt{dn\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$. The gap between those bounds
on $R -\frac{n}{2}$ is an $\Theta(\sqrt{\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$ factor related to
the gap between the worst covering radius given $d$ and the sphere-covering
bound. Our focus in this paper is on the case when $d = o(n)$, i.e., when the
code size is subexponential and the gap is $w(1)$. We show that up to a
constant, the gap can be eliminated by relaxing the covering requirement to
allow for missing $o(1)$ fraction of points. Namely, if the dual distance $d =
o(n)$, then for sufficiently large $d$, almost all points can be covered with
radius $R\leq\frac{n}{2}-\Theta(\sqrt{dn\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$. Compared to
random linear codes, our bound on $R-\frac{n}{2}$ is asymptotically tight up to
a factor less than $3$. We give applications to dual BCH codes. The proof
builds on the author's previous work on the weight distribution of cosets of
linear codes, which we simplify in this paper and extend from codes to
probability distributions on $\{0,1\}^n$, thus enabling the extension of the
above result to $(d-1)$-wise independent distributions.

mathematical model, a system of differential equations, for the slime's
adaption process (J. Theoretical Biology'07). It was shown that the process
convergences to the shortest path (J. Theoretical Biology'12) for all graphs.
We show that the dynamics actually converges for a much wider class of
problems, namely undirected linear programs with a non-negative cost vector.
  Combinatorial optimization researchers took the dynamics describing slime
behavior as an inspiration for an optimization method and showed that its
discretization can $\varepsilon$-approximately solve linear programs with
positive cost vector (ITCS'16). Their analysis requires a feasible starting
point, a step size depending linearly on $\varepsilon$, and a number of steps
with quartic dependence on $\mathrm{opt}/(\varepsilon\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is
the difference between the smallest cost of a non-optimal basic feasible
solution and the optimal cost ($\mathrm{opt}$).
  We give a refined analysis showing that the dynamics initialized with any
strongly dominating point converges to the set of optimal solutions. Moreover,
we strengthen the convergence rate bounds and prove that the step size is
independent of $\varepsilon$, and the number of steps depends logarithmically
on $1/\varepsilon$ and quadratically on $\mathrm{opt}/\Phi$.

combinatorics literature, but the hybrid notion of a noncrossing hypertree has
received less attention. In this article I investigate the poset of noncrossing
hypertrees as an induced subposet of the hypertree poset. Its dual is the face
poset of a simplicial complex, one that can be identified with a generalized
cluster complex of type $A$. The first main result is that this noncrossing
hypertree complex is homeomorphic to a piecewise spherical complex associated
with the noncrossing partition lattice and thus it has a natural metric. The
fact that the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice with its
bounding elements removed is homeomorphic to a generalized cluster complex was
not previously known or conjectured.
  The metric noncrossing hypertree complex is a union of unit spheres with a
number of remarkable properties: 1) the metric subspheres and simplices in each
dimension are both bijectively labeled by the set of noncrossing hypertrees
with a fixed number of hyperedges, 2) the number of spheres containing the
simplex labeled by the noncrossing tree $\tau$ is the same as the number
simplices in the sphere labeled by the noncrossing tree $\tau$, and 3) among
the maximal spherical subcomplexes one finds every normal fan of a metric
realization of the simple associahedron associated to the cluster algebra of
type $A$. In particular, the poset of noncrossing hypertrees and its metric
simplicial complex provide a new perspective on familiar combinatorial objects

solar flares often involve more than one magnetic fluxtube. Some of the
fluxtubes are closed, while others can contain open field. The relative
proportion of nonthermal electrons among those distinct loops is highly
important for understanding the energy release, particle acceleration, and
transport. The access of nonthermal electrons to the open field is further
important as the open field facilitates the solar energetic particle (SEP)
escape from the flaring site, and thus controls the SEP fluxes in the solar
system, both directly and as seed particles for further acceleration. The
large-scale fluxtubes are often filled with a tenuous plasma, which is
difficult to detect in either EUV or X-ray wavelengths; however, they can
dominate at low radio frequencies, where a modest component of nonthermal
electrons can render the source optically thick and, thus, bright enough to be
observed. Here we report detection of a large-scale `plume' at the impulsive
phase of an X-class solar flare, SOL2001-08-25T16:23, using multi-frequency
radio data from Owens Valley Solar Array. To quantify the flare spatial
structure, we employ 3D modeling utilizing force-free-field extrapolations from
the line-of-sight SOHO/MDI magnetograms with our modeling tool GX Simulator. We
found that a significant fraction of the nonthermal electrons accelerated at
the flare site low in the corona escapes to the plume, which contains both
closed and open field. We propose that the proportion between the closed and
open field at the plume is what determines the SEP population escaping into

transport in nanoscale and molecular electronic devices. In particular,
""extended reservoir"" simulations, where explicit reservoir degrees of freedom
are present, allow for the computation of both real-time and steady-state
properties but require relaxation of the extended reservoirs. The strength of
this relaxation, $\gamma$, influences the conductance, giving rise to a
""turnover"" behavior analogous to Kramers' turnover in chemical reaction rates.
We derive explicit, general expressions for the weak and strong relaxation
limits. For weak relaxation, the conductance increases linearly with $\gamma$
and every electronic state of the total explicit system contributes to the
electronic current according to its ""reduced"" weight in the two extended
reservoir regions. Essentially, this represents two conductors in series -- one
at each interface with the implicit reservoirs that provide the relaxation. For
strong relaxation, a ""dual"" expression -- one with the same functional form --
results, except now proportional to $1/\gamma$ and dependent on the system of
interest's electronic states, reflecting that the strong relaxation is
localizing electrons in the extended reservoirs. Higher order behavior (e.g.,
$\gamma^2$ or $1/\gamma^2$) can occur when there is a gap in the frequency
spectrum. Moreover, inhomogeneity in the frequency spacing can give rise to a
pseudo-plateau regime. These findings yield a physically motivated approach to
diagnosing numerical simulations and understanding the influence of relaxation,
and we examine their occurrence in both simple models and a realistic,
fluctuating graphene nanoribbon.

studies, which require good three-dimensional models of the stellar mass
distribution. Possible non-axisymmetric structures like a bar need to be taken
into account. Due to M31's high inclination, the bar is difficult to detect in
photometry alone. Therefore, detailed kinematic measurements are needed to
constrain the possible existence and position of a bar in M31. We obtained
$\approx$ 220 separate fields with the optical IFU spectrograph VIRUS-W,
covering the whole bulge region of M31 and parts of the disk. We derive stellar
line-of-sight velocity distributions from the stellar absorption lines, as well
as velocity distributions and line fluxes of the emission lines H$\beta$,
[OIII] and [NI]. Our data supersede any previous study in terms of spacial
coverage and spectral resolution. We find several features that are indicative
of a bar in the kinematics of the stars, we see intermediate plateaus in the
velocity and the velocity dispersion, and correlation between the higher moment
$h3$ and the velocity. The gas kinematics is highly irregular, but is
consistent with non-triaxial streaming motions caused by a bar. The morphology
of the gas shows a spiral pattern, with seemingly lower inclination than the
stellar disk. We also look at the ionization mechanisms of the gas, which
happens mostly through shocks and not through starbursts.

evolve from its initial state due to stellar escape is directly linked to
$\alpha(r)$. We find that the amount of mass segregation in M10, NGC 6218, and
NGC 6981 is consistent with their dynamical ages, but only the global MF of M10
is consistent with its degree of mass segregation as well. NGC 5466 and NGC

evaluate in terms of the expert's cost function and observe that the

high-cost trajectories, corresponding to tail-end events of catastrophic

This makes the reliability of GAIL-agents questionable when it comes to
deployment in risk-sensitive applications like robotic surgery and autonomous

minimizing tail risk within the GAIL framework. We quantify tail risk by the

relativistic motions of material in the strong gravitational fields close to

sense, and a statistically significant polarisation detection requires a fairly
long exposure, even for the brightest objects. Therefore, the sub-minute
timescales of interest are not accessible using a direct time-resolved analysis
of polarisation degree and angle. Phase-folding can be used for coherent
pulsations, but not for stochastic variability such as quasi-periodic
oscillations. Here, we introduce a Fourier method that enables statistically
robust detection of stochastic polarisation variability for arbitrarily short

Lense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow. This is contingent on

region. The strongest of the otherwise low-level residuals are overdensities
associated with a low-latitude structure as well as the so-called X-shape
previously identified using the split RC. These additional components
contribute only $\sim5\%$ and $\sim7\%$ respectively to the Bulge mass budget.
The best-fit Bulge is `boxy' with an axis ratio of [1:0.44:0.31] and is rotated
with respect to the Sun-Galactic Centre line by at least $20^{\circ}$. We
provide an estimate of the total, full sky, mass of the Bulge of

Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD). The most prominent benefit is that when the
true inverse covariance matrix is sparse, the graphical horseshoe provides
estimates with small information divergence from the true sampling

be almost unbiased under certain conditions. In addition to these theoretical
results, we also provide a full Gibbs sampler for implementing our estimator.

propagation we investigate methods for measuring tension propagation
quantitatively in computer simulations of driven polymer translocation. Here
the motion of flexible polymer chains through a narrow pore is simulated using
Langevin dynamics. We measure tension forces, bead velocities, bead distances,
and bond angles along the polymer at all stages of translocation with
unprecedented precision. Measurements are done at a standard temperature used
in simulations and at zero temperature to pin down the effect of fluctuations.
The measured quantities were found to give qualitatively similar
characteristics, but the bias dependence could be determined only using tension
force. We find that in the scaling relation $\tau \sim N^\beta f_d^\alpha$ for
translocation time $\tau$, the polymer length $N$, and the bias force $f_d$ the
increase of the exponent $\beta$ with bias is caused by center-of-mass
diffusion of the polymer toward the pore on the \textit{cis} side. We find that
this diffusion also causes the exponent $\alpha$ to deviate from the ideal
value $-1$. The bias dependence of $\beta$ was found to result from combination
of diffusion and pore friction and so be relevant for polymers that are too
short to be considered asymptotically long. The effect is relevant in
experiments all of which are made using polymers whose lengths are far below
the asymptotic limit. Thereby our results also corroborate the theoretical
prediction by Sakaue's theory [Polymers 8(12), 424 (2016)] that there should
not be bias dependence of $\beta$ for asymptotically long polymers. By
excluding fluctuations we also show that monomer crowding at the pore exit
cannot have a measurable effect on translocation dynamics under realistic
conditions.

new paradigms may be needed for these issues. At the very least, regulatory

the heat reservoirs and the bulk, giving a length-independent reduction of the

effect robust against disorder and nonlinearity. These results bridge two

reconfigured to minimize losses, balance loads, alleviate faults, or for

grid scheduling. While synchrophasor installations are limited in low-voltage
grids, utilities have an abundance of smart meter data at their disposal. In
this context, a statistical learning framework is put forth for verifying
single-phase grid structures using non-synchronized voltage data. The related
maximum likelihood task boils down to minimizing a non-convex function over a
non-convex set. The function involves the sample voltage covariance matrix and
the feasible set is relaxed to its convex hull. Asymptotically in the number of
data, the actual topology yields the global minimizer of the original and the
relaxed problems. Under a simplified data model, the function turns out to be
convex, thus offering optimality guarantees. Prior information on line statuses
is also incorporated via a maximum a-posteriori approach. The formulated tasks
are tackled using solvers having complementary strengths. Numerical tests using
real data on benchmark feeders demonstrate that reliable topology estimates can
be acquired even with a few smart meter data, while the non-convex schemes
exhibit superior line verification performance at the expense of additional

it, or by expanding into it, or both. CMEs whose front moves faster in the

are important contributors to space weather, by triggering substorms,
compressing the magnetosphere and accelerating particles. In general, near 1
AU, CMEs with speed greater than about 500 km s$^{-1}$ drive shocks, whereas
slower CMEs do not. However, CMEs as slow as 350 km s$^{-1}$ may sometimes,
although rarely, drive shocks. Here, we study these slow CMEs with shocks and
investigate the importance of CME expansion in contributing to their ability to
drive shocks and in enhancing shock strength. Our focus is on CMEs with average
speeds under 375 km s$^{-1}$. From Wind measurements from 1996 to 2016, we find
22 cases of such shock-driving slow CMEs, and, for about half of them (11 out
of the 22), the existence of the shock appears to be strongly related to CME
expansion. We also investigate the proportion of all CMEs with speeds under 500
km s$^{-1}$ with and without shocks in solar cycles 23 and 24, depending on
their speed. We find no systematic difference, as might have been expected on
the basis of the lower solar wind and Alfv\'en speeds reported for solar cycle
24 vs. 23. The slower expansion speed of CMEs in solar cycle 24 might be an
explanation for this lack of increased frequency of shocks, but further studies
are required.

states, including generalized Clausius relations and thermodynamic potentials.
But these general results carry their own limitations: fluctuation theorems
involve exponential averages that can depend sensitively on unobservably rare
trajectories; steady-state thermodynamics makes use of a dual dynamics that
lacks any direct physical interpretation. This review aims to present these
central results of contemporary nonequilibrium thermodynamics in such a way
that the power of each claim for making physical predictions can be clearly
assessed, using examples from current topics in soft matter and biophysics.

theories (Sections 2 and 3), and illustrate it in detail with the example of
bosonization: a boson-fermion duality in two-dimensional quantum field theory
(Sections 4 and 5).
  The schema develops proposals in De Haro (2016, 2016a): these proposals
include construals of notions related to duality, like representation, model,
symmetry and interpretation. The aim of the schema is to give a more precise
criterion for duality than has so far been considered.
  The bosonization example, or boson-fermion duality, has the feature of being
simple yet rich enough to illustrate the most relevant aspects of our schema,
which also apply to more sophisticated dualities. The richness of the example
consists, mainly, in its concern with two non-trivial quantum field theories:
including massive Thirring-sine-Gordon duality, and non-abelian bosonization.
  This prompts two comparisons with the recent literature on dualities:---
  (a) Unlike the standard cases of duality in quantum field theory and string
theory, where only specific simplifying limits of the theories are explicitly
known, the boson-fermion duality is known to hold exactly. This exactness can
be exhibited explicitly.
  (b) The bosonization example illustrates both the cases of isomorphic and
non-isomorphic models: which we believe the literature on dualities has not so
far discussed.

Our approach is a compromise between Tukey's exploratory (roughly speaking

as close in spirit to current practice of applied statisticians and data
scientists while allowing frequentist guarantees for results to be reported in
the scientific literature, or Bayesian results where the data scientist may
choose the statistical model (and hence the prior) after some initial
exploratory analysis. While this approach to data analysis does not cover every
scenario, and every possible algorithm data scientists may use, we see this as
a useful step in concrete providing tools (with frequentist statistical
guarantees) for current data scientists. The basis of inference we use is
selective inference [Lee et al., 2016, Fithian et al., 2014], in particular its
randomized form [Tian and Taylor, 2015a]. The randomized framework, besides
providing additional power and shorter confidence intervals, also provides
explicit forms for relevant reference distributions (up to normalization)
through the {\em selective sampler} of Tian et al. [2016]. The reference
distributions are constructed from a particular conditional distribution formed
from what we call a DAG-DAG -- a Data Analysis Generative DAG. As sampling
conditional distributions in DAGs is generally complex, the selective sampler
is crucial to any practical implementation of inferactive data analysis. Our
principal goal is in reviewing the recent developments in selective inference
as well as describing the general philosophy of selective inference.

A Bayesian test is proposed for separability of covariance functions which is
much more interpretable than parameters related to separability. Spatial models
have been increasingly applied in several areas, such as environmental science,
climate science and agriculture. These data are usually available in space,
time and possibly for several processes. In this context the modeling of
dependence is crucial for correct uncertainty quantification and reliable
predictions. In particular, for multivariate spatial data we need to specify a
valid cross-covariance function, which defines the dependence between the
components of a response vector for all locations in the spatial domain.
However, cross-covariance functions are not easily specified and the
computational burden is a limitation for model complexity. In this work, we
propose a nonseparable covariance function that is based on the convex
combination of separable covariance functions and on latent dimensions

valid and flexible. We simulate four different scenarios for different degrees

$L(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, with respect to a parameter vector
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$, when only noisy observations of $L(\boldsymbol{\theta})$
or its gradient are available (through the natural connection between
root-finding and minimization); SA algorithms can be thought of as stochastic
line search methods where the entire parameter vector is updated at each
iteration. The cyclic approach to SA is a variant of SA procedures where
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is divided into multiple subvectors that are updated one
at a time in a cyclic manner. This dissertation focuses on studying the
asymptotic properties of cyclic SA and of the generalized cyclic SA (GCSA)
algorithm, a variant of cyclic SA where the subvector to update may be selected
according to a random variable or according to a predetermined pattern, and
where the noisy update direction can be based on the updates of any SA
algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient, Kiefer--Wolfowitz, or simultaneous
perturbation SA). The convergence of GCSA, asymptotic normality of GCSA
(related to rate of convergence), and efficiency of GCSA relative to its
non-cyclic counterpart are investigated both analytically and numerically.
Specifically, conditions are obtained for the convergence with probability one
of the GCSA iterates and for the asymptotic normality of the normalized
iterates of a special case of GCSA. Further, an analytic expression is given
for the asymptotic relative efficiency (when efficiency is defined in terms of
mean squared error) between a special case of GCSA and its non-cyclic

tidal heating compared to a traditional Maxwell model for a warm (1400-1600 K)
Io-like satellite. Sundberg-Cooper can cause even larger dissipation around a
critical temperature and frequency. These models allow cooler planets to stay
tidally active in the face of orbital perturbations-a condition we term 'tidal
resilience.' This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active
worlds, and the long-term equilibria they fall into. For instance, if Io's
interior is better modeled by the Andrade or Sundberg-Cooper rheologies, the
number of possible resonance-forming scenarios that still produce a hot, modern
Io is expanded, and these scenarios do not require an early formation of the
Laplace resonance. The two primary empirical parameters that define the Andrade
anelasticity are examined in several phase spaces to provide guidance on how
their uncertainties impact tidal outcomes, as laboratory studies continue to
constrain their real values. We provide detailed reference tables on the fully

from a falling cube retroreflector in the vertical arm of an interferometer,
and light in a reference beam in the horizontal arm. Coordinates that are
nearly Minkowskian, attached to the falling cube, are used to describe the
propagation of light within the cube. Relativistic effects such as the
dependence of the coordinate speed of light on gravitational potential,
propagation of light along null geodesics, relativity of simultaneity, and
Lorentz contraction of the moving cube, are accounted for. The calculation is
carried to first order in the gradient of the acceleration of gravity. Analysis
of data from a falling cube gravimeter shows that the propagation time of light
within the cube itself causes a significant reduction in the value of the
acceleration of gravity obtained from measurements, compared to assuming
reflection occurs at the face. An expression for the correction to the
acceleration of gravity is derived and found to agree with experiment.
Depending on the instrument, the correction can be several microgals,
comparable to commonly applied corrections such as those due to polar motion
and earth tides. The controversial ""speed of light"" correction is discussed.

is analyzed through measurements of the net magnetic moment of bulk millimeter

mineralogically and texturally heterogeneous at submillimeter scales, with only
a fraction of the ferromagnetic grains carrying the remanent magnetization of
interest. Therefore, characterizing this magnetization in such cases requires a
technique capable of imaging magnetic fields at fine spatial scales and with
high sensitivity. To address this challenge, we developed a new instrument,
based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which enables direct imaging of
magnetic fields due to both remanent and induced magnetization, as well as
optical imaging, of room-temperature geological samples with spatial resolution
approaching the optical diffraction limit. We describe the operating principles
of this device, which we call the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), and report

uT.um/Hz^1/2), spatial resolution (5 um), and field of view (4 mm), as well as
trade-offs between these parameters. We also perform an absolute magnetic field
calibration for the device in different modes of operation, including
three-axis (vector) and single-axis (projective) magnetic field imaging.
Finally, we use the QDM to obtain magnetic images of several terrestrial and
meteoritic rock samples, demonstrating its ability to resolve spatially
distinct populations of ferromagnetic carriers.

the substrate. As the thickness of the deposited Bi film increases further, the
lattice parameter evolves to that of bulk Bi(0001). After annealing a multiple

additional BLs aggregate to form thicker islands of Bi. These results show that
a single Bi BL on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a particularly stable structure. After

however, its origin is not well understood. In this paper, we show that the
X-ray flux variations in some AGNs, and correspondingly the power spectral
densities (PSDs) of the variations, may be interpreted as being caused by
absorptions of eclipsing clouds or clumps in the broad line region (BLR) and
the dusty torus. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations for a number of
plausible cloud models, we systematically investigate the statistics of the
X-ray variations resulting from the cloud eclipsing and the PSDs of the
variations. For these models, we show that the number of eclipsing events can
be significant and the absorption column densities due to those eclipsing
clouds can be in the range from 10^{21} to 10^{24} cm^{-2}, leading to
significant X-ray variations. We find that the PSDs obtained from the mock
observations for the X-ray flux and the absorption column density resulting
from these models can be described by a broken double power law, similar to
those directly measured from observations of some AGNs. The shape of the PSDs
depend strongly on the kinematic structures and the intrinsic properties of the
clouds in AGNs. We demonstrate that the X-ray eclipsing model can naturally
lead to a strong correlation between the break frequencies (and correspondingly
the break timescales) of the PSDs and the masses of the massive black holes
(MBHs) in the model AGNs, which can be well consistent with the one obtained
from observations. Future studies of the PSDs of the AGN X-ray (and possibly
also the optical-UV) flux and column density variations may provide a powerful
tool to constrain the structure of the BLR and the torus and to estimate the
MBH masses in AGNs.

an enigma and proper characterizations on the superconducting- and normal-state
properties of the SC-II phase were hampered by the intrinsic inhomogeneity and
phase separation. To elucidate this intriguing problem, we performed a detailed
high-pressure magnetotransport study on the recently discovered
(Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe single crystals, which have high Tc~40 K and share similar
Fermi surface topology as AxFe2-ySe2, but are free from the sample
complications. We found that the ambient-pressure Tc~41 K is suppressed
gradually to below 2 K upon increasing pressure to Pc ~5 GPa, above which a
SC-II phase with higher Tc emerges and the Tc increases progressively to above
50 K up to 12.5 GPa. Interestingly, our high-precision resistivity data enable
us to uncover the sharp transition of the normal state from a Fermi liquid for
SC-I phase (0 < P < 5 GPa) to a non-Fermi-liquid for SC-II phase (P > 5GPa). In
addition, the reemergence of high-Tc SC-II phase is found to accompany with a
concurrent enhancement of electron carrier density. Since high-pressure
structural study based on the synchrotron X-ray diffraction rules out the
structural transition below 10 GPa, the observed SC-II phase with enhanced
carrier density should be ascribed to an electronic origin associated with a
pressure-induced Fermi surface reconstruction.

However, the fundamental limit of existing beamspace MIMO is that, the number

time-frequency resources. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper we
propose a new spectrum and energy efficient mmWave transmission scheme that
integrates the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with beamspace
MIMO, i.e., beamspace MIMO-NOMA. By using NOMA in beamspace MIMO systems, the
number of supported users can be larger than the number of RF chains at the
same time-frequency resources. Particularly, the achievable sum rate of the
proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA in a typical mmWave channel model is analyzed,
which shows an obvious performance gain compared with the existing beamspace
MIMO. Then, a precoding scheme based on the principle of zero-forcing (ZF) is
designed to reduce the inter-beam interferences in the beamspace MIMO-NOMA
system. Furthermore, to maximize the achievable sum rate, a dynamic power
allocation is proposed by solving the joint power optimization problem, which
not only includes the intra-beam power optimization, but also considers the
inter-beam power optimization. Finally, an iterative optimization algorithm
with low complexity is developed to realize the dynamic power allocation.
Simulation results show that the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA can achieve

two tagging approaches at particle-level with respect to discriminating
top-jets against gluons and quarks, using multivariate optimization scans. We
then introduce a basic fast detector simulation, including electromagnetic
calorimeter showering patterns determined from GEANT. We consider a number of
tricks for processing the fast detector output back to an approximate
particle-level picture. Re-optimizing the tagger parameters, we demonstrate
that the inevitable losses in discrimination power at very high energies can
typically be ameliorated. For example, percent-scale mistag rates might be
maintained even in extreme cases where an entire top decay would sit inside of
one hadronic calorimeter cell and tracking information is completely absent. We
then study three novel physics effects that will come up in the multi-TeV
energy regime: gluon radiation off of boosted top quarks, mistags originating
from g -> tt, and mistags originating from q -> (W/Z)q collinear electroweak
splittings with subsequent hadronic decays. The first effect, while nominally a
nuisance, can actually be harnessed to slightly improve discrimination against
gluons. The second effect can lead to effective O(1) enhancements of gluon
mistag rates for tight working points. And the third effect, while conceptually
interesting, we show to be of highly subleading importance at all energies.

information change. The problem is formulated as a bi-level mathematical model
where the upper level model (ULM) seeks for optimal division of energy storage
among Disco and customers, and the lower level models (LLMs) represent the
minimizations of the electricity purchase costs of DisCo and customers.
Further, in order to enhance the computation efficiency, we transform the
bi-level model into a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium
constraints (MPEC) model and linearize it. Finally, we validate the
effectiveness of the strategy and complement our analysis through case studies.

are numerically investigated in a two-dimensional channel. The nonequilibrium
driving comes from the rotating wheel, which can break thermodynamical

found that the direction of the transport along the potential is determined by
the asymmetry of the potential and the position of the wheel. The average
velocity is a peaked function of the angular speed (or the diffusion

increases. There exists an optimal angular speed (or diffusion coefficient) at
which the effective diffusion coefficient takes its maximal value. Remarkably,
the giant acceleration of diffusion is observed by suitably adjusting the

from large-sphere dominant to small-sphere dominant mixtures. For weakly
asymmetric particle sizes, packing properties evolve smoothly, but not
monotonically, with increasing small sphere composition, $f$. Our simulations
reveal that at high values of ratio $\alpha$ of large to small sphere radii,
($\alpha\geq \alpha_c \approx 5.75$) evolution of structural properties such as
packing density, fraction of jammed spheres and contact statistics with $f$
exhibit features that suggest a sharp transition, either through
discontinuities in structural measures or their derivatives. We argue that this
behavior is related to the singular, composition dependence of close-packing
fraction predicted in infinite aspect ratio mixtures $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$
by the Furnas model, but occurring for finite values range of $\alpha$ above a
critical value, $\alpha_c \approx 5.75$. The existence of a sharp transition
from small- to large-$f$ values for $\alpha\geq \alpha_c$ can be attributed to
the existence of a {\it sub-jamming transition} of small spheres in the
interstices of jammed large spheres along the line of compositions
$f_{sub}(\alpha)$. We argue that the critical value of finite size asymmetry
$\alpha_c \simeq 5.75$ is consistent with the geometric criterion for the
transmission of small sphere contacts between neighboring tetrahedrally close

predictions in several scenarios beyond the standard model (SM) and are
extensively searched for by LHC experiments. Challenges on the experimental
side require optimising the strategy based on accurate predictions. Firstly,
QCD corrections are known to be large both for the SM QCD background and for
the pure signal scalar production. Secondly, leading order and approximate
next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations indicate that the interference between
signal and background is large and drastically changes the lineshape of the
signal, from a simple peak to a peak-dip structure. Therefore, a robust
prediction of this interference at NLO accuracy in QCD is necessary to ensure
that higher-order corrections do not alter the lineshapes. We compute the exact
NLO corrections, assuming a point-like coupling between the scalar and the
gluons and consistently embedding the calculation in an effective field theory
within an automated framework, and present results for a representative set of
beyond the SM benchmarks. The results can be further matched to parton shower
simulation, providing more realistic predictions. We find that NLO corrections
are important and lead to a significant reduction of the uncertainties. We also
discuss how our computation can be used to improve the predictions for physics
scenarios where the gluon-scalar loop is resolved and the effective approach is
less applicable.

of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring, which refers to classifying
each ongoing case of a process according to a given set of possible categorical

canceled or withdrawn? Unfortunately, different authors have used different
datasets, experimental settings, evaluation measures and baselines to assess
their proposals, resulting in poor comparability and an unclear picture of the
relative merits and applicability of different methods. To address this gap,
this article presents a systematic review and taxonomy of outcome-oriented

knob to alter fundamental properties in unprecedented ways. In thermal
transport, porous nanomaterials can reduce thermal conductivity by not only
enhancing phonon scattering from the boundaries of the pores and therefore
decreasing the phonon mean free path, but also by reducing the phonon group
velocity. Here we establish a structure-property relationship by measuring the
porosity and thermal conductivity of individual electrolessly etched single
crystalline silicon nanowires using a novel electron beam heating technique.
Such porous silicon nanowires exhibit extremely low diffusive thermal
conductivity (as low as 0.33 Wm-1K-1 at 300K for 43% porosity), even lower than
that of amorphous silicon. The origin of such ultralow thermal conductivity is
understood as a reduction in the phonon group velocity, experimentally verified
by measuring the Young modulus, as well as the smallest structural size ever
reported in crystalline Silicon (less than 5nm). Molecular dynamics simulations
support the observation of a drastic reduction in thermal conductivity of
silicon nanowires as a function of porosity. Such porous materials provide an
intriguing platform to tune phonon transport, which can be useful in the design
of functional materials towards electronics and nano-electromechanical systems.

outperforms alternative schemes such as the matrix logarithm normalization when
combined with elementwise square-root and l2 normalization. This improves the
accuracy by 2-3% on a range of fine-grained recognition datasets leading to a
new state of the art. We also investigate how the accuracy of matrix function
computations effect network training and evaluation. In particular we compare
against a technique for estimating matrix square-root gradients via solving a
Lyapunov equation that is more numerically accurate than computing gradients
via a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We find that while SVD gradients are
numerically inaccurate the overall effect on the final accuracy is negligible

computing gradients that is faster and yet it offers improvements over the

Our goal is to minimize the competitive ratio between the time required to

constraint for theoretical models. Mean-field Babcock-Leighton dynamos that
consider non-instantaneous rising flux tubes have been shown to exhibit
long-term variability in their magnetic cycle. However a relation that
parameterizes the rise-time of non-axisymmetric magnetic flux tubes in terms of
stellar parameters is still missing. Aims: We aim to find a general
parameterization of the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes for solar-like stars.
Methods: By considering the influence of magnetic tension on the rise of
non-axisymmetric flux tubes, we predict the existence of a control parameter
referred as $\Gamma_{\alpha_1}^{\alpha_2}$. This parameter is a measure of the
balance between rotational effects and magnetic effects (buoyancy and tension)
acting on the magnetic flux tube. We carry out two series of numerical
experiments (one for axisymmetric rise and one for non-axisymmetric rise) and
demonstrate that $\Gamma_{\alpha_1}^{\alpha_2}$ indeed controls the rise-time
of magnetic flux tubes. Results: We find that the rise-time follows a power law
of $\Gamma_{\alpha_1}^{\alpha_2}$ with an exponent that depends on the
azimuthal wavenumber of the magnetic flux loop. Conclusions: Compressibility
does not impact the rise of magnetic flux tubes, while non-axisymmetry does. In
the case of non-axisymmetric rise, the tension force modifies the force balance
acting on the magnetic flux tube. We identified the three independent
parameters required to predict the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes, that is,
the stellar rotation rate, the magnetic flux density of the flux tube, and its
azimuthal wavenumber. We combined these into one single relation that is valid
for any solar-like star. We suggest using this generalized relation to
constrain the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes in Babcock-Leighton dynamo
models.

topic in computer vision and remote sensing fields. Most existing approaches
utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them
in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and
complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult
to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the
current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification
results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point
clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In
this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional
neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural
network (RNN) for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds.
In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize
and segment the points of the object class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual
RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye
window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point
clouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the

chemical evolution models of galaxies of different morphological types,
reproducing the main observed features of present day galaxies. We adopt the
most updated prescriptions for dust production from supernovae and asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars as well as for dust accretion and destruction
processes. Then, we study the cosmic dust rate in the framework of three
different cosmological scenarios for galaxy formation: i) a pure luminosity
scenario (PLE), ii) a number density evolution scenario (DE), as suggested by
the classical hierarchical clustering scenario and iii) an alternative
scenario, in which both spirals and ellipticals are allowed to evolve in number
on an observationally motivated basis. Our results give predictions about the
evolution of the dust content in different galaxies as well as the cosmic dust
rate as a function of redshift. Concerning the cosmic dust rate, the best
scenario is the alternative one, which predicts a peak at 2 < z < 3 and
reproduces the cosmic star formation rate. We compute the evolution of the
comoving dust density parameter {\Omega} dust and find agreement with data for
z < 0.5 in the framework of DE and alternative scenarios. Finally, the
evolution of the average cosmic metallicity is presented and it shows a quite
fast increase in each scenario, reaching the solar value at the present time,
although most of the heavy elements are incorporated into solid grains, and
therefore not observable in the gas phase.

with the usual behaviors present in the literature of BH entropy. Moreover, a
phase transition emerges with a positive specific heat $C$ at Planckian lengths
instead of the usual negative oneat non-Planckian scales, in agreement with

many computer vision applications, like video surveillance, Human Computer
Interaction and face analysis. The stunning amount of work done for detecting
faces on RGB images, together with the availability of huge face datasets,
allowed to setup very effective systems on that domain. However, due to
illumination issues, infrared or depth cameras may be required in real
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for head detection on
depth images that exploits the classification ability of deep learning
approaches. In addition to reduce the dependency on the external illumination,
depth images implicitly embed useful information to deal with the scale of the
target objects. Two public datasets have been exploited: the first one, called
Pandora, is used to train a deep binary classifier with face and non-face
images. The second one, collected by Cornell University, is used to perform a
cross-dataset test during daily activities in unconstrained environments.
Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes the performance of

averaging which takes full account of the class-specific model uncertainty by

decreases (i.e. when the wavelength approaches this characteristic size)
important quantities, such as phase and group velocity, deviate considerably
from their low frequency/long wavelength values. This well-known phenomenon is
called dispersion of waves. Objective of this work is to show that
strain-gradient elasticity can be used to quantitatively describe the behaviour
of a microstructured solid, and that the validity domain (in terms of frequency
and wavelength) of this model is sufficiently large to be useful in practical
applications. To this end, the parameters of the overall continuum are
identified for a periodic architectured material, and the results of a
transient problem are compared to those obtained from a finite element full
field computation on the real geometry. The quality of the overall description
using a strain-gradient elastic continuum is compared to the classical
homogenization procedure that uses Cauchy continuum. The extended model of
elasticity is shown to provide a good approximation of the real solution over a

$\mathrm{BV}^{\mathbb A}(\Omega)$-functions have an $L^1(\partial\Omega)$-trace
if and only if $\mathbb A$ is $\mathbb C$-elliptic (or, equivalently, if the

$L^1(\partial\Omega)$-trace was previously only known for the special cases
that $\mathbb A u$ coincides either with the full or the symmetric gradient of
the function $u$ (and hence covered the special cases $\mathrm{BV}$ or
$\mathrm{BD}$). As a main novelty, we do not use the fundamental theorem of
calculus to construct the trace operator (an approach which is only available
in the $\mathrm{BV}$- and $\mathrm{BD}$-setting) but rather compare projections
onto the nullspace as we approach the boundary. As a sample application, we
study the Dirichlet problem for quasiconvex variational functionals with linear
growth depending on $\mathbb A u$.

list $(s_1,t_1),\dots,(s_d,t_d)$ of requests form a directed graph that is a

show that if every pattern in $\mathcal{H}$ has the combinatorial property of
being ""transitively equivalent to a bounded-length caterpillar with a bounded

recursively enumerable $\mathcal{H}$ not having this property. This complete
dichotomy unifies and generalizes the known results showing that Directed
Steiner Tree is FPT [Dreyfus and Wagner, Networks 1971], $q$-Root Steiner Tree
is FPT for constant $q$ [Such\'y, WG 2016], Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph

of stationary, homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in incompressible flows in
three dimensions. Within the framework of the Non-Perturbative Renormalization
Group, we derive a closed renormalization flow equation for a generic $n$-point
correlation (and response) function for large wave-numbers with respect to the
inverse integral scale. The closure is obtained from a controlled expansion and
relies on extended symmetries of the Navier-Stokes field theory. It yields the
exact leading behavior of the flow equation at large wave-numbers $|\vec p_i|$,
and for arbitrary time differences $t_i$ in the stationary state. Furthermore,
we obtain the form of the general solution of the corresponding fixed point
equation, which yields the analytical form of the leading wave-number and time
dependence of $n$-point correlation functions, for large wave-numbers and both
for small $t_i$ and in the limit $t_i\to \infty$. At small $t_i$, the leading
contribution at large wave-number is logarithmically equivalent to $-\alpha
(\epsilon L)^{2/3}|\sum t_i \vec p_i|^2$, where $\alpha$ is a nonuniversal
constant, $L$ the integral scale and $\varepsilon$ the mean energy injection
rate. For the 2-point function, the $(t p)^2$ dependence is known to originate
from the sweeping effect. The derived formula embodies the generalization of
the effect of sweeping to $n-$point correlation functions. At large wave-number
and large $t_i$, we show that the $t_i^2$ dependence in the leading order

correlation functions in this regime was not derived before, even for the

has got increased attention among the researchers due to its various
complexities and challenges. Because of low resolution, blurring effect,
complex background, different fonts, color and variant alignment of text within
images and video frames, etc., text recognition in such scenario is difficult.
Most of the current approaches usually apply a binarization algorithm to
convert them into binary images and next OCR is applied to get the recognition
result. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on color channel
selection for text recognition from scene images and video frames. In the
approach, at first, a color channel is automatically selected and then selected
color channel is considered for text recognition. Our text recognition
framework is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which uses Pyramidal Histogram
of Oriented Gradient features extracted from selected color channel. From each
sliding window of a color channel our color-channel selection approach analyzes
the image properties from the sliding window and then a multi-label Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied to select the color channel that
will provide the best recognition results in the sliding window. This color
channel selection for each sliding window has been found to be more fruitful
than considering a single color channel for the whole word image. Five
different features have been analyzed for multi-label SVM based color channel
selection where wavelet transform based feature outperforms others. Our
framework has been tested on different publicly available scene/video text
image datasets. For Devanagari script, we collected our own data dataset. The
performances obtained from experimental results are encouraging and show the
advantage of the proposed method.

on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The obliquity of the
rotation axis of 67P causes strong seasonal variations. During perihelion the
southern hemisphere is four times more active than the north. Northern
territories are widely covered by granular material that indicates back fall
originating from the active south. Decimetre sized chunks contain water ice and
their trajectories are influenced by an anti-solar force instigated by
sublimation. OSIRIS observations suggest that up to 20 % of the particles
directly return to the nucleus surface taking several hours of travel time. The
back fall covered northern areas are active if illuminated but produce mainly
water vapour. The decimetre chunks from the nucleus surface are too small to
contain more volatile compounds such as CO 2 or CO. This causes a north-south
dichotomy of the composition measurements in the coma. Active particles are
trapped in the gravitational minimum of Hapi during northern winter. They are
""shock frozen"" and only reactivated when the comet approaches the sun after its
aphelion passage. The insolation of the big cavity is enhanced by self-heating,
i. e. reflection and IR radiation from the walls. This, together with the
pristinity of the active back fall, explains the early observed activity of the
Hapi region. Sobek may be a role model for the consolidated bottom of Hapi.
Mass transfer in the case of 67P strongly influences the evolution of the
nucleus and the interpretation of coma measurements.

state-of-the-art exact methods are based on prefix-filtering, the performance
of which depends on the data set having many rare tokens. Our method is robust
against the absence of such structure in the data. At 90% recall our algorithm
is often more than an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art exact
methods, depending on how well a data set lends itself to prefix filtering. Our
experiments on benchmark data sets also show that the method is several times

heavily influenced by the energy loss arising from the emission of radiation

the transition between the classical and quantum radiation reaction regimes. We
report on the observation of radiation reaction in the collision of an
ultra-relativistic electron beam generated by laser wakefield acceleration

an energy loss in the post-collision electron spectrum that is correlated with
the detected signal of hard photons ($\gamma$-rays), consistent with a quantum
(stochastic) description of radiation reaction. The generated $\gamma$-rays
have the highest energies yet reported from an all-optical inverse Compton

nanostructuring the contact area using electron beam lithography. By increasing
the edge contact length, the contact resistivity was improved by up to 70%

measurements is one of the main goals, to constrain the cosmological parameters

can more efficiently provide information on the parameters forecast, justifying
also the inclusion in the analysis of a future ground-based CMB experiment

energy modifies the conservation equations such that the fluid equations for

found powerful constraints on, for example, the coupling constant when
comparing it with present limits for two of the models, and their future

Most of the existing works in the literature of writer identification in

lines removal. In this paper we propose a novel writer identification framework
in musical documents without removing staff lines from documents. In our
approach, Hidden Markov Model has been used to model the writing style of the

from musical score lines and they are used to build writer specific HMM models.
Given a query musical sheet, writer specific confidence for each musical line

loglikelihood score in page level is computed by weighted combination of these
scores from the corresponding line images of the page. A novel Factor Analysis

on analyzing the spoken content, and the verbal behavior of the speakers. While
the success of public speaking largely depends on the content of the talk, and
the verbal behavior, non-verbal (visual) cues, such as gestures and physical
appearance also play a significant role. This paper investigates the importance
of visual cues by estimating their contribution towards predicting the
popularity of a public lecture. For this purpose, we constructed a large

TED talks, we leverage the corresponding (online) viewers' ratings from
YouTube. Visual cues related to facial and physical appearance, facial
expressions, and pose variations are extracted from the video frames using
convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Thereafter, an attention-based long
short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed to predict the video popularity
from the sequence of visual features. The proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy indicating that visual cues alone contain
highly predictive information about the popularity of a talk. Furthermore, our
network learns a human-like attention mechanism, which is particularly useful
for interpretability, i.e. how attention varies with time, and across different
visual cues by indicating their relative importance.

excitation energies where Kramers' assumption of a large barrier no longer

modelling strategy based on the assumption that any process can emerge by
transforming a parent Gaussian process with a specific correlation structure. A
novel mathematical representation of the parent-Gaussian scheme provides a
consistent and fully general description that supersedes previous specific

procedure for every spatiotemporal process. In particular, introducing a simple

transformation function, allowing to assess the correlation structure of the
parent-Gaussian process that yields the prescribed correlation of the target
process after marginal back transformation. The same framework is also
applicable for cyclostationary and multivariate modelling. The simulation of a
variety of hydroclimatic variables with very different correlation structures

starting point is that, for a probability measure $ Q $ on the open unit

quantile risk measure $ \varrho_Q $ as the map which integrates the quantile
function of a random variable in $ \mathcal{L}_Q $ with respect to $ Q $. The

proving high order continuous dependence of the strong solutions on the

in a linear (or cyclic) hash table of size $n$ and both start points are chosen
independently and uniformly at random. Each object must be placed into a table
cell within its intervals, but each cell can only hold one object. Experiments
suggested that this scheme outperforms the variant with blocks in which
intervals are aligned at multiples of $\ell$. In particular, the load threshold
is higher, i.e. the load $c$ that can be achieved with high probability. For
instance, Lehman and Panigrahy [LP09] empirically observed the threshold for
$\ell = 2$ to be around $96.5\%$ as compared to roughly $89.7\%$ using blocks.
They managed to pin down the asymptotics of the thresholds for large $\ell$,
but the precise values resisted rigorous analysis.
  We establish a method to determine these load thresholds for all $\ell \geq
2$, and, in fact, for general $k \geq 2$. For instance, for $k = \ell = 2$ we
get $\approx 96.4995\%$. The key tool we employ is an insightful and general
theorem due to Leconte, Lelarge, and Massouli\'e [LLM13], which adapts methods
from statistical physics to the world of hypergraph orientability. In effect,
the orientability thresholds for our graph families are determined by belief
propagation equations for certain graph limits. As a side note we provide
experimental evidence suggesting that placements can be constructed in linear
time with loads close to the threshold using an adapted version of an algorithm

graph nodes and the momenta on graph edges is proposed. A robust descent
algorithm for the action functional is derived, which in particular uses a
proximal splitting with an edgewise nonlinear projection on the convex subgraph

global coupling of probability densities on all graph nodes in the projection
step. For the time discrete action functional $\Gamma$--convergence to the time

$M^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $1\leq p\leq \infty$, by symplectic rotations. Precisely,
instead to measure the time-frequency content of a function by using
translations and modulations of a fixed window as building blocks, we use
translations and metaplectic operators corresponding to symplectic rotations.
Technically, this amounts to replace, in the computation of the
$M^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$-norm, the integral in the time-frequency plane with an
integral on $\mathbb{R}^n\times U(2n,\mathbb{R})$ with respect to a suitable
measure, $U(2n,\mathbb{R})$ being the group of symplectic rotations. More
conceptually, we are considering a sort of polar coordinates in the
time-frequency plane. In this new framework, the Gaussian invariance under
symplectic rotations yields to choose Gaussians as suitable window functions.
We also provide a similar characterization with the group $U(2n,\mathbb{R})$
being reduced to the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$.

disease. Detection of microaneurysms is crucial for the early diagnosis of
diabetic retinopathy and prevention of blindness. In this paper, a novel and
reliable method for automatic detection of microaneurysms in retinal images is
proposed. In the first stage of the proposed method, several preliminary
microaneurysm candidates are extracted using a gradient weighting technique and
an iterative thresholding approach. In the next stage, in addition to intensity
and shape descriptors, a new set of features based on local convergence index
filters is extracted for each candidate. Finally, the collective set of
features is fed to a hybrid sampling/boosting classifier to discriminate the
MAs from non-MAs candidates. The method is evaluated on images with different
resolutions and modalities (RGB and SLO) using five publicly available datasets
including the Retinopathy Online Challenge's dataset. The proposed method
achieves an average sensitivity score of 0.471 on the ROC dataset outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in an extensive comparison. The experimental
results on the other four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness

jet is expanding in time along the axis of the jet's propagation: we observe
the formation of a tail (~2.25""), which appears to extend backwards with an
apparent velocity ~-0.10c. The origin of this feature is discussed in the
framework of scenarios of energy dissipation. A single power-law adequately
describes the broadband spectra, supporting a synchrotron origin of the X-ray
emission. However, a spectral break at ~10^{15} Hz is necessary in coincidence
with a re-flare at 8.64 GHz in September 2002. This finding may be indicative
of emission from newly accelerated low-energy particles. The first detection of
the jet is in February 2001 (F_{8.64GHz}=0.25+/-0.09 mJy) in the flux rising
phase. A phase of stable emission is followed by a rapid decay
(t_{decay}=167+/-5 days). The decay at radio frequencies is significantly
shorter than in X-rays (t_{decay}=338+/-14 days). We detected a high fraction
(up to ~9%) of linearly polarized radiation at 4.8 GHz and 8.6 GHz. The
orientation of the electric vector is consistent with the picture of a
shock-compressed magnetic field, and there are hints of variations on
month-timescales, possibly connected with the evolution of the jet structure.

images where a semantic class label is assigned to each pixel via supervised
classification as a basis for automatic map generation. Recently, deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have
quickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the added
benefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a
major downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry,
thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to
obtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed
that they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up
the intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data,
and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced
maps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this
paper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a
substantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient
performance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors,
but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger
parts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semantic
segmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare its
performance when using different training data sets, ranging from manually
labeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic training
data derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations. We report our
results that indicate that satisfying performance can be obtained with
significantly less manual annotation effort, by exploiting noisy large-scale

observations of the graph nodes. When visited by the walk, each node of the
graph observes a signal of elevated mean, which we assume can be different
across different nodes. Outside of the path of the walk, and also in its
absence, nodes measure only noise. Assuming the Neyman-Pearson setting, our
goal then is to characterize detection performance by computing the error
exponent for the probability of a miss, under a constraint on the probability
of false alarm. Since exact computation of the error exponent is known to be
difficult, equivalent to computation of the Lyapunov exponent, we approximate
its value by finding a tractable lower bound. The bound reveals an interesting
detectability condition: the walk is detectable whenever the entropy of the
walk is smaller than one half of the expected signal-to-noise ratio. We derive
the bound by extending the notion of Markov types to Gauss-Markov types. These
are sequences of state-observation pairs with a given number of node-to-node
transition counts and the same average signal values across nodes, computed
from the measurements made during the times the random walk was visiting each
node's respective location. The lower bound has an intuitive interpretation:
among all Gauss-Markov types that are asymptotically feasible in the absence of
the walk, the bound finds the most typical one under the presence of the walk.
Finally, we show by a sequence of judicious problem reformulations that
computing the bound reduces to solving a convex optimization problem, which is
a result in its own right.

By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for

to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare
and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific
application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for

corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of
the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and

providing a robust baseline of the astrophysical background for dark matter
search via antimatter. However, models of CR propagation are affected by other
important sources of uncertainties, notably from solar modulation and nuclear
fragmentation, that cannot be improved with the sole use of the AMS data. The
present work is aimed at assessing these uncertainties and their relevance in
the interpretation of the new AMS data on the boron-to-carbon (B/C) ratio.
Uncertainties from solar modulation are estimated using improved models of CR

monthly-resolved CR data collected by balloon-born or space missions,
interstellar flux data from the Voyager-1 spacecraft, and counting rates from
ground-based neutron monitor detectors. Uncertainties from nuclear

guarantee the desired level of precision, in comparison with the improved
accuracy of the recent data on the B/C ratio. On the other hand, nuclear
uncertainties represent a serious limiting factor over a wide energy range. We
therefore stress the need for establishing a dedicated program of cross-section

focusing is addressed by analytical calculation of Coulomb momentum transfer to

recollisions is also investigated and they are shown to be responsible for a
decrease of the bend of the cusp at very low energies in this regime. In
general, the momentum transfer caused by high-order rescattering events, while

science outside our Solar System and possibly habitability. First, we derive
from N-body simulations possible planetary evolution scenarios, and show that
each of the planets are likely to be in synchronous rotation. We then use a 3-D
Global Climate Model to explore the possible climates of cool planets of the
TRAPPIST-1 system. In particular, we look at the conditions required for cool
planets to prevent possible volatile species to be lost by permanent
condensation, irreversible burying or photochemical destruction. We also
explore the resilience of the same volatiles (when in condensed phase) to a
runaway greenhouse process. We find that background atmospheres made of N2, CO
or O2 are resistant to atmospheric collapse. However, it should be difficult
for TRAPPIST-1 planets to accumulate significant greenhouse gases like CO2,
CH4, or NH3. CO2 can easily condense on the nightside, forming glaciers that
would flow toward the substellar region. A complete CO2 ice cover is possible
on TRAPPIST-1g and h only, although CO2 ice deposits could be gravitationally
unstable and get buried beneath the water ice shell in geologically short
timescales. Given TRAPPIST-1 planets large EUV irradiation (at least 1000x
Titan's flux), CH4 and NH3 should be photodissociated rapidly and thus be hard
to accumulate in the atmosphere. Photochemical hazes could then sedimentate and
form a surface layer of tholins. Regarding habitability, we confirm that few
bars of CO2 would suffice to warm the surface of TRAPPIST-1f and g above the
melting point of water. We also show that TRAPPIST-1e is a remarkable candidate
for surface habitability. If the planet is today synchronous and abundant in
water, then it should always sustain surface liquid water at least in the
substellar region, whatever the atmosphere considered.

different sentiments may feature the same score (and vice-versa); and 2)
detecting and analyzing the mismatches between the review content and the
actual score may benefit both service providers and consumers, by highlighting
specific factors of satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) in texts.
  To prove the intuitions, we adopt sentiment analysis techniques and we
concentrate on hotel reviews, to find polarity mismatches therein. In
particular, we first train a text classifier with a set of annotated hotel
reviews, taken from the Booking website. Then, we analyze a large dataset, with
around 160k hotel reviews collected from Tripadvisor, with the aim of detecting
a polarity mismatch, indicating if the textual content of the review is in
line, or not, with the associated score.
  Using well established artificial intelligence techniques and analyzing in
depth the reviews featuring a mismatch between the text polarity and the score,
we find that -on a scale of five stars- those reviews ranked with middle scores
include a mixture of positive and negative aspects.
  The approach proposed here, beside acting as a polarity detector, provides an
effective selection of reviews -on an initial very large dataset- that may
allow both consumers and providers to focus directly on the review subset
featuring a text/score disagreement, which conveniently convey to the user a
summary of positive and negative features of the review target.

technology, such as an autocompletion user interface (AUI), to help workers
input text responses. But support for the efficacy of AUIs is mixed. Here we
designed and conducted a randomized experiment where workers were asked to
provide short text responses to given questions. Our experimental goal was to
determine if an AUI helps workers respond more quickly and with improved
consistency by mitigating typos and misspellings. Surprisingly, we found that
neither occurred: workers assigned to the AUI treatment were slower than those
assigned to the non-AUI control and their responses were more diverse, not
less, than those of the control. Both the lexical and semantic diversities of
responses were higher, with the latter measured using word2vec. A crowdsourcer
interested in worker speed may want to avoid using an AUI, but using an AUI to
boost response diversity may be valuable to crowdsourcers interested in

communication (VLC) systems with spatially distributed passive eavesdroppers

legitimate receiver (UE). Based on certain amplitude constraints, we propose an
optimal beamforming scheme to optimize secrecy performance. Contrary to the
case where null-steering is made possible by using knowledge of the ED
locations, we show that the optimal solution when only statistical information
about ED locations is available directs the transmission along a particular
eigenmode related to the intensity of the ED process and the intended channel.
Then, a sub-optimal LED selection scheme is provided to reduce the secrecy
outage probability (SOP). An approximate closed-form for the SOP is derived by
using secrecy capacity bounds. All analysis is numerically verified by Monte
Carlo simulations. The analysis shows that the optimal beamformer yields
superior performance to LED selection. However, LED selection is still a highly
efficient suboptimal scheme due to the complexity associated with the use of
multiple transmitters in the full beamforming approach. These performance
trends and exact relations between system parameters can be used to develop a

communication systems with periodically varying dispersion profile (dispersion
management). The associated constrained variational principle is shown to
posses a ground state solution by constructing a convergent minimizing sequence
through the application of a method similar to the classical concentration
compactness principle of Lions. One of the obstacles in applying this
variational approach is that a saturated nonlocal nonlinearity does not satisfy
uniformly the so-called strict sub-additivity condition. This is overcome by
applying a special version of Ekeland's variational principle.

experimentally by means of an analog version of a universal model, and

visits allocated across the six passbands with 30s exposure visits.

science opportunities and open a new era of precision cosmology with
unprecedented statistical power and tight control of systematic errors. In this
review, we give a brief account of the LSST cosmology program with an emphasis
on dark energy investigations. The LSST will address dark energy physics and
cosmology in general by exploiting diverse precision probes including
large-scale structure, weak lensing, type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, and
strong lensing. Combined with the cosmic microwave background data, these
probes form interlocking tests on the cosmological model and the nature of dark

use either fingerprints that require labor-intensive radio-map survey and

Wi-Fi transceivers. In this work, we explore the Fresnel Zone Theory in physics
and propose a generic Fresnel Penetration Model (FPM), which reveals the linear
relationship between specific Fresnel zones and multicarrier Fresnel phase
difference, along with the Fresnel phase offset caused by static multipath
environments. We validate FPM in both outdoor and complex indoor environments.
Furthermore, we design a multicarrier FPM based device-free localization system
(MFDL), which overcomes a number of practical challenges, particularly the
Fresnel phase difference estimation and phase offset calibration in
multipath-rich indoor environments. Extensive experimental results show that
compared with the state-of-the-art work (LiFS), our MFDL system achieves better
localization accuracy with much fewer number of Wi-Fi transceivers.
Specifically, using only three transceivers, the median localization error of
MFDL is as low as 45$cm$ in an outdoor environment of 36$m^2$, and 55$cm$ in
indoor settings of 25$m^2$. Increasing the number of transceivers to four
allows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error in a 72$m^2$ indoor area,

large-scale and complicated system, and there exists a key requirement that a
user and a bike should be matched sufficiently in time. Such matched behavior
makes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This
paper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two
important views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related
to geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival
processes (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of
bike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates
that the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in
practice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a
multiclass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example,
bikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as
virtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station
nodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road
nodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we
provide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike
sharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a
nonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the
product-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths
at the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state
probability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting
performance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology
and results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike
sharing systems through multiclass closed queueing networks.

first scientists to suggest an intimate connection between cosmology and atomic
physics. Though a revolutionary proposal for its time, Dirac's Large Number
Hypothesis (1937) adopted a standard assumption of the day, namely, the
non-existence of the cosmological constant term ($\Lambda = 0$). As a result,
its implementation necessitated extreme violence to the theory of general
relativity -- something few physicists were prepared to sacrifice in favour of
`numerology' -- requiring a time-dependent gravitational coupling of the form
$G(t) \sim 1/t$. Zel'dovich's insight (1968) was to realise that a small but
nonzero cosmological term ($\Lambda > 0$) allowed the present day radius of the
Universe to be identified with the de Sitter radius, $r_{\rm U} \simeq l_{\rm
dS} \simeq 1/{\sqrt{\Lambda}}$, which removed the need for time-dependence in
the fundamental couplings. Thus, he obtained the formula $\Lambda \simeq
m^6G^2/\hbar^4$, where $m$ is a mass scale characterising the relative
strengths of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which he
identified with the proton mass $m_{\rm p}$. In this paper, we review a number
of recent arguments which, instead, suggest the identification $m = m_{\rm
e}/\alpha_{\rm e}$, where $m_{\rm e}$ is the electron mass and $\alpha_{\rm e}
= e^2/\hbar c \simeq 1/137$ is the usual fine structure constant. We note that
these are of a {\it physical} nature and, therefore, represent an attempt to
lift previous arguments \emph{{\` a} la} Dirac from the realm of numerology
into the realm of empirical science. If valid, such arguments suggest an
intimate connection, not only between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds,
but, perhaps even more surprisingly, between the very essence of ""dark"" and
""light"" physics.

galaxy merger NGC 6240, hosting a close pair of highly obscured active galactic
nuclei (AGN). Over a period of about two years, the source exhibits hard X-ray
variability of the order of 20 per cent, peaking around 20 keV. When the two
AGN are resolved with Chandra, column densities in the range $N_\textrm{H} \sim
1-2 \times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ are estimated for both of them. The exact values
are hard to determine, as they appear to depend on aspects that are sometimes
overlooked in Compton-thick objects, such as the covering factor of the
absorber, iron abundance, and the contamination in the Fe-K band from
foreground hot-gas emission. Nearly spherical covering and slightly subsolar
iron abundance are preferred in this case. While the southern nucleus is
suggested to be intrinsically more powerful, as also implied by the mid-IR and
2-10 keV brightness ratios, solutions involving a similar X-ray luminosity of
the two AGN cannot be ruled out. The observed variability is rather limited
compared to the one revealed by the Swift/BAT light curve, and it can be fully
explained by changes in the continuum flux from the two AGN, without requiring
significant column density variations. NGC 6240 is hereby confirmed to
represent a unique opportunity to investigate the X-ray (and broad-band)
properties of massive galaxy mergers, which were much more frequent in the
early Universe.

  Prior","To be published in the 2017 Computational Diffusion MRI Workshop of

diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI), remain underutilized compared to diffusion tensor imaging because the
scan times needed to produce accurate estimations of fiber orientation are
significantly longer. To accelerate DSI and HARDI, recent methods from
compressed sensing (CS) exploit a sparse underlying representation of the data
in the spatial and angular domains to undersample in the respective k- and
q-spaces. State-of-the-art frameworks, however, impose sparsity in the spatial
and angular domains separately and involve the sum of the corresponding sparse
regularizers. In contrast, we propose a unified (k,q)-CS formulation which
imposes sparsity jointly in the spatial-angular domain to further increase
sparsity of dMRI signals and reduce the required subsampling rate. To
efficiently solve this large-scale global reconstruction problem, we introduce
a novel adaptation of the FISTA algorithm that exploits dictionary
separability. We show on phantom and real HARDI data that our approach achieves
significantly more accurate signal reconstructions than the state of the art
while sampling only 2-4% of the (k,q)-space, allowing for the potential of new
levels of dMRI acceleration.

extraction of the minority carrier diffusion length and surface recombination

fixed-fixed beam subjected to an applied voltage and the switch
capacitance-voltage characteristics without using parallel-plate assumption.
For model validation, the model solutions are compared with ANSYS finite
element results and experimental data. It is found that the model works
especially well in residual stress dominant and stretching dominant cases. The
model shows that the nonlinear stretching can significantly increase the
pull-in voltage and extend the beam maximum travel range. Based on the model, a
graphene nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator is simulated and the
agreement with the experimental data is excellent. The proposed coupled
hyperbolic model demonstrates its capacity to guide the design and optimization
