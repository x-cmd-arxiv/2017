prove that a division of the irreversible work can be made into a coherent and
incoherent part, which provides an operational criterion for quantifying the
coherent contribution in a generic non-equilibrium transformation on a closed
quantum system. We then study such a contribution in two physical models of a
driven qubit and kicked rotor. In addition, we also show that coherence
generation is connected to the non-adiabaticity of a processes, for which it
gives the dominant contribution for slow-enough transformation. The amount of
generated coherence in the energy eigenbasis is equivalent to the change in
diagonal entropy, and here we show that it fulfills a fluctuation theorem.

are increasingly available in material sciences and medical imaging
applications. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such multivariate data
provide novel and unique information, but at the cost of requiring a more
complex statistical analysis. In this work we derive the distributions of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the special but important case of $m \times m$
symmetric random matrices, $D$, observed with isotropic matrix-variate Gaussian
noise. The properties of these distributions depend strongly on the symmetries
of the mean tensor/matrix, $\bar D$. When $\bar D$ has repeated eigenvalues,
the eigenvalues of $D$ are not asymptotically Gaussian, and repulsion is
observed between the eigenvalues corresponding to the same $\bar D$
eigenspaces. We apply these results to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with
$m=3$, addressing an important problem of detecting the symmetries of the
diffusion tensor, and seeking an experimental design that could potentially
yield an isotropic Gaussian distribution. In the 3-dimensional case, when the
mean tensor is spherically symmetric and the noise is Gaussian and isotropic,
the asymptotic distribution of the first three eigenvalue central moment
statistics is simple and can be used to test for isotropy. In order to apply
such tests, we use quadrature rules of order $t \ge 4$ with constant weights on
the unit sphere to design a DTI-experiment with the property that isotropy of
the underlying true tensor implies isotropy of the Fisher information. We also
explain the potential implications of the methods using simulated DTI data with
a Rician noise model.

  There is very little known about $R(G_{1},\ldots, G_{k})$ even for very

bipartite Ramsey numbers we obtain the exact values of some multicolor Ramsey

aim is to split a complex sentence into a meaning preserving sequence of
shorter sentences. Like sentence simplification, splitting-and-rephrasing has
the potential of benefiting both natural language processing and societal
applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP
systems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and
improves the performance of parsers, semantic role labellers and machine
translation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading
disabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter
ones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we
create and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tuples mapping a
single complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning.
Second, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to
semantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed

view of a (relational) data source that abstracts away details about data
storage. This conceptual view is realized through an ontology that is connected
to the data source through declarative mappings, and query answering is carried
out by translating the user queries over the conceptual view into SQL queries
over the data source. Standard translation techniques in OBDA try to transform
the user query into a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ), following the
heuristic argument that UCQs can be efficiently evaluated by modern relational
database engines. In this work, we show that translating to UCQs is not always
the best choice, and that, under certain conditions on the interplay between
the ontology, the map- pings, and the statistics of the data, alternative
translations can be evaluated much more efficiently. To find the best
translation, we devise a cost model together with a novel cardinality
estimation that takes into account all such OBDA components. Our experiments
confirm that (i) alternatives to the UCQ translation might produce queries that

faithful to the actual query evaluation cost, and hence is well suited to
select the best translation.

Atomic imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) shows that
quenching from 900oC introduces antiphase boundary to the crystals, and a
faster cooling rate during crystal growth leads to clusters of Y and Ir
antisite disorder. STEM study suggests the antiphase boundary region is Ir-rich
with a composition of Ba2YIrO6. The magnetic measurements show that Ba2YIrO6
crystals with clusters of antisite defects have a larger effective moment and a
larger saturation moment than the slow-cooled crystals. Quenched crystals with
Ir-rich antiphase boundary shows a slightly suppressed saturation moment than
the slow cooled crystals, and this seems to suggest that antiphase boundary is
detrimental to the moment formation. Our DFT calculations suggest magnetic
condensation is unlikely as the energy to be gained from superexchange is small
compared to the spin-orbit gap. However, once Y is replaced by Ir in the
antisite disordered region, the picture of local non-magnetic singlets breaks
down and magnetism can be induced. This is because of (a) enhanced interactions
due to increased overlap of orbitals between sites, and, (b) increased number
of orbitals mediating the interactions. Our work highlights the importance of
lattice defects in understanding the experimentally observed magnetism in

thinking modes in philosophy, both based on dialectic concept and
thesis-antithesis paradigm. They impose two different kinds of dialectics.
Idealistic and materialistic antitheses are formulated as optimization models.
Based on the models, the population is coordinated for dialectical
interactions. At the population-based context, the formulated optimization
models are reduced to a simple detection problem for each thinker (particle).
According to the assigned thinking mode to each thinker and her/his
measurements of corresponding dialectic with other candidate particles, they
deterministically decide to interact with a thinker in maximum dialectic with
their theses. The position of a thinker at maximum dialectic is known as an
available antithesis among the existing solutions. The dialectical interactions
at each ideological community are distinguished by meaningful distributions of
step-sizes for each thinking mode. In fact, the thinking modes are regarded as
exploration and exploitation elements of the proposed algorithm. The result is
a delicate balance without any requirement for adjustment of step-size
coefficients. Main parameter of the proposed algorithm is the number of
particles appointed to each thinking modes, or equivalently for each kind of
motions. An additional integer parameter is defined to boost the stability of
the final algorithm in some particular problems. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated by a testbed of 12 single-objective continuous benchmark functions.
Moreover, its performance and speed were highlighted in sparse reconstruction
and antenna selection problems, at the context of compressed sensing and
massive MIMO, respectively. The results indicate fast and efficient performance
in comparison with well-known evolutionary algorithms and dedicated
state-of-the-art algorithms.

their evolution during reionization (redshifts z=6-10). At these redshifts, the
spatial distribution of hydrogen-ionizing radiation is highly inhomogeneous,
and some regions of the Universe are still neutral. After masking the neutral
regions and ionizing sources in the simulation, we find that the hydrogen
photoionization rate depends on the local hydrogen density in a manner very
similar to that in the post-reionization Universe. The characteristic physical
hydrogen density above which self-shielding becomes important at these
redshifts is about $\mathrm{n_H \sim 3 \times 10^{-3} cm^{-3}}$, or $\sim$ 20
times the mean hydrogen density, reflecting the fact that during reionization
photoionization rates are typically low enough that the filaments in the cosmic
web are often self-shielded. The value of the typical self-shielding density
decreases by a factor of 3 between redshifts z=3 and 10, and follows the
evolution of the average photoionization rate in ionized regions in a simple
fashion. We provide a simple parameterization of the photoionization rate as a
function of density in self-shielded regions during the epoch of reionization.

proven confounding to this scenario. \citet{Cakirli2013a} measured a radius for

with the inhibited convection scenario. However, in their mass determinations,
\citet[][]{Iglesias2017} lacked independent radial velocity measurements for
the secondary component due to the star's faintness at optical wavelengths. The
secondary component is especially interesting as its purported mass is near the
transition from partially-convective to a fully-convective interior. In this

orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are
adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that

perturb an electron beam and introduce correlations between the otherwise
orthogonal transverse trajectories. These correlations couple the x and y
dynamics which increases the transverse emittance. If the correlation becomes
""diluted"" or randomized in the beam transport then as the correlation
disappears the 4D emittance increases. This paper discusses two important
correlations common to most electron injectors. The first results from the
coupling of a weak quadrupole field with beam rotation in a solenoid, and the
second x-y coupling is generated by an asymmetric on-axis RF field due to a
high-power RF coupler or cavity port. This paper shows that a small quadrupole
field combined with solenoidal focusing can result in significant emittance
growth due to coupled transverse dynamics. It also shows how adding a skewed
quadrupole field can exactly cancel this correlation and its emittance. Similar
emittance cancellation is demonstrated for asymmetric RF fields, with the

the Z' boson couples mostly to third generation fermions. We show that bottom

performed within a generic framework for explaining the B anomalies that can be

associated with Z' in such models produces lower bound on the production
cross-section which gives rise to a cross-section range for such scenarios for
the LHC to probe. Results are presented in Z' -> $\mu \mu$ decays with at least
one bottom-tagged jet in its final state. Some parts of the model parameter
space become constrained by the existing dimuon-resonance searches by the ATLAS

bottom-tagged jets in the final state would allow for probing a larger region
of the parameter space of the models at the ongoing LHC program.

previously proven this result for likelihoods comprised of at least one

uniqueness, however, cannot be guaranteed in the more general analysis applied

there exists a unique best-fit halo function, and provide a procedure for
constructing either a pointwise confidence band, if the best-fit halo function

of energetic electrons which are initially injected at the stagnation surface
and subsequently transported along flow streamlines. With this formulation the
energy spectra evolution of the electrons along the flow in the presence of
radiative and adiabatic cooling is determined. For flows regulated by
synchrotron radiative losses and adiabatic cooling, the effective radio
emission region is found to be finite, and geometrically it is more extended
along the jet central axis. Moreover, the emission from regions adjacent to the
stagnation surface is expected to be the most luminous as this is where the
freshly injected energetic electrons concentrate. An observable stagnation
surface is thus a strong prediction of the GRMHD jet model with the prescribed
non-thermal electron injection. Future millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm)

particlization, the transition between the hydrodynamic description to
microscopic degrees of freedom. For this purpose, individual particles are
sampled on the Cooper-Frye hypersurface. In this work, 4 different realizations
of sampling algorithms are compared, where three of them incorporate global
conservation laws of quantum numbers in each event. The algorithms are compared
within two types of scenarios: simple ""box"" hypersurface consisting of only one
static cell and a typical particlization hypersurface for Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For all algorithms the mean multiplicities
(or particle spectra) remain unaffected by global conservation laws in the case
of large volumes. In contrast, the fluctuations of the particle numbers are
affected considerably. The fluctuations of the newly developed SPREW algorithm
based on exponential weights and the recently suggested SER algorithm based on
ensemble rejection are smaller than without conservation laws and agree with
the expectation from the canonical ensemble. The previously applied mode
sampling algorithm produces dramatically larger fluctuations, than it is
expected in the corresponding microcanonical ensemble, and therefore should be
avoided in fluctuation studies. This study might be of interest for
investigations of particle fluctuations and correlations, e.g. the suggested
signatures for a phase transition or a critical endpoint, in hybrid approaches
that are affected by global conservation laws.

not thermalize when taken far from equilibrium. As one perturbs such systems
away from the integrable point, thermalization sets in, but the nature of the
crossover from integrable to thermalizing behavior is an unresolved and
actively discussed question. We explore this question by studying the dynamics
of the momentum distribution function in a dipolar quantum Newton's cradle
consisting of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms. This is accomplished by
creating the first one-dimensional Bose gas with strong magnetic dipole-dipole
interactions. These interactions provide tunability of both the strength of the
integrability-breaking perturbation and the nature of the near-integrable
dynamics. We provide the first experimental evidence that thermalization close
to a strongly interacting integrable point occurs in two steps:
prethermalization followed by near-exponential thermalization. Exact numerical
calculations on a two-rung lattice model yield a similar two-timescale process,
suggesting that this is generic in strongly interacting near-integrable models.
Moreover, the measured thermalization rate is consistent with a parameter-free
theoretical estimate, based on identifying the types of collisions that
dominate thermalization. By providing tunability between regimes of integrable
and nonintegrable dynamics, our work sheds light both on the mechanisms by
which isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, and on the temporal
structure of the onset of thermalization.

with user-centric small cell deployments is studied in this paper. In
particular, we consider a heterogeneous network model with user equipments
(UEs) being distributed according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP).
Specifically, we address two cluster processes, namely (i) Thomas cluster
process, where the UEs are clustered around the base stations (BSs) and the
distances between UEs and the BS are modeled as Gaussian distributed, and (ii)
Matern cluster process, where the UEs are scattered according to a uniform
distribution. In addition, distinguishing features of mmWave communications
including directional beamforming and a sophisticated path loss model
incorporating both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
transmissions, are taken into account. Initially, the complementary cumulative
distribution function (CCDF) and probability density function (PDF) of path
loss are provided. Subsequently, using tools from stochastic geometry, we
derive a general expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) coverage probability. Our results demonstrate that coverage probability
can be improved by decreasing the size of UE clusters around BSs, decreasing
the beamwidth of the main lobe, or increasing the main lobe directivity gain.
Moreover, interference has noticeable influence on the coverage performance of
our model. We also show that better coverage performance is achieved in the
presence of clustered users compared to the case in which the users are
distributed according to a Poisson Point Process (PPP).

star lead to questions about the habitability of massive moons orbiting planets
in the HZ. Around low-mass stars, the HZ is much closer to the star than for
Sun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity of the
star forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the
planet. Under these conditions the effects of tidal heating, distortion
torques, and stellar perturbations become important considerations for exomoon
habitability.
  Utilizing a model that considers both dynamical and tidal interactions
simultaneously, we performed a computational investigation into exomoon
evolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars ($\lesssim 0.6\ M_{\odot}$).
We show that dwarf stars with masses $\lesssim 0.2\ M_{\odot}$ cannot host
habitable exomoons within the stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the
moon. Perturbations from a central star may continue to have deleterious
effects in the HZ up to $\approx 0.5\ M_{\odot}$, depending on the host
planet's mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to
heating concerns, torques due to tidal and spin distortion can lead to the
relatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons of giant planets
in HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable
surfaces. In cases with lower intensity tidal heating the stellar perturbations
may have a positive influence on exomoon habitability by promoting long-term
heating and possibly extending the HZ for exomoons.

instability (MRI) in Keplerian disks with a nonzero net azimuthal magnetic
field using shearing box simulations. As distinct from most previous studies,
we analyze turbulence dynamics in Fourier (${\bf k}$-) space to understand its
sustenance. The linear growth of MRI with azimuthal field has a transient
character and is anisotropic in Fourier space, leading to anisotropy of
nonlinear processes in Fourier space. As a result, the main nonlinear process
appears to be a new type of angular redistribution of modes in Fourier space --
the \emph{nonlinear transverse cascade} -- rather than usual direct/inverse
cascade. We demonstrate that the turbulence is sustained by interplay of the
linear transient growth of MRI (which is the only energy supply for the
turbulence) and the transverse cascade. These two processes operate at large
length scales, comparable to box size and the corresponding small wavenumber
area, called \emph{vital area} in Fourier space is crucial for the sustenance,
while outside the vital area direct cascade dominates. The interplay of the
linear and nonlinear processes in Fourier space is generally too intertwined
for a vivid schematization. Nevertheless, we reveal the \emph{basic subcycle}
of the sustenance that clearly shows synergy of these processes in the
self-organization of the magnetized flow system. This synergy is quite robust
and persists for the considered different aspect ratios of the simulation
boxes. The spectral characteristics of the dynamical processes in these boxes
are qualitatively similar, indicating the universality of the sustenance
mechanism of the MRI-turbulence.

for mission-critical and civilian applications. However, IoT communication
networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks including the denial-of-service (DoS)
and jamming attacks, resulting in link removals in IoT network. In this work,
we develop a heterogeneous IoT network design framework in which a network
designer can add links to provide additional communication paths between two
nodes or secure links against attacks by investing resources. By anticipating
the strategic cyber attacks, we characterize the optimal design of secure IoT
network by first providing a lower bound on the number of links a secure
network requires for a given budget of protected links, and then developing a
method to construct networks that satisfy the heterogeneous network design
specifications. Therefore, each layer of the designed heterogeneous IoT network
is resistant to a predefined level of malicious attacks with minimum resources.
Finally, we provide case studies on the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT)
to corroborate and illustrate our obtained results.

of the cotangent functor to the structure maps of a Lie groupoid. We show that
such objects are in one-to-one correspondence with symplectic double groupoids,
generalizing a result of Zakrzewski concerning symplectic double groups and
Hopf algebra objects in the aforementioned category. The proof relies on the
fact that one can realize the core of a symplectic double groupoid as a
symplectic quotient of the total space. The resulting constructions apply more
generally to give a correspondence between double Lie groupoids and
groupoid-like objects in the category of smooth manifolds and smooth relations,

competing outputs of the system. Experiments are conducted on the artificial
overlapped Switchboard and hub5e-swb dataset. The proposed framework achieves
over 30% relative improvement of WER over both a strong jointly trained system,

distortion in the blackbody spectrum of cosmic microwave background photons. In
this work, we propose to use these distortions as a probe of the microphysics
of dark matter on scales $1\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}\lesssim k \lesssim
10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We consider in particular models in which the dark
matter is kinetically coupled to either neutrinos or photons until shortly
before recombination, and compute the photon heating rate and the resultant
$\mu$-distortion in both cases. We show that the $\mu$-parameter is generally
enhanced relative to $\Lambda$CDM for interactions with neutrinos, and may be
either enhanced or suppressed in the case of interactions with photons. The
deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM signal are potentially within the sensitivity
reach of a PRISM-like experiment if $\sigma_{\textrm{DM}-\gamma} \gtrsim
1.1\times10^{-30} \left(m_{\textrm{DM}}/\textrm{GeV}\right) \textrm{cm}^{2}$

cross sections, and $\sigma^{0}_{\textrm{DM}-\gamma} \gtrsim 1.8 \times

$\sigma^{0}_{\textrm{DM}-\nu} \gtrsim 2.5 \times 10^{-47}
\left(m_{\textrm{DM}}/\textrm{GeV}\right) \textrm{cm}^{2}$ for cross sections
scaling as temperature squared, coinciding with the parameter regions in which
late kinetic decoupling may serve as a solution to the small-scale crisis.
Furthermore, these $\mu$-distortion signals differ from those of warm dark
matter (no deviation from $\Lambda$CDM) and a suppressed primordial power
spectrum (strongly suppressed or a negative $\mu$-parameter), demonstrating
that CMB spectral distortion can potentially be used to distinguish between
solutions to the small-scale crisis.

resulted from overestimation of Ba by standard methods of LTE abundance
analysis in which the microturbulence derived from the Fe lines formed deep in
the photosphere is insufficient to represent the true line broadening imposed
on Ba {\scs II} lines by the upper photospheric layers from where the Ba {\scs

overabundances most likely result from the adoption of too low a value of
microturbulence in the spectum synthesis of the strong Ba {\scs II} lines but
the change of microturbulence in the upper photosphere has only a minor affect

simple to implement and avoids remeshing procedures as the domain is moving.
The evolving domain is embedded in a domain with fixed mesh and a cut finite
element method with continuous elements in space and discontinuous elements in
time is proposed. The method allows the evolving geometry to cut through the
fixed background mesh arbitrarily and thus avoids remeshing procedures.
However, the arbitrary cuts may lead to ill-conditioned algebraic systems. A
stabilization term is added to the weak form which guarantees well-conditioned
linear systems independently of the position of the geometry relative to the
fixed mesh and in addition makes it possible to use quadrature rules in time to
approximate the space-time integrals. We review here the space-time cut finite
element method presented in [13] where linear elements are used in both space
and time and extend the method to higher order elements for problems on
evolving surfaces (or interfaces). We present a new stabilization term which
also when higher order elements are used controls the condition number of the
linear systems from cut finite element methods on evolving surfaces. The new
stabilization combines the consistent ghost penalty stabilization [1] with a
term controlling normal derivatives at the interface.

to study a semi-saturated steady-state resulting from the two sources of
irradiation: microwave from the DNP process and the additional RF used to
manipulate the tensor polarization. The steady-state condition and
continuous-wave NMR lineshape are found that optimize the spin-1 alignment in

social media data? In this paper, we investigate an elementary dynamics, from
which word-dependent special effects are segregated, such as breaking news,
increasing (or decreasing) concerns, or seasonality. To elucidate this problem,
we investigated approximately three billion Japanese blog articles over a
period of six years, and analysed some corresponding solvable mathematical
models. From the analysis, we found that a word appearance can be explained by
the random diffusion model based on the power-law forgetting process, which is
a type of long memory point process related to ARFIMA(0,0.5,0). In particular,
we confirmed that ultraslow diffusion (where the mean squared displacement
grows logarithmically), which the model predicts in an approximate manner,
reproduces the actual data. In addition, we also show that the model can
reproduce other statistical properties of a time series: (i) the fluctuation
scaling, (ii) spectrum density, and (iii) shapes of the probability density
functions.

data transmission and detection approach for a single input multiple output
(SIMO) system. It is assumed that the signal having a bandwidth $B$ is
transmitted through a wireless channel with $L$ multipath components. Under
this assumption, the current paper provides a novel and simple OFTN
transmission and symbol-by-symbol detection approach that exploits the
multiplexing gain obtained by the multipath characteristic of wideband wireless
channels. It is shown that the proposed design can achieve a higher
transmission rate than the existing one (i.e., orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM)). Furthermore, the achievable rate gap between the proposed
approach and that of the OFDM increases as the number of receiver antennas
increases for a fixed value of $L$. This implies that the performance gain of
the proposed approach can be very significant for a large-scale multi-antenna
wireless system. The superiority of the proposed approach is shown
theoretically and confirmed via numerical simulations. {Specifically, we have
found {upper-bound average} rates of 15 bps/Hz and 28 bps/Hz with the OFDM and
proposed approaches, respectively, in a Rayleigh fading channel with 32 receive

  V2I Network","IEEE VTC-Fall 2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the important use-cases of 5G network is the vehicle to infrastructure
(V2I) communication which requires accurate understanding about its dynamic
propagation environment. As 5G base stations (BSs) tend to have multiple
antennas, they will likely employ beamforming to steer their radiation pattern
to the desired vehicle equipment (VE). Furthermore, since most wireless
standards employ an OFDM system, each VE may use one or more sub-carriers. To
this end, this paper proposes a joint design of adaptive channel prediction,
beamforming and scheduling for 5G V2I communications. The channel prediction
algorithm is designed without the training signal and channel impulse response
(CIR) model. In this regard, first we utilize the well known adaptive recursive
least squares (RLS) technique for predicting the next block CIR from the past
and current block received signals (a block may have one or more OFDM symbols).
Then, we jointly design the beamforming and VE scheduling for each sub-carrier
to maximize the uplink channel average sum rate by utilizing the predicted CIR.
The beamforming problem is formulated as a Rayleigh quotient optimization where
its global optimal solution is guaranteed. And, the VE scheduling design is
formulated as an integer programming problem which is solved by employing a
greedy search. The superiority of the proposed channel prediction and
scheduling algorithms over those of the existing ones is demonstrated via
numerical simulations.

analyze the profiles of the five transitions of Mg II (the 3p - 3s h and k
transitions, and three lines belonging to the 3d - 3p transitions). We use
analytical methods to understand the unusual profiles, together with higher
resolution observational data of similar phenomena observed by Jing et al.
(2016). The peculiar line ratios indicate anisotropic emission from the strands
which have cross-strand line center optical depths (k-line) of between 1 and
10. The lines are broadened by unresolved Alfvenic motions whose energy exceeds
the radiation losses in the Mg II lines by an order of magnitude. The decay of
the line widths is accompanied by a decay in the brightness, suggesting a
causal connection. If the plasma is <~ 99% ionized, ion-neutral collisions can
account for the dissipation, otherwise a of dynamical process seems necessary.
Our work implies that the motions are initiated during the impulsive phase, to
be dissipated as radiation over a period of an hour, predominantly by strong
chromospheric lines. The coronal ""rain"" we observe is far more turbulent that
most earlier reports have indicated, with implications for plasma heating
mechanisms.

to solve eigenvalue and linear problems on large-scale meshes despite the

re-identification (re-id), is a challenging problem that is of importance to
visual recognition and surveillance. Most existing methods exploit local
regions within spatial manipulation to perform matching in local
correspondence. However, they essentially extract \emph{fixed} representations
from pre-divided regions for each image and perform matching based on the
extracted representation subsequently. For models in this pipeline, local finer
patterns that are crucial to distinguish positive pairs from negative ones
cannot be captured, and thus making them underperformed. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep multiplicative integration gating function, which answers
the question of \emph{what-and-where to match} for effective person re-id. To
address \emph{what} to match, our deep network emphasizes common local patterns
by learning joint representations in a multiplicative way. The network
comprises two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract convolutional
activations, and generates relevant descriptors for pedestrian matching. This
thus, leads to flexible representations for pair-wise images. To address
\emph{where} to match, we combat the spatial misalignment by performing
spatially recurrent pooling via a four-directional recurrent neural network to
impose spatial dependency over all positions with respect to the entire image.
The proposed network is designed to be end-to-end trainable to characterize
local pairwise feature interactions in a spatially aligned manner. To
demonstrate the superiority of our method, extensive experiments are conducted
over three benchmark data sets: VIPeR, CUHK03 and Market-1501.

We derive the thermodynamically consistent fluctuation-dissipation relation for
SCN to show that it predicts the molecular arrest resembling the glass
transition, i.e. the critical slow-down of dynamics in the disordered phases.
We show that the mechanism of singular dissipation is embedded in the
dissipation matrix, accompanying SCN. We are also able to identify the
characteristic length of collective dissipation, which diverges at critical
packing. This novel physical quantity conveniently describes the difference
between the ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. The model is fully analytically
solvable, one-dimensional and admits arbitrary interactions between the

strategies for multi-robot systems. Consider a team of $n$ cooperating robots
traveling along predetermined closed and disjoint trajectories. Each robot
needs to periodically communicate information to nearby robots. At places where
two trajectories are within range of each other, a communication link is
established, allowing two robots to exchange information, provided they are
""synchronized"", i.e., they visit the link at the same time. In this setting a
communication graph is defined and a system of robots is called
\emph{synchronized} if every pair of neighbors is synchronized.
  If one or more robots leave the system, then some trajectories are left
unattended. To handle such cases in a synchronized system, when a live robot
arrives to a communication link and detects the absence of the neighbor, it
shifts to the neighboring trajectory to assume the unattended task. If enough
robots leave, it may occur that a live robot enters a state of
\emph{starvation}, failing to permanently meet other robots during flight. To
measure the tolerance of the system under this phenomenon we define the
\emph{$k$-resilience} as the minimum number of robots whose removal may cause
$k$ surviving robots to enter a state of starvation. We show that the problem
of computing the $k$-resilience is NP-hard if $k$ is part of the input, even if
the communication graph is a tree. We propose algorithms to compute the
$k$-resilience for constant values of $k$ in general communication graphs and
show more efficient algorithms for systems whose communication graph is a tree.

scenarios, there are examples aplenty where new physics give rise to anomalous
objects (such as collimated and equally energetic particles, decays due to long

vetoes that eliminate all standard-objects up to a pre-determined acceptance
rate. Any event containing at least one anomalous object (that passes all these
vetoes), can be identified as a candidate for new physics. Subsequent offline
analyses can determine the nature of the anomalous object as well as of the

number, $M_{\rm s}\lesssim 3$, are expected to form in merging galaxy clusters.
The presence of such shocks has been indicated by X-ray and radio observations
of many merging clusters. In particular, diffuse radio sources known as radio
relics could be explained by synchrotron-emitting electrons accelerated via
diffusive shock acceleration (Fermi I) at quasi-perpendicular shocks. Here we
also consider possible roles of stochastic acceleration (Fermi II) by
compressive MHD turbulence downstream of the shock. Then we explore a puzzling
discrepancy that for some radio relics, the shock Mach number inferred from the
radio spectral index is substantially larger than that estimated from X-ray
observations. This problem could be understood, if shock surfaces associated
with radio relics consist of multiple shocks with different strengths.In that
case, X-ray observations tend to pick up the part of shocks with lower Mach
numbers and higher kinetic energy flux, while radio emissions come
preferentially from the part of shocks with higher Mach numbers and higher
cosmic ray (CR) production. We also show that the Fermi I reacceleration model
with preexisting fossil electrons supplemented by Fermi II acceleration due to
postshock turbulence could reproduce observed profiles of radio flux densities
and integrated radio spectra of two giant radio relics. This study demonstrates
the CR electrons can be accelerated at collisionless shocks in galaxy clusters
just like supernova remnant shock in the interstellar medium and interplanetary
shocks in the solar wind.

reconstruction with motion field estimation. The formulated optimization
problem is solved by a primal-dual algorithm with linesearch due to its
efficiency when dealing with non-differentiable problems. With the estimated
motion field, the DMRI reconstruction is refined through MC. By employing the
multi-scale coarse-to-fine strategy, we are able to update the
variables(temporal image sequences and motion vectors) and to refine the image
reconstruction alternately. Moreover, the proposed framework is capable of
handling a wide class of prior information (regularizations) for DMRI
reconstruction, such as sparsity, low rank and total variation. Experiments on
various DMRI data, ranging from in vivo lung to cardiac dataset, validate the
reconstruction quality improvement using the proposed scheme in comparison to

number of cores per chip rather than single core performance. In turn, modern
jobs are often designed to run on any number of cores. However, to effectively
leverage these multi-core chips, one must address the question of how many
cores to assign to each job. Given that jobs receive sublinear speedups from
additional cores, there is an obvious tradeoff: allocating more cores to an
individual job reduces the job's runtime, but in turn decreases the efficiency
of the overall system. We ask how the system should schedule jobs across cores
so as to minimize the mean response time over a stream of incoming jobs.
  To answer this question, we develop an analytical model of jobs running on a
multi-core machine. We prove that EQUI, a policy which continuously divides
cores evenly across jobs, is optimal when all jobs follow a single speedup
curve and have exponentially distributed sizes. EQUI requires jobs to change
their level of parallelization while they run. Since this is not possible for
all workloads, we consider a class of ""fixed-width"" policies, which choose a
single level of parallelization, k, to use for all jobs. We prove that,
surprisingly, it is possible to achieve EQUI's performance without requiring
jobs to change their levels of parallelization by using the optimal fixed level
of parallelization, k*. We also show how to analytically derive the optimal k*
as a function of the system load, the speedup curve, and the job size
distribution.
  In the case where jobs may follow different speedup curves, finding a good
scheduling policy is even more challenging. We find that policies like EQUI
which performed well in the case of a single speedup function now perform
poorly. We propose a very simple policy, GREEDY*, which performs near-optimally
when compared to the numerically-derived optimal policy.

topological photonics and optomechanics. To achieve the transverse spin of
nonzero longitudinal fields, various platforms that derive transversely
confined waves based on focusing, interference, or evanescent waves have been
suggested. Nonetheless, because of the transverse confinement inherently
accompanying sign reversal of the field derivative, the resulting transverse
spin handedness experiences spatial inversion, which leads to a mismatch
between the densities of the wavefunction and its spin component and hinders
the global observation of the transverse spin. Here, we reveal a globally pure
transverse spin in which the wavefunction density signifies the spin
distribution, by employing inverse molding of the eigenmode in the spin basis.
Starting from the target spin profile, we analytically obtain the potential
landscape and then show that the elliptic-hyperbolic transition around the
epsilon-near-zero permittivity allows for the global conservation of transverse
spin handedness across the topological interface between anisotropic
metamaterials. Extending to the non-Hermitian regime, we also develop
annihilated transverse spin modes to cover the entire Poincare sphere of the
meridional plane. Our results enable the complete transfer of optical energy to
transverse spinning motions and realize the classical analogy of 3-dimensional
quantum spin states.

fabricated FTJs with BaTiO3 single barriers (SB-FTJs) and BaTiO3/SrTiO3
composite barriers (CB-FTJs), and reported a systematic study of FTJ
performances by varying the barrier thicknesses and compositions. For the
SB-FTJs, the TER is limited by pronounced leakage current for ultrathin
barriers and extremely small tunneling current for thick barriers. For the
CB-FTJs, the extra SrTiO3 barrier provides an additional degree of freedom to
modulate the barrier potential and tunneling behavior. The resultant high
tunability can be utilized to overcome the barrier thickness limits and enhance
the overall CB-FTJ performances beyond those of SB-FTJ. Our results reveal a
new paradigm to manipulate the FTJs through designing multilayer tunneling

implement: in each mini-batch, images or feature maps are randomly chosen to
undergo a transformation such that pixels within each local patch are shuffled.
Through generating images and feature maps with interior orderless patches,
PatchShuffle creates rich local variations, reduces the risk of network
overfitting, and can be viewed as a beneficial supplement to various kinds of
training regularization techniques, such as weight decay, model ensemble and

PatchShuffle improves the generalization ability of CNN especially when the

vary periodically on the pixel scale in most cases. The amplitude of variation
depends on not only the detector but also how well the spot is sampled by the

bonding. Significantly, the QSH states in III-Bi-(CH3)2 films are robust
against the mechanical strains and various methyl coverages, making these films
particularly flexible to substrate choice for device applications. Besides, the
h-BN substrate is an ideal substrate for III-Bi-(CH3)2 films to realize large
gap nontrivial topological states.. These findings demonstrate that the
methyl-functionalized III-Bi films may be good QSH effect platforms for
topological electronic devices design and fabrication in spintronics.

Participants with bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and
healthy volunteers completed daily mood ratings using a bespoke smartphone app
for up to a year. A signature-based machine learning model was used to classify
participants on the basis of the interrelationship between the different mood
items assessed and to predict subsequent mood. The signature methodology was
significantly superior to earlier statistical approaches applied to this data
in distinguishing the participant three groups, clearly placing 75% into their

correctly predicted with greater than 70% accuracy in all groups. Prediction of

deep learning based restoration methods do not take the multi-scale information

module to learn multi-scale information and design a deep network for single
image super-resolution. Different dilated convolution learns different scale
feature, then the inception module concatenates all these features to fuse
multi-scale information. In order to increase the reception field of our
network to catch more contextual information, we cascade multiple inception
modules to constitute a deep network to conduct single image super-resolution.
With the novel dilated convolution based inception module, the proposed
end-to-end single image super-resolution network can take advantage of
multi-scale information to improve image super-resolution performance.
Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms many

human spinal cord injury patient undergoing spinal stimulation and physical
rehabilitation. Because clinicians must remain close to the patient during
training sessions, the patient is usually under permanent and transient
occlusions due to the training equipment and the movements of the attending
clinicians. These occlusions can significantly degrade the accuracy of existing
human tracking methods. To improve the data association problem in these
circumstances, we present a new global feature based on the geodesic distances
of surface mesh points to a set of anchor points. Transient occlusions are
handled via a multi-hypothesis tracking framework. To evaluate the method, we
simulated different occlusion sizes on a data set captured from a human in
varying movement patterns, and compared the proposed feature with other
tracking methods. The results show that the proposed method achieves robustness
to both surface deformations and transient occlusions.

reduce the average load under an arbitrary (known) file popularity

which are specified by a general file partition parameter. Then, we formulate
the coded caching design optimization problem over the considered class of
schemes with 2^K2^N variables to minimize the average load by optimizing the
file partition parameter under an arbitrary file popularity. Furthermore, we
show that the optimization problem is convex, and the resulting optimal
solution generally improves upon known schemes. Next, we analyze structural

Fourier-Laplacian filtering in the frequency domain that includes a
verification technique using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The proposed approach
deals with the text region appearing not only in horizontal or vertical
directions, but also in any other oblique or curved orientation in the image.
Until now only a few methods have been proposed that look into curved text
detection in video frames, wherein lies our novelty. In our approach, we first
apply Fourier-Laplacian transform on the image followed by an ideal
Laplacian-Gaussian filtering. Thereafter K-means clustering is employed to
obtain the asserted text areas depending on a maximum difference map. Next, the
obtained connected components (CC) are skeletonized to distinguish various text
strings. Complex components are disintegrated into simpler ones according to a
junction removal algorithm followed by a concatenation performed on possible
combination of the disjoint skeletons to obtain the corresponding text area.
Finally these text hypotheses are verified using HMM-based text/non-text
classification system. False positives are thus eliminated giving us a robust
text detection performance. We have tested our framework in multi-oriented text
lines in four scripts, namely, English, Chinese, Devanagari and Bengali, in
video frames and scene texts. The results obtained show that proposed approach
surpasses existing methods on text detection.

distribution functions (PDFs) using lattice QCD. One of the problems faced in
calculations of quasi-PDFs is the renormalization of a nonlocal operator. By
introducing an auxiliary field, we can replace the nonlocal operator with a
pair of local operators in an extended theory. On the lattice, this is closely
related to the static quark theory. In this approach, we show how to understand
the pattern of mixing that is allowed by chiral symmetry breaking, and obtain a
master formula for renormalizing the nonlocal operator that depends on three
parameters. We present an approach for nonperturbatively determining these
parameters and use perturbation theory to convert to the MS-bar scheme.
Renormalization parameters are obtained for two lattice spacings using Wilson
twisted mass fermions and for different discretizations of the Wilson line in
the nonlocal operator. Using these parameters we show the effect of
renormalization on nucleon matrix elements with pion mass approximately 370
MeV, and compare renormalized results for the two lattice spacings. The
renormalized matrix elements are consistent among the different Wilson line
discretizations and lattice spacings.

Photons belonging to a structured beam of finite transverse size, generated by
a spatial light modulator, have been observed to travel with a group velocity,
$v_g$, which is smaller than $c$ also when propagating in vacuum [1-3]. This is
an effect that depends on the geometry of the beam. From quantum mechanical
considerations, these photons must in any case propagate at the speed of light.
This paradox can be resolved by taking into account a projection effect. What
was measured in these experiments as group velocity was in fact its projection
onto the beam propagation axis [4]. This depends on the divergence of the beams
used in these experiments. We have found that for hypergeometric beams carrying
orbital angular momentum (OAM), generated by sources with equal aperture [5-8],
$v_g$ obeys an OAM/velocity relationship similar to that proposed by Majorana
between spin and mass for bosonic and fermionic relativistic particles. This
relationship, depending on the geometrical properties of the beam, can pave the
way for an alternative estimation of OAM or to implement a time buffer in
optical communications.

The Open University (2015)",,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the near future the SCM is predicted to modify the form of new programs,
the access form to storage, and the way that storage devices themselves are
built. Therefore, a combination between the SCM and a designated Memory
Allocation Manager (MAM) that will allow the programmer to manually control the
different memories in the memory hierarchy will be likely to achieve a new
level of performance for memory-aware data structures. Although the manual MAM
seems to be the optimal approach for multi-level memory hierarchy management,
this technique is still very far from being realistic, and the chances that it
would be implemented in current codes using High Performance Computing (HPC)
platforms is quite low. This premise means that the most reasonable way to
introduce the SCM into any usable and popular memory system would be by
implementing an automated version of the MAM using the fundamentals of paging
algorithms, as used for two-level memory hierarchy. Our hypothesis is that
achieving appropriate transferability between memory levels may be possible
using ideas of algorithms employed in current virtual memory systems, and that
the adaptation of those algorithms from a two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy is possible. In order to reach the conclusion that our
hypothesis is correct, we investigated various paging algorithms, and found the
ones that could be adapted successfully from two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy. We discovered that using an adaptation of the Aging
paging algorithm to an N-level memory hierarchy results in the best
performances in terms of Hit/Miss ratio. In order to verify our hypothesis we
build a simulator called ""DeMemory simulator"" for analyzing our algorithms as
well as for other algorithms that will be devised in the future.

bubbles, we address the calibration of time series in which the inception of
the latest regime of interest is unknown. By taking into account the tendency
of a given model to overfit data, we introduce the Lagrange regularisation of
the normalised sum of the squared residuals, $\chi^{2}_{np}(\Phi)$, to
endogenously detect the optimal fitting window size := $w^* \in
[\tau:\bar{t}_2]$ that should be used for calibration purposes for a fixed
pseudo present time $\bar{t}_2$. The performance of the Lagrange regularisation
of $\chi^{2}_{np}(\Phi)$ defined as $\chi^{2}_{\lambda (\Phi)}$ is exemplified
on a simple Linear Regression problem with a change point and compared against
the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) := $\chi^{2}(\Phi)$ and RSS/(N-p):=
$\chi^{2}_{np}(\Phi)$, where $N$ is the sample size and p is the number of
degrees of freedom. Applied to synthetic models of financial bubbles with a
well-defined transition regime and to a number of financial time series (US
S\&P500, Brazil IBovespa and China SSEC Indices), the Lagrange regularisation
of $\chi^{2}_{\lambda}(\Phi)$ is found to provide well-defined reasonable
determinations of the starting times for major bubbles such as the bubbles
ending with the 1987 Black-Monday, the 2008 Sub-prime crisis and minor
speculative bubbles on other Indexes, without any further exogenous

metrics which play a prominent role in Riemannian geometry, are also of
fundamental importance in information geometry. Precisely, the paper features a
new theorem, which states that the Rao-Fisher information metric of any
location-scale model, defined on a Riemannian manifold, is a warped Riemannian
metric, whenever this model is invariant under the action of some Lie group.
This theorem is a valuable tool in finding the expression of the Rao-Fisher
information metric of location-scale models defined on high-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds. Indeed, a warped Riemannian metric is fully determined by
only two functions of a single variable, irrespective of the dimension of the
underlying Riemannian manifold. Starting from this theorem, several original
contributions are made. The expression of the Rao-Fisher information metric of
the Riemannian Gaussian model is provided, for the first time in the
literature. A generalised definition of the Mahalanobis distance is introduced,
which is applicable to any location-scale model defined on a Riemannian
manifold. The solution of the geodesic equation is obtained, for any Rao-Fisher
information metric defined in terms of warped Riemannian metrics. Finally,
using a mixture of analytical and numerical computations, it is shown that the
parameter space of the von Mises-Fisher model of $n$-dimensional directional
data, when equipped with its Rao-Fisher information metric, becomes a Hadamard
manifold, a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold of negative sectional
curvature, for $n = 2,\ldots,8$. Hopefully, in upcoming work, this will be
proved for any value of $n$.

handling a distinct unary potential on every node (pixel), typical of CV
applications. This allows us to lift the large class of algorithms that model a

following the quench. We find that the change in EE is finite (and real) only
if the spin-three charge q is bounded by the energy of the perturbation E, as
|q|/c < E^2/c^2. We show that the Wilson line/EE correlator deep in the

Regge limit for chaos of the out-of-time-ordered correlator. We further find
that the scrambling time for the two-sided mutual information between two

charge, diverging when the bound is saturated. For larger values of the charge,
the scrambling time is shorter than for pure gravity and controlled by the
spin-three Lyapunov exponent 4\pi/\beta. In a CFT with higher spin chemical
potential, dual to a higher spin black hole, we find that the chemical

performance of long elastomeric seals in relatively smooth test fixtures.
Motivated by these results, we analytically and computationally investigate the
combined effects of seal length and compressibility on the maximum differential
pressure a seal can support. We present a Saint-Venant type analytic shear lag
solution for slightly compressible seals with large aspect ratios, which
compares well with nonlinear finite element simulations in regions far from the
ends of the seal. However, at the high- and low-pressure ends, where fracture
is observed experimentally, the analytic solution is in poor agreement with
detailed finite element calculations. Nevertheless, we show that the analytic
solution provides far-field stress measures that correlate, over a range of
aspect ratios and bulk moduli, the calculated energy release rates for the
growth of small cracks at the two ends of the seal. Thus a single finite
element simulation coupled with the analytic solution can be used to determine
tendencies for fracture at the two ends of the seal over a wide range of
geometry and compressibility. Finally, using a hypothetical critical energy
release rate, predictions for whether a crack on the high-pressure end will
begin to grow before or after a crack on the low-pressure end begins to grow
are made using the analytic solution and compared with finite element
simulations for finite deformation, hyperelastic seals.

cancer patients have resectable tumors; however, their cardiopulmonary function
needs to be properly evaluated before they are deemed operative candidates.
Consequently, a subset of such patients is asked to undergo standard pulmonary
function tests, such as cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) or stair climbs,
to have their pulmonary function evaluated. The standard tests are expensive,
labor intensive, and sometimes ineffective due to co-morbidities, such as
limited mobility. Recovering patients would benefit greatly from a device that
can be worn at home, is simple to use, and is relatively inexpensive. Using
advances in information technology, the goal is to design a continuous,
inexpensive, mobile and patient-centric mechanism for evaluation of a patient's
pulmonary function. A light mobile mask is designed, fitted with CO2, O2, flow
volume, and accelerometer sensors and tested on 18 subjects performing 15
minute exercises. The data collected from the device is stored in a cloud
service and machine learning algorithms are used to train and predict a user's
activity .Several classification techniques are compared - K Nearest Neighbor,
Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Naive
Bayes. One useful area of interest involves comparing a patient's predicted
activity levels, especially using only breath data, to that of a normal

the Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations exhibit a super-Poissonian statistics

Alfven wave collisions---are the fundamental building block of astrophysical
plasma turbulence and naturally generate current sheets in the strongly
nonlinear limit. A nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation of a strong Alfven wave
collision is used to examine the damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations
and the associated energization of particles that occurs in self-consistently

collisionless damping and the associated particle energization, as well as the
subsequent thermalization of the particle energy by collisions. The net
particle energization by the parallel electric field is shown to be spatially
intermittent, and the nonlinear evolution is essential in enabling that spatial
non-uniformity. Using the recently developed field-particle correlation
