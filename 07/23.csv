sample, new texture images of arbitrary size and which are perceptually
equivalent to the sample. The two main approaches are statistics-based methods
and patch re-arrangement methods. In the first class, a texture is
characterized by a statistical signature; then, a random sampling conditioned
to this signature produces genuinely different texture images. The second class
boils down to a clever ""copy-paste"" procedure, which stitches together large
regions of the sample. Hybrid methods try to combine ideas from both approaches
to avoid their hurdles. The recent approaches using convolutional neural
networks fit to this classification, some being statistical and others
performing patch re-arrangement in the feature space. They produce impressive
synthesis on various kinds of textures. Nevertheless, we found that most real
textures are organized at multiple scales, with global structures revealed at
coarse scales and highly varying details at finer ones. Thus, when confronted
with large natural images of textures the results of state-of-the-art methods
degrade rapidly, and the problem of modeling them remains wide open.

the incompressibility coefficient of symmetric nuclear matter and the density
dependence of the symmetry energy. The main goal of this paper is to explore
the emergence, evolution, and origin of low energy monopole strength along the
even-even calcium isotopes: from 40Ca to 60Ca. The distribution of isoscalar
monopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation
(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the
properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is
adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any
reliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of
low-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is
being filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows. Further, in
contrast to experimental findings, a mild softening of the monopole response
with increasing mass number is predicted. Beyond 48Ca, a significant amount of
low-energy monopole strength emerges as soon as the weak-binding neutron
orbitals (2p and 1f5/2) become populated. The emergence and evolution of
low-energy strength is identified with transitions from these weakly-bound
states into the continuum. Moreover, given that models with a soft symmetry
energy tend to reach the neutron-drip line earlier than their stiffer
counterparts, we identify an inverse correlation between the neutron-skin
thickness and the inverse energy weighted sum.

this paper, we explore how \textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,
\textit{hipsters}) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products.
We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for
updating node states (which describe which product has been adopted) in which
an adjustable fraction $p_{\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters,
who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the
two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by
considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate
our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters
have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:
even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the
simulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the
other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this
behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction
on $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our
simulations demonstrate that a time delay $\tau$ in the knowledge of the
product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of
product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final
distribution of product adoptions. Our simple model and analysis may help shed
light on the road to success for anti-establishment choices in elections, as
such success can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of
anti-establishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on
normal individuals.

between quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, and can be exploited for
quantum communication with one untrusted party. In particular, steering of
continuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a
manifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on
quadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that
there exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian
measurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR
steering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing
and extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of
two-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent
interest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these
states as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the
pseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored
regimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones
to witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We
further consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose
expectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for
all two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion,
these observables are found to be always less sensitive than Gaussian
observables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous variable
Werner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find
that pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to
reveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of
non-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian
and non-Gaussian states.

overtone transitions that are inherently insensitive to crystal orientation and

nanodiamond ensembles specifically for nuclear hyperpolarization and show that
frequency-swept dynamic nuclear polarization may transfer a large amount of the
NV- center's hyperpolarization to nuclear spins by sweeping over a small region

In addition, we compute the asymptotic distribution of total winding numbers in

We provide a prescription that identifies all $\mathbb{P}^1$ curves in certain

questions in graph theory. The Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property characterizes the
cases when the optimal solutions of these two problems are bounded by functions
of each other. Robertson and Seymour proved that when packing and covering
$H$-minors for any fixed graph $H$, the planarity of $H$ is equivalent to the
Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property. Thomas conjectured that the planarity is no longer
required if the solution of the packing problem is allowed to be half-integral.
  In this paper, we prove that this half-integral version of Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa
property holds for packing and covering $H$-topological minors, for any fixed
graph $H$, which easily implies Thomas' conjecture. In fact, we prove an even
stronger statement in which those topological minors are rooted at any choice
of prescribed subsets of vertices.
  A number of results on $H$-topological minor free or $H$-minor free graphs
have conclusions or requirements tied to properties of $H$. Classes of graphs
that can half-integrally pack only a bounded number of $H$-topological minors
or $H$-minors are more general topological minor-closed or minor-closed
families whose minimal obstructions are more complicated than $H$. Our theorem
provides a general machinery to extend those results to those more general
classes of graphs without losing their tight connections to $H$.

interaction with the surrounding atmosphere and ionosphere, meteors are a
highly interesting observational target for high-resolution wide-field
astronomical surveys. Such surveys are capable of resolving the physical size
of meteor plasma heads, but they produce large volumes of images that need to
be automatically inspected for possible existence of long linear features
produced by meteors. Here we show how big aperture sky survey telescopes detect
meteors as defocused tracks with a central brightness depression. We derive an
analytic expression for a defocused point source meteor track and use it to
calculate brightness profiles of meteors modeled as uniform brightness disks.
We apply our modeling to meteor images as seen by the SDSS and LSST telescopes.
The expression is validated by Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations of photons
traveling through the atmosphere and the LSST telescope optics. We show that
estimates of the meteor distance and size can be extracted from the measured
FWHM and the strength of the central dip in the observed brightness profile.
However, this extraction becomes difficult when the defocused meteor track is
distorted by the atmospheric seeing or contaminated by a long lasting glowing
meteor trail. The FWHM of satellites tracks is distinctly narrower than meteor
values, which enables removal of a possible confusion between satellites and
meteors.

network to map spatial feature to polarimetric feature with which the
polarimetric covariance matrix of each pixel can be reconstructed. Both
qualitative and quantitative experiments with real fully polarimetric data are
conducted to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The reconstructed

considering the $3d$ case and note that our solutions belong to the family of
maximally symmetric spaces that can be extended to the $d\geq 4$ case following
an analogue treatment. These solutions can be divided into two scenarios:
maximally symmetric spaces with positive curvature i.e. de Sitter spaces, and
maximally symmetric spaces with negative curvature i.e. Anti-de Sitter spaces.
We show that between both scenarios there is a {\it critical point} where the
curvature blows up along the flow. Also the solutions for $d\geq 4$ satisfy the
flow equations with Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metrics due to the fact
that the considered maximally symmetric spaces do not depend on time neither on
the angular coordinates yielding equations that depend only on the radial
coordinate and the Ricci flow parameter. Additionally we find an interesting
effect of the flow consisting in a change of the signature of the metric when
passing the singular point. Besides the signature change, the sign of the
curvature also experiences a transition from positive to negative curvature,
either with Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metrics throughout the singular
point.

beyond of the previous discrete TRFs that only use linear potentials with
discrete features. The idea is to use nonlinear potentials with continuous

TRFs combine the advantages of both NNs and TRFs. The benefits of word

from the use of NNs. At the same time, the strength of efficient inference by
avoiding expensive softmax is preserved. A number of technical contributions,
including employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to define the

successfully train neural TRF LMs. Various LMs are evaluated in terms of speech

explain the observed size-dependency of Keff for smaller nanoparticles with D <

compact entity itself is expected to be governed by superstringy effects, and
in astrophysical scenarios it can give rise to interesting observable
phenomena. Earlier it was suggested that the superspinar may not be stable but
we point out here that this does not necessarily follow from earlier studies.
We show, by analytically treating the Teukolsky equations by Detwiler's method,
that in fact there are infinitely many boundary conditions that make the
superspinar stable, and that the modes will decay in time. It follows that we
need to know more on the physical nature of the superspinar in order to decide
on its stability in physical reality.

error signals to find the optimal motor command in the face of Gaussian sensory
and motor noise. However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral
observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily
corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually
introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of
sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that
the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather
than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via
Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this
theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the
pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory
feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung
pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains
the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising
predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we
confirm experimentally.

sum of two random Hermitian matrices with given eigenvalues via
\emph{derivative principle}, a powerful tool used to get the exact probability

eigenvalues of two random Hermitian matrices with given eigenvalues. Moreover,
as an illustration, we derive the analytical expressions of eigenvalues of the
sum of two random Hermitian matrices from $\rG\rU\rE(n)$ or Wishart ensemble by
derivative principle, respectively.We also investigate the statistics of
exponential of random matrices and connect them with Golden-Thompson

applications in quantum information theory, such as uniform average quantum
Jensen-Shannon divergence and average coherence of uniform mixture of two

collisions can be attributed to factorization breaking effects in the formation
of quarkonium. These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color
exchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving
partons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute
the short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass
Condensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color
Evaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at
large distances. The combined CGC+ICEM model provides a quantitative
description of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ data in proton-proton (p+p) collisions
from both RHIC and the LHC. Factorization breaking effects in hadronization,
due to additional parton comovers in the nucleus, are introduced heuristically
by imposing a cutoff $\Lambda$, representing the momentum kick from soft color
exchanges, in the ICEM model. Such soft exchanges have no perceptible effect on
$J/\psi$ suppression in p+A collisions. In contrast, the interplay of the
physics of these soft exchanges at large distances, with the physics of
semi-hard rescattering at short distances, causes a significant additional
suppression of $\psi(2S)$ yields relative to that of the $J/\psi$. A good fit
of all RHIC and LHC $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ data, for transverse momenta
$P_\perp\leq 5$ GeV in p+p and p+A collisions, is obtained for $\Lambda\sim 10$

Thus, in this paper a comprehensive hybrid ANR (H-ANR) architecture which leads
to the management of relations utilizing an extensive set of universal

H-ANR functionality ranks the neighbors not based on instantaneous information
but on historic values of the performance criteria and other metrics. The

This
problem becomes especially difficult if the same set of actuators (e.g. a
single rudder) has to be used for roll stabilization and heading control of the
vessel, so that the roll stabilizing system interferes with the ship autopilot.
Finding the ""trade-off"" between the concurrent goals of accurate vessel
steering and roll stabilization usually reduces to an optimization problem,
which has to be solved in presence of an unknown wave disturbance. Standard
approaches to this problem (loop-shaping, LQG, $H_{\infty}$-control etc.)
require to know the spectral density of the disturbance, considered to be a
\colored noise"". In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal roll
stabilization, approximating the disturbance by a polyharmonic signal with
known frequencies yet uncertain amplitudes and phase shifts. Linear quadratic
optimization problems in presence of polyharmonic disturbances can be solved by
means of the theory of universal controllers developed by V.A. Yakubovich. An
optimal universal controller delivers the optimal solution for any uncertain
amplitudes and phases. Using Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) Toolbox that
provides a realistic vessel's model, we compare our design method with
classical approaches to optimal roll stabilization. Among three controllers
providing the same quality of yaw steering, OUC stabilizes the roll motion most
efficiently.

rate databases and sets of adsorption energies on a large sample of chemical
species and emerging line fluxes from the near-IR to the submm wavelength
range. Results. We find large differences in the masses and radial distribution
of ice reservoirs when considering freeze-out on bare or polar ice coated
grains. Most strongly the ammonia ice mass and the location of the snow line
(water) change. As a consequence molecules associated to the ice lines such as
N2H+ change their emitting region; none of the line fluxes in the sample
considered here changes by more than 25% except CO isotopologues, CN and N2H+
lines. The three-body reaction N+H2+M plays a key role in the formation of
water in the outer disk. Besides that, differences between the UMIST 2006 and
2012 database change line fluxes in the sample considered here by less than a
factor 2 (a subset of low excitation CO and fine structure lines stays even
within 25%); exceptions are OH, CN, HCN, HCO+ and N2H+ lines. However,
different networks such as OSU and KIDA 2011 lead to pronounced differences in
the chemistry inside 100 au and thus affect emission lines from high excitation
CO, OH and CN lines. H2 is easily excited at the disk surface and
state-to-state reactions enhance the abundance of CH+ and to a lesser extent

meta-order) in a market with a linear temporary price impact (Kyle, 1985). We
endogenize the pressure to liquidate by introducing a downward drift in the
unaffected asset price while simultaneously ruling out short sales. In this
setting the liquidation time horizon becomes a stopping time determined
endogenously, as part of the optimal strategy. We find that the optimal
liquidation strategy is consistent with the square-root law which states that
the average price impact per share is proportional to the square root of the
size of the meta-order (Bershova and Rakhlin, 2013; Farmer et al., 2013; Donier
et al., 2015; T\'oth et al., 2016).
  Mathematically, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of our optimization
leads to a severely singular and numerically unstable ordinary differential
equation initial value problem. We provide careful analysis of related singular
mixed boundary value problems and devise a numerically stable computation
strategy by re-introducing time dimension into an otherwise time-homogeneous

programs emerging from optimal transport very efficiently. This was
accomplished by formulating a regularized version of the linear program as
Bregman projection problem onto the polytope of doubly-stochastic matrices, and
then computing the projection using the efficient Sinkhorn algorithm, which is
based on alternating closed-form Bregman projections on the larger polytopes of
row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices. In this paper we suggest a
generalization of this algorithm for solving a well-known lifted linear program
relaxations of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), which is known as the
Johnson Adams (JA) Relaxation. First, an efficient algorithm for Bregman
projection onto the JA polytope by alternating closed-form Bregman projections
onto one-sided local polytopes is devised. The one-sided polytopes can be seen
as a high-dimensional, generalized version of the row/column-stochastic
polytopes. Second, a new method for solving the original linear programs using
the Bregman projections onto the JA polytope is developed and shown to be more
accurate and numerically stable than the standard approach of driving the
regularizer to zero. The resulting algorithm is considerably more scalable than
standard linear solvers and is able to solve significantly larger linear
programs.

aleatoric uncertainty in regression tasks performed by artificial neural
networks. It is based on the simultaneous training of two neural networks with
a joint loss function and a specific hyperparameter $\lambda>0$ that allows for
automatically detecting noisy and clean regions in the input space and
controlling their {\em relative contribution} to the loss and its gradients.
After the model has been trained, one of the networks performs predictions and
the other quantifies the uncertainty of these predictions by estimating the
locally averaged loss of the first one. Unlike in many classical uncertainty
quantification methods, we do not assume any a priori knowledge of the ground
truth probability distribution, neither do we, in general, maximize the
likelihood of a chosen parametric family of distributions. We analyze the
learning process and the influence of clean and noisy regions of the input
space on the loss surface, depending on $\lambda$. In particular, we show that
small values of $\lambda$ increase the relative contribution of clean regions
to the loss and its gradients. This explains why choosing small $\lambda$
allows for better predictions compared with neural networks without uncertainty
counterparts and those based on classical likelihood maximization. Finally, we
demonstrate that one can naturally form ensembles of pairs of our networks and
thus capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty and avoid overfitting.

(established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property
of interest. Fingerprints may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the

joint spatial and Radon (projection) domain (JSR) image reconstruction
framework with a built-in weighting and re-weighting mechanism in Radon domain
to repair degraded projection data. The new weighting strategy used in the
proposed model not only makes the regularization in Radon domain by wavelet
frame transform more effective, but also makes the commonly assumed linear
model for CT imaging a more accurate approximation of the nonlinear physical
problem. The proposed model, which will be referred to as the re-weighted JSR
model, combines the ideas of the recently proposed wavelet frame based JSR
model \cite{Dong2013} and the normalized metal artifact reduction model
\cite{meyer2010normalized}, and manages to achieve noticeably better CT
reconstruction quality than both methods. To solve the proposed re-weighted JSR
model, an efficient alternative iteration algorithm is proposed with guaranteed
convergence. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real CT image data
demonstrate the effectiveness of the re-weighted JSR model and its advantage

In principle, the proposed MSCSL approach is capable of effectively capturing

intrinsic dependency relationships among these multi-scale correspondence

T}$ spectra and $v_2$ within the Blast-Wave model. The predictions are able to
reproduce the $v_2$ coefficient in the measured $p_{\rm T}$ range and the
transverse-momentum spectra for $p_{\rm T}>1.8$ GeV/$c$ within the experimental
uncertainties. The measurement of the coalescence parameter $B_2$ is performed,
showing a $p_{\rm T}$ dependence in contrast with the simplest coalescence
model, which fails to reproduce also the measured $v_2$ coefficient. In
addition, the coalescence parameter $B_2$ and the elliptic flow coefficient in
the 20-40% centrality interval are compared with the AMPT model which is able,
in its version without string melting, to reproduce the measured $v_2$($p_{\rm
T}$) and the $B_2$($p_{\rm T}$) trend.

fractional and deconfined quasiparticle excitations, referred to as spinons and
visons. Their fractional nature establishes topological properties such as a
protected ground-state degeneracy. This work investigates spin-orbit coupled
spin liquids where, additionally, topology enters via non-trivial band
structures of the spinons. We revisit the $Z_2$ spin-liquid phases that have
recently been identified in a projective symmetry-group analysis on the square
lattice when spin-rotation symmetry is maximally lifted [Phys. Rev. B 90,
174417 (2014)]. We find that in the case of nearest neighbor couplings only,
$Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice always exhibit trivial spinon bands.
Adding second neighbor terms, the simplest projective symmetry-group solution
closely resembles the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for topological insulators.
Assuming that the emergent gauge fields are static we investigate vison
excitations, which we confirm to be deconfined in all investigated spin phases.
Particularly, if the spinon bands are topological, the spinons and visons form
bound states consisting of several spinon-Majorana zero modes coupling to one
vison. The existence of such zero modes follows from an exact mapping between
these spin phases and topological $p+ip$ superconductors with vortices. We
propose experimental probes to detect such states in real materials.

the possibility to tune the fundamental resonance frequency to, in principle,
arbitrarily low values, and at the same time maintain a compact design of the

well-known expression for a simple pendulum. It is found that while the Roberts
linkage can provide strong seismic isolation due to a very low fundamental

the system. We argue that this is true for all horizontal mechanical isolation
systems with spring-antispring dynamics. This imposes strict requirements on

way to find maximal function fields is to find all subfields of a maximal

field, it is natural to find as many subfields of the Hermitian function field

automorphism groups of function fields when genus tends to infinity.
  Motivated by applications in coding and cryptography, we consider the maximum
size of abelian subgroups of the automorphism group
$\mbox{Aut}(F/\mathbb{F}_q)$ in terms of genus ${g_F}$ for a function field $F$
over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Although the whole group
$\mbox{Aut}(F/\mathbb{F}_q)$ could have size $\Omega({g_F}^4)$, the maximum
size $m_F$ of abelian subgroups of the automorphism group
$\mbox{Aut}(F/\mathbb{F}_q)$ is upper bounded by $4g_F+4$ for $g_F\ge 2$. In
the present paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of $m_F$ by defining
$M_q=\limsup_{{g_F}\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m_F \cdot \log_q m_F}{{g_F}}$, where
$F$ runs through all function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We show that $M_q$
lies between $2$ and $3$ (or $4$) for odd characteristic (or for even
characteristic, respectively). This means that $m_F$ grows much more slowly
than genus does asymptotically.
  The second part of this paper is to study the maximum size $b_F$ of subgroups
of $\mbox{Aut}(F/\mathbb{F}_q)$ whose order is coprime to $q$. The Hurwitz
bound gives an upper bound $b_F\le 84(g_F-1)$ for every function field
$F/\mathbb{F}_q$ of genus $g_F\ge 2$. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of
$b_F$ by defining ${B_q}=\limsup_{{g_F}\rightarrow\infty}\frac{b_F}{{g_F}}$,
where $F$ runs through all function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Although the
Hurwitz bound shows ${B_q}\le 84$, there are no lower bounds on $B_q$ in
literature. One does not even know if ${B_q}=0$. For the first time, we show
that ${B_q}\ge 2/3$ by explicitly constructing some towers of function fields

OECTs have been studied as aqueous sensors, specifically sensitive to the

features for the development of hydrazine sensors, such as a sensitivity down
to 10-5 M of hydrazine in water, an order of magnitude higher selectivity for
hydrazine than for 9 other water soluble common analytes, the capability to
recover entirely its base signal after water flushing and a very low voltage
operation. The specificity for hydrazine to be sensed by our OECTs is caused by
its catalytic oxidation at the gate electrode and enables increasing the output
current modulation of the devices. This has permitted the device-geometry study
of the whole series of 80 micrometric OECT devices with sub-20-nm PEDOT:PSS

the polarization effect, using the theory of Amic et al. (1997) to derive a
model prediction for the polarization coherent opposition effect at small
angles. Our extension is to assess the effect of circular polarized light, thus
completing exact derivation of the full M\""uller matrix for the semi infinite
slab of Rayleigh sized particles. We find the circular polarization peak is
narrower than the coherent backscattering intensity peak, and weaker in
intensity.

model (HOpS model), which is adaptive network model. The HOpS model admits to
identify the main attributes of dynamics on networks and to study analytically
the relation between topological network properties and processes taking place
on a network. Another key point of the HOpS model is the possibility to study
network dynamics via the novel parameter of heterogeneity. We show that not
only clear topological network properties, such as node degree, but also, the
nodes' status distribution (the factor of network heterogeneity) play an
important role in so-called opinion spreading and information diffusion on a
network. This model can be potentially used for studying the co-evolution of
globally aggregated or averaged key observables of the earth system. These
include natural variables such as atmospheric, oceanic and land carbon stocks,
as well as socio-economic quantities such as global human population, economic
production or wellbeing.

Explicitly Lorentz Invariant (STDELI) ${\cal S}^{'}_L$. In this paper we
overcome here such limitation and show that it can be generalized to all
aforementioned STDELI and obtain a product in a ring with zero divisors.
  For this purpose, we resort to a formula obtained in [Int. J. of Theor. Phys.
{\bf 43}, 1019 (2004)] and demonstrate the existence of the convolution (in
Minkowskian space) of such distributions. This is done by following a procedure
similar to that used so as to define a general convolution between the
Ultradistributions of J. Sebastiao e Silva [Math. Ann. {\bf 136}, 38 (1958)],
also known as Ultrahyperfunctions, obtained by Bollini et al. [Int. J. of
Theor. Phys. {\bf 38}, 2315 (1999), {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004), {\bf 43}, 59
(2004),{\bf 46}, 3030 (2007)]. Using the Inverse Fourier Transform we get the
ring with zero divisors ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}$, defined as ${\cal
S}^{'}_{LA}={\cal F}^{-1}\{{\cal S}^{'}_L\}$, where ${\cal F}^{-1}$ denotes the
Inverse Fourier Transform. In this manner we effect a dimensional
regularization in momentum space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{L}$) via convolution,
and a product of distributions in the corresponding configuration space (the
ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA})$. This generalizes the results obtained by Bollini and
Giambiagi for Euclidean space in [Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996)].
  We provide several examples of the application of our new results in Quantum
Field Theory. In particular, the convolution of $n$ massless Feynman
propagators and the convolution of n massless Wheeler propagators in
Minkowskian space.

enhancing the effectiveness of photocatalytic and biomedical nanomaterials.
Herein, the immobilization of monodispersed silicon dioxide (SiO2)
nanoparticles on multiple graphene layers is demonstrated for intercalation of
graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Interestingly, the loading of graphene
nanoplatelets with SiO2 nanoparticles enhances the photocatalytic efficiency
from 46% to 99%. For biomedical applications, it is found that 75% of Gram
positive and 50% of Gram negative bacteria have been killed, hence bacterial
proliferation is significantly restricted. Further, the cytotoxicity study
reveals that the synthesised nanocomposites are non-toxic for both normal
(HCEC) and cancerous (MCF-7, HEp-2) cell lines which signifies their potential
as carriers for drug delivery. The prepared nanocomposites with controlled
amount of carbon in the form of graphene can be employed for photocatalysis
based waste water remediation, biomedicine and nano drug delivery

materials. For electron transport junctions it is natural to characterize the
materials by their conductance length dependence, $\beta$. Theoretical
estimations of $\beta$ are made employing two primary theories: complex band
structure and DFT-NEGF Landauer transport. Both reveal information on $\beta$
of individual states; i.e. complex Bloch waves and transmission eigenchannels,
respectively. However, it is unclear how the $\beta$-values of the two
approaches compare. Here, we present calculations of decay constants for the
two most conductive states as determined by complex band structure and standard
DFT-NEGF transport calculations for two molecular and one semi-conductor
junctions. Despite the different nature of the two methods, we find strong
agreement of the calculated decay constants for the molecular junctions while
the semi-conductor junction shows some discrepancies. The results presented
here provide a template for studying the intrinsic, channel resolved length
dependence of the junction through complex band structure of the central
material in the heterogeneous nano-scale junction.

endogenous ligand found in the human serum albumin (HSA) of renal failure
patients. It gets accumulated in the HSA and its concentration in sera of
patients may reflect the chronicity of renal failure [1-4]. It is considered
uremic toxin due to its damaging effect on the renal cells. The high
concentrations of CMPF inhibit the binding of other ligands to HSA. Removal of
CMPF is difficult through conventional hemodialysis due to its strong binding
affinity. We hypothesized that the competitive inhibition may be helpful in
removal of CMPF binding to HSA. A compound with higher HSA binding affinity
than CMPF could be useful to prevent CMPF from binding so that CMPF could be
excreted by the body through the urine. We studied an active compound
dihydrothymoquinone/ dithymoquinone (DTQ) found in black cumin seed (Nigella
sativa), which has higher binding affinity for HSA. Molecular docking
simulations were performed to find the binding affinity of CMPF and DTQ with
HSA. DTQ was found to have higher binding affinity possessing more interactions
with the binding residues than the CMPF. We studied the binding pocket
flexibility of CMPF and DTQ to analyze the binding abilities of both the
compounds. We have also predicted the ADME properties for DTQ which shows
higher lipophilicity, higher gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, and blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability. We discovered that DTQ has potential to act as an
inhibitor of CMPF and can be considered as a candidate for the formation of the
therapeutic drug against CMPF.
