Cayley-Dickson doubling products. A Cayley-Dickson algebra $\cda{N+1}$ of
dimension $2^{N+1}$ consists of all ordered pairs of elements of a
Cayley-Dickson algebra $\cda{N}$ of dimension $2^N$ where the product
$(a,b)(c,d)$ of elements of $\cda{N+1}$ is defined in terms of a pair of second
degree binomials $\left(f(a,b,c,d),g(a,b,c,d)\right)$ satisfying certain
properties. The polynomial pair$(f,g)$ is called a `doubling product.' While
$\cda{0}$ may denote any ring, here it is taken to be the set $\mathbb{R}$ of
real numbers. The binomials $f$ and $g$ should be devised such that
$\cda{1}=\mathbb{C}$ the complex numbers, $\cda{2}=\mathbb{H}$ the quaternions,

used different yet equivalent doubling products.

to the complexity and multiformity of ground objects in high-resolution remote

image retrieval and provide a comprehensive review on existing methods.
Furthermore, for the goal to advance the state-of-the-art in HRRS image
retrieval, we focus on the feature extraction issue and delve how to use
powerful deep representations to address this task. We conduct systematic
investigation on evaluating correlative factors that may affect the performance
of deep features. By optimizing each factor, we acquire remarkable retrieval
results on publicly available HRRS datasets. Finally, we explain the

in current network science and the hyperbolic space is one of the most studied,

random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong
clustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce
an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community
organization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently
developed to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by
forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have variable level
of attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be
explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real
applications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model that,
differently from GPA, forces heterogeneous angular node attractiveness by
sampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability
distribution, for instance a mixture of Gaussians. The nPSO differs from GPA in
other three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of
communities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network
temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After
several tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate
networks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a
realistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link
prediction.

rate as the barrier parameter $\mu$ ensures the Lagrange multiplier sequence
remains bounded, provided the limit point of the primal sequence has a Lagrange
multiplier. This result does not require constraint qualifications. We also
guarantee the IPM finds a solution satisfying strict complementarity if one
exists. On the other hand, if the primal feasibility is reduced too slowly,
then the algorithm converges to a point of minimal complementarity; if the
primal feasibility is reduced too quickly and the set of Lagrange multipliers
is unbounded, then the norm of the Lagrange multiplier tends to infinity.
  Our theory has important implications for the design of IPMs. Specifically,
we show that IPOPT, an algorithm that does not carefully control primal
feasibility has practical issues with the dual multipliers values growing to
unnecessarily large values. Conversely, the one-phase IPM of
\citet*{hinder2018one}, an algorithm that controls primal feasibility as our

obtain a symmetric bounce condition which can be satisfied by a slight
modification in the construction of loops over which holonomies are considered

quantization ambiguities, and are demonstrated in three different flavors which
all lead to a non-singular black to white hole transition with identical

purchase of demand reductions from a fixed group of residential electricity

wholesale energy market. The aggregator procures reductions in demand by
offering its customers a uniform price for reductions in consumption relative
to their predetermined baselines. Prior to its realization of the aggregate
demand reduction, the aggregator must also determine how much energy to sell
into the two-settlement energy market. In the day-ahead market, the aggregator
commits to a forward contract, which calls for the delivery of energy in the
real-time market. The underlying aggregate demand curve, which relates the
aggregate demand reduction to the aggregator's offered price, is assumed to be
affine and subject to unobservable, random shocks. Assuming that both the
parameters of the demand curve and the distribution of the random shocks are
initially unknown to the aggregator, we investigate the extent to which the
aggregator might dynamically adapt its offered prices and forward contracts to
maximize its expected profit over a time window of $T$ days. Specifically, we
design a dynamic pricing and contract offering policy that resolves the
aggregator's need to learn the unknown demand model with its desire to maximize
its cumulative expected profit over time. In particular, the proposed pricing
policy is proven to incur a regret over $T$ days that is no greater than
$O(\log(T)\sqrt{T})$.

Specifically, our approach first extracts a sequence of context words that
indicates the temporal relation between two events, which well align with the
dependency path between two event mentions. The context word sequence, together
with a parts-of-speech tag sequence and a dependency relation sequence that are
generated corresponding to the word sequence, are then provided as input to
bidirectional recurrent neural network (LSTM) models. The neural nets learn
compositional syntactic and semantic representations of contexts surrounding
the two events and predict the temporal relation between them. Evaluation of
the proposed approach on TimeBank corpus shows that sequential modeling is
capable of accurately recognizing temporal relations between events, which
outperforms a neural net model using various discrete features as input that

role in quantum physics and other scientific and engineering applications. In
order to resolve local features and to obtain converged results, typically the
number of degrees of freedom needed is much larger than the rank of the
spectral projector. This leads to significant cost in terms of both computation
and storage. In this paper, we develop a method to construct a basis set that
is adaptive to the given differential operator. The basis set is systematically
improvable, and the local features of the projector is built into the basis
set. As a result the required number of degrees of freedom is only a small
constant times the rank of the projector. The construction of the basis set
uses a randomized procedure, and only requires applying the differential
operator to a small number of vectors on the global domain, while each basis
function itself is supported on strictly local domains and is discontinuous
across the global domain. The spectral projector on the global domain is
systematically approximated from such a basis set using the discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) method. The global construction procedure is very flexible, and
allows a local basis set to be consistently constructed even if the operator
contains a nonlocal potential term. We verify the effectiveness of the globally
constructed adaptive local basis set using one-, two- and three-dimensional
linear problems with local potentials, as well as a one dimensional nonlinear
problem with nonlocal potentials resembling the Hartree-Fock problem in quantum
physics.

superconductor are shown to have significant differences, when they are applied
to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov state of Weyl metals. In the first approach the
pairing term is restricted by a cutoff energy to the neighborhood of the Fermi
surface, whereas in the second approach the pairing term is extended to the
whole Brillouin zone. We explore their difference by considering two minimal
models for the Weyl metal. For a model giving a single pair of Weyl pockets,
both two approaches give a partly-gapped (fully-gapped) bulk spectrum for small
(large) pairing amplitude. However, for very small cutoff energy, a portion of
the Fermi surface can be completely unaffected by the pairing term in the first
approach. For the other model giving two pairs of Weyl pockets, while the bulk
spectrum for the first approach can be fully gapped, the one from the second
approach has a robust line node, and the surface states are also changed
qualitatively by the pairing. We elucidate the above differences by topological
arguments and analytical analyses. A factor common to both of the two models is
the tilting of the Weyl cones which leads to asymmetric normal state band
structure with respect to the Weyl nodes. For the Weyl metal with two pairs of
Weyl pockets, the band folding leads to a double degeneracy in the effective
model, which distinguishes the pairing of the second approach from all others.

the lack of convergence guarantees when the function considered is not strictly

  More precisely, in Part I an exact characterization is provided to the
asymptotic behaviour of unconstrained gradient dynamics. We also show that when
convergence to a saddle point is not guaranteed then the system behaviour can
be problematic, with arbitrarily small noise leading to an unbounded variance.
In Part II we consider a general class of subgradient dynamics that restrict
trajectories in an arbitrary convex domain, and show that when an equilibrium
point exists their limiting trajectories are solutions of subgradient dynamics
on only affine subspaces. The latter is a smooth class of dynamics with an

asymmetric simple exclusion process with respect to the stationary distribution
(also known as the steady state), as a stochastic process indexed by $[0,1]$.
In three phases of the model and their boundaries within the fan region, we
establish a complete picture of the scaling limits of the fluctuations of the
density as the number of sites goes to infinity. In the maximal current phase,
the limit fluctuation is the sum of two independent processes, a Brownian
motion and a Brownian excursion. This extends an earlier result by Derrida et
al. (2004) for totally asymmetric simple exclusion process in the same phase.
In the low/high density phases, the limit fluctuations are Brownian motion.
Most interestingly, at the boundary of the maximal current phase, the limit
fluctuation is the sum of two independent processes, a Brownian motion and a
Brownian meander (or a time-reversal of the latter, depending on the side of
the boundary). Our proofs rely on a representation of the joint generating
function of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with respect to the
stationary distribution in terms of joint moments of a Markov processes, which
is constructed from orthogonality measures of the Askey--Wilson polynomials.

expected to depend on frequency not only via the scattering time but also via
the effective mass, which acquires a singular frequency dependence near a QCP.
We check this assertion by computing diagrammatically the optical conductivity,
$\sigma' (\Omega)$, near both nematic and spin-density wave (SDW) quantum
critical points (QCPs) in 2D. If renormalization of current vertices is not
taken into account, $\sigma' (\Omega)$ is expressed via the quasiparticle
residue $Z$ (equal to the ratio of bare and renormalized masses in our
approximation) and transport scattering rate $\gamma_{\text{tr}}$ as $\sigma'
(\Omega)\propto Z^2 \gamma_{\text{tr}}/\Omega^2$. For a nematic QCP
($\gamma_{\text{tr}}\propto\Omega^{4/3}$ and $Z\propto\Omega^{1/3}$), this
formula suggests that $\sigma'(\Omega)$ would tend to a constant at $\Omega \to
0$. We explicitly demonstrate that the actual behavior of $\sigma' (\Omega)$ is
different due to strong renormalization of the current vertices, which cancels
out a factor of $Z^2$. As a result, $\sigma' (\Omega)$ diverges as
$1/\Omega^{2/3}$, as earlier works conjectured. In the SDW case, we consider
two contributions to the conductivity: from hot spots and from""lukewarm""
regions of the Fermi surface. The hot-spot contribution is not affected by
vertex renormalization, but it is subleading to the lukewarm one. For the
latter, we argue that a factor of $Z^2$ is again cancelled by vertex
corrections. As a result, $\sigma' (\Omega)$ at a SDW QCP scales as $1/\Omega$
down to the lowest frequencies.

entropies. Holographically there is an entanglement plateau in the BTZ black
hole background, which means that there exists a critical length such that when
$\ell \leq \ell_c$ the inequality saturates $\Delta S=0$. In thermal AdS
background, the holographic entanglement entropy leads to $\Delta S=0$ for
arbitrary $\ell$. We compute the next-to-leading order contributions to $\Delta
S$ in the large central charge CFT at both high and low temperatures. In both

magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate supercritical accretion onto a

dipole fields is $10^{10}$ G on the star surface. We found the supercritical
accretion flow consists of two parts; the accretion columns and the truncated
accretion disk. The supercritical accretion disk, which appears far from the
neutron star, is truncated at around $\sim 3R_*$ ($R_*=10^6$ cm is the neutron
star radius), where the magnetic pressure via the dipole magnetic fields
balances with the radiation pressure of the disks. The angular momentum of the
disk around the truncation radius is effectively transported inward through
magnetic torque by dipole fields, inducing the spin up of a neutron star. The
evaluated spin up rate, $\sim -10^{-11}$ s s$^{-1}$, is consistent with the
recent observations of the ultra luminous X-ray pulsars. Within the truncation
radius, the gas falls onto neutron star along dipole fields, which results in a
formation of accretion columns onto north and south hemispheres. The net
accretion rate and the luminosity of the column are $\sim 66L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$

limited by the acoustic diffraction limit. In this work, taking inspiration
from super-resolution imaging techniques developed to beat the optical
diffraction limit, we demonstrate that the localization of individual optical
absorbers can provide super-resolution photoacoustic imaging well beyond the
acoustic diffraction limit. As a proof-of-principle experiment, photoacoustic
cross-sectional images of microfluidic channels were obtained with a 15 MHz
linear CMUT array while absorbing beads were flown through the channels. The
localization of individual absorbers allowed to obtain super-resolved
cross-sectional image of the channels, by reconstructing both the channel width
and position with an accuracy better than $\lambda/10$. Given the discrete
nature of endogenous absorbers such as red blood cells, or that of exogenous
particular contrast agents, localization is a promising approach to push the
current resolution limits of photoacoustic imaging.

importance for computer network analytics. Several methods have been proposed

community graph model. This model is formed by adding new vertices, and
randomly attaching them to the existing nodes. It is a dynamic extension of the
well-known stochastic blockmodel. The goal of the work is to detect the time at
which the graph dynamics switches from a normal evolution -- where balanced
communities grow at the same rate -- to an abnormal behavior -- where
communities start merging. In order to circumvent the problem of decomposing
each graph into communities, we use a metric to quantify changes in the graph
topology as a function of time. The detection of anomalies becomes one of
testing the hypothesis that the graph is undergoing a significant structural
change. In addition the the theoretical analysis of the test statistic, we
perform Monte Carlo simulations of our dynamic graph model to demonstrate that

of a mean-field-type non-stoquastic Hamiltonian by a semi-classical analysis.
The fully connected mean-field model with $p$-body ferromagnetic interactions
under a transverse field has a first-order quantum phase transition for $p\ge
3$. This first-order transition is known to be reduced to second order for
$p\ge 5$ by an introduction of antiferromagnetic transverse interactions, which
makes the Hamiltonian non-stoquastic. This reduction of the order of transition
means an exponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic processes
because the first-order transition is shown to have an exponentially small
energy gap whereas the second order case does not. We apply a semi-classical
method to analytically derive the explicit expression of the rate of the
exponential decay of the energy gap at first-order transitions. The result
reveals how the property of first-order transition changes as a function of the
system parameters. We also derive the exact closed-form expression for the
critical point where the first-order transition line disappears within the
ferromagnetic phase. These results help us understand how the antiferromagnetic
transverse interactions affect the performance of quantum annealing by
controlling the effects of non-stoquasticity in the Hamiltonian.

on the integration-through-transients (ITT) formalism and hence provides a
starting point for the calculation of non-equilibrium averages in
active-Brownian particle systems. The ABP are characterized by a
self-propulsion velocity $v_0$, and by their translational and rotational
diffusion coefficients, $D_t$ and $D_r$. The theory treats both the
translational and the orientational degrees of freedom of ABP explicitly. This
allows to study the effect of self-propulsion of both weak and strong
persistence of the swimming direction, also at high densities where the
persistence length $\ell_p=v_0/D_r$ is large compared to the typical
interaction length scale. While the low-density dynamics of ABP is
characterized by a single P\'eclet number, $Pe=v_0^2/D_rD_t$, close to the
glass transition the dynamics is found to depend on $Pe$ and $\ell_p$
separately. At fixed density, increasing the self-propulsion velocity causes
structural relaxatino to speed up, while decreasing the persistence length
slows down the relaxation. The theory predicts a non-trivial
idealized-glass-transition diagram in the three-dimensional parameter space of
density, self-propulsion velocity and rotational diffusivity. The active-MCT
glass is a nonergodic state where correlations of initial density fluctuations

Certain flow velocities may bring about a bounded-response instability in the

theory of {\em large deflections} and utilize a piston-theoretic approximation
of the flow for appropriate parameters, yielding a nonlinear

We account for rotational inertia effects in the beam and discuss technical

  We demonstrate nonlinear semigroup well-posedness of the model with the
rotational inertia terms. For the case with no rotational inertia, we utilize a
Galerkin approach to establish existence of weak, possibly non-unique,

focus on defining two distinct types of adopters: innovator/early adopters and
imitators. LCCMs allow for heterogeneity in the utility of adoption for the
various market segments i.e. innovators/early adopters, imitators and
non-adopters. We make use of revealed preference (RP) time series data from a
one-way carsharing system in a major city in the United States to estimate
model parameters. The data entails a complete set of member enrollment for the
carsharing service for a time period of 2.5 years after being launched.
Consistent with the technology diffusion literature, our model identifies three
latent classes whose utility of adoption have a well-defined set of preferences
that are significant and behaviorally consistent. The technology adoption model
predicts the probability that a certain individual will adopt the service at a
certain time period, and is explained by social influences, network effect,
socio-demographics and level-of-service attributes. Finally, the model was
calibrated and then used to forecast adoption of the carsharing system for
potential investment strategy scenarios.

in mergers with variety of mass ratios, inclinations, orbits, galaxy structures

merger-driven SF using the burst efficiency parameter introduced by Cox et al.
We confirm the previous studies that, in galaxy mergers, AGN suppresses SF more
efficiently than in isolated galaxies. However, we additionally find that the
effect of AGNs on SF is larger in major mergers than in minor mergers. In minor
merger simulations with different primary bulge-to-total ratios, the effect of
bulge fraction on the merger-driven SF decreases due to AGN feedback. We create
models of Sa, Sb and Sc type galaxies and compare their SF properties while
undergoing mergers. With the current AGN prescriptions, the difference in

global map to solve the problem of over coming a long cul-de-sac. However, due
to errors induced from local and global drift, it is highly challenging to
maintain such a map for long periods of time. One way to mitigate this problem
is by using learning techniques that do not rely on hand engineered map
representations and instead output appropriate control policies directly from
their sensory input. We first demonstrate that such a problem cannot be solved
directly by deep reinforcement learning due to the sparse reward structure of
the environment. Further, we demonstrate that deep supervised learning also
cannot be used directly to solve this problem. We then investigate network
models that offer a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised
learning and highlight the significance of adding fully differentiable memory

astrophysics, the companions of the exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO
WDs) are still not completely identified. It has been suggested recently that a
He-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN
Ia. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock
compression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell
might lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few
binary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario
of a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to
systematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of
SNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We
performed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties
of SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley
rapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different
metallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found
that no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD
and a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.
This scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long
delay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and
a He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and
cover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from
this scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities.

The accuracy of Jarzynski's measurement scheme was known to be determined by
the variance of exponential work, denoted as ${\rm var}\left(e^{-\beta

processing applications. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved
significant successes for image classification, texture classification remains
a difficult problem since textures usually do not contain enough information
regarding the shape of object. In image processing, texture classification has
been traditionally studied well with spectral analyses which exploit repeated
structures in many textures. Since CNNs process images as-is in the spatial
domain whereas spectral analyses process images in the frequency domain, these
models have different characteristics in terms of performance. We propose a
novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which integrates a spectral analysis into
CNNs. Our insight is that the pooling layer and the convolution layer can be
viewed as a limited form of a spectral analysis. Based on this insight, we
generalize both layers to perform a spectral analysis with wavelet transform.
Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is lost in
conventional CNNs but useful in texture classification. The experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves better accuracy in texture classification
than existing models. We also show that our model has significantly fewer

resolve the apparent contradiction. We measure the field distribution across
the width of 2G high-Tc superconducting tapes as the transport current is
increased to Ic. We identify a threshold current, Ic_surfB, at which two
physical events occur simultaneously: (i) an abrupt crossover from non-linear

function of transport current measured at any point on the superconductor

Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) and macro-actions (MAs). Dec-POMDPs provide a
general framework for cooperative sequential decision making under uncertainty
and MAs allow temporally extended and asynchronous action execution. To date,
most methods assume the underlying Dec-POMDP model is known a priori or a full
simulator is available during planning time. Previous methods which aim to
address these issues suffer from local optimality and sensitivity to initial
conditions. Additionally, few hardware demonstrations involving a large team of
heterogeneous robots and with long planning horizons exist. This work addresses
these gaps by proposing an iterative sampling based Expectation-Maximization
algorithm (iSEM) to learn polices using only trajectory data containing
observations, MAs, and rewards. Our experiments show the algorithm is able to
achieve better solution quality than the state-of-the-art learning-based

retransmission opportunities are available. Each device chooses a pilot
sequence from a predetermined set as its signature and transmits its selected
pilot and data simultaneously. A collision occurs when two or more devices
choose the same pilot sequence. Collisions are treated as interference to the
remaining received signals. We consider successive joint decoding (SJD) and
successive interference cancellation (SIC) under a Rayleigh fading and path
loss channel model. We first derive the expression for the outage probability
for the case where devices transmit at the same fixed rate. Then, we derive the
expression for the maximum achievable throughput for the case where devices
transmit with rateless codes. Thus, their code rate is adaptive to the system
conditions, i.e., load, received powers, and interference. Numerical results
verify the accuracy of our analytical expressions. For low data rate
transmissions, results show that SIC performs close to that of SJD in terms of
outage probability for packet arrival rates up to 10 packets per slot. However,
SJD can achieve almost double the throughput of SIC and is, thus, far more
superior.

vibrational analyses based on quantum mechanical calculations of 153 organic
molecules, including both pure aromatic molecules and molecules with mixed
aromatic/olefinic/aliphatic hydridizations. We find that many of the C-H
stretching vibrational modes in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules
are coupled. Even considering the un-coupled modes only, the correlation

describe any kind of nuclear shape. The quadrupole and octupole deformed nuclei
appear in the mass region with characteristic neutron and proton numbers which

huge collections of data. In order to scale, they distribute query processing
among many nodes, where each node holds and searches over a subset of the index
called shard. Responses from some nodes occasionally fail to arrive within a
reasonable time-interval due to various reasons, such as high server load and
network congestion. Search engines typically need to respond in a timely
manner, and therefore skip such tail latency responses, which causes
degradation in search quality. In this paper, we tackle response misses due to
high tail latencies with the goal of maximizing search quality.
  Search providers today use redundancy in the form of Replication for
mitigating response misses, by constructing multiple copies of each shard and
searching all replicas. This approach is not ideal, as it wastes resources on
searching duplicate data. We propose two strategies to reduce this waste.
First, we propose rSmartRed, an optimal shard selection scheme for replicated
indexes. Second, when feasible, we propose to replace Replication with
Repartition, which constructs independent index instances instead of exact
copies. We analytically prove that rSmartRed's selection is optimal for
Replication, and that Repartition achieves better search quality compared to
Replication. We confirm our results with an empirical study using two
real-world datasets, showing that rSmartRed improves recall compared to
currently used approaches. We additionally show that Repartition improves over
Replication in typical scenarios.

The primary design goal is to maximize the sum rate of all secondary users
(SUs) subject to the minimum rate requirement for all SUs, the transmit power
constraint at the secondary BS, and the interference power constraints at all
primary users. The original problem is difficult to solve since it is highly
nonconvex. We first convert the problem into a more tractable form, then arrive
at a convex program based on an inner approximation framework, and finally
propose a new algorithm to successively solve this convex program. We prove
that the proposed algorithm iteratively improves the objective while
guaranteeing convergence at least to local optima. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reaches a stationary point after only a
few iterations with a substantial performance improvement over existing

decays algebraically, using the method developed in [Ann. Probab.,

The Hurst parameter is determined by the correlation exponent of the random

applications such as blood vessel detection in medical images, segmentation of
rivers or roads in aerial images, detection of cracks in walls or pavements,
etc. In this paper we present trainable B-COSFIRE filters, which are a model of
some neurons in area V1 of the primary visual cortex, and apply it to the
delineation of line patterns in different kinds of images. B-COSFIRE filters
are trainable as their selectivity is determined in an automatic configuration
process given a prototype pattern of interest. They are configurable to detect
any preferred line structure (e.g. segments, corners, cross-overs, etc.), so
usable for automatic data representation learning. We carried out experiments
on two data sets, namely a line-network data set from INRIA and a data set of
retinal fundus images named IOSTAR. The results that we achieved confirm the
robustness of the proposed approach and its effectiveness in the delineation of
line structures in different kinds of images.

order of one chord), with moderate Reynolds numbers and reduced frequencies of
order 1, varying the mean pitch angle and the phase shift between the pitching

(viscous effects) to the aerodynamic force is negligible compared to the
contributions from the body motion (fluid inertia) and the vorticity within the
flow (circulation). For the range of parameters considered here, the latter
tends to be instantaneously oriented in the direction normal to the chord of
the airfoil. Based on the results discussed in the paper, a reduced order model
for the instantaneous aerodynamic force is proposed, taking advantage of the
force decomposition and the chord-normal orientation of the contribution from
vorticity within the flow to the total aerodynamic force. The predictions of
the proposed model are compared to those of a similar model from the

with probabilistically triggered arms (PTAs). Under the assumption that the arm
triggering probabilities (ATPs) are positive for all arms, we prove that a
class of upper confidence bound (UCB) policies, named Combinatorial UCB with
exploration rate $\kappa$ (CUCB-$\kappa$), and Combinatorial Thompson Sampling
(CTS), which estimates the expected states of the arms via Thompson sampling,
achieve bounded regret. In addition, we prove that CUCB-$0$ and CTS incur
$O(\sqrt{T})$ gap-independent regret. These results improve the results in
previous works, which show $O(\log T)$ gap-dependent and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$
gap-independent regrets, respectively, under no assumptions on the ATPs. Then,
we numerically evaluate the performance of CUCB-$\kappa$ and CTS in a
real-world movie recommendation problem, where the actions correspond to
recommending a set of movies, the arms correspond to the edges between the
movies and the users, and the goal is to maximize the total number of users
that are attracted by at least one movie. Our numerical results complement our
theoretical findings on bounded regret. Apart from this problem, our results
also directly apply to the online influence maximization (OIM) problem studied

Haversian system in mammals, there are few studies conducted on bones from
non-mammalian species. The objective of the current study was to investigate
the existence of the typical Haversian system in compact bones from reptiles
and birds. Materials and Methods: Femora were collected from geckos, Nile
monitors, sparrows, ducks and geese. Samples were then, fixed in 10%
paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin or Von Kossa and then examined using light microscopy.
Results: The current study showed different histological structures of compact
bones from studied species and an absence of the typical Haversian system seen
in mammals. The compact bone of geckos was mostly avascular, while Nile monitor
bone was highly vascular. Sparrow bone showed one side vascular and the other
side avascular. The vascularity was represented by primary vascular canals
surrounded by a few irregularly arranged osteocytes inside their lacunae
forming primary osteons. Bone tissue from ducks and geese were similar and were
composed mostly of dense Haversian tissue, while some areas had primary
osteons. Conclusion: The compact bone microstructure in some reptile and bird
species lack the typical Haversian system described in mammals. This will be of
a great importance in developing a better understanding of long bone anatomy

absorbing sightlines. Here, we report ALMA observations of CH+ and SH+, and of
their 13C- and 34S- isotopologues, as potential tracers of energetic processes
in the interstellar medium. CH+ and 13CH+ are detected toward both images of
PKS1830-211, CH+ showing the deepest and broadest absorption among all species
observed so far. The [CH+]/[13CH+] abundance ratio is ~100 in the south-west
line of sight. [...] Toward the north-east image, we find an even larger value
of [CH+]/[13CH+], 146 +/- 43, although with a large uncertainty. This sightline
intercepts the absorber at a larger galactocentric radius than the southwestern
one, where material might be less processed in stellar nucleosynthesis. In
contrast to CH+ and its 13C isotopologue, SH+ and 34SH+ are only detected on
the south-west sightline. These are the first detections of extragalactic SH+
and interstellar 34SH+. The spectroscopic parameters of SH+ are reevaluated and
improved rest frequencies of 34SH+ are obtained. The [CH+]/[SH+] column density
ratios show a large difference between the two lines of sight: ~25 and >600
toward the SW and NE image, respectively. We are not able to shed light on the
formation process of CH+ and SH+ with these data, but the differences in the
two sightlines toward PKS1830-211 suggest that their absorptions arise from gas
with molecular fraction gtrsim 10%, with SH+ tracing significantly higher
molecular fractions than CH+.

breakdown of Scallop theorem in the case of one-hinge swimmer or
two-dimensional scallop at low Reynolds number. To model a one-hinge artificial

flexibility in the arms, the time reversal symmetry breaks in the case of the
one-hinged swimmer without the presence of a head contrary to the one-armed
super paramagnetic swimmer which required a passive head in order to swim. The
reduced velocity of the swimmer is studied using a range of parameters like

closest known massive young stellar object Orion Source I observed at 86 GHz
(3mm) with the VLBA. These images have high spatial (~0.3 mas) and spectral
(~0.054 km/s) resolutions. We find that the 3mm masers lie in an X-shaped locus
consisting of four arms, with blue-shifted emission in the south and east arms
and red-shifted emission in the north and west arms. Comparisons with previous
images of the 28SiO v=1,2, J=1-0 transitions at 7mm (observed in 2001-2002)
show that the bulk of the J=2-1 transition emission follows the streamlines of
the J=1-0 emission and exhibits an overall velocity gradient consistent with
the gradient at 7mm. While there is spatial overlap between the 3mm and 7mm
transitions, the 3mm emission, on average, lies at larger projected distances
from Source I (~44 AU compared with ~35 AU for 7mm). The spatial overlap
between the v=1, J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions is suggestive of a range of
temperatures and densities where physical conditions are favorable for both
transitions of a same vibrational state. However, the observed spatial offset
between the bulk of emission at 3mm and 7mm possibly indicates different ranges
of temperatures and densities for optimal excitation of the masers. We discuss
different maser pumping models that may explain the observed offset. We
interpret the 3mm and 7mm masers as being part of a single wide-angle outflow
arising from the surface of an edge-on disk rotating about a
northeast-southwest axis, with a continuous velocity gradient indicative of
differential rotation consistent with a Keplerian profile in a high-mass
proto-binary.

a promising new approach to protein engineering. In these experiments,
libraries of mutant genotypes are randomly distributed and expressed in
microscopic compartments - droplets of an emulsion. The selection of desirable
variants is performed according to the phenotype of each compartment. The
random partitioning leads to a fraction of compartments receiving more than one
genotype making the whole process a lab implementation of the group selection.
From a practical point of view (where efficient selection is typically sought),
it is important to know the impact of the increase in the mean occupancy of
compartments on the selection efficiency. We carried out a theoretical
investigation of this problem in the context of selection dynamics for an
infinite non-mutating subdivided population that randomly colonizes an infinite
number of patches (compartments) at each reproduction cycle. We derive here an
update equation for any distribution of phenotypes and any value of the mean
occupancy. Using this result, we demonstrate that, for the linear additive
fitness, the best genotype is still selected regardless of the mean occupancy.
Furthermore, the selection process is remarkably resilient to the presence of
multiple genotypes per compartments, and slows down approximately inversely
proportional to the mean occupancy at high values. We extend out results to
more general expressions that cover nonadditive and non-linear fitnesses, as
well non-Poissonian distribution among compartments. Our conclusions may also
apply to natural genetic compartmentalized replicators, such as viruses or
early trans-acting RNA replicators.

time-varying network-induced delays, packet dropouts and packet disorder in a
Networked Control System. Slow-rate sensing enables to achieve energy saving by
reducing network load. In addition, choosing a slower sensing period than the
longest round-trip time delay can avoid packet disorder. On the other hand, a
slow-rate sensing usually degrades control performance in a conventional
control framework. Therefore, including dual-rate control techniques can be
useful to maintain the desired performance, since the controller is able to
generate a fast-rate control signal from a slow-rate sensing signal. A
dual-rate PID controller is used, which can be split into two parts: a
slow-rate PI controller is located at the remote side (with no permanent
communication to the plant) and a fast-rate PD controller, at the local side
(close to the plant, sensor, and inside the actuator, which can offer a low
computation power). In addition, at the remote side, where a powerful
computation device is located, a prediction stage is included in order to
generate the packet of future, estimated slow-rate control actions to be sent
to the local side. At this side, these actions are converted to fast-rate ones
and used when a packet does not arrive due to the network-induced delay or due
to occurring dropouts. The control proposal is able to reach the nominal
(no-dropout, no-delay) performance despite the existence of time-varying delays
and packet dropouts. Via real-time control for a Cartesian robot, results
clearly reveal the superiority of the control approach compared to a previous
authors\' proposal, where the time-varying delays are faced by means of a gain
scheduling control strategy.

this paper we studied the pulsar glitches in a strangeon star model. Strangeon
stars would be solidified during cooling, and the solid stars would be natural
to have glitches as the result of starquakes. Based on the starquake model
established before, we proposed that when the starquake occurs, the inner
motion of the star which changes the moment of inertia and has impact on the
glitch sizes, is divided into plastic flow and elastic motion. The plastic flow
which is induced in the fractured part of the outer layer, would move
tangentially to redistribute the matter of the star and would be hard to
recover. The elastic motion, on the other hand, changes its shape and would
recover significantly. Under this scenario, we could understand the behaviors
of glitches without significant energy releasing, including the Crab and the
Vela pulsars, in an uniform model. We derive the recovery coefficient as a
function of glitch size, as well as the time interval between two successive

a metallicity range from [Fe/H] $\simeq -0.09$ to $0.32$. The parameters
describing the granulation activity of these stars and their
$\nu_\mathrm{max}$, are studied by considering the different masses,
metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages. We derive new scaling relations
for the granulation activity, re-calibrate existing ones, and identify the best
scaling relations from the available set of observations. We adopted the
Bayesian code DIAMONDS for the analysis of the background signal in the Fourier
spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model
comparison to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in
the literature. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the
amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that
induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the
metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the
phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that
of mass. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and
meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward
longer periods.

Counting (ARC), enables large-scale data sharing by admitting up to $2^{32}-2$

advanced RMW-based approach which is limited to 58 readers. Further, ARC avoids
multiple copies of the register content when accessing it---this affects
classical register's algorithms based on atomic read/write operations on single
words. Thus it allows for higher scalability with respect to the register size.
Moreover, ARC explicitly reduces improves performance via a proper limitation
of RMW instructions in case of read operations, and by supporting constant time
for read operations and amortized constant time for write operations. A proof
of correctness of our register algorithm is also provided, together with
experimental data for a comparison with literature proposals. Beyond assessing
ARC on physical platforms, we carry out as well an experimentation on
virtualized infrastructures, which shows the resilience of wait-free

a one to two orders of magnitude change in spontaneous emission time occurs due
to two distinct mechanisms: (A) Change in wave function symmetry, where within
the direct bandgap regime, strain changes the symmetry of wave functions, which
in turn leads to a large change of optical dipole matrix element. (B) Direct to
indirect bandgap transition which makes the spontaneous photon emission to be
of a slow second order process mediated by phonons. This feature uniquely
occurs in silicon nanowires while in bulk silicon there is no change of optical
properties under any reasonable amount of strain. These results promise new
applications of silicon nanowires as optoelectronic devices including a

different models of disordered fcc crystal lattices, with randomly-removed
bonds and with vacancies, respectively, within the framework of non-affine
lattice dynamics. We find that both systems feature the same scaling of the
shear modulus with the newly defined inversion-symmetry breaking (ISB)
parameter, which shows that local inversion-symmetry breaking around defects is
the universal root source of the non-affine softening of the shear modulus.
This finding allows us to derive analytical relations for the non-affine
(zero-frequency) shear modulus as a function of vacancy concentration in
excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Nevertheless, due to the
different microstructural disorder, the spatial fluctuations of the local ISB
parameter are different in the vacancy and bond-depleted case. The vacancy fcc
exhibits comparatively a more heterogenous microstructural disorder (due to the
broader distribution of coordination number $Z$), which is reflected in a
different scaling relation between boson peak frequency in the DOS and the
average $\bar{Z}$. These differences are less important at low vacancy
concentrations, where the numerical DOS of the vacancy fcc can be well
described theoretically by coherent-potential approximation, presented here for
the bond-depleted fcc lattice in 3d.

vectors of the AFM sublattices are canted inside the easy plane by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). The DC electric current flowing in the
Pt layer creates, due to the spin-Hall effect, a perpendicular spin current
that, being injected in the AFM layer, tilts the DMI-canted AFM sublattices out
of the easy plane, thus exposing them to the action of a strong internal
exchange magnetic field of the AFM. The sublattice magnetizations, along with
the small net magnetization vector $\textbf{m}_{\rm DMI}$ of the canted AFM,
start to rotate about the hard anisotropy axis of the AFM with the THz
frequency proportional to the injected spin current and the AFM exchange field.
The rotation of the small net magnetization $\textbf{m}_{\rm DMI}$ results in
the THz-frequency dipolar radiation that can be directly received by an
adjacent (e.g. dielectric) resonator. We demonstrate theoretically that the
radiation frequencies in the range $f=0.05-2$~THz are possible at the

evaluate the power of the signal radiated into different types of resonators,
showing that this power increases with the increase of frequency $f$, and that

processes: one donating free energy and the other accepting it. Recent studies
show that most protein enzymes have rich stochastic dynamics of transitions
between the multitude of conformation substates that make up their native
state. This dynamics often manifests itself in fluctuating rates of the
catalyzed processes and the presence of short-term memory. For such stochastic
dynamics, after dividing the free energy into operational and organizational
energy, we proved the generalized fluctuation theorem, which leads to the
extension of the second law of thermodynamics to include two competing
functions of process: dissipation and information. Computer simulation of the
course of catalyzed processes taking place on the model network of substates,
expressed in jumps of unit values at random moments of time, indicates the
possibility of negative dissipation of the organizational free energy at the
expense of information temporarily stored in memory, i.e. the behavior like
Maxwell's demon. Because similar courses can be registered in observation of
real systems, all theses of the paper are open to experimental verification.

distribution without a likelihood function, using simulations and a set of
distance metrics. For that reason, it has recently been gaining popularity as
an analysis tool in cosmology and astrophysics. Its drawback, however, is a
slow convergence rate. We propose a novel method, which we call qABC, to
accelerate ABC with Quantile Regression. In this method, we create a model of
quantiles of distance measure as a function of input parameters. This model is
trained on a small number of simulations and estimates which regions of the
prior space are likely to be accepted into the posterior. Other regions are
then immediately rejected. This procedure is then repeated as more simulations
are available. We apply it to the practical problem of estimation of redshift
distribution of cosmological samples, using forward modelling developed in
previous work. The qABC method converges to nearly same posterior as the basic
ABC. It uses, however, only 20\% of the number of simulations compared to basic
ABC, achieving a fivefold gain in execution time for our problem. For other
problems the acceleration rate may vary; it depends on how close the prior is
to the final posterior. We discuss possible improvements and extensions to this
method.

polarimetric properties, probably related to both their shape and composition.
They are named after (234) Barbara, the first on which such properties were
identified. As has been suggested, large scale topographic features could play
a role in the polarimetric response, if the shapes of Barbarians are
particularly irregular and present a variety of scattering/incidence angles.
This idea is supported by the shape of (234) Barbara, that appears to be deeply
excavated by wide concave areas revealed by photometry and stellar
occultations. Aims. With these motivations, we started an observation campaign
to characterise the shape and rotation properties of Small Main- Belt Asteroid
Spectroscopic Survey (SMASS) type L and Ld asteroids. As many of them show long
rotation periods, we activated a worldwide network of observers to obtain a
dense temporal coverage. Methods. We used light-curve inversion technique in
order to determine the sidereal rotation periods of 15 asteroids and the con-
vergence to a stable shape and pole coordinates for 8 of them. By using
available data from occultations, we are able to scale some shapes to an
absolute size. We also study the rotation periods of our sample looking for
confirmation of the suspected abundance of asteroids with long rotation
periods. Results. Our results show that the shape models of our sample do not
seem to have peculiar properties with respect to asteroids with similar size,
while an excess of slow rotators is most probably confirmed.

the parameter space for outflows, spanned by the angular momentum
($\lambda_{\rm in}$) and the energy (${\cal E}_{\rm in}$) at the inner sonic
point ($x_{\rm in}$), as function of the dissipation parameters and find that
parameter space gradually shrinks with the increase of dissipation rates.
Further, we examine the properties of the outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ (defined as
the ratio of outflow to inflow mass flux) and ascertain that dissipative
processes play the decisive role in determining the outflow rates. We calculate
the limits on the maximum outflow rate ($R_{\dot{m}}^{\rm max}$) in terms of
viscosity parameter ($\alpha$) as well as black hole spin ($a_k$) and obtain
the limiting range as $3\% \le R_{\dot{m}}^{\rm max} \le 19\%$. Moreover, we
calculate the viable range of $\alpha$ that admits the coupled inflow-outflow

number of sources, sensitivity, angular resolution and area covered by this
project are unprecedented. We have detected 468 radio sources, expected to be
AGNs, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.4 GHz. This is, to date,
the largest sample assembled of VLBI detected sources in the sub-mJy regime.
The input sample was taken from previous observations with the Very Large Array
(VLA). We present the catalogue with additional multiwavelength information. We
find a detection fraction of 20%, considering only those sources from the input
catalogue which were in principle detectable with the VLBA (2361). As a
function of redshift, we see no evolution of the detection fraction over the
redshift range 0.5<z<3. In addition, we find that faint radio sources typically
have a greater fraction of their radio luminosity in a compact core: ~70% of
the sub-mJy sources detected with the VLBA have more than half of their total
radio luminosity in a VLBI-scale component, whereas this is true for only ~30%
of the sources that are brighter than 10 mJy. This suggests that fainter radio
sources differ intrinsically from brighter ones. Across our entire sample, we
find the predominant morphological classification of the host galaxies of the
VLBA detected sources to be early type (57%), although this varies with
redshift and at z>1.5 we find that spiral galaxies become the most prevalent
(48%). We demonstrate that wide-field VLBI observations, together with new
calibration methods such as multi-source self-calibration and mosaicing, result

dislocations in a single slip system in the presence of forest dislocations.
The model consists of a Peierls-Nabarro type energy penalizing non-integer slip
and elastic stress. Forest dislocations are introduced as a perforation of the
domain by small disks where slip is prohibited. The $\Gamma$-limit of this
energy was deduced by Garroni and M\""uller (2005 and 2006). Our main result
shows that the gradient flows of these $\Gamma$-convergent energy functionals
do not approach the gradient flow of the limiting energy. Indeed, the gradient
flow dynamics remains a physically reasonable model in the case of non-monotone
loading. Our proofs rely on the construction of explicit sub- and
super-solutions to a fractional Allen-Cahn equation on a flat torus or in the
plane, with Dirichlet data on a union of small discs. The presence of these
obstacles leads to an additional friction in the viscous evolution which
appears as a stored energy in the $\Gamma$-limit, but it does not act as a
driving force. Extensions to related models with soft pinning and non-viscous
evolutions are also discussed. In terms of physics, our results explain how in
this phase field model the presence of forest dislocations still allows for
plastic as opposed to only elastic deformation.

discovered photometrically by the WASP planet survey, as their shallow eclipses
mimic a hot-Jupiter transit. The observations we present permit a precise
characterisation of the binary orbital elements and mass function. With
modelling of the primary star this mass function is converted to a mass of the
secondary star. In the future, this spectroscopic work will be combined with
precise photometric eclipses to draw an empirical mass/radius relation for the
bottom of the mass sequence. This has applications in both stellar astrophysics
and the growing number of exoplanet surveys around M-dwarfs. In particular, we
have discovered 34 systems with a secondary mass below $0.2 M_\odot$, and so we
will ultimately double the known number of very low-mass stars with well
characterised mass and radii.
  We are able to detect eccentricities as small as 0.001 and orbital periods to
sub-second precision. Our sample can revisit some earlier work on the tidal
evolution of close binaries, extending it to low mass ratios. We find some
binaries that are eccentric at orbital periods < 3 days, while our longest
circular orbit has a period of 10.4 days.
  By collating the EBLM binaries with published WASP planets and brown dwarfs,
we derive a mass spectrum with twice the resolution of previous work. We
compare the WASP/EBLM sample of tightly-bound orbits with work in the
literature on more distant companions up to 10 AU. We note that the brown dwarf
desert appears wider, as it carves into the planetary domain for our
short-period orbits. This would mean that a significantly reduced abundance of
planets begins at $\sim 3M_{\rm Jup}$, well before the Deuterium-burning limit.

effect of $\sim3\,$GeV protons injected at the inner edge of the PPD. An
increase in the ionisation fraction as a result of these CRs could allow the
magnetorotational instability to operate in otherwise magnetically dead regions
of the disk. For the typical values assumed we find an ionisation rate of
$\zeta_\mathrm{CR} \sim 10^{-17}\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ at $1\,$au. The transport
equation is solved by treating the propagation of the CRs as diffusive. We find
for increasing diffusion coefficients the CRs penetrate further in the PPD,
while varying the mass density profile of the disk is found to have little
effect. We investigate the effect of an energy spectrum of CRs. The influence
of a disk wind is examined by including an advective term. For advective wind
speeds between $1-100\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ diffusion dominates at all radii
considered here (out to 10$\,$au) for reasonable diffusion coefficients.
Overall, we find that low energy CRs can significantly ionise the midplane of
PPDs out to $\sim\,1\,$au. By increasing the luminosity or energy of the CRs,
within plausible limits, their radial influence could increase to $\sim2\,$au
at the midplane but it remains challenging to significantly ionise the midplane
further out.

the entangling surface, can be directly read from the entanglement spectrum
distribution. We also clarify the effect of the non-integer degeneracy on the
spectrum of the partial transpose, which is the central object for quantifying
the entanglement in mixed states. We show that the exact knowledge of the
entanglement spectrum in some integrable spin-chains provides strong analytical
evidences corroborating our results.

used the data of $N$-body simulations to simulate full-sky ray-tracing of

tangential shears around it. The lensing signal expected in a concordant

have numerically studied different prescriptions for the dynamics of a spinning
particle in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole. In the present
work, we continue this line of investigation to the rotating Kerr black hole.
We consider the Mathisson-Papapetrou formalism under three different
spin-supplementary-conditions (SSC), the Tulczyjew SSC, the Pirani SSC and the
Ohashi-Kyrian-Semerak SSC, and analyze the different circular dynamics in terms
of the ISCO shifts and the frequency parameter ${x \equiv (M \Omega)^{2/3}}$,
where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $M$ is the Kerr black hole mass.
Then, we solve numerically the inhomogeneous $(2+1)D$ Teukolsky equation to
contrast the asymptotic gravitational wave fluxes for the three cases. Our
central observation made in Paper I for the Schwarzschild limit is found to
hold true for the Kerr background: the three SSCs reduce to the same circular
dynamics and the same radiation fluxes for small frequency parameters but
differences arise as $x$ grows close to the ISCO. For a positive Kerr parameter
$a=0.9$ the energy fluxes mutually agree with each other within a $0.2\%$
uncertainty up to $x<0.14$, while for $a=-0.9$ this level of agreement is
preserved up to $x<0.1$. For large frequencies ($x \gtrsim 0.1$), however, the
spin coupling of the Kerr black hole and the spinning body results in
significant differences of the circular orbit parameters and the fluxes,
especially for the $a=-0.9$ case. Instead, in the study of ISCO the negative
Kerr parameter $a=-0.9$ results in less discrepancies in comparison with the
positive Kerr parameter $a=0.9$.

many computer vision applications spanning from object recognition to visual

not robust across different and heterogeneous set of data. In this paper, we
address this issue proposing a robust probabilistic latent graph-based feature
selection algorithm that performs the ranking step while considering all the
possible subsets of features, as paths on a graph, bypassing the combinatorial
problem analytically. An appealing characteristic of the approach is that it
aims to discover an abstraction behind low-level sensory data, that is,
relevancy. Relevancy is modelled as a latent variable in a PLSA-inspired
generative process that allows the investigation of the importance of a feature
when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. The proposed method has been
tested on ten diverse benchmarks, and compared against eleven state of the art
feature selection methods. Results show that the proposed approach attains the
highest performance levels across many different scenarios and difficulties,
thereby confirming its strong robustness while setting a new state of the art
in feature selection domain.

to aggregate user capacities and to increase system throughput in live
multimedia streaming. Nonetheless, such systems are vulnerable to pollution
attacks where a handful of malicious peers can disrupt the communication by
transmitting just a few bogus packets which are then recombined and relayed by
unaware honest nodes, further spreading the pollution over the network. Whereas
previous research focused on malicious nodes identification schemes and
pollution-resilient coding, in this paper we show pollution countermeasures
which make a standard network coding scheme resilient to pollution attacks.
Thanks to a simple yet effective analytical model of a reference node
collecting packets by malicious and honest neighbors, we demonstrate that i)
packets received earlier are less likely to be polluted and ii) short
generations increase the likelihood to recover a clean generation. Therefore,
we propose a recombination scheme where nodes draw packets to be recombined
according to their age in the input queue, paired with a decoding scheme able
to detect the reception of polluted packets early in the decoding process and
short generations. The effectiveness of our approach is experimentally
evaluated in a real system we developed and deployed on hundreds to thousands
peers. Experimental evidence shows that, thanks to our simple countermeasures,
the effect of a pollution attack is almost canceled and the video quality
experienced by the peers is comparable to pre-attack levels.

reconstruction of under-sampled dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI.
  Methods: A library of concentration v.s time profiles is simulated for a
range of physiological kinetic parameters. The library is reduced to a
dictionary of temporal bases, where each profile is approximated by a sparse
linear combination of the bases. Image reconstruction is formulated as
estimation of concentration profiles and sparse model coefficients with a fixed
sparsity level. Simulations are performed to evaluate modeling error, and error
statistics in kinetic parameter estimation in presence of noise. Retrospective
under-sampling experiments are performed on a brain tumor DCE digital reference
object (DRO) at different signal to noise levels (SNR=20-40) at (k-t) space
under-sampling factor (R=20), and 12 brain tumor in- vivo 3T datasets at
(R=20-40). The approach is compared against an existing compressed sensing
based temporal finite-difference (tFD) reconstruction approach.
  Results: Simulations demonstrate that sparsity levels of 2 and 3 model the
library profiles from the Patlak and extended Tofts-Kety (ETK) models,
respectively. Noise sensitivity analysis showed equivalent kinetic parameter
estimation error statistics from noisy concentration profiles, and model
approximated profiles. DRO based experiments showed good fidelity in recovery
of kinetic maps from 20-fold under- sampled data at SNRs between 10-30. In-vivo
experiments demonstrated reduced bias and uncertainty in kinetic mapping with
the proposed approach compared to tFD at R>=20.
  Conclusions: Tracer kinetic models can be applied as temporal constraints
during DCE-MRI reconstruction, enabling more accurate reconstruction from
under- sampled data. The approach is flexible, can use several kinetic models,
and does not require tuning of regularization parameters.

this extended spacetime with that appearing in double field theory and

provides a higher-dimensional perspective on the origin of mass and tension in
string theory and M-theory. Finally, we consider the reduction of exceptional
field theory on a twisted torus, which is known to give the massive IIA theory

compact objects can be explained by the propagating fluctuations model applied
to the accretion disc. The mass accretion rate fluctuations originate from
variability of viscosity, which arises at every radius and causes local
fluctuations of the density. The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and
result in local variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the
X-ray flux from the inner disc in the case of black holes, or from the surface
in the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical explanation of fast
variability belongs to the description of the diffusion process. The
propagation and evolution of the fluctuations is described by the diffusion
equation, which can be solved by the method of Green functions. We implement
Green functions in order to accurately describe the propagation of fluctuations
in the disc. For the first time we consider both forward and backward
propagation. We show that (i) viscous diffusion efficiently suppress
variability at time scales shorter than the viscous time, (ii) local
fluctuations of viscosity affect the mass accretion rate variability both in
the inner and the outer parts of accretion disc, (iii) propagating fluctuations
give rise not only to hard time lags as previously shown, but also produce soft
lags at high frequency similar to those routinely attributed to reprocessing,
(iv) deviation from the linear rms-flux relation is predicted for the case of
very large initial perturbations. Our model naturally predicts bumpy power
spectra.

corresponding metal-dependent yields and lifetimes are adopted to model
primordial stellar populations. The DLAs in the simulations are selected
according to either the local gas temperature (temperature selected) or the
host mass (mass selected). We find that 3\% (40\%) of mass (temperature)
selected high-$z$ ($z\ge5.5$) DLAs retain signatures of pollution from PopIII
stars, independently from the first star model. Such DLAs have low halo mass
($<10^{9.6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$), metallicity ($<10^{-3}\,\rm Z_{\odot}$) and star
formation rate ($<10^{-1.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$). { Metal abundance ratios
of DLAs imprinted in the spectra of QSO} can be useful tools to infer the
properties of the polluting stellar generation and to constrain the first star
mass ranges. Comparing the abundance ratios derived from our simulations to
those observed in DLAs at $z\ge5$, we find that most of these DLAs are
consistent within errors with PopII stars dominated enrichment and strongly
disfavor the pollution pattern of very massive first stars (i.e. 100~$\rm
M_{\odot}$-500~$\rm M_{\odot}$). However, some of them could still result from
the pollution of first stars in the mass range [0.1, 100]~$\rm M_{\odot}$. In
particular, we find that the abundance ratios from SDSS J1202+3235 are
consistent with those expected from PopIII enrichment dominated by massive (but

concerning the influence of transfer channels on fusion cross sections and the
hindrance phenomenon far below the barrier. Indeed, early data of sub-barrier
fusion taught us that cross sections may strongly depend on the low-energy
collective modes of the colliding nuclei, and, possibly, on couplings to
transfer channels. The coupled-channels (CC) model has been quite successful in
the interpretation of the experimental evidences. Fusion barrier distributions
often yield the fingerprint of the relevant coupled channels. Recent results
obtained by using radioactive beams are reported. At deep sub-barrier energies,
the slope of the excitation function in a semi-logarithmic plot keeps
increasing in many cases and standard CC calculations over-predict the cross
sections. This was named a hindrance phenomenon, and its physical origin is
still a matter of debate. Recent theoretical developments suggest that this
effect, at least partially, may be a consequence of the Pauli exclusion
principle. The hindrance may have far-reaching consequences in astrophysics
where fusion of light systems determines stellar evolution during the carbon
and oxygen burning stages, and yields important information for exotic
reactions that take place in the inner crust of accreting neutron stars.

paper, we propose an end-to-end two-stage deep convolutional neural network

stage, a convolutional encoder-decoder sub-network is employed to reconstruct
the background images and encode rich prior knowledge of background scenes. In
the second stage, the reconstructed background and current frame are input into
a multi-channel fully-convolutional sub-network (MCFCN) for accurate foreground
segmentation. In the two-stage CNN, the reconstruction loss and segmentation
loss are jointly optimized. The background images and foreground objects are
output simultaneously in an end-to-end way. Moreover, by incorporating the
prior semantic knowledge of foreground and background in the pre-training
process, our method could restrain the background noise and keep the integrity
of foreground objects at the same time. Experiments on CDNet 2014 show that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.9%.

efforts have been mainly informed by anecdotal evidence rather than systematic
data. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand articles on
Twitter during and following the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and election.
We find evidence that social bots played a disproportionate role in amplifying
low-credibility content. Accounts that actively spread articles from
low-credibility sources are significantly more likely to be bots. Automated
accounts are particularly active in amplifying content in the very early
spreading moments, before an article goes viral. Bots also target users with
many followers through replies and mentions. Humans are vulnerable to this
manipulation, retweeting bots who post links to low-credibility content.
Successful low-credibility sources are heavily supported by social bots. These
results suggest that curbing social bots may be an effective strategy for
mitigating the spread of online misinformation.

  Protests Against Refugee Housing","12 pages, Proc. Int. Conf. on Soc. Inform., 2017",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The political discourse in Western European countries such as Germany has
recently seen a resurgence of the topic of refugees, fueled by an influx of
refugees from various Middle Eastern and African countries. Even though the
topic of refugees evidently plays a large role in online and offline politics
of the affected countries, the fact that protests against refugees stem from
the right-wight political spectrum has lead to corresponding media to be shared
in a decentralized fashion, making an analysis of the underlying social and
mediatic networks difficult. In order to contribute to the analysis of these
processes, we present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a
contemporary nationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in
Germany, which organizes itself via dedicated Facebook pages per city. We
analyse data from 136 such protest pages in 2015, containing more than 46,000
posts and more than one million interactions by more than 200,000 users. In
order to learn about the patterns of communication and interaction among users
of far-right social media sites and pages, we investigate the temporal
characteristics of the social media activities of this protest movement, as
well as the connectedness of the interactions of its participants. We find
several activity metrics such as the number of posts issued, discussion volume
about crime and housing costs, negative polarity in comments, and user
engagement to peak in late 2015, coinciding with chancellor Angela Merkel's
much criticized decision of September 2015 to temporarily admit the entry of
Syrian refugees to Germany. Furthermore, our evidence suggests a low degree of
direct connectedness of participants in this movement, (i.a., indicated by a
lack of geographical collaboration patterns), yet we encounter a strong
affiliation of the pages' user base with far-right political parties.

goals, usually defined on single data instances. However, in relational
learning and other non-i.i.d domains, goals can also be defined over sets of
instances. For example, a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be
consistent with the transitivity property: if is-a(x_1, x_2) and is-a(x_2, x_3)
hold, is-a(x_1, x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for
deriving an inconsistency loss, measuring the degree to which the model
violates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The
training objective is defined as a minimax problem, where an adversary finds
the most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss,
and the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the
inconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method
that can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any
neural link predictor, with complexity independent of the domain size. We show
that for several link prediction models, the optimisation problem faced by the
adversary has efficient closed-form solutions. Experiments on link prediction
benchmarks indicate that given suitable prior knowledge, our method can
significantly improve neural link predictors on all relevant metrics.

in a number of applications such as geophysical and medical imaging. Parameter
estimation is commonly phrased as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that
can be solved iteratively using gradient-based optimization. A computational
bottleneck in such approaches is that the underlying PDEs needs to be solved
numerous times before the model is reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. One
way to reduce this computational burden is by using Model Order Reduction (MOR)
techniques such as the Multiscale Finite Volume Method (MSFV).
  In this paper, we apply MSFV for solving high-dimensional parameter
estimation problems. Given a finite volume discretization of the PDE on a fine
mesh, the MSFV method reduces the problem size by computing a
parameter-dependent projection onto a nested coarse mesh. A novelty in our work
is the integration of MSFV into a PDE-constrained optimization framework, which
updates the reduced space in each iteration. We also present a computationally
tractable way of differentiating the MOR solution that acknowledges the change
of basis. As we demonstrate in our numerical experiments, our method leads to
computational savings particularly for large-scale parameter estimation
problems and can benefit from parallelization.

origins of such `supermassive' black holes (SMBHs) remain unknown (Djorgovski
et al. 1999), while those of stellar-mass BHs are well-understood. One possible
scenario is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are formed by the
runaway coalescence of stars in young compact star clusters (Portagies Zwart et
al. 1999), merge at the centre of a galaxy to form an SMBH (Ebisuzaki et al.
2001). Although many candidates for IMBHs have been proposed to date, none of
them are accepted as definitive. Recently we discovered a peculiar molecular
cloud, CO-0.40-0.22, with an extremely broad velocity width near the centre of
our Milky Way galaxy. Based on the careful analysis of gas kinematics, we
concluded that a compact object with a mass of ~1E5 Msun is lurking in this
cloud (Oka et al. 2016). Here we report the detection of a point-like continuum
source as well as a compact gas clump near the center of CO-0.40-0.22. This
point-like continuum source (CO-0.40-0.22*) has a wide-band spectrum consistent
with 1/500 of the Galactic SMBH (Sgr A*) in luminosity. Numerical simulations
around a point-like massive object reproduce the kinematics of dense molecular
gas well, which suggests that CO-0.40-0.22* is the most promising candidate for
an intermediate-mass black hole.

provide the discussion on the most general level we consider soft factors for

the gluon exchanges with the distant transverse plane, and are structurally
equivalent to the ultraviolet divergences. It allows to formulate and to prove
the renormalization theorem for rapidity divergences. The proof is made with
the help the conformal transformation which maps rapidity divergences to
ultraviolet divergences. The theorem is the systematic form of the
factorization of rapidity divergences, which is required for the definition of
TMD parton distributions. In particular, the definition of multi parton
distributions is presented. The equivalence of ultraviolet and rapidity
divergences leads to the exact relation between soft and rapidity anomalous
dimensions. Using this relation we derive the rapidity anomalous dimension at

coherence tomography (OCT) images of the optic nerve head (ONH).
  Methods: A horizontal B-scan was acquired through the center of the ONH using
OCT (Spectralis) for 1 eye of each of 100 subjects (40 normal & 60 glaucoma).
All images were enhanced using adaptive compensation. A custom deep learning
network was then designed and trained with the compensated images to digitally
stain (i.e. highlight) 6 tissue layers of the ONH. The accuracy of our
algorithm was assessed (against manual segmentations) using the Dice
coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. We further studied how compensation
and the number of training images affected the performance of our algorithm.
  Results: For images it had not yet assessed, our algorithm was able to
digitally stain the retinal nerve fiber layer + prelamina, the retinal pigment
epithelium, all other retinal layers, the choroid, and the peripapillary sclera
and lamina cribrosa. For all tissues, the mean dice coefficient was $0.84 \pm
0.03$, the mean sensitivity $0.92 \pm 0.03$, and the mean specificity $0.99 \pm
0.00$. Our algorithm performed significantly better when compensated images
were used for training. Increasing the number of images (from 10 to 40) to
train our algorithm did not significantly improve performance, except for the
RPE.
  Conclusion. Our deep learning algorithm can simultaneously stain neural and
connective tissues in ONH images. Our approach offers a framework to
automatically measure multiple key structural parameters of the ONH that may be
critical to improve glaucoma management.

spacetime in an isotropic FLRW background universe. We study the global
structure of McVittie spacetimes with spatially non-flat FLRW backgrounds. This
requires the extension of the definition of such spacetimes, previously given
only for the flat and open cases, to the closed case. We revisit this
definition and show how it gives rise to a unique spacetime (given the FLRW
background, the mass parameter $M$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$) in
the open and flat cases. In the closed case, an additional free function of the
cosmic time arises. We derive some basic results on the metric, curvature and
matter content of McVittie spacetimes and derive a representation of the line
element that makes the study of their global properties possible. In the closed
case (independently of the free function mentioned above), the spacetime is
confined (at each instant of time) to a region bounded by a minimum and a
maximum area radius, and is bounded either to the future or to the past by a
scalar curvature singularity. This allowed region only exists when the
background scale factor is above a certain minimum. In the open case, radial
null geodesics originate in finite affine time in the past at a boundary formed
by the union of the Big Bang singularity of the FLRW background and a
non-singular hypersurface of varying causal character. Furthermore, in the case
of eternally expanding open universes, we show that black holes are ubiquitous:
ingoing radial null geodesics extend in finite affine time to a hypersurface
that forms the boundary of the region from which photons can escape to future
null infinity. We revisit the black hole interpretation of McVittie spacetimes
in the spatially flat case, and show that this interpretation holds also in the
case of a vanishing cosmological constant, contrary to a previous claim of
ours.

and multifractality of a Bitcoin time series. We find that the 1-min return
distribution is fat-tailed, and kurtosis largely deviates from the Gaussian
expectation. Although for large sampling periods, kurtosis is anticipated to
approach the Gaussian expectation, we find that convergence to that is very
slow. Skewness is found to be negative at time scales shorter than one day and
becomes consistent with zero at time scales longer than about one week. We also
investigate daily volatility-asymmetry by using GARCH, GJR, and RGARCH models,
and find no evidence of it. On exploring multifractality using multifractal
detrended fluctuation analysis, we find that the Bitcoin time series exhibits
multifractality. The sources of multifractality are investigated, confirming
that both temporal correlation and the fat-tailed distribution contribute to
it. The influence of ""Brexit"" on June 23, 2016 to GBP--USD exchange rate and
Bitcoin is examined in multifractal properties. We find that, while Brexit
influenced the GBP--USD exchange rate, Bitcoin was robust to Brexit.

  Enabled by Quick Error Detection and Formal Methods",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During post-silicon validation, manufactured integrated circuits are
extensively tested in actual system environments to detect design bugs. Bug
localization involves identification of a bug trace (a sequence of inputs that
activates and detects the bug) and a hardware design block where the bug is
located. Existing bug localization practices during post-silicon validation are
mostly manual and ad hoc, and, hence, extremely expensive and time consuming.
This is particularly true for subtle electrical bugs caused by unexpected
interactions between a design and its electrical state. We present E-QED, a new
approach that automatically localizes electrical bugs during post-silicon
validation. Our results on the OpenSPARC T2, an open-source
500-million-transistor multicore chip design, demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of E-QED: starting with a failed post-silicon test, in a few hours
(9 hours on average) we can automatically narrow the location of the bug to
(the fan-in logic cone of) a handful of candidate flip-flops (18 flip-flops on
average for a design with ~ 1 Million flip-flops) and also obtain the
corresponding bug trace. The area impact of E-QED is ~2.5%. In contrast,
deter-mining this same information might take weeks (or even months) of mostly
manual work using traditional approaches.

with information on both the Mach numbers derived from X-ray observation,
$\mathcal{M}_X$, and using spectral information from radio observations of the
peak and the average values of the spectral index along the relic,
$\mathcal{M}_R$. We find that there is a lack of correlation between
$\mathcal{M}_X$ and $\mathcal{M}_R$; this result is an indication that the
spectral index of the relic is likely not due to the acceleration of particles
operated by the shock but it is related to the properties of a fossil electrons
population. We also find that the available data on the correlation between the
radio power $P_{1.4}$ and Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_R$ and $\mathcal{M}_X$) in
relics indicate that neither the DSA nor the adiabatic compression can simply
reproduce the observed $P_{1.4}-\mathcal{M}$ correlations. Furthermore, we find
that the radio power is not correlated with $\mathcal{M}_X$, whereas it is not
possible to exclude a correlation with $\mathcal{M}_R$. This also indicates
that the relic power is mainly determined by the properties of a fossil
electron population rather than by the properties of the shock. Our results
require either to consider models of shock (re)acceleration that go beyond the
proposed scenarios of DSA and adiabatic compression at shocks, or to reconsider
the origin of radio relics in terms of other physical scenarios.

badly divergent, and as a result not very useful. Nevertheless some of the most
interesting phenomena in physics are often associated with non-analytic
behavior in the coupling constant and the existence of nontrivial quantum
condensates. It is therefore possible that pathologies encountered in the case
of gravity are more likely the result of inadequate analytical treatment, and
not necessarily a reflection of some intrinsic insurmountable problem. The
nonperturbative treatment of quantum gravity via the Regge-Wheeler lattice path
integral formulation reveals the existence of a new phase involving a
nontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate, and a new set of scaling exponents
characterizing both the running of G and the long-distance behavior of
invariant correlation functions. The appearance of such a gravitational

chiral condensates known to describe the physical vacuum of QCD. The resulting
quantum theory of gravity is highly constrained, and its physical predictions
are found to depend only on one adjustable parameter, a genuinely

parameter Lambda MSbar of QCD. Recent results point to significant deviations
from classical gravity on distance scales approaching the effective infrared

computational coarse grid. Previous inversion techniques for multiscale
problems seek a coarse-grid media properties, e.g., permeability and
conductivity, and by doing so, they assume that there exists a homogenized
representation of the underlying fine-scale permeability field on a coarse
grid. Generally such assumptions do not hold for highly heterogeneous fields,
e.g., fracture media or channelized fields, where the width of channels are
very small compared to the coarse-grid sizes. In these cases, grid refinement
can lead to many degrees of freedom, and thus unattractive to apply. The
proposed algorithm is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method
(GMsFEM), which uses local spectral problems to identify non-localized
features, i.e., channels (high-conductivity inclusions that connect the
boundaries of the coarse-grid block). The inclusion of these features in the
coarse space enables one to achieve a good accuracy. The approach is valid
under the assumption that the solution can be well represented in a
reduced-dimensional space by multiscale basis functions. In practice, these
basis functions are non-observable as we do not identify the fine-scale
features of the permeability field. Our inversion algorithm finds the
discretization parameters of the resulting system. By doing so, we identify the
appropriate coarse-grid parameters representing the permeability field instead
of fine-grid permeability field. We illustrate the approach by numerical
results for fractured media.

factor into a product of Mayer f-functions and the resulting expression is
rearranged to reveal a form of the monomer fraction that is analogous to that
used within the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT). The present

representation of images, which results in richer characterizations. To measure
the influence of the Full-Network embedding, we evaluate its performance on
three different datasets, and compare the results with the original multimodal
embedding generation scheme when using a one-layer image embedding, and with
the rest of the state-of-the-art. Results for image annotation and image
retrieval tasks indicate that the Full-Network embedding is consistently
superior to the one-layer embedding. These results motivate the integration of
the Full-Network embedding on any multimodal embedding generation scheme,
something feasible thanks to the flexibility of the approach.

  Conference on Nuclear Engineering)",,,"physics.app-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The management of long-lived radionuclides in spent fuel is a key issue to
achieve the closed nuclear fuel cycle and the sustainable development of
nuclear energy. Partitioning-Transmutation is supposed to be an efficient
method to treat the long-lived radionuclides in spent fuel. Some Minor
Actinides (MAs) have very long half-lives among the radionuclides in the spent
fuel. Accordingly, the study of MAs transmutation is a significant work for the
post-processing of spent fuel.
  In the present work, the transmutations in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel are investigated through the Monte Carlo based code RMC.
Two kinds of MAs, $^{237}$Np and five MAs ($^{237}$Np, $^{241}$Am, $^{243}$Am,
$^{244}$Cm and $^{245}$Cm) are incorporated homogeneously into the MOX fuel
assembly. The transmutation of MAs is simulated with different initial MOX
concentrations.
  The results indicate an overall nice efficiency of transmutation in both
initial MOX concentrations, especially for the two kinds of MAs primarily
generated in the UOX fuel, $^{237}$Np and $^{241}$Am. In addition, the
inclusion of $^{237}$Np in MOX has no large influence for other MAs, while the
transmutation efficiency of $^{237}$Np is excellent. The transmutation of MAs
in MOX fuel depletion is expected to be a new, efficient nuclear spent fuel
management method for the future nuclear power generation.

experimental investigation of winding number change at magnetic field
corresponding to the half of the flux quantum inside the ring. According to the
conventional theory, the critical current of such rings should change by jump
due to this change. Experimental data obtained at measurements of aluminum
rings agree with theoretical prediction in magnetic flux region close to
integer numbers of the flux quantum and disagree in the region close to the
half of the one, where a smooth change is observed instead of the jump. First
measurements of tantalum ring give a hope for the jump. Investigation of this
problem may have both fundamental and practical importance.

(ATF),which consists of U$_3$Si$_2$ fuel and FeCrAl cladding. In comparison
with current UO$_2$-Zr system, FeCrAl has a better oxidation resistance but a
larger thermal neutron absorption cross section. U$_3$Si$_2$ has a higher
thermal conductivity and a higher uranium density, which can compensate the
reactivity suppressed by FeCrAl. Based on neutronic investigations, a possible
U$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl fuel-cladding systemis taken into consideration. Fundamental
properties of the suggested fuel-cladding combination are investigated in a
fuel assembly.These properties include moderator and fuel temperature
coefficients, control rods worth, radial power distribution (in a fuel rod),
and different void reactivity coefficients. The present work proves that the
new combination has less reactivity variation during its service lifetime.
Although, compared with the current system, it has a little larger deviation on
power distribution and a little less negative temperature coefficient and void
reactivity coefficient and its control rods worth is less important, variations
of these parameters are less important during the service lifetime of fuel.
Hence, U$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl system is a potential ATF candidate from a neutronic
view.

aluminum projectile on a thin steel mesh shield at high-velocity impact in a
three-dimensional (3D) setting. The numerical simulations are carried out by
smoothed particle hydrodynamics method applied to the equations of mechanics of
deformable solids. Quantitative characteristics of the projectile fragmentation
are obtained by studying statistics of the cloud of fragments. The considerable
attention is given to scaling laws accompanying the fragmentation of the
projectile. Scaling is carried out using the parameter K which defines the
number of the mesh cells falling within the projectile diameter. It is found
that the dependence of the critical velocity Vc of fragmentation on the
parameter K consists of two branches that correspond to two modes of the
projectile fragmentation associated with the ""small"" and ""large"" aperture of
the mesh cell. We obtain the dependences of the critical velocity Vc on the
projectile diameter and the mesh parameters for the both modes of the
fragmentation. It is shown that the average cumulative mass distributions
constructed at Vc exhibit the property of scale invariance, splitting into two
groups of distributions exactly corresponding to the modes of the projectile
fragmentation. In each group, the average cumulative distributions show good
coincidence in the entire mass region, moreover in the intermediate mass region
the each group of distributions has a power-law distribution with an exponent
tau different from that in the other group. The conclusion about the dependence
of the exponent of the power-law distribution tau on the fragmentation mode is
made.
