  Terahertz Kerr Effect",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Formation of local molecular structures in liquid water is believed to have
marked effect on the bulk properties of water, however, resolving such
structural motives in an experiment is challenging. This challenge might be
handled if the relevant low-frequency structural motion of the liquid is
directly driven with an intense electromagnetic pulse. Here, we resonantly
excite diffusive reorientational motions in water with intense terahertz pulses
and measure the resulting transient optical birefringence. The observed
response is shown to arise from a particular configuration, namely the
restricted trans-lational motion of water molecules whose motions are
predominantly orthogonal to the dipole moment of the excited neighboring water
molecules. Accordingly, we estimate the strength of the anharmonic coupling
between the rotational and the restricted translational degrees of freedom of
water.

the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains by beam selection. However,
beam selection requires the base station to acquire the accurate information of
beamspace channel. This is a challenging task, as the size of beamspace channel
is large while the number of RF chains is limited. In this paper, we
investigate the beamspace channel estimation problem in mmWave massive MIMO
systems with lens antenna array. Specifically, we first design an adaptive
selecting network for mmWave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array, and
based on this network, we further formulate the beamspace channel estimation
problem as a sparse signal recovery problem. Then, by fully utilizing the
structural characteristics of mmWave beamspace channel, we propose a support
detection (SD)-based channel estimation scheme with reliable performance and
low pilot overhead. Finally, the performance and complexity analyses are
provided to prove that the proposed SD-based channel estimation scheme can
estimate the support of sparse beamspace channel with comparable or higher
accuracy than conventional schemes. Simulation results verify that the proposed
SD-based channel estimation scheme outperforms conventional schemes and enjoys
satisfying accuracy, even in the low SNR region as the structural
characteristics of beamspace channel can be exploited.

side length $n$, $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$, where each edge refreshes its status at rate
$\mu=\mu_n\le 1/2$ to be open with probability $p$. We study random walk on the
torus, where the walker moves at rate $1/(2d)$ along each open edge. In earlier
work of two of the authors with A. Stauffer, it was shown that in the
subcritical case $p<p_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, the (annealed) mixing time of the walk
is $\Theta(n^2/\mu)$, and it was conjectured that in the supercritical case
$p>p_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, the mixing time is $\Theta(n^2+1/\mu)$; here the implied

$\theta(p)>1/2$. Our proof is based on percolation results (e.g., the
Grimmett-Marstrand Theorem) and an analysis of the volume-biased evolving set
process; the key point is that typically, the evolving set has a substantial
intersection with the giant percolation cluster at many times. This allows us
to use precise isoperimetric properties of the cluster (due to G. Pete) to
infer rapid growth of the evolving set, which in turn yields the upper bound on
the mixing time.

microlensing signal does not depend on the brightness of the lensing object. A
characteristic timescale of microlensing events depends on the mass of the
lens: the less massive the lens, the shorter the microlensing event. A previous
analysis of 474 microlensing events found an excess of very short events (1-2
days) - more than known stellar populations would suggest - indicating the
existence of a large population of unbound or wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets
(reported to be almost twice as common as main-sequence stars). These results,
however, do not match predictions of planet formation theories and are in
conflict with surveys of young clusters. Here we report the analysis of a six
times larger sample of microlensing events discovered during the years
2010-2015. Although our survey has very high sensitivity (detection efficiency)
to short-timescale (1--2 days) microlensing events, we found no excess of
events with timescales in this range, with a 95% upper limit on the frequency
of Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planet per
main-sequence star. We detected a few possible ultrashort-timescale events
(with timescales of less than 0.5 day), which may indicate the existence of

first principles, at the example of a nitro-substituted oligo-(phenylene
ethynylene) covalently bound to graphene nanoribbon leads. Recently, we
demonstrated that the conductivity of this single-molecule-graphene-nanoribbon
junction can be switched quantitatively and reversibly upon application of a
static electric field in a top gate position, in the spirit of a traditional
field effect transistor [J. Phys. Chem. C, 2016, 120, 28808-28819]. The
propensity of the central oligomer unit to align with the external field was
found to induce a damped rotational motion and to cause an interruption of the
conjugated $\pi$-system, thereby drastically reducing the conductance through
the nanojunction. In the current work, we use the driven Liouville-von-Neumann
(DLvN) approach for time-dependent electronic transport calculations to
simulate the electronic current dynamics under time-dependent potential biases
for the two logical states of the nanojunction. Our quantum dynamical
simulations rely on a novel localization procedure using an orthonormal set of
molecular orbitals obtained from a standard density functional theory
calculation to generate a localized representation for the different parts of
the molecular junction. The transparent DLvN formalism allows us to directly
access the density matrix and to reconstruct the time-dependent electronic
current density, unraveling unique mechanistic details of the electron
transport.

  Materials with Applications to Induction Heating Theory (2008 Student Thesis)",,,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic induction was first proposed as a planetary heating mechanism by
Sonett and Colburn in 1968, in recent years this theory has lost favor as a
plausible source of heating in the early solar system. However, new models of
proto-planetary disk evolution suggest that magnetic fields play an important
role in solar system formation. In particular, the magneto-hydrodynamic
behavior of proto-planetary disks is believed to be responsible for the net
outward flow of angular momentum in the solar system. It is important to
re-evaluate the plausibility of magnetic induction based on the intense
magnetic field environments described by the most recent models of
proto-planetary disk evolution.
  In order to re-evaluate electromagnetic induction theory the electrical
conductivity of meteorites must be determined. To develop a technique capable
of making these measurements, a time-varying magnetic field was generated to
inductively heat metallic control samples. The thermal response of each sample,
which depends on electrical conductivity, was monitored until a thermal steady
state was achieved. The relationship between conductivity and thermal response
can be exploited to estimate the electrical conductivity of unknown samples.
After applying the technique to various metals it was recognized that this
method is not capable of making precise electrical conductivity measurements.
However, this method can constrain the product of the electrical conductivity
and the square of the magnetic permeability, or ${\sigma}{{\mu}^2}$, for
meteoritic and metallic samples alike. The results also illustrate that along
with electrical conductivity {\sigma}, the magnetic permeability {\mu} of a
substance has an important effect on induction heating phenomena for
paramagnetic ({\mu}/{\mu}0 > 1) and especially ferromagnetic materials
({\mu}/{\mu}0 >> 1).

Therefore, a specific path planning pattern is proposed. The notion is that

spraying applications and related in-field work. Consequently, multiple returns
to a mobile or stationary depot located outside of the field are required for
storage tank refilling. Therefore, a suitable path planning method is suggested
that accounts for the limited turning radii of agricultural vehicles, satisfies
compacted area minimisation constraints, and aims at overall path length
minimisation. The benefits of the proposed method are illustrated by means of a
comparison to a planning method based on the more common AB pattern. It is
illustrated how the proposed path planning pattern can also be employed

several experiments and proposals. A very challenging one is its evaluation
from reactor experiments based on the tiny interference effect between the

several years of data taking and an extreme energy resolution to achieve anyhow
less than 5 $\sigma$. Referring to the JUNO experimental conditions we
developed a completely new technique that would provide a robust 5 $\sigma$
measurement in less than six years of running. The two orderings could be
discriminated at the price of allowing for two different values of $\Delta
m^2_{31}$. This degeneracy on $\Delta m^2_{31}$ (around $12\times 10^{-5}$
eV$^2$) can however be measured at an unprecedented accuracy of much less than
1\%, i.e. $10^{-5}$ eV$^2$, within the same analysis. Analogies with the usual
$\chi^2$ analysis, where the $\Delta m^2_{31}$ degeneracy is much more
important, are discussed. Evaluation and inclusion of systematic errors and
backgrounds have been performed, the most relevant among them being the
addition of the two remote reactor plants 250 km away. Baselines of each
contributing reactor core and its spatial resolution have been taken into
account. Possible results after two years of running and the foreseen
initially-reduced available reactor power have been studied, too. These results
confirm the very positive perspectives for JUNO to determine the mass ordering

it with spinor helicity methods explicit all-N results can be obtained at the
one-loop and, for the ""all + "" amplitudes, also at the two-loop level. For the
imaginary part of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, an all-loop formula has been
conjectured independently by Affleck, Alvarez and Manton for Scalar QED, and by
Lebedev and Ritus for Spinor QED. This formula can be related through a Borel
dispersion relation to the leading large-N behaviour of the N-photon

theory. Preliminary results of such a study for the 1+1 dimensional case throw

provide evidence for dark matter substructure in the halo of the lensing galaxy
if the flux ratios differ from those predicted by a smooth model of the lensing

in the lensing galaxy, such as edge-on discs, can produce flux-ratio anomalies.
In this work, we present the first statistical analysis of flux-ratio anomalies
due to baryons from a numerical simulation perspective. We select galaxies with
various morphological types in the Illustris simulation and ray-trace through
the simulated halos, which include baryons in the main lensing galaxies but
exclude any substructures, in order to explore the pure baryonic effects. Our
ray-tracing results show that the baryonic components can be a major
contribution to the flux-ratio anomalies in lensed quasars and that edge-on
disc lenses induce the strongest anomalies. We find that the baryonic
components increase the probability of finding high flux-ratio anomalies in the
early-type lenses by about 8% and by about 10 - 20% in the disc lenses. The
baryonic effects also induce astrometric anomalies in 13% of the mock lenses.
Our results indicate that the morphology of the lens galaxy becomes important
in the analysis of flux-ratio anomalies when considering the effect of baryons,
and that the presence of baryons may also partially explain the discrepancy
between the observed (high) anomaly frequency and what is expected due to the
presence of subhalos as predicted by the CDM simulations.

$G$-parity-even operators by combining Chiral Effective Field Theory
($\chi$EFT) and dispersion analysis. The FFs are expressed as dispersive
integrals over the two-pion cut at $t > 4 M_\pi^2$. The spectral functions are
obtained from the elastic unitarity condition and expressed as products of the
complex $\pi\pi \rightarrow N\bar N$ partial-wave amplitudes and the timelike
pion FF. $\chi$EFT is used to calculate the ratio of the partial-wave
amplitudes and the pion FF, which is real and free of $\pi\pi$ rescattering in
the $t$-channel ($N/D$ method). The rescattering effects are then incorporated
by multiplying with the squared modulus of the empirical pion FF. The procedure
results in a marked improvement compared to conventional $\chi$EFT calculations
of the spectral functions. We apply the method to the nucleon scalar FF and
compute the scalar spectral function, the scalar radius, the $t$-dependent FF,
and the Cheng-Dashen discrepancy. Higher-order chiral corrections are estimated
through the $\pi N$ low-energy constants. Results are in excellent agreement
with dispersion-theoretical calculations. We elaborate several other
interesting aspects of our method. The results show proper scaling behavior in
the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD because the $\chi$EFT calculation includes $N$ and
$\Delta$ intermediate states. The squared modulus of the timelike pion FF
required by our method can be extracted from Lattice QCD calculations of vacuum
correlation functions of the operator at large Euclidean distances. Our method
can be applied to the nucleon FFs of other operators of interest, such as the
isovector-vector current, the energy-momentum tensor, and twist-2 QCD operators
(moments of generalized parton distributions).

charged under an exact $U(1)_{\rm DM} \subset SO(6)$ that ensures its
stability. Depending on whether the $\chi$ shift symmetry is respected or
broken by the coupling of the top quark to the strong sector, the DM can be
much lighter than the Higgs or have a weak-scale mass. Here we focus primarily
on the latter possibility. We introduce the lowest-lying composite resonances

of BELs formed in rotating accretion disc winds. We use a Monte Carlo radiative
transfer and ionization code to predict velocity-delay maps for representative
high- (C$~IV$) and low-ionization (H$\alpha$) emission lines in both high- and
moderate-luminosity AGN. Self-shielding, multiple scattering and the ionization
structure of the outflows are all self-consistently taken into account, while
small-scale structure in the outflow is modelled in the micro-clumping
approximation. Our main findings are: (1) The velocity-delay maps of
smooth/micro-clumped outflows often contain significant negative responses.
(2)~The reverberation signatures of disc wind models tend to be rotation
dominated and can even resemble the classic ""red-leads-blue"" inflow signature.
(3) Traditional ""blue-leads-red"" outflow signatures can usually only be
observed in the long-delay limit. (4) Our models predict lag-luminosity
relationships similar to those inferred from observations, but systematically
underpredict the observed centroid delays. (5) The ratio between ""virial
product"" and black hole mass predicted by our models depends on viewing angle.
Our results imply that considerable care needs to be taken in interpreting data
obtained by observational reverberation mapping campaigns. In particular, basic
signatures such as ""red-leads-blue"", ""blue-leads-red"" and ""blue and red vary

of their jets close to the line ofsight. Their radiation is thus
relativistically beamed, giving rise to extreme behaviors, specially strong
variability on very short time-scales (i.e., microvariability). Here we present
simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations of two relatively nearby
blazars, 1ES 1959+650 and HB89 2201+044, that were obtained using the Calar
Alto Faint Object Spectrograph mounted at the 2.2 m telescope in Calar Alto,
Spain. An outstanding characteristic of these two blazars is the presence of
well resolved host galaxies. This particular feature allows us to produce a
study of their intrinsic polarization, a measurement of the polarization state
of the galactic nucleus unaffected by the host galaxy. To carry out this work,
we computed photometric fluxes from which we calculated the degree and
orientation of the blazars polarization. Then, we analyzed the depolarizing
effect introduced by the host galaxy with the main goal to recover the
intrinsic polarization of the galactic nucleus, carefully taking into
consideration the spurious polarimetric variability introduced by changes in
seeing along the observing nights. We find that the two blazars do not present
intra-night photo-polarimetric variability, although we do detect a significant
inter-night variability. Comparing polarimetric values before and after
accounting for the host galaxies, we observe a significant difference in the
polarization degree of about 1 % in the case of 1ES 1959+650, and 0.3 % in the
case of HB89 2201+044, thus evidencing the non-negligible impact introduced by
the host galaxies. We note that this host galaxy effect depends on the
weaveband, and varies with changing seeing conditions, so it should be
particularly considered when studying frequency-dependent polarization in
blazars.

Fourier transform to the AdS phase shift of the dual 2-to-2 scattering process.
AdS unitarity was conjectured some time ago to be positivity of the imaginary
part of this bulk phase shift. This condition was recently proved using purely
CFT arguments. For large $N$ CFTs we further expand on these ideas, by
considering the phase shift in the Regge limit, which is dominated by the
leading Regge pole with spin $j(\nu)$, where $\nu$ is a spectral parameter. We
compute the phase shift as a function of the bulk impact parameter, and then
use AdS unitarity to impose bounds on the analytically continued OPE
coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal J}j(\nu)}$ and $C_{TTj(\nu)}$ that describe the
coupling to the leading Regge trajectory of the current ${\cal J}$ and stress
tensor $T$. AdS unitarity implies that the OPE coefficients associated to
non-minimal couplings of the bulk theory vanish at the intercept value $\nu=0$,
for any CFT. Focusing on the case of large gap theories, this result can be
used to show that the physical OPE coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal J}T}$ and
$C_{TTT}$, associated to non-minimal bulk couplings, scale with the gap
$\Delta_g$ as $\Delta_g^{-2}$ or $\Delta_g^{-4}$. Also, looking directly at the
unitarity condition imposed at the OPE coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal J}T}$ and
$C_{TTT}$ results precisely in the known conformal collider bounds, giving a
new CFT derivation of these bounds. We finish with remarks on finite $N$
theories and show directly in the CFT that the spin function $j(\nu)$ is
convex, extending this property to the continuation to complex spin.

we apply ELDAR to the data of the ALHAMBRA survey, which covered an effective
area of $2.38\,{\rm deg}^2$ with 20 contiguous medium-band optical filters down
to F814W$\simeq 24.5$. Using two different configurations of ELDAR in which we
require the detection of at least 2 and 3 emission lines, respectively, we
extract two catalogues of type-I AGN. The first is composed of 585 sources
($79\,\%$ of them spectroscopically-unknown) down to F814W$=22.5$ at $z_{\rm
phot}>1$, which corresponds to a surface density of $209\,{\rm deg}^{-2}$. In
the second, the 494 selected sources ($83\,\%$ of them
spectroscopically-unknown) reach F814W$=23$ at $z_{\rm phot}>1.5$, for a
corresponding number density of $176\,{\rm deg}^{-2}$. Then, using samples of
spectroscopically-known AGN in the ALHAMBRA fields, for the two catalogues we
estimate a completeness of $73\,\%$ and $67\,\%$, and a redshift precision of
$1.01\,\%$ and $0.86\,\%$ (with outliers fractions of $8.1\,\%$ and $5.8\,\%$).
At $z>2$, where our selection performs best, we reach $85\,\%$ and $77\,\%$

perturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through
monolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have
experienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulations readily
produce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density
profile with an inner slope, $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha=1$,
recent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off expected for
the CDM model is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density
profiles of $\alpha\sim1.5$. In this paper, we study the formation of density
cusps in haloes using idealized $N$-body simulations of the collapse of
proto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle
free-streaming at high redshift, we universally find $\sim r^{-1.5}$ profiles
irrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale
non-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a
power-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when
the density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value,
$\alpha_{\rm ini} \sim 0.3$, while the final slope can be steeper for
$\alpha_{\rm ini}\ga 0.3$. We further demonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ profiles
are sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an
inner slope of $-1$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We
demonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium,
largely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that
angular momentum appears to determine the inner slope.

diffusion due to the interaction with the interstellar turbulent magnetic
field. Usually, CR diffusion is assumed to be uniform and isotropic all across
the Galaxy. However, this picture is clearly inaccurate: Several data-driven
and theoretical arguments, as well as dedicated numerical simulations, show
that diffusion exhibits highly anisotropic properties with respect to the
direction of a background (ordered) magnetic field (i.e., parallel or
perpendicular to it). In this paper we focus on a recently discovered anomaly
in the hadronic CR spectrum inferred by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data at
different positions in the Galaxy, i.e. the progressive hardening of the proton
slope at low Galactocentric radii. We propose the idea that this feature can be
interpreted as a signature of anisotropic diffusion in the complex Galactic
magnetic field: In particular, the harder slope in the inner Galaxy is due, in
our scenario, to the parallel diffusive escape along the poloidal component of
the large-scale, regular, magnetic field. We implement this idea in a numerical
framework, based on the DRAGON code, and perform detailed numerical tests on
the accuracy of our setup. We discuss how the effect proposed depends on the
relevant free parameters involved. Based on low-energy extrapolation of the few
focused numerical simulations aimed at determining the scalings of the
anisotropic diffusion coefficients, we finally present a set of plausible
models that reproduce the behavior of the CR proton slopes inferred by

with high quality multi-band data and relatively well sampled time coverage.
Most of the SNe in our sample were detected less than a week after explosion so
their light curves cover the evolution both before and after recombination
starts playing a role. We use this sample to study the signature of hydrogen
recombination, which is expected to appear once the observed temperature drops
to $\approx 7,000$K. Theory predicts that before recombination starts affecting
the light curve, both the luminosity and the temperature should drop relatively
fast, following a power-law in time. Once the recombination front reaches inner
parts of the outflow, it sets the observed temperature to be nearly constant,
and slows the decline of the luminosity (or even leads to a re-brightening). We
compare our data to analytic studies and find strong evidence for the signature
of recombination. We also find that the onset of the optical plateau in a given
filter, is effectively the time at which the black body peak reaches the
central wavelength of the filter, as it cools, and it does not correspond to
the time at which recombination starts affecting the emission.

unprecedented resolution of the dynamics of cellular processes such as cell
cycle and response to pharmaceutical compounds. In anticipation of the
proliferation of time series data sets in the near future, we use the Hopfield
model, a recurrent neural network based on spin glasses, to model the dynamics
of cell cycle in HeLa (human cervical cancer) and S. cerevisiae cells. We study
some of the rich dynamical properties of these cyclic Hopfield systems,
including the ability of populations of simulated cells to recreate
experimental expression data and the effects of noise on the dynamics. Next, we
use a genetic algorithm to identify sets of genes which, when selectively
inhibited by local external fields representing gene silencing compounds such
as kinase inhibitors, disrupt the encoded cell cycle. We find, for example,
that inhibiting the set of four kinases BRD4, MAPK1, NEK7, and YES1 in HeLa
cells causes simulated cells to accumulate in the M phase. Finally, we suggest
possible improvements and extensions to our model.

differential privacy (pDP), which captures the privacy of a specific individual
with respect to a fixed data set. We show that this is a strict generalization
of the standard DP and inherits all its desirable properties, e.g.,
composition, invariance to side information and closedness to postprocessing,
except that they all hold for every instance separately. When the data is drawn
from a distribution, we show that per-instance DP implies generalization.
Moreover, we provide explicit calculations of the per-instance DP for the
output perturbation on a class of smooth learning problems. The result reveals
an interesting and intuitive fact that an individual has stronger privacy if
he/she has small ""leverage score"" with respect to the data set and if he/she
can be predicted more accurately using the leave-one-out data set. Our
simulation shows several orders-of-magnitude more favorable privacy and utility
trade-off when we consider the privacy of only the users in the data set. In a
case study on differentially private linear regression, provide a novel
analysis of the One-Posterior-Sample (OPS) estimator and show that when the
data set is well-conditioned it provides $(\epsilon,\delta)$-pDP for any target
individuals and matches the exact lower bound up to a
$1+\tilde{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ multiplicative factor. We also demonstrate
how we can use a ""pDP to DP conversion"" step to design AdaOPS which uses
adaptive regularization to achieve the same results with
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP.

main sequence, suggesting the presence of multiple stellar populations with
ages which may differ even by hundreds million years (Mackey et al. 2008,
Milone et al. 2009, Girardi et al. 2011). A strongly debated question is
whether such an extended turnoff is instead due to populations with different
stellar rotations (Girardi et al. 2011, Goudfrooij et al. 2011, Rubele et al.
2013, Li et al. 2014). The recent discovery of a `split' main sequence in some
younger clusters (about 80--400Myr) added another piece to this puzzle. The
blue (red) side of the main sequence is consistent with slowly (rapidly)
rotating stellar models (D'Antona et al. 2015, Milone et al. 2016, Correnti et
al. 2017, Milone et al 2016), but a complete theoretical characterization of
the observed color-magnitude diagram appeared to require also an age spread
(Correnti et al. 2017). We show here that, in three clusters so far analyzed,
if the blue main sequence stars are interpreted with models that have been
always slowly rotating, they must be about 30% younger than the rest of the
cluster. If they are instead interpreted as stars initially rapidly rotating,
but that have later slowed down, the age difference disappears, and ""braking""
also helps to explain the apparent age differences of the extended turnoff. The
age spreads in Magellanic Cloud clusters are a manifestation of rotational
stellar evolution. Observational tests are suggested.

isotopes measured using the TITAN Penning trap and the recently measured
proton-separation energies of $^{29}$Cl and $^{30}$Ar. The atomic mass of
$^{27}$Mg was found to be within 1.6$\sigma$ of the value stated in the Atomic

the $^{29}$Mg mass excess and previous measurements of $^{29}$Cl we uncovered a
cubic coefficient of $d$ = 28(7) keV, which is the largest known cubic
coefficient of the IMME. This departure, however, could also be caused by
experimental data with unknown systematic errors. Hence there is a need to

quantities are shown to be single-letter upper bounds on the
secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of a quantum channel,

between the amortized entanglement of two channels is bounded from above by a
simple function of the diamond norm of their difference and the output
dimension of the channels. We then define approximately teleportation- and
positive-partial-transpose-simulable (PPT-simulable) channels as those that are
close in diamond norm to a channel which is either exactly teleportation- or
PPT-simulable, respectively. These results then lead to single-letter upper
bounds on the secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of

criteria to determine which transitions are extracted from the line list for
inclusion in the synthesis, and enables novel pedagogical and research
experiments in spectrum synthesis. This line selection flexibility is reflected
in the CSDB UI. The database extraction is very fast and would be appropriate
for the larger line lists of research-grade modeling codes. We also take the
opportunity to present major additions to the ChromaStar and CSS codes that are
also reflected in CSDB: i) TiO band opacity in the JOLA approximation, ii)
Metal b-f and Rayleigh scattering opacity, iii) 2D implementation of the flux

strained armchair terminated graphene nanoribbons. This is done by considering
a short-pulse spatial-periodic strain field. Then, the tight-binding
Hamiltonian of the system is mapped into a one dimensional ladder. The time
periodicity is considered within the Floquet formalism. Thus the quasienergy
spectrum is found numerically by diagonalizing the evolution operator. For some
particular cases, the quasienergy spectrum is found analytically. We find that
the system is able to support gapless and gapped phases. Very different edge
states emerge for both the gapless and the gapful phases. In the case of the
gapped phase, edge states emerge at the gap centered at zero quasienergy,
although the Chern number is zero due to the chiral symmetry of the system. For
the gapless phase, besides edge states at zero quasienergy, cosine like edge
states which merge and coexist with the bulk band are observed. To confirm the
topological nature of these edge states, we analytically obtained the effective
Hamiltonian and its spectrum for a particular case, finding that the edge
states are topologically weak. Finally, we found analytically the evolution of
band edges and its crossings as a function of the driven period. Topological
modes arise at such crossings.

of polarization is preferably oriented along the Local spiral arm, i.e. Y

thus the light curve deviates significantly from the lensing model that is

measure the microlensing parallax through the annual parallax effect. The
microlensing parallax parameters constrained by the ground-based data are
confirmed by the Spitzer observations through the satellite parallax method. By
additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the analysis of the
resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens are determined.
It is found that the binary lens is composed of two dwarf stars with masses
$M_1 = 0.606 \pm 0.028M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.125 \pm 0.006M_\odot$ in the

Specifically, at a given Lx/Ledd, for more rapidly rotating NSs we find lower
seed photon temperatures and a general increase in Comptonization strength, as
parametrised by the Comptonization y parameter and amplification factor A. This
is in good agreement with the theoretical scenario whereby less energy is
liberated in a boundary layer for more rapidly spinning NSs, resulting in a
lower seed photon luminosity and, consequently, less Compton cooling in the
corona. This effect in extremis results in the hard states of the most rapidly
spinning sources encroaching upon the regime of Comptonization properties

interior of supernovae, in particular SN 1986J. Young neutron stars are
involved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has
been suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be
produced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using
VLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact
component not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the
first time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr
old) supernova. We show that at age 30 yr, any FRB signal at ~1 GHz would still
be largely absorbed by the ejecta. By the time the ejecta have expanded so that
a 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN
ejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion
measures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to
propagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at
distances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc. We conclude that
if FRBs originate in Type II SNe/SNRs, they would likely not become visible
till 60 ~ 200 yr after the SN explosion.

computer vision applications, ranging from medical image analysis for

roads and rivers, and to biometrics and robotics, among others. %The visual
system of the brain has remarkable abilities to detect curvilinear structures
in noisy images. This is a nontrivial task especially for the detection of thin
or incomplete curvilinear structures surrounded with noise. We propose a
general purpose curvilinear structure detector that uses the brain-inspired
trainable B-COSFIRE filters. It consists of four main steps, namely nonlinear
filtering with B-COSFIRE, thinning with non-maximum suppression, hysteresis
thresholding and morphological closing. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a
data set of noisy images with cracked pavements, where we achieve
state-of-the-art results (F-measure=0.865). The proposed method can be employed
in any computer vision methodology that requires the delineation of curvilinear
and elongated structures.

  Communications",,,,,"cs.GT cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of random access contention between machine type
devices (MTDs) in the uplink of a wireless cellular network is studied. In
particular, the possibility of forming cooperative groups to coordinate the
MTDs' requests for the random access channel (RACH) is analyzed. The problem is
formulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the
players that seek to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function
that captures each MTD's energy consumption and time-varying queue length.
Within each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends the access
requests of the coalition members over the RACH. One key feature of this game
is its ability to cope with stochastic environments in which the arrival
requests of MTDs and the packet success rate over RACH are dynamically
time-varying. The proposed stochastic coalitional is composed of multiple
stages, each of which corresponds to a coalitional game in stochastic
characteristic form that is played by the MTDs at each time step. To solve this
game, a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed and shown
to converge to a stable MTD partition. Simulation results show that, on the
average, the proposed stochastic coalition formation algorithm can reduce the
average fail ratio and energy consumption of up to 36% and 31% for a
cluster-based distribution of MTDs, respectively, compared with a
noncooperative case. Moreover, when the MTDs are more sensitive to the energy
consumption (queue length), the coalitions' size will increase (decrease).

Skolemization, avoids the need for dealing with negative numbers, and reduces
the time complexity of inference. These two examples may be interesting from
three theoretical aspects: 1- they provide a better and deeper understanding of

evidence that there are larger classes of models for which domain recursion can

recovering a reward function from the observed actions of an agent. We
introduce a strategy to flexibly handle different types of actions with two
approximations of the Bellman Optimality Equation, and a Bellman Gradient
Iteration method to compute the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the
reward function. These methods allow us to build a differentiable relation
between the Q-value and the reward function and learn an approximately optimal
reward function with gradient methods. We test the proposed method in two
simulated environments by evaluating the accuracy of different approximations
and comparing the proposed method with existing solutions. The results show
that even with a linear reward function, the proposed method has a comparable
accuracy with the state-of-the-art method adopting a non-linear reward
function, and the proposed method is more flexible because it is defined on
observed actions instead of trajectories.

and theoreticians. Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the
number of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances and traits.
Although their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling
exponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that
ecological scaling laws are linked had been entertained before, but the full
extent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints
imposed by finite resource supply and a comprehensive empirical verification
are still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that
predicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species'
abundances and body sizes. We show that such framework is consistent with the
stationary state statistics of a broad class of resource-limited community
dynamics models, regardless of parametrization and model assumptions. We verify
predicted theoretical covariations by contrasting empirical data and provide
testable hypotheses for yet unexplored patterns. We thus place the observed
variability of ecological scaling exponents into a coherent statistical
framework where patterns in ecology embed constrained fluctuations.

for the first time filtration of radon from SF$_6$ gas by using a molecular

through the filters and a specially adapted Durridge RAD7 radon detector. In

significantly reduce the radon concentration without absorbing the SF$_6$ gas.

this analysis for the background field reproduced by a magnetohydrodynamic

find that all three CME source regions contain a coronal hole that is separated
from neighboring coronal holes by topologically very similar pseudo-streamer
structures. However, the two models yield very different results for the size,
shape, and flux of the coronal holes. We find that the helmet-streamer cusp

structurally unstable and does not form in the MHD model. Our analysis
indicates that generally, in MHD configurations, this line rather consists of a
multiple-null separator passing along the edge of disconnected flux regions.
Some of these regions are transient and may be the origin of so-called streamer
blobs. We show that the core topological structure of such blobs is a
three-dimensional ""plasmoid"", consisting of two conjoined flux ropes of
opposite handedness, which connect at a spiral null point of the magnetic
field. Our analysis reveals that such plasmoids appear also in pseudo-streamers

astrophysical reach of Advanced LIGO (once commissioning is complete) and
third-generation detectors. Adopting crystalline materials for thin, reflecting
mirror coatings, rather than the amorphous coatings used in current-generation
detectors, could potentially reduce thermal noise. Understanding and reducing
thermal noise requires accurate theoretical models, but modeling thermal noise
analytically is especially challenging with crystalline materials. Thermal
noise models typically rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which
relates the power spectral density of the thermal noise to an auxiliary elastic
problem. In this paper, we present results from a new, open-source tool that
numerically solves the auxiliary elastic problem to compute the Brownian
thermal noise for both amorphous and crystalline coatings. We employ
open-source frameworks to solve the auxiliary elastic problem using a
finite-element method, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing that
enables us to use high resolutions capable of resolving the thin reflective
coating. We compare with approximate analytic solutions for amorphous
materials, and we verify that our solutions scale as expected. Finally, we
model the crystalline coating thermal noise in an experiment reported by Cole
and collaborators (2013), comparing our results to a simpler numerical
calculation that treats the coating as an ""effectively amorphous"" material. We
find that treating the coating as a cubic crystal instead of as an effectively

step toward better understanding and reducing thermal noise to increase the

minimal assumptions, i.e. only that processing times have finite 1 + epsilon
moment and inter-arrival times have finite second moment, the sequence of
stationary queue length distributions, normalized by $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$, is
tight. All previous tightness results for the stationary queue length required
that processing times have finite 2 + epsilon moment. Furthermore, we develop
simple and explicit bounds on the stationary queue length in that setting.
  When processing times have an asymptotically Pareto tail with index alpha in
(1,2), we bound the large deviations behavior of the limiting process, and
derive a matching lower bound when inter-arrival times are Markovian.
Interestingly, we find that the large deviations behavior of the limit has a
sub-exponential decay, differing fundamentally from the exponentially decaying
tails known to hold in the light-tailed setting, and answering an open question
of Gamarnik and Goldberg.
  For the setting where instead the inter-arrival times have an asymptotically
Pareto tail with index alpha in (1,2), we extend recent results of Hurvich and
Reed (who analyzed the case of deterministic processing times) by proving that
for general processing time distributions, the sequence of stationary queue
length distributions, normalized by $n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, is tight (here we
use the scaling of Hurvich and Reed, i.e. Halfin-Whitt-Reed regime). We are
again able to bound the large-deviations behavior of the limit, and find that
our derived bounds do not depend on the particular processing time
distribution, and are in fact tight even for the case of deterministic

innovative numerical algorithms. We first establish the existence of optimal
solutions to the composite L0 regularization problem and its capped Lp
approximation problem under conditions that the data fitting function is
asymptotically level stable and bounded below. Asymptotically level stable
functions cover a rich class of data fitting functions encountered in practice.
We then prove that the capped Lp problem asymptotically approximates the
composite L0 problem if the data fitting function is a level bounded function
composed with a linear mapping. We further show that if the data fitting
function is the indicator function on an asymptotically linear set or the L0
norm composed with an affine mapping, then the composite L0 problem and its
capped Lp approximation problem share the same optimal solution set provided
that the approximation parameter is large enough.

problem in parallel computing with applications to debug- ging, testing and
runtime verification of parallel programs. Breadth-first search (BFS)
enumeration is especially useful for these applications as it finds an
erroneous consistent global state with the least number of events possible. The
total number of executed events in a global state is called its rank. BFS also
allows enumeration of all global states of a given rank or within a range of
ranks. If a computation on n processes has m events per process on average,
then the traditional BFS (Cooper-Marzullo and its variants) requires
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{m^{n-1}}{n})$ space in the worst case, whereas ou r
algorithm performs the BFS requires $\mathcal{O}(m^2n^2)$ space. Thus, we
reduce the space complexity for BFS enumeration of consistent global states
exponentially. and give the first polynomial space algorithm for this task. In
our experimental evaluation of seven benchmarks, traditional BFS fails in many
cases by exhausting the 2 GB heap space allowed to the JVM. In contrast, our
implementation uses less than 60 MB memory and is also faster in many cases.

Recently, the contrastive and triplet loss are proposed to enhance the
discriminative power of the deeply learned features, and have achieved
remarkable success. As can be seen, either the contrastive or triplet loss is
just one special case of the Euclidean distance relationships among these
training samples. Therefore, we propose a structured graph Laplacian embedding
algorithm, which can formulate all these structured distance relationships into
the graph Laplacian form. The proposed method can take full advantages of the
structured distance relationships among these training samples, with the
constructed complete graph. Besides, this formulation makes our method
easy-to-implement and super-effective. When embedding the proposed algorithm
with the softmax loss for the CNN training, our method can obtain much more
robust and discriminative deep features with inter-personal dispersion and
intra-personal compactness, which is essential to person Re-Id. We illustrate

making declarative graph traversal queries. Learning and inference models can

stolen images randomly and partly. We also develop a practical method to

the rural and remote places to the optical Point of Presence (PoP) over
distances of few kilometers. A lot of work has been done in the area of long
distance Wi-Fi networks. However, these networks require tall towers and high
gain (directional) antennas. Also, they work in the unlicensed band which has
Effective Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) limit (e.g. 1 W in India) which
restricts the network design. In this work, we propose a Long Term
Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) network operating in TV UHF to connect the remote
areas to the optical PoP. In India, around 100 MHz of TV UHF band IV (470-585
MHz) is unused at any location and can be put to an effective use in these
areas. We explore the idea of multi-hop topology for the proposed network. We
also compare the performance of the multi-hop network with the Point to
Multipoint (PMP) topology. The results show that multi-hop network performs
much better than the PMP network. We then formulate a Linear Programming (LP)
problem of generating optimal topology and compare its performance with the
multi-hop network. Overall, the analysis implies that an optimally planned
LTE-A network in TV UHF band can be a potential solution for affordable rural
broadband.

transport coefficients of glass-forming liquids determined at various
temperatures T and pressures P means the data conform to a single function of
the product variable TVgamma, where V is the specific volume and gamma is a
material specific constant. In the past two decades we have witnessed
successful TVgamma-scaling in many molecular, polymeric, and even metallic
glass-formers, and gamma is related to the slope of the repulsive part of the
intermolecular potential. The advances made indicate TVgamma-scaling is an
important aspect of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of glass-formers.
In this paper we show the origin of TVgamma-scaling is not from the structural
alpha-relaxation time. Instead it comes from its precursor, the
Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation or the primitive relaxation of the Coupling
Model and their relaxation times or tau_0 respectively. It is remarkable that
all relaxation times are functions of TVgamma with the same gama, as well as
the fractional exponent of the Kohlrausch correlation function of the
structural alpha-relaxation. We arrive at this conclusion convincingly based on
corroborative evidences from a number of experiments and molecular dynamics
simulations performed on a wide variety of glass-formers and in conjunction
with consistency with the predictions of the Coupling Model.

as a technique to improve the rate-versus-distance behavior of QKD systems by
using existing, or nearly-achievable, quantum technologies. The promise is that
MA-QKD would require less demanding quantum memories than the ones needed for
probabilistic quantum repeaters. Nevertheless, early investigations suggest
that, in order to beat the conventional no-memory QKD schemes, the quantum
memories used in the MA-QKD protocols must have high bandwidth-storage products
and short interaction times. Among different types of quantum memories,
ensemble-based memories offer some of the required specifications, but they
typically suffer from multiple excitation effects. To avoid the latter issue,
in this paper, we propose two new variants of MA-QKD both relying on
single-photon sources (SPSs) for entangling purposes. One is based on known
techniques for entanglement distribution in quantum repeaters. This scheme
turns out to offer no advantage even if one uses ideal SPSs. By finding the
root cause of the problem, we then propose another setup, which can outperform
single no-QM setups even if we allow for some imperfections in our SPSs. For
such a scheme, we compare the key rate for different types of ensemble-based
memories and show that certain classes of atomic ensembles can improve the
rate-versus-distance behavior.

given a multiplicative function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}$, the values of
$f(n)$ and $f(n+a)$ are ""generally"" independent unless $f$ is of a ""special""
form. First, we classify all bounded completely multiplicative functions having
uniformly large gaps between its consecutive values. This implies the solution
of the following folklore conjecture: for any completely multiplicative
function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{T}$ we have
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty}|f(n+1)-f(n)|=0.$$ Second, we settle an old conjecture
due to N.G. Chudakov [Actes du ICM ({N}ice, 1970), {T}. 1, p. 487] that states
that any completely multiplicative function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}$ that:
a) takes only finitely many values, b) vanishes at only finitely many primes,
and c) has bounded discrepancy, is a Dirichlet character. This generalizes
previous work of Tao on the Erd\H{o}s Discrepancy Problem. Finally, we show
that if many of the binary correlations of a 1-bounded multiplicative function
are asymptotically equal to those of a Dirichlet character $\chi$ mod $q$ then
$f(n) = \chi'(n)n^{it}$ for all $n$, where $\chi'$ is a Dirichlet character
modulo $q$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$. This establishes a variant of a conjecture
of H. Cohn for multiplicative arithmetic functions. The main ingredients

covered in the training data. So the models should be inherently robust and
adaptive to occlusions instead of fitting / learning the occlusion patterns in
the training data. Our approach detects semantic parts by accumulating the
confidence of local visual cues. Specifically, the method uses a simple voting
method, based on log-likelihood ratio tests and spatial constraints, to combine
the evidence of local cues. These cues are called visual concepts, which are
derived by clustering the internal states of deep networks. We evaluate our
voting scheme on the VehicleSemanticPart dataset with dense part annotations.
We randomly place two, three or four irrelevant objects onto the target object
to generate testing images with various occlusions. Experiments show that our
algorithm outperforms several competitors in semantic part detection when
occlusions are present.

regulation. They depend on how fast transcription factors (TFs) find and how
efficient they occupy their specific target sites. It is well known that target
site search is accelerated by TF binding to and sliding along unspecific DNA
and that unspecific associations alter the occupation frequency of a gene.
However, whether target site search time and occupation frequency can be
optimized simultaneously is mostly unclear. We developed a transparent and
intuitively accessible state-based formalism to calculate search times to
target sites on and occupation frequencies of promoters of arbitrary state
structure. Our formalism is based on dissociation rate constants experimentally
accessible in live cell experiments. To demonstrate our approach, we consider
promoters activated by a single TF, by two coactivators or in the presence of a
competitive inhibitor. We find that target site search time and promoter
occupancy differentially vary with the unspecific dissociation rate constant.
Both parameters can be harmonized by adjusting the specific dissociation rate
constant of the TF. However, while measured DNA residence times of various
eukaryotic TFs correspond to a fast search time, the occupation frequencies of
target sites are generally low. Cells might tolerate low target site
occupancies as they enable timely gene regulation in response to a changing
environment.

plasma wave (EPW) which is assumed to grow from the noise level, and to keep
growing at least up to the amplitude when linear theory in no longer valid
(while the wave evolution in the nonlinear regime may be arbitrary). The ions
are considered as a neutralizing fluid, while the electron response to the wave
is derived by matching two different techniques. We make use of a perturbation
analysis similar to that introduced to prove the Kolmogorov-Arnold- Moser

Our theory is applied to the growth and saturation of the beam-plasma

emphasis on nonlinear collisionless dissipation. We provide an explicit
theoretical expression for the nonlinear Landau-like damping rate which, in
some instances, is amenable to a simple analytic formula. We also insist on the
irreversible evolution of the electron distribution function, which is nonlocal
in the wave amplitude and phase velocity. This makes trapping an effective
means of dissipation for the electrostatic energy, and also makes the wave
dispersion relation nonlocal. Our theory is generalized to allow for stimulated
Raman scattering, which we address up to saturation by accounting for plasma
inhomogeneity and non-stationarity, nonlinear kinetic effects, and interspeckle

active particles interact with their neighbours within the framework of the
Lebwohl-Lasher model, and move anisotropically along their orientation to an
unoccupied nearest neighbour lattice site. An interplay of the activity,
thermal fluctuations and density gives rise distinct states in the system. For
a fixed temperature, the active nematic shows a disordered isotropic state, a
locally ordered inhomogeneous mixed state, and bistability between the
inhomogeneous mixed and a homogeneous globally ordered state in different
density regime. In the low temperature regime, the isotropic to the
inhomogeneous mixed state transition occurs with a jump in the order parameter
at a density less than the corresponding equilibrium disorder-order transition
density. Our analytical calculations justify the shift in the transition
density and the jump in the order parameter. We construct the phase diagram of

an interactively constrained encoding (ICE) scheme to incorporate motion and
appearance patterns into a graph that leads to a spatiotemporal energy
optimization. The reason of utilizing ICE is that both motion and appearance
cues for the same target share underlying correlative structure, thus can be

structural patterns about object perceptions throughout the whole framework.

partially explore the multi-object localization problem with inter-occlusion by
weighted bipartite graph matching. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark

basic building block of typical type inference algorithms. In particular,
polymorphic type inference in the Hindley--Milner type system (HM) can be
succinctly specified and executed in Prolog. In our previous work, we have
demonstrated that more advanced features of parametric polymorphism beyond HM,
such as type-constructor polymorphism and kind polymorphism, can be similarly
specified in Prolog. Here, we demonstrate a specification for records, which is
one of the most widely supported compound data structures in real-world
programming languages, and discuss the advantages and limitations of Prolog as
a specification language for type systems. Record types are specified as
order-irrelevant collections of named fields mapped to their corresponding
types. In addition, an open-ended collection is used to support row
polymorphism for record types to be extensible.

analogy to a Bell-type measurement and giving a straightforward account in
standard quantum mechanics. The delayed choice quantum eraser experiment turns
out to resemble a Bell-type scenario in which the paradox's resolution is
rather trivial, and so there really is no mystery. At first glance, the
experiment suggests that measurements on one part of an entangled photon pair
(the idler) can be employed to control whether the measurement outcome of the
other part of the photon pair (the signal) produces interference fringes at a
screen after being sent through a double slit. Significantly, the choice
whether there is interference or not can be made long after the signal photon
encounters the screen. The results of the experiment have been alleged to
invoke some sort of 'backwards in time influence'. I argue that this issue can
be eliminated by taking into proper account the role of the signal photon.
Likewise, in the de Broglie-Bohm picture the particle's trajectories can be
given a well-defined description at any instant of time during the experiment.
Thus, it is again clear that there is no need to resort to any kind of
'backwards in time influence'.

tracing sunspot groups during the period 1964-2016, using the Kanzelh\""ohe

white light images. Two procedures for the determination of the heliographic
positions were applied: an interactive procedure on the KSO sunspot drawings
(1964 - 2008, solar cycles nos. 20 - 23) and an automatic procedure on the KSO
white light images (2009 - 2016, solar cycle no. 24). For the determination of
the synodic angular rotation velocities two different methods have been used: a
daily shift (DS) method and a robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) method.
Afterwards, the rotation velocities had to be converted from synodic to
sidereal, which were then used in the least-squares fitting for the solar
differential rotation law. For the test data from 2014, we found the rLSQ
method for calculating rotational velocities to be more reliable than the DS
method. The best fit solar differential rotation profile for the whole time
period is $\omega(b)$ = (14.47 $\pm$ 0.01) - (2.66 $\pm$ 0.10) $\sin^2b$
(deg/day) for the DS method and $\omega(b)$ = (14.50 $\pm$ 0.01) - (2.87 $\pm$
0.12) $\sin^2b$ (deg/day) for the rLSQ method. A barely noticeable north -
south asymmetry is observed for the whole time period 1964 - 2016 in the
present paper. Rotation profiles, using different data sets (e.g. Debrecen
Photoheliographic Data, Greenwich Photoheliographic Results), presented by
other authors for the same time periods and the same tracer types, are in good
agreement with our results. Therefore, the KSO data set is suitable for the
investigation of the long-term variabilities in the solar rotation profile.

problem of learning a mapping from an image or a video frame to a crowd density

promising results for crowd counting. However, even when dealing with video
data, CNN-based methods still consider each video frame independently, ignoring
the strong temporal correlation between neighboring frames. To exploit the
otherwise very useful temporal information in video sequences, we propose a
variant of a recent deep learning model called convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)

captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we extend the
ConvLSTM model to a bidirectional ConvLSTM model which can access long-range
information in both directions. Extensive experiments using four publicly
available datasets demonstrate the reliability of our approach and the
effectiveness of incorporating temporal information to boost the accuracy of
crowd counting. In addition, we also conduct some transfer learning experiments
to show that once our model is trained on one dataset, its learning experience
can be transferred easily to a new dataset which consists of only very few

quantum technologies. Here we review the power of symmetry as a resource to
manipulate quantum transport, and apply these ideas to engineer novel quantum
devices. Using tools from open quantum systems and large deviation theory, we
show that symmetry-mediated control of transport is enabled by a pair of twin
dynamic phase transitions in current statistics, accompanied by a coexistence
of different transport channels. By playing with the symmetry decomposition of
the initial state, one can modulate the importance of the different transport
channels and hence control the flowing current. Motivated by the problem of
energy harvesting we illustrate these ideas in open quantum networks, an
analysis which leads to the design of a symmetry-controlled quantum thermal
switch. We review an experimental setup recently proposed for symmetry-mediated
quantum control in the lab based on a linear array of atom-doped optical
cavities, and the possibility of using transport as a probe to uncover hidden
symmetries, as recently demonstrated in molecular junctions, is also discussed.
Other symmetry-mediated control mechanisms are also described. Overall, these
results demonstrate the importance of symmetry not only as an organizing
principle in physics but also as a tool to control quantum systems.

question. Structures far from classical FCC or BCC phases are now commonly
experimentally observed in many different systems. Models based on pair
interaction between soft particle are at present much studied in 2D. Pair
interaction with two different lengths have been shown to lead to
quasicrystalline architectures. It is also the case for a hard core with a
square repulsive shoulder potential. In 3D, global approaches have been
proposed for instance by minimizing the interface area between the deformed
objects in the case of foams or micellar systems or using self-consistent mean
field theory in copolymer melts. In this paper we propose to compare a strong
van der Waals attraction between spherical hard cores and an elastic energy
associated to the deformation of the soft corona. This deformation is measured
as the shift between the deformed shell compared to a corona with a perfect
spherical symmetry. The two main parameters in this model are: the hard core
volume fraction and the weight of the elastic energy compared to the van der
Waals one. The elastic energy clearly favours the BCC structure but large van
der Waals forces favors Frank and Kasper phases. This result opens a route
towards controlling the building of nanoparticle superlattices with complex

prone to negative transfer for the partial transfer problem. We present
Selective Adversarial Network (SAN), which simultaneously circumvents negative

accumulated over 16 years (from 2000 to 2015). We compiled the forecast data
together with solar flare data obtained with the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES). Using the compiled data sets, we estimated
some conventional scalar verification measures with 95% confidence intervals.
We also estimated a multi-categorical scalar verification measure. These scalar
verification measures were compared with those obtained by the persistence
method and recurrence method. As solar activity varied during the 16 years, we
also applied verification analyses to four subsets of forecast-observation pair
data with different solar activity levels. We cannot conclude definitely that
there are significant performance difference between the forecasts of RWC Japan

for some event definitions. We propose to use a scalar verification measure to
assess the judgment skill of the operational solar flare forecast. Finally, we
propose a verification strategy for deterministic operational solar flare
forecasting.

Neumann index) of a graph's trace normalized combinatorial Laplacian provides
structural information about the level of centralization across a graph. This
is done by considering the Theil index, which is an established statistical
measure used to determine levels of inequality across a system of `agents',
e.g., income levels across a population. Here, we establish a Theil index for
graphs, which provides us with a macroscopic measure of graph centralization.
Concretely, we show that the von Neumann index can be used to bound the graph's
Theil index, and thus we provide a direct characterization of graph
centralization via the von Neumann index. Because of the algebraic similarities
between the bound and the Theil index, we call the bound the von Neumann Theil
index. %From an information theoretic perspective, the von Neumann Theil index
describes the mutual information between the quantum state corresponding to a
graph and the maximally mixed state (which corresponds to the complete graph).
We elucidate our ideas by providing examples and a discussion of different
$n=7$ vertex graphs. We also discuss how the von Neumann Theil index provides a
more comprehensive measure of centralization when compared to traditional
centralization measures, and when compared to the graph's classical Theil
index. This is because it more accurately accounts for macro-structural changes
that occur from micro-structural changes in the graph (e.g., the removal of a
vertex). Finally, we provide future direction, showing that the von Neumann
Theil index can be generalized by considering the R\'enyi entropy. We then show
that this generalization can be used to bound the negative logarithm of the
graph's Jain fairness index.

real-valued edge lengths and no vertices of degree two can be reconstructed

non-leaf vertex of $T$ has degree 3 then the number of distance values required
is linear in the number of leaves. A canonical candidate for such a set of
pairs of leaves in $T$ is the following: for each non-leaf vertex $v$, choose a
leaf in each of the three components of $T-v$, group these three leaves into
three pairs, and take the union of this set over all choices of $v$. This forms
a so-called 'triplet cover' for $T$. In the first part of this paper we answer
an open question (from 2012) by showing that the induced leaf-to-leaf distances
for any triplet cover for $T$ uniquely determine $T$ and its edge lengths. We
then investigate the finer combinatorial properties of triplet covers. In

magnetic-field-aligned electric fields in the polar funnel of an accreting
black hole (BH). Applying the pulsar outer-gap theory to BH magnetospheres, we
find that such a lepton accelerator arises in the immediate vicinity of the
event horizon due to frame-dragging, and that their gamma-ray luminosity
increases with decreasing accretion rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
gamma-ray flux is enhanced along the rotation axis by more than an order of
magnitude if the BH spin increases from $a=0.90M$ to $a=0.9999M$. As a result,
if a ten-solar-mass, almost-maximally rotating BH is located within 3 kpc, when
its accretion rate is between 0.005% and 0.01% of the Eddington rate, its
high-energy flare becomes detectable with the Fermi/Large Area Telescope,
provided that the flare lasts longer than 1.2 months and that we view the
source nearly along the rotation axis. In addition, its very-high-energy flux
is marginally detectable with the Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided that the
flare lasts longer than a night and that our viewing angle is about 45 degrees

difference of transmission vs. the sign of their incident parallel wavevector
normal to the in-plane magnetization. This asymmetry is universally scaled by a
unique function independent of the spin-orbit strength. This particular feature
is reproduced by a multiband $\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{p}$ tunneling transport

A-star in the triple-star system HD131399. We investigate a high-quality
spectrum of the primary component HD131399A obtained with FEROS on the ESO/MPG
2.2m telescope, aiming to characterise the star's atmospheric and fundamental
parameters, and to determine elemental abundances at high precision and
accuracy. The aim is to constrain the chemical composition of the birth cloud
of the system and therefore the bulk composition of the putative planet. A
hybrid non-local thermal equilibrium (non-LTE) model atmosphere technique is
adopted for the quantitative spectral analysis. Comparison with the most recent
stellar evolution models yields the fundamental parameters. The atmospheric and
fundamental stellar parameters of HD131399A are constrained to Teff=9200+-100
K, log g=4.37+-0.10, M=1.95+0.08-0.06 Msun, R=1.51+0.13-0.10 Rsun, and log
L/Lsun=1.17+-0.07, locating the star on the zero-age main sequence. Non-LTE
effects on the derived metal abundances are often smaller than 0.1dex, but can
reach up to ~0.8dex for individual lines. The observed lighter elements up to
calcium are overall consistent with present-day cosmic abundances, with a C/O
ratio of 0.45$\pm$0.07 by number, while the heavier elements show mild
overabundances. We conclude that the birth cloud of the system had a standard
chemical composition, but we witness the onset of the Am phenomenon in the
slowly rotating star. We furthermore show that non-LTE analyses have the
potential to solve the remaining discrepancies between observed abundances and
predictions by diffusion models for Am stars. Moreover, the present case allows
mass loss, not turbulent mixing, to be identified as the main transport process
competing with diffusion in very young Am stars.

the AR face database. Secondly, we propose a novel loss function called batch
triplet loss that improves the performance of the triplet loss by adding an
extra term to the loss function to cause minimisation of the standard deviation
of both positive and negative scores. We show consistent improvement in the

frontoparietal connections, interconnections of the dorsal medial frontal

assumed to switch between different operating modes. Specifically, piecewise
smooth (PWS) regression considers target functions switching deterministically
via a partition of the input space, while switching regression considers
arbitrary switching laws. The paper derives generalization error bounds in
these two settings by following the approach based on Rademacher complexities.
For PWS regression, our derivation involves a chaining argument and a
decomposition of the covering numbers of PWS classes in terms of the ones of
their component functions and the capacity of the classifier partitioning the
input space. This yields error bounds with a radical dependency on the number
of modes. For switching regression, the decomposition can be performed directly
at the level of the Rademacher complexities, which yields bounds with a linear
dependency on the number of modes. By using once more chaining and a
decomposition at the level of covering numbers, we show how to recover a
radical dependency. Examples of applications are given in particular for PWS
and swichting regression with linear and kernel-based component functions.

account for several anomalies in both ATLAS and CMS data at the LHC. This
hypothesis extends the standard model through the addition of two scalar bosons
and a hidden sector that can provide a dark matter candidate. This hidden
sector interacts with the standard model only through the mediation of one of
these scalars S. The couplings of S are not amenable to investigation in
current collider data and so are assumed to be Higgs-like to reduce the
parameter space of the model. Our previous work (Beck & Colafrancesco 2016) has
shown that these couplings can be limited via indirect dark matter detection
experiments in gamma-rays (for resonant annihilations into S). Here we will
treat the dark matter and S masses independently, and we generalise our
previous work and examine what fraction of the cosmological dark matter
abundance can be accounted for by particles in the hidden sector of the Madala
hypothesis dark matter when these annihilate to standard model products via a
Higgs-like S. We will also extend our gamma-ray analysis of Madala hypothesis
dark matter to include the constraints of diffuse radio data from the Coma
galaxy cluster in addition to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data from both this
target and the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy.
  Our analysis indicates that either the Madala hypothesis cannot provide the
bulk of cosmological dark matter, or the S boson cannot be simply Higgs-like.
These apply unless the candidate particle exceeds a mass of 200 GeV. Both these
scenarios may reduce the attractiveness of the hypothesis as the second case
will imply that many free parameters must be added to describe S, greatly
weakening fits for the model. To investigate the full consequences of this
further work will necessitate using larger astrophysical data sets to strongly
constrain details about S.

inflaton, a, may couple to the standard model hypercharge via a
Chern-Simons-type interaction, $L \subset a/(4\Lambda) F\tilde{F}$. This
coupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,
especially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological
consequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally
helical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon
number, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak
symmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during
inflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an
imprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this
paper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the
approximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of
baryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2)
examine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that
successful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~
3 x 10^17 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion. The
gauge field production at the end of inflation is then typically accompanied by
a peak in the GW spectrum at frequencies in the MHz range or above. The
detection of such a peak is out of reach of present-day technology; but in the
future, it may serve as a smoking-gun signal for baryogenesis from pseudoscalar
inflation. Conversely, models that do yield an observable GW signal suffer from
the overproduction of baryon number, unless the reheating temperature is lower
than the electroweak scale.

that $X_{i,j}=\text{trace}(A^iB^j)$ for $i=1,...,m$, and $j=1,...n$. PSD
factorization is NP-hard. In this work, we introduce several local optimization
schemes to tackle this problem: a fast projected gradient method and two
algorithms based on the coordinate descent framework. The main application of
PSD factorization is the computation of semidefinite extensions, that is, the
representations of polyhedrons as projections of spectrahedra, for which the
matrix to be factorized is the slack matrix of the polyhedron. We compare the
performance of our algorithms on this class of problems. In particular, we
compute the PSD extensions of size $k=1+ \lceil \log_2(n) \rceil$ for the
regular $n$-gons when $n=5$, $8$ and $10$. We also show how to generalize our
algorithms to compute the square root rank (which is the size of the factors in
a PSD factorization where all factor matrices $A^i$ and $B^j$ have rank one)
and completely PSD factorizations (which is the special case where the input
matrix is symmetric and equality $A^i=B^i$ is required for all $i$).

such as virulence and bioluminescence. Recent experiments have shown a
heterogeneous promoter activity of autoinducer synthase genes, suggesting that
some of the isogenic cells in a population might produce autoinducers, whereas
others might not. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotypic

non-producers replicate faster than producers. We show that the coupling

is a wide-field survey to detect Neptunes and super-Earths transiting bright
stars, which are suitable for precise radial velocity follow-up and
characterisation. Thereby, its sub-mmag photometric precision and ability to
identify false positives are crucial. Particularly, variable background objects
blended in the photometric aperture frequently mimic Neptune-sized transits and
are costly in follow-up time. These objects can best be identified with the
centroiding technique: if the photometric flux is lost off-centre during an
eclipse, the flux centroid shifts towards the centre of the target star.
Although this method has successfully been employed by the Kepler mission, it
has previously not been implemented from the ground. We present a
fully-automated centroid vetting algorithm developed for NGTS, enabled by our
high-precision auto-guiding. Our method allows detecting centroid shifts with
an average precision of 0.75 milli-pixel, and down to 0.25 milli-pixel for
specific targets, for a pixel size of 4.97 arcsec. The algorithm is now part of
the NGTS candidate vetting pipeline and automatically employed for all detected
signals. Further, we develop a joint Bayesian fitting model for all photometric
and centroid data, allowing to disentangle which object (target or background)
is causing the signal, and what its astrophysical parameters are. We
demonstrate our method on two NGTS objects of interest. These achievements make
NGTS the first ground-based wide-field transit survey ever to successfully
apply the centroiding technique for automated candidate vetting, enabling the
production of a robust candidate list before follow-up.

likelihood functions to estimate the habitability potential. It is defined as
the geometric mean of four sub-indexes related with four comparison criteria:
Is the planet telluric?; Does it have an atmosphere dense enough and a gravity
compatible with life?; Does it have liquid water on its surface?; Does it have
a magnetic field shielding its surface from harmful radiation and stellar
winds?. Only with seven physical characteristics, can the SEPHI be estimated:
Planetary mass, radius, and orbital period; stellar mass, radius, and effective
temperature; planetary system age. We have applied the SEPHI to all the planets

Kepler-186 f, and Kepler-442 b have the largest SEPHI values assuming certain

non-linear development of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) (with
a field-aligned interface) in an ideal gas close to the incompressible limit in
three dimensions. Numerical experiments are conducted in a domain sufficiently
large so as to allow the predicted critical modes to develop in a physically
realistic manner. The ratio between gravity, which drives the instability in
this case (as well as in several of the corresponding observations), and
magnetic field strength is taken up to a ratio which accurately reflects that
of observed astrophysical plasma, in order to allow comparison between the
results of the simulations and the observational data which served as
inspiration for this work. This study finds reduced non-linear growth of the
rising bubbles of the RTI for stronger magnetic fields, and that this is
directly due to the change in magnetic field strength, rather than the indirect
effect of altering characteristic length scales with respect to domain size. By
examining the growth of the falling spikes, the growth rate appears to be
enhanced for the strongest magnetic field strengths, suggesting that rather
than affecting the development of the system as a whole, increased magnetic
field strengths in fact introduce an asymmetry to the system. Further
investigation of this effect also revealed that the greater this asymmetry, the
less efficiently the gravitational energy is released. By better understanding
the under-studied regime of such a major phenomenon in astrophysics, deeper
explanations for observations may be sought, and this work illustrates that the
strength of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas influences observed RTI in
subtle and complex ways.

off their star formation, building the quiescent population that we observe in
the local Universe. From the GAMA and VIPERS surveys, we use spectroscopic
indices to select quiescent and candidate transition galaxies. We identify
potentially rapidly transitioning post-starburst galaxies, and slower
transitioning green-valley galaxies. Over the last 8 Gyrs the quiescent
population has grown more slowly in number density at high masses
(M$_*>10^{11}$M$_\odot$) than at intermediate masses
(M$_*>10^{10.6}$M$_\odot$). There is evolution in both the post-starburst and
green valley stellar mass functions, consistent with higher mass galaxies
quenching at earlier cosmic times. At intermediate masses
(M$_*>10^{10.6}$M$_\odot$) we find a green valley transition timescale of 2.6
Gyr. Alternatively, at $z\sim0.7$ the entire growth rate could be explained by
fast-quenching post-starburst galaxies, with a visibility timescale of 0.5 Gyr.
At lower redshift, the number density of post-starbursts is so low that an
unphysically short visibility window would be required for them to contribute
significantly to the quiescent population growth. The importance of the
fast-quenching route may rapidly diminish at $z<1$. However, at high masses
(M$_*>10^{11}$M$_\odot$), there is tension between the large number of
candidate transition galaxies compared to the slow growth of the quiescent
population. This could be resolved if not all high mass post-starburst and
green-valley galaxies are transitioning from star-forming to quiescent, for
example if they rejuvenate out of the quiescent population following the
accretion of gas and triggering of star formation, or if they fail to
completely quench their star formation.

population properties and radial gradients by applying a Centroidal Voronoi
Tesselation and performing a multi-color photometry SED fitting. This technique
has been applied to a sample of 29 massive (M$_{\star}$ > 10$^{10.5}$
M$_{\odot}$), early-type galaxies at $z$ < 0.3 from the ALHAMBRA survey. We
produced detailed 2D maps of stellar population properties (age, metallicity
and extinction). Radial structures have been studied and luminosity-weighted
and mass-weighted gradients have been derived out to 2 - 3.5 R$_\mathrm{eff}$.
We find the gradients of early-type galaxies to be on average flat in age
($\nabla$log Age$_\mathrm{L}$ = 0.02 $\pm$ 0.06 dex/R$_\mathrm{eff})$ and
negative in metallicity ($\nabla$[Fe/H]$_\mathrm{L}$ = - 0.09 $\pm$ 0.06
dex/R$_\mathrm{eff}$). Overall, the extinction gradients are flat
($\nabla$A$_\mathrm{v}$ = - 0.03 $\pm$ 0.09 mag/R$_\mathrm{eff}$ ) with a wide
spread. These results are in agreement with previous studies that used standard
long-slit spectroscopy as well as with the most recent integral field unit
(IFU) studies. According to recent simulations, these results are consistent
with a scenario where early-type galaxies were formed through major mergers and
where their final gradients are driven by the older ages and higher metallicity
of the accreted systems. We demonstrate the scientific potential of
multi-filter photometry to explore the spatially resolved stellar populations
of local galaxies and confirm previous spectroscopic trends from a
complementary technique.

sites recruited better than expected with no significant difference.
Completeness of clinical forms was significantly improved by eSource, but
Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMs) were less well completed on
smartphones than paper in this population.
  Discussion: The TRANSFoRm approach provides an ontologically-based approach
to eSource in a low-resource, heterogeneous, highly distributed environment,
that allows precise prospective mapping of data elements in the EHR.
  Conclusion: Further studies using this approach to CDISC should optimise the
delivery of PROMS, whilst building a sustainable infrastructure for eSource
with research networks, trials units and EHR vendors.

  states in $^{25,26}$F","14 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, submitted to PRC","Phys. Rev. C 96, 054305 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevC.96.054305",,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been
extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions. However, the evolution
of these interactions as a function of the binding energy, ultimately when
nuclei become unbound, is poorly known. The $^{26}$F nucleus, composed of a
deeply bound $\pi0d\_{5/2}$ proton and an unbound $\nu0d\_{3/2}$ neutron on top
of an $^{24}$O core, is particularly adapted for this purpose. The coupling of
this proton and neutron results in a $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet,
whose energies must be determined to study the influence of the proximity of
the continuum on the corresponding proton-neutron interaction. The $J^{\pi} =
1^{+}\_1, 2^{+}\_1,4^{+}\_1$ bound states have been determined, and only a
clear identification of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to
complete the study of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet in
$^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ unbound
state. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in
$^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous
experiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at
about $440A$\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to
populate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout
reactions on a CH$\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the
R$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added
to the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the
determination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in
$^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound
state in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a
$p\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV
is proposed to be the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ member of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 -
4^{+}\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been
compared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a
phenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium
similarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective
proton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\% in comparison to the
models, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in
theoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of
$^{26}$F.

frequently use an oscillating strategy, letting the velocity evolve between
fixed lower and upper bounds. We present a general justification of this very

dynamics, robust and easily adaptable for real-time control strategy. Effective
implementation in a competition prototype involved in low-consumption races
shows that automatic velocity control achieves performances comparable with the
results of trained human drivers. Major advantages of automatic control are
improved robustness and safety. The total average power consumption for the

Hamiltonian derived only from a single real-space image produced by scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM). Currently, there have been two main methods to
construct phase diagrams in material science: ab initio calculations and
CALPHAD with thermodynamic information obtained by experiments and/or
theoretical calculations. Although the two methods have successfully revealed a
number of unsettled phase diagrams, their results sometimes contradicted when
it is difficult to construct an appropriate Hamiltonian that captures the
characteristics of materials, e.g., for a system consisting of multiple-scale
objects whose interactions are essential to the system's characteristics.
Meanwhile, the advantage of our approach over existing methods is that it can
directly and uniquely determine the effective Hamiltonian without any
thermodynamic information. The validity of our approach is demonstrated through
an Mg--Zn--Y long-period stacking-ordered structure, which is a challenging
system for existing methods, leading to contradictory results. Our result
successfully reproduces the ordering tendency seen in STM images that previous
theoretical study failed to reproduce and clarifies its previously unknown
phase diagram. Thus, our approach can be used to clear up contradictions shown
by existing methods.

been proposed in this framework, such as the conjunctive rule, the cautious

rules can be adopted for different types of sources. However, most of these
rules are not applicable when the number of sources is large. This is due to
either the complexity or the existence of an absorbing element (such as the
total conflict mass function for the conjunctive-based rules when applied on
unreliable evidence). In this paper, based on the assumption that the majority
of sources are reliable, a combination rule for a large number of sources,
named LNS (stands for Large Number of Sources), is proposed on the basis of a
simple idea: the more common ideas one source shares with others, the
morereliable the source is. This rule is adaptable for aggregating a large
number of sources among which some are unreliable. It will keep the spirit of
the conjunctive rule to reinforce the belief on the focal elements with which
the sources are in agreement. The mass on the empty set will be kept as an
indicator of the conflict. Moreover, it can be used to elicit the major opinion
among the experts. The experimental results on synthetic mass functionsverify
that the rule can be effectively used to combine a large number of mass
functions and to elicit the major opinion.

automatically eliminate redundant convolution filters. We represent each
compressed network as a binary individual of specific fitness. Then, the
population is upgraded at each evolutionary iteration using genetic operations.
As a result, an extremely compact CNN is generated using the fittest
individual. In this approach, either large or small convolution filters can be
redundant, and filters in the compressed network are more distinct. In
addition, since the number of filters in each convolutional layer is reduced,
the number of filter channels and the size of feature maps are also decreased,
naturally improving both the compression and speed-up ratios. Experiments on

focusing or defocusing. In closed domains, focusing typically dominates and
projects the wave energy onto 'wave attractors'. For small-amplitude internal

can be balanced by viscous dissipation at high wave numbers. Contrary to what
was previously suggested, viscous dissipation in interior shear layers may not
be sufficient to explain the experiments on wave attractors in the classical

theory, we provide an elaborate description of the viscous dissipation in the

that even if the thin lateral Stokes boundary layers consist of no more than 1%
of the wall-to-wall distance, dissipation by lateral walls dominates at
intermediate wave numbers. Our extended model for the spectrum of 3D wave
attractors in equilibrium closes the gap between observations and theory by

Since writing, testing, and installing software patches can involve

needed to semantically characterize a syntactic consequence relation. Suszko
proved that every Tarskian consequence relation can be characterized using only
two truth values. Malinowski showed that this number can equal three if some of
Tarski's structural constraints are relaxed. By so doing, Malinowski introduced
a case of so-called mixed consequence, allowing the notion of a designated
value to vary between the premises and the conclusions of an argument. In this
paper we give a more systematic perspective on Suszko's problem and on mixed
consequence. First, we prove general representation theorems relating
structural properties of a consequence relation to their semantic
interpretation, uncovering the semantic counterpart of substitution-invariance,
and establishing that (intersective) mixed consequence is fundamentally the
semantic counterpart of the structural property of monotonicity. We use those
to derive maximum-rank results proved recently in a different setting by French
and Ripley, as well as by Blasio, Marcos and Wansing, for logics with various
structural properties (reflexivity, transitivity, none, or both). We strengthen
these results into exact rank results for non-permeable logics (roughly, those
which distinguish the role of premises and conclusions). We discuss the
underlying notion of rank, and the associated reduction proposed independently
by Scott and Suszko. As emphasized by Suszko, that reduction fails to preserve
compositionality in general, meaning that the resulting semantics is no longer
truth-functional. We propose a modification of that notion of reduction,
allowing us to prove that over compact logics with what we call regular
connectives, rank results are maintained even if we request the preservation of
truth-functionality and additional semantic properties.

convolutional encoder-decoder architecture combined with multi-level feature
concatenation and deep supervision. Then an adversarial network is utilized
during training process to discriminate the output of DI2IN from ground truth,
which further boosts the performance of DI2IN. The proposed method is trained
on an annotated dataset of 1000 CT volumes with various different scanning
protocols (e.g., contrast and non-contrast, various resolution and position)
and large variations in populations (e.g., ages and pathology). Our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of segmentation accuracy

centrifugally-supported gaseous discs embedded in cold dark matter (CDM) halos.
At fixed radius $R$, the shape of the vertical density profile depends only
weakly on whether the disc is self-gravitating (SG) or not (NSG). The disc
thickness, set by the midplane sound speed and circular velocity, $(c_s/V_c)R$,
in the NSG case, and by the sound speed and surface density, $c_s^2/G\Sigma$,
in SG discs, is smaller than either of these scales. SG discs are typically
Toomre unstable, NSG discs are stable. Exponential discs in CDM halos with
roughly flat circular velocity curves generally ""flare"" outwards. For the
polytropic equation of state of the EAGLE simulations, discs whose mass and
size match observational constraints are stable (NSG) for $M_d< 3\times 10^9\,
M_\odot$ and unstable (SG) at higher masses, if fully gaseous. We test these
analytic results using a set of idealized SPH simulations and find excellent
agreement. Our results clarify the role of the gravitational softening on the
thickness of simulated discs, and on the onset of radial instabilities. EAGLE
low-mass discs are non-self-gravitating so the softening plays no role in their
vertical structure. High-mass discs, on the other hand, are expected to be
self-gravitating and unstable, and may be artificially thickened and stabilized
unless gravity is well resolved. Simulations with spatial resolution high
enough to not compromise the vertical structure of a disc also resolve the
onset of their instabilities, but the converse is not true: resolving
instabilities does not guarantee that the vertical structure is resolved.

time, exploit the cache memory of both the trusted and untrusted BSs for
improving the system performance. Considering imperfect channel state

Benders decomposition (GBD) to solve the problem optimally, where the caching
and the cooperative transmission policies are determined via offline
(long-timescale) and online (short-timescale) optimization, respectively.
Furthermore, inspired by the optimal algorithm, a low-complexity suboptimal
algorithm based on a greedy heuristic is proposed. Simulation results show that
the proposed schemes achieve significant gains in power efficiency and secrecy

physics, chemistry, and bio-chemistry. In many applications the size of the
systems involved calls for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to
be used in their computational modeling, due to its unprecedented balance
between accuracy and efficiency. However, although exact in principle, in
practise approximations must be made for the exchange-correlation functional in
this theory, and the standard functional approximations perform poorly for
excitations which have a long-range charge-transfer component. Intense progress
has been made in developing more sophisticated functionals for this problem,
which we review. We point out an essential difference between the properties of
the exchange-correlation kernel needed for an accurate description of
charge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between closed-shell
fragments. We then turn to charge-transfer dynamics, which, in contrast to the
excitation problem, is a highly non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, process
involving a transfer of one full electron in space. This turns out to be a much
more challenging problem for TDDFT functionals. We describe dynamical step and
peak features in the exact functional evolving over time, that are missing in
the functionals currently used. The latter underestimate the amount of charge
transferred and manifest a spurious shift in the charge transfer resonance
position. We discuss some explicit examples.

present four new families of exact initial data for inhomogeneous cosmological
models at their maximum of expansion. These data generalise existing black hole
lattice models to situations that contain clusters of masses, and hence allow
the consequences of cosmological structures to be considered in a well-defined
and non-perturbative fashion. The degree of clustering is controlled by a
parameter $\lambda$, in such a way that for $\lambda \sim 0$ or $1$ we have
very tightly clustered masses, whilst for $\lambda \sim 0.5$ all masses are
separated by cosmological distance scales. We study the consequences of
structure formation on the total net mass in each of our clusters, as well as
calculating the cosmological consequences of the interaction energies both
within and between clusters. The locations of the shared horizons that appear
around groups of black holes, when they are brought sufficiently close
together, are also identified and studied. We find that clustering can have
surprisingly large effects on the scale of the cosmology, with models that
contain thousands of black holes sometimes being as little as 30% of the size
of comparable Friedmann models with the same total proper mass. This deficit is
comparable to what might be expected to occur from neglecting gravitational
interaction energies in Friedmann cosmology, and suggests that these quantities
may have a significant influence on the properties of the large-scale
cosmology.

exponentially with system size, at variance with the similar phase for the

contexts, which are determined by user and item profiles, and then make open
rate predictions accordingly. The item with the highest predicted open rate is
then chosen to be included in the push notification message for each user. The
parameters of the mixture model are optimized using an EM algorithm. A set of

inconsistencies in the results. In this paper, a modified OMP algorithm is
proposed to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting maximum variance based
criterion using only one snapshot. This criterion relaxes the imposed
restricted isometry property (RIP) on the measurement matrix to obtain the
sources and hence, reduces the sparsity of the input vector to the local OMP
algorithm. Moreover, it also tackles sources irrespective of their coherency.
The condition for the weak-1 RIP on decreased sparsity is derived and it is
shown that how the algorithm gives better result than the OMP algorithm. With
an addition to this, a simple method is also presented to calculate source
distance from the reference point in a uniform linear sensor array. Numerical

countries. In the Philippines, commercial loads have unused backup generation
of up to 3000 MW, at the same time there are shortages of as much as 700 MW
during peak demand. This gives utilities the incentive to implement Demand
Response programs to minimize this shortage. But when considering Demand
Response from a modeling perspective, social welfare through profit is always
the major objective for program implementation. That isn't always the case
during an emergency situation as there can be a trade-off between grid
resilience and cost of electricity.
  The question is how the Distribution Utility (DU) shall optimally allocate
the unused generation to meet the shortage when this trade-off exists. We
formulate a combined multi-objective optimal dispatch model where we can make a
direct comparison between the least-cost and resilience objectives.
  We find that this trade-off is due to the monotonically increasing nature of
energy cost functions. If the supply is larger than the demand, the DU can
perform a least-cost approach in the optimal dispatch since maximizing the
energy generated in this case can lead to multiple solutions. We also find in
our simulation that in cases where the supply of energy from the customers is
less than shortage quantity, the DU must prioritize maximizing the generated
energy rather than minimizing cost.

alternatives in time. Based on this interpretation of quantum theory the
existence of free objects in space, their symmetry properties and their
interactions shall be inferred. The alternatives are represented by binary
alternatives, which are called Ur-alternatives because of their logically
fundamental character. Through Ur-alternatives as elementary quantum
theoretical units of information the Copernican revolution with respect to the
question of space is realized in a consequent way. This means that not the
objects of nature are in a given space, but the existence of space arises as a
kind of indirect representation of relations between abstract quantum
theoretical objects. The Ur-alternatives do not exist in a given physical
reality, but the existence of space is constituted by Ur-alternatives at all.
Such a concept of reality is implicitly contained within the uncertainty
relation and can be seen especially in the EPR-paradoxon. It is shown in this
thesis in a mathematical consistent way that a state in the tensor space of
many Ur-alternatives can directly be mapped into a real three dimensional space
which means that together with the dynamics a representation in a
(3+1)-dimensional space-time becomes possible. By considering the $G_2$ an
approach for the incorporation of the internal symmetries can be suggested.
Furthermore the Ur-alternatives enable the constitution of a concept of
interaction, which is based on quantum theoretical entanglement. By using this
concept it is tried to obtain a purely quantum theoretical description of
electromagnetism and gravity. This corresponds to a much more principle and in
a radical sense background independent way of quantization.

Specifically, we first select different aspect images to generate the

extract a comprehensive spatial features, followed by dimensionality reduction
with the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network. Finally, we design a

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve 99.9%

interacting with the vacuum fluctuation in a measurable manner. In the quantum
electrodynamics calculation presented here, a photon traveling through the
vacuum is used as the test particle to determine properties of the vacuum
resulting from vacuum fluctuations. In particular, this article (1) discusses
the mathematical procedure for describing a lepton-antilepton bound state that
is a vacuum fluctuation, (2) describes the photon interacting with and being
incorporated into the bound state to form a quasi-stationary bound state, and
(3) calculates the electromagnetic decay rate of the quasi-stationary bound
state.

of a particle under the effects of a Snyder like deformation in the background
of the Kepler problem. In order to accomplish that task, a newtonian spacetime
is used. Newtonian spacetime is not a metric manifold, but allows to introduce
a torsion free connection in order to interpret the dynamic equations of the
deformed Kepler problem as geodesics in a curved spacetime. These geodesics and
the curvature terms of the Riemann and Ricci tensors show a mass and a
fundamental length dependence as expected, but are velocity independent. In
this sense, the effect of introducing a deformed algebra is examinated and the
corresponding curvature terms calculated, as well as the modifications of the
integrals of motion.

  Networks","6 pages, under submission to HPEC Graph Challenge",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic networks, especially those representing social networks, undergo
constant evolution of their community structure over time. Nodes can migrate
between different communities, communities can split into multiple new
communities, communities can merge together, etc. In order to represent dynamic
networks with evolving communities it is essential to use a dynamic model
rather than a static one. Here we use a dynamic stochastic block model where
the underlying block model is different at different times. In order to
represent the structural changes expressed by this dynamic model the network
will be split into discrete time segments and a clustering algorithm will
assign block memberships for each segment. In this paper we show that using an
ensemble of clustering assignments accommodates for the variance in scalable
clustering algorithms and produces superior results in terms of
pairwise-precision and pairwise-recall. We also demonstrate that the dynamic
clustering produced by the ensemble can be visualized as a flowchart which
encapsulates the community evolution succinctly.

points protected by chiral (sublattice) symmetry. The model system we consider
is the rhombohedral stack of graphene layers with each layer subjected to a
uniform external potential that respects either AIII or BDI classes. From the
Hamiltonians in either classes, a pair of nontrivial spiraling Dirac nodal
lines can be derived. The results are reasonable in accord to the topological
classification of gapless phases for codimension $2$. The nodal lines approach
each other as the magnitude of the potential increases, revealing their
annihilation due to the fact that regarding the full system their topological
invariants are cancelled out.

  Effects on Wired Communication Links""",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Power distribution grids are exploited by Power Line Communication (PLC)
technology to convey high frequency data signals. The natural conformation of
such power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signals
traveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. This causes
not only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to
power line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.
Since existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to
radiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate
network simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted
and radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to
common mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this
work allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission
matrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of
transmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The
results of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of
comprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated
phenomena.
