different doping concentrations using a set of long and thin diffused junction
diodes separated by various distances on the order of the diffusion length. The
methodology is described, including the ensuing analysis which yields diffusion
lengths between 70 - 85 um at room temperature for doping concentrations in the
range of 5 - 9 x 10^15 cm-3. The analysis also provides insight into the
minority carrier mobility which is a parameter not commonly reported in the
literature. Hole mobilities on the order of 500 - 750 cm2/Vs are reported for
the aforementioned doping range, which are comparable albeit longer than the
majority hole mobility for the same doping magnitude in p-InGaAs. A radiative
recombination coefficient of (0.5-0.2)x10^-10 cm^-3s^-1 is also extracted from
the ensuing analysis for an InGaAs thickness of 2.7 um. Preliminary evidence is
also given for both heavy and light hole diffusion. The dark current of
InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors with 25 and 15 um pitches are then calibrated
to device simulations and correlated to the extracted diffusion lengths and
doping concentrations. An effective Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of between
90-200 us provides the best fit to the dark current of these structures.

Joint Video Team (JVT) developed H.264/MVC to enhance the compression
efficiency for multiview video, however, MVC encoded multiview video (MVC
video) still requires high bitrates for transmission. This paper investigates
live MVC video streaming over Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The goal is to
minimize the server bandwidth costs whist ensuring high streaming quality to
peers. MVC employs intra-view and inter-view prediction structures, which leads
to a complicated layer dependency relationship. As the peers' outbound
bandwidth is shared while supplying all the MVC video layers, the bandwidth
allocation to one MVC layer affects the available outbound bandwidth of the
other layers. To optimise the utilisation of the peers' outbound bandwidth for
providing video layers, a maximum flow based model is proposed which considers
the MVC video layer dependency and the layer supplying relationship between
peers. Based on the model, a layer dependency aware live MVC video streaming
method over a BitTorrent-like P2P network is proposed, named MVP2P. The key
components of MVP2P include a chunk scheduling strategy and a peer selection
strategy for receiving peers, and a bandwidth scheduling algorithm for
supplying peers. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, MVP2P is
compared with existing methods considering the constraints of peer bandwidth,
peer numbers, view switching rates, and peer churns. The test results show that
MVP2P significantly outperforms the existing methods.

excess irradiation embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels at

dynamics model was developed to study the evolution of MNSPs in low- Cu RPV
steels. The model is based on CALPHAD thermodynamics and radiation enhanced
diffusion ki- netics. The thermodynamics dictates the compositional and
temperature dependence of the free energy reductions that drive precipitation.
The model treats both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, where the
latter occurs on cascade damage, like dislocation loops. The model has only
four adjustable parameters that were fit to an atom probe tomography (APT)
database. The model predictions are in semi-quantitative agreement with
systematic Mn, Ni and Si composition variations in alloys character- ized by
APT, including a sensitivity to local tip-to-tip variations even in the same
steel. The model predicts that heterogeneous nucleation plays a critical role
in MNSP formation in lower alloy Ni contents. Single variable assessments of
compositional effects show that Ni plays a dominant role, while even small
variations in irradiation temperature can have a large effect on theMNSP
evolution. Within typical RPV steel ranges, Mn and Si have smaller effects. The
delayed but then rapid growth of MNSPs to large volume fractions at high
fluence is well predicted by the model. For purposes of illustration, the
effect of MNSPs on transition temperature shifts are presented based on
well-established microstructure-prop- erty and property-property models.

represents a challenge for planet formation theory: how did they avoid runaway
gas accretion and collapsing to hot Jupiters despite their core masses being in
the critical range of $M_\mathrm{c} \simeq 10 M_\mathrm{\oplus}$? Previous
three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of
low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc,
contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is
referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the
recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D
radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the
evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D
atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses
entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the
disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,
potentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.
Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous
studies. However, we also identify an ""inner core"" -- in size $\approx$ 25% of
the Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much
lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are
needed to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on
long time-scales.

Understanding the temporal intent of the user and retrieving the most relevant

quantifiers of chaos to identify changes in the dynamical structure of complex
systems preceding critical transitions. As suitable indicator variables for
critical transitions, we consider changes in growth rates and directions of
covariant Lyapunov vectors. Studying critical transitions in several models of
fast-slow systems, i.e., a network of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators,
models for Josephson junctions and the Hindmarsh-Rose model, we find that
tangencies between covariant Lyapunov vectors are a common and maybe generic
feature during critical transitions. We further demonstrate that this deviation
from hyperbolic dynamics is linked to the occurrence of critical transitions by
using it as an indicator variable and evaluating the prediction success through
receiver operating characteristic curves. In the presence of noise, we find the
alignment of covariant Lyapunov vectors and changes in finite-time Lyapunov
exponents to be more successful in announcing critical transitions than common
indicator variables as, e.g., finite-time estimates of the variance.
Additionally, we propose a new method for estimating approximations of
covariant Lyapunov vectors without knowledge of the future trajectory of the
system. We find that these approximated covariant Lyapunov vectors can also be
applied to predict critical transitions.

widely-used approach in the field of genetics for whole genome sequencing,

on three main steps. First, a brute-force WSD algorithm is applied to short
context windows (up to 10 words) selected from the document in order to
generate a short list of likely sense configurations for each window. In the
second step, these local sense configurations are assembled into longer
composite configurations based on suffix and prefix matching. The resulted
configurations are ranked by their length, and the sense of each word is chosen
based on a voting scheme that considers only the top k configurations in which
the word appears. We compare our algorithm with other state-of-the-art
unsupervised WSD algorithms and demonstrate better performance, sometimes by a
very large margin. We also show that our algorithm can yield better performance
than the Most Common Sense (MCS) baseline on one data set. Moreover, our
algorithm has a very small number of parameters, is robust to parameter tuning,
and, unlike other bio-inspired methods, it gives a deterministic solution (it
does not involve random choices).

very popular for sparse recovery in these settings. Restricted Eigenvalue (RE)
condition is among the weakest, and hence the most general, condition in
literature imposed on the Gram matrix that guarantees nice statistical
properties for the Lasso estimator. It is natural to ask: what families of
matrices satisfy the RE condition? Following a line of work in this area, we
construct a new broad ensemble of dependent random design matrices that have an
explicit RE bound. Our construction starts with a fixed (deterministic) matrix
$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ satisfying a simple stable rank condition, and
we show that a matrix drawn from the distribution $X \Phi^\top \Phi$, where
$\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ is a subgaussian random matrix, with high
probability, satisfies the RE condition. This construction allows incorporating
a fixed matrix that has an easily {\em verifiable} condition into the design
process, and allows for generation of {\em compressed} design matrices that
have a lower storage requirement than a standard design matrix. We give two
applications of this construction to sparse linear regression problems,
including one to a compressed sparse regression setting where the regression
algorithm only has access to a compressed representation of a fixed design
matrix $X$.

generalized to periodically driven heat engines only recently. These results
include a general expression for entropy production in terms of currents and

relations can be obtained from the more general fluctuation theorem for the

circularization for the core of a giant planet after it is scattered from an
inner disk region by a more massive planet, which was proposed by Kikuchi et al
(2014). We extend their model for single star systems to binary (multiple) star
systems, by taking into account tidal truncation of the protoplanetary gas disk
by a binary companion. As an example, we consider a wide-orbit gas giant in a
hierarchical triple system, HD131399Ab. The best-fit orbit of the planet is
that with semimajor axis $\sim 80$ au and eccentricity $\sim 0.35$. As the
binary separation is $\sim 350$ au, it is very close to the stability limit,
which is puzzling. With the original core location $\sim 20$-30 au, the core

our model reproduces the best-fit orbit of HD131399Ab. We find that the orbit
after the circularization is usually close to the stability limit against the
perturbations from the binary companion, because the scattered core accretes
gas from the truncated disk. Our conclusion can also be applied to wider or
more compact binary systems if the separation is not too large and another
planet with $> \sim$ 20-30 Earth masses that scattered the core existed in

effects are temperature and polarization anisotropies induced by the scattering
of CMB photons from structure in the post-reionization Universe. In the case of
the kSZ effect, small angular scale anisotropies in the optical depth are
modulated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole field, i.e. the CMB
dipole observed at each spacetime point, which is sourced by the primordial
dipole and especially the local peculiar velocity. In the case of the pSZ
effect, similar small-scale anisotropies are modulated by the CMB quadrupole
field, which receives contributions from both scalar and tensor modes.
Statistical anisotropies in the cross correlations of CMB temperature and
polarization with tracers of the inhomogeneous distribution of electrons
provide a means of isolating and reconstructing the dipole and quadrupole
fields. In this paper, we present a set of unbiased minimum variance quadratic
estimators for the reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields, and
forecast the ability of future CMB experiments and large scale structure
surveys to perform this reconstruction. Consistent with previous work, we find
that a high fidelity reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields over a
variety of scales is indeed possible, and demonstrate the sensitivity of the
pSZ effect to primordial tensor modes. Using a principle component analysis, we
estimate how many independent modes could be accessed in such a reconstruction.
We also comment on a few first applications of a detection of the dipole and
quadrupole fields, including a reconstruction of the primordial contribution to
our locally observed CMB dipole, a test of statistical homogeneity on large
scales from the first modes of the quadrupole field, and a reconstruction
technique for the primordial potential on the largest scales.

is a highly pursued goal. Prominent proposed realization schemes include
semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures and set stringent constraints on
the chemical potential of the system. However, the ability to keep the chemical
potential in the required range while in the presence of an adjacent SC and its
accompanied screening effects, is a great experimental challenge. In this work,
we study a SC lattice structure in which the SC is deposited periodically on a
one- or two-dimensional sample. We demonstrate that this realization platform
overcomes the challenge of controlling the chemical potential in the presence
of the superconductor's electrostatic screening. We show how Majorana bound
states emerge at the ends of a one-dimensional system proximity coupled to a
one-dimensional SC lattice, and move on to present a SC-lattice-based
realization of the two-dimensional px+ipy SC, hosting chiral Majorana modes at
its edges. In particular, we establish that even when assuming the worst case
of absolute screening, in which the chemical potential under the SC is
completely unaffected by the external gate potential, the topological phase can
be reached by tuning the chemical potential in the area not covered by the SC.
Finally, we briefly discuss possible effects of Coulomb blockade on the
properties of the system.

heuristically, to compare various classes of transient events, to explore the
origin of new transients, and to influence optical survey observing strategies.
For example, several observational searches have been guided by intriguing
voids and gaps in this phase space. However we should ask: Do we expect to find
transients in these voids given our understanding of the various heating
sources operating in astrophysical transients? In this work, we explore a broad
range of theoretical models and empirical relations to generate optical light
curves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS). We explore
transients powered by adiabatic expansion, radioactive decay, magnetar
spin-down, and circumstellar interaction. For each heating source, we provide a
concise summary of the basic physical processes, a physically motivated choice
of model parameter ranges, an overall summary of the resulting light curves and
their the occupied range in the DLPS, and how the various model input
parameters affect the light curves. We specifically explore the key voids
discussed in the literature: the intermediate luminosity gap between classical
novae and supernovae, and short-duration transients (<10 days). We find that
few physical models lead to transients that occupy these voids. Moreover, we
find that only relativistic expansion can produce fast and luminous transients,
while for all other heating sources, events with durations <10 days are dim (>
-15 mag). Finally, we explore the detection potential of optical surveys (e.g.,
LSST) in the DLPS and quantify the notion that short-duration and dim
transients are exponentially more difficult to discover in untargeted surveys.

class of multi-component dynamical systems. We address a system whose failure
corresponds to a physical variable of the system (temperature, pressure, water
level) entering a critical region. Such systems are common in hydraulic and
nuclear industry. In these systems, the statuses of the components (on, off, or
out-of-order) determine the dynamics of the physical variables, and is altered
both by deterministic feedback mechanisms and random failures or repairs. In
order to deal with this interplay between components status and physical
variables we model trajectory using piecewise deterministic Markovian processes
(PDMP). We show how to adapt the importance sampling method to PDMP, by
introducing a reference measure on the trajectory space, and we present a
biasing strategy for importance sampling. A simulation study compares our

scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging. By measuring
interlayer separations and comparing these to density functional theory (DFT)
calculations we find that pristine interfaces exist between hBN and MoS2 or WS2
for stacks prepared by mechanical exfoliation in air. However, for two
technologically important transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) systems, MoSe2
and WSe2, our measurement of interlayer separations provide the first evidence
for impurity species being trapped at buried interfaces with hBN: interfaces
which are flat at the nanometer length scale. While decreasing the thickness of
encapsulated WSe2 from bulk to monolayer we see a systematic increase in the
interlayer separation. We attribute these differences to the thinnest TMDC
flakes being flexible and hence able to deform mechanically around a sparse
population of protruding interfacial impurities. We show that the air sensitive
two dimensional (2D) crystal NbSe2 can be fabricated into heterostructures with
pristine interfaces by processing in an inert-gas environment. Finally we find
that adopting glove-box transfer significantly improves the quality of

the DarkSide Collaboration is going to construct DarkSide-20k, a direct WIMP
search detector using a two-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC)
with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 t (20 t). The DarkSide-20k LArTPC will be
deployed within a shield/veto with a spherical Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV)
inside a cylindrical Water Cherenkov Veto (WCV). Operation of DarkSide-50
demonstrated a major reduction in the dominant $^{39}$Ar background when using
argon extracted from an underground source, before applying pulse shape
analysis. Data from DarkSide-50, in combination with MC simulation and
analytical modeling, shows that a rejection factor for discrimination between
electron and nuclear recoils of $\gt3\times10^9$ is achievable. This, along
with the use of the veto system, is the key to unlocking the path to large
LArTPC detector masses, while maintaining an ""instrumental background-free""
experiment, an experiment in which less than 0.1 events (other than
$\nu$-induced nuclear recoils) is expected to occur within the WIMP search
region during the planned exposure. DarkSide-20k will have ultra-low
backgrounds than can be measured in situ. This will give sensitivity to
WIMP-nucleon cross sections of $1.2\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ ($1.1\times10^{-46}$
cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$ TeV$/c^2$ ($10$ TeV$/c^2$) mass, to be achieved during
a 5 yr run producing an exposure of 100 t yr free from any instrumental
background. DarkSide-20k could then extend its operation to a decade,
increasing the exposure to 200 t yr, reaching a sensitivity of
$7.4\times10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ ($6.9\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$) for WIMPs of $1$

provides force cues to the human, during the reach-to-grasp phase, which
encourage the human to select grasp poses which maximise manipulation

a certified ""human-safe"" (e.g. compliant) arm may become hazardous once it

edges or other dangers. Additionally, minimising collision forces is critical
to preserving the longevity of robots which operate in uncertain and hazardous

a damaged robot from a contaminated zone for repairs may be extremely difficult
and costly. Also, unwanted collisions between a robot and critical
infrastructure (e.g. pipework) in such high-consequence environments can be
disastrous. In this paper, we investigate how the safety of the post-grasp

selected grasp is optimal in terms applying minimum impact forces if a

demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several experiments with

chaotic orbit would reveal a fully chaotic nature. This situation needs
clarification, because partially chaotic orbits might play a significant role

perform a counterfactual analysis and show that they significantly improved the

hardware, it is even more critical to understand how a neural network, as a

its communication channels, synapses. Experimentally assessing the robustness
of neural networks involves the quixotic venture of testing all the possible
failures, on all the possible inputs, which ultimately hits a combinatorial

inputs for the second.
  In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the expected error of the output

neurons activation function, and an exponential dependency on the depth of the

layered IC detector (IBA) calibrated in terms of penetration range in water.
The analysis of the measured Bragg peak determines penetration range in water
which can be subsequently converted into proton beam energy using Range-Energy
tables. We extended this analysis to obtain an estimate of the beam energy
spread out of the cyclotron. Using Monte Carlo simulations we established the
correlation between Bragg peak shape parameters (width at 50% and 80% dose
levels, distal falloff) and penetration range for a monoenergetic proton beam.
Then we studied how this correlation changes when the shape of Bragg peak is
distorted by the beam focusing conditions. We found that small field size or
diverging beam cause Bragg peak deformation predominantly in the proximal
region. The distal shape of the renormalized Bragg peaks stays nearly constant.
This excludes usage of Bragg peak width parameters for energy spread estimates.
The measured Bragg peaks had an average distal falloff of 4.86mm, which
corresponds to an effective range of 35.5cm for a monoenergetic beam. The
32.7cm measured penetration range is 2.8cm less. Passage of a 230 MeV proton
beam through a 2.8cm thick slab of water results in a 0.56 MeV energy spread.
As a final check, we confirmed agreement between shapes of the measured Bragg

spread.

hull does. As a consequence, we offer a new, short proof of a result from
[Draga and Kochanek 2016] regarding the behavior of summability of Szlenk index
under $c_0$ direct sums. We also use this result to prove that the injective
tensor product of two Banach spaces has summable Szlenk index if both spaces
do, which answers a question from [Draga and Kochanek 2017]. As a final
consequence of this result, we prove that a separable Banach space has summable
Szlenk index if and only if it embeds into a Banach space with an asymptotic
$c_0$ finite dimensional decomposition, which generalizes a result from [Odell
et al 2008]. We also introduce an ideal norm $\mathfrak{s}$ on the class
$\mathfrak{S}$ of operators with summable Szlenk index and prove that
$(\mathfrak{S}, \mathfrak{s})$ is a Banach ideal. For $1\leqslant p\leqslant
\infty$, we prove precise results regarding the summability of the Szlenk index
of an $\ell_p$ direct sum of a collection of operators.

(providing the main contribution to the fullerene absorption spectrum) are
found to be actually volume ones in their spatial structure, and the frequency
of the higher of them becomes larger than the plasma frequency (as with all the

differentiation. However not much attention has been given to the process which
is inverse to differentiation: integration. This paper presents the parallel
development for integration by axiomatizing an integral transformation, $s_A:
!A \to !A \otimes A$, in a symmetric monoidal category with a coalgebra
modality. When integration is combined with differentiation, the two
fundamental theorems of calculus are expected to hold (in a suitable sense): a
differential category with integration which satisfies these two theorem is
called a {\em calculus category\/}.
  Modifying an approach to antiderivatives by T. Ehrhard, we define having
antiderivatives as the demand that a certain natural transformation, $K: !A \to
!A$, is invertible. We observe that a differential category having
antiderivatives, in this sense, is always a calculus category.
  When the coalgebra modality is monoidal, it is natural to demand an extra
coherence between integration and the coalgebra modality. In the presence of
this extra coherence we show that a calculus category with a monoidal coalgebra
modality has its integral transformation given by antiderivatives and, thus,
that the integral structure is uniquely determined by the differential
structure.
  The paper finishes by providing a suite of separating examples. Examples of
differential categories, integral categories, and calculus categories based on
both monoidal and (mere) coalgebra modalities are presented. In addition,
differential categories which are not integral categories are discussed and
vice versa.

such as Network Time Proto- col (NTP). However GPS based solutions have poor
reception in indoor environments and dense urban canyons as well as GPS antenna
installation might be costly. Some smart grid nodes such as Phasor Measurement
Units (PMUs), fault detection, Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) etc.,
requires synchronous accuracy as low as 1 ms. On the other hand, 1 sec accuracy
is acceptable in management information domain. Acknowledging this, in this
study, we introduce gossip algorithm based clock synchronization method among
network entities from the decision control and communication point of view. Our
method synchronizes clock within dense network with a bandwidth limited
environment. Our technique has been tested in different kinds of network
topologies- complete, star and random geometric network and demonstrated
satisfactory performance.

the use of these ensembles in statistical descriptions. However, there is still
no full consensus on the precise reasoning justifying the use of such

ensembles taking a strictly operational perspective. We investigate the set of
possible transitions that a system can undergo together with an environment,
when one only has partial information about both the system and its
environment. The set of all these allowed transitions encodes thermodynamic
laws and limitations on thermodynamic tasks as particular cases. Our main
result is that the set of allowed transitions coincides with the one possible
if both system and environment were assigned the maximum entropy state
compatible with the partial information. This justifies the overwhelming
success of such ensembles and provides a derivation without relying on
considerations of typicality or information-theoretic measures.

extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of

  We show that the ""average"" asteroseismic parameter $\delta\nu_{02}$, derived
from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between
the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars.
  Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both
empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with
independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections.
Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to
be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling
relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be
$1.61\pm0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ and $1.64{\pm}0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$,
respectively. The difference $\Delta M=-0.03\pm0.01\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ is
almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if

believed to be the products of mass transfer in binary systems from a now
extinct AGB primary star. The mass of the AGB star and the orbital parameters
of the system are the key factors usually considered when determining how much
mass is transferred onto the lower-mass main-sequence companion. What is
usually neglected, however, is the angular momentum of the accreted material,
which should spin up the accreting star. If the star reaches critical rotation,
further accretion should cease until the excess angular momentum is somehow
dealt with. If the star cannot redistribute or lose the angular momentum while
the primary is on the AGB, the amount of mass accreted could be much lower than
otherwise expected. Here we present calculations, based on detailed stellar
evolution models, of the mass that can be accreted by putative progenitors of
Ba and CEMP stars before they reach critical rotation under the assumption that
no angular momentum loss occurs during the mass transfer. We consider different
accretion rates and values of specific angular momentum. The most stringent
limits on the accreted masses result from considering accretion from a
Keplerian accretion disk, which is likely present during the formation of most
extrinsically-polluted carbon-enriched stars. Our calculations indicate that in
this scenario only about 0.05 solar masses of material can be added to the
accreting star before it reaches critical rotation, which is much too low to
explain the chemical enrichment of many Ba and CEMP stars. Either the specific
angular momentum of the accreted material has to effectively be lower by about
a factor of ten than the Keplerian value, or significant angular momentum
losses must occur for substantial accretion to take place.

solving dCMEs is intractable due to the exploding size of the state space. It
is important to truncate the state space effectively with quantified errors, so
accurate solutions can be computed. It is also important to know if all major
probabilistic peaks have been computed. Here we introduce the Accurate CME
(ACME) algorithm for obtaining direct solutions to dCMEs. With multi-finite
buffers for reducing the state space by O(n!), exact steady-state and
time-evolving network probability landscapes can be computed. We further
describe a theoretical framework of aggregating microstates into a smaller
number of macrostates by decomposing a network into independent aggregated
birth and death processes, and give an a priori method for rapidly determining
steady-state truncation errors. The maximal sizes of the finite buffers for a
given error tolerance can also be pre-computed without costly trial solutions
of dCMEs. We show exactly computed probability landscapes of three multi-scale
networks, namely, a 6-node toggle switch, 11-node phage-lambda epigenetic

the ACME method enables accurate and efficient solutions of the dCME for a

dynamics that accounts for demographic noise. In the spirit of the methodology
used by statistical physicists, transitions between the states of the system
are caused by individual events while the dynamics are described in terms of
the time-evolution of a probability density function. In general, the
application of the diffusion approximation still leaves a description that is
quite complex. However, in many biological applications one or more of the
processes happen slowly relative to the system's other processes, and the
dynamics can be approximated as occurring within a slow low-dimensional
subspace. We review these time-scale separation arguments and analyse the more
simple stochastic dynamics that result in a number of cases. We stress that it
is important to retain the demographic noise derived in this way, and emphasise
this point by showing that it can alter the direction of selection compared to
the prediction made from an analysis of the corresponding deterministic model.

studying stochasticity in mesoscopic reaction networks. Since its direct
solution rapidly becomes intractable due to the increasing size of the state
space, truncation of the state space is necessary for solving most dCMEs. It is
therefore important to assess the consequences of state space truncations so
errors can be quantified and minimized. Here we describe a novel method for
state space truncation. By partitioning a reaction network into multiple
molecular equivalence groups (MEG), we truncate the state space by limiting the
total molecular copy numbers in each MEG. We further describe a theoretical
framework for analysis of the truncation error in the steady state probability
landscape using reflecting boundaries. By aggregating the state space based on
the usage of a MEG and constructing an aggregated Markov process, we show that
the truncation error of a MEG can be asymptotically bounded by the probability
of states on the reflecting boundary of the MEG. Furthermore, truncating states
of an arbitrary MEG will not undermine the estimated error of truncating any
other MEGs. We then provide an error estimate for networks with multiple MEGs.
To rapidly determine the appropriate size of an arbitrary MEG, we introduce an
a priori method to estimate the upper bound of its truncation error, which can
be rapidly computed from reaction rates, without costly trial solutions of the
dCME. We show results of applying our methods to four stochastic networks. We
demonstrate how truncation errors and steady state probability landscapes can
be computed using different sizes of the MEG(s) and how the results validate
out theories. Overall, the novel state space truncation and error analysis
methods developed here can be used to ensure accurate direct solutions to the
dCME for a large class of stochastic networks.

collisional term is integrated implicitly in time, while the advective term is
integrated explicitly in time, thus allowing time step sizes that are
comparable to the advective time scales. This partitioning results in a more

step sizes are constrained by the stiff collisional time scales. We implement

from social activity limiting their own potential to spread. Successful
transmission therefore requires the onset of infectiousness to coincide with a
time when its host is socially active. Since social activity and infectiousness
are both temporal phenomena, we hypothesize that diseases are most pervasive
when these two processes are synchronized. We consider disease dynamics that
incorporate a behavioral response that effectively shortens the infectious
period of the disease. We apply this model to data collected from face-to-face
social interactions and look specifically at how the duration of the latent
period effects the reachability of the disease. We then simulate the spread of
the model disease on the network to test the robustness of our results.
Diseases with latent periods that synchronize with the temporal social behavior
of people, i.e. latent periods of 24 hours or 7 days, correspond to peaks in
the number of individuals who are potentially at risk of becoming infected. The
effect of this synchronization is present for a range of disease models with
realistic parameters. The relationship between the latent period of an
infectious disease and its pervasiveness is non-linear and depends strongly on
the social context in which the disease is spreading.

potential to precisely calibrate systematic photometric redshift uncertainties
arising from the unavailability of complete and representative training and
validation samples of galaxies. However, application of this technique in the
Dark Energy Survey (DES) is hampered by the relatively low number density,
small area, and modest redshift overlap between photometric and spectroscopic
samples. We propose instead using photometric catalogs with reliable
photometric redshifts for photo-z calibration via cross-correlations. We verify
the viability of our proposal using redMaPPer clusters from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) to successfully recover the redshift distribution of SDSS
spectroscopic galaxies. We demonstrate how to combine photo-z with
cross-correlation data to calibrate photometric redshift biases while
marginalizing over possible clustering bias evolution in either the calibration
or unknown photometric samples. We apply our method to DES Science Verification
(DES SV) data in order to constrain the photometric redshift distribution of a
galaxy sample selected for weak lensing studies, constraining the mean of the
tomographic redshift distributions to a statistical uncertainty of $\Delta z
\sim \pm 0.01$. We forecast that our proposal can in principle control
photometric redshift uncertainties in DES weak lensing experiments at a level
near the intrinsic statistical noise of the experiment over the range of
redshifts where redMaPPer clusters are available. Our results provide strong
motivation to launch a program to fully characterize the systematic errors from
bias evolution and photo-z shapes in our calibration procedure.

enhances the pair production. The employed formalism allows us to isolate the
contribution of magnetic fields in vacuum, leading to a separate analysis of
the effects of different ingredients. This is essential since the analytical
computation of the decay width necessarily needs of some approximation and the
results that can be found in the literature are not always coincident. We
perform the calculation in vacuum by two different weak field approximations.
The particle pair production in vacuum was found to coincide with finite
temperature behavior, which is opposite to results obtained by other authors in
scenarios that involve neutral particles decaying into a pair of charged
fermions. Among other differences between these scenarios, we traced that the
analytical structure of the self-energy imposed by the spin of particles
involved in the process is determinant in the behavior of the decay rate with
the magnetic field.

show how to increase the sensitivity, to the Heisenberg limit of $1/N$, while
increasing the quantum noise by $\sqrt{N}$, thereby suppressing by the same
factor the effect of excess noise. The protocol uses a Schr\""odinger Cat state
representing a superposition of two collective states of $N$ atoms, behaving as
a single entity with an $N$-fold increase in Compton frequency. The resulting

for implementing this scheme, using one axis twist squeezing employing the

network (CNN) with the Lucene search engine in a multi-stage ranking
architecture. Our models are trained using the PyTorch deep learning toolkit,
which is implemented in C/C++ with a Python frontend. One obvious integration
strategy is to expose the neural network directly as a service. For this, we
use Apache Thrift, a software framework for building scalable cross-language
services. In exploring alternative architectures, we observe that once trained,
the feedforward evaluation of neural networks is quite straightforward.
Therefore, we can extract the parameters of a trained CNN from PyTorch and
import the model into Java, taking advantage of the Java Deeplearning4J library
for feedforward evaluation. This has the advantage that the entire end-to-end
system can be implemented in Java. As a third approach, we can extract the
neural network from PyTorch and ""compile"" it into a C++ program that exposes a
Thrift service. We evaluate these alternatives in terms of performance (latency
and throughput) as well as ease of integration. Experiments show that
feedforward evaluation of the convolutional neural network is significantly
slower in Java, while the performance of the compiled C++ network does not
consistently beat the PyTorch implementation.

projected onto an eigenstate of the measured operator, in a weak measurement
the system is only weakly perturbed while only partial information on the
measured observable is obtained. A full description of such measurement should
describe the measurement protocol and provide an explicit form of the
measurement operator that transform the quantum state to its post measurement
form. A simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables cannot be
projective, however the strongest possible such measurement can be defined as
providing their values at the smallest uncertainty limit. Starting with the
Arthurs and Kelly (AK) protocol for such measurement of position and momentum,
we derive a systematic extension to a corresponding weak measurement along
three steps: First, a plausible form of the weak measurement operator analogous
to the Gaussian Kraus operator often used to model a weak measurement of a
single observable is obtained by projecting a na\""ive extension (valid for
commuting observable) onto the corresponding Gabor space. Second, we show that
the so obtained set of measurement operators satisfies the normalization
condition for the probability to obtain given values of the position and
momentum in the weak measurement operation, namely that this set constitutes a
positive operator valued measure (POVM) in the position-momentum space.
Finally, we show that the so-obtained measurement operator corresponds to a
generalization of the AK measurement protocol in which the initial detector
wavefunctions is suitable broadened.

symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which include the well-known graph
Laplacian. We achieve this by developing an adaptive operator compression
scheme and a multiresolution matrix factorization algorithm which achieve
nearly optimal performance on both complexity and well-posedness. To develop
our adaptive operator compression and multiresolution matrix factorization
methods, we first introduce a novel notion of energy decomposition for SPD
matrix $A$ using the representation of energy elements. The interaction between
these energy elements depicts the underlying topological structure of the
operator. This concept of decomposition naturally reflects the hidden geometric
structure of the operator which inherits the localities of the structure. By
utilizing the intrinsic geometric information under this Energy framework, we
propose a systematic operator compression scheme for the inverse operator
$A^{-1}$. In particular, with an appropriate partition of the underlying
geometric structure, we can construct localized basis by using the concept of
interior and closed energy. Meanwhile, two important localized quantities are
introduced, namely the error factor and the condition factor. Our error
analysis results show that these two factors will be the guidelines for finding
the appropriate partition of the basis functions such that prescribed
compression error and acceptable condition number can be achieved. By virtue of
this insight, we propose the Patch Pairing algorithm to realize our energy
partition framework for operator compression with controllable compression
error and condition number.

first formulates a general model in the sense that it is applicable to all AICs

Doppler shifts and delays is performed sequentially, in which the Doppler
estimation is formulated into a spatial spectrum estimation problem and the
delay estimation is decomposed into a series of compressive parameter
estimation problems with each corresponding to an estimated Doppler shift. By
the sequential and decomposed processing, the computational complexity is
substantially reduced, and by the parametric estimation techniques, the high
accurate estimation is obtained. Theoretical analyses and numerical experiments
show the effectiveness and the correctness of the proposed scheme.

unique selection coefficient. However, population dynamics inherently generate
noise in numbers of individuals and selection acts on various components of the
individuals' fitness. In plant species with seed banks, the size of both the
above- and below-ground compartments present noise depending on seed production
and the state of the seed bank. We investigate if this noise has consequences
on 1)~the rate of genetic drift, and 2)~the efficacy of selection. We consider
four variants of two-allele Moran-type models defined by combinations of
presence and absence of noise in above-ground and seed bank compartments. Time
scale analysis and dimension reduction methods allow us to reduce the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to a one-dimensional diffusion
approximation of a Moran model. We first show that if the above-ground noise
classically affects the rate of genetic drift, below-ground noise reduces the
diversity storage effect of the seed bank. Second, we consider that selection
can act on four different components of the plant fitness: plant or seed death
rate, seed production or seed germination. Our striking result is that the
efficacy of selection for seed death rate or germination rate is reduced by
seed bank noise, whereas selection occurring on plant death rate or seed
production is not affected. We derive the expected site-frequency spectrum
reflecting this heterogeneity in selection efficacy between genes underpinning
different plant fitness components. Our results highlight the importance to
consider the effect of ecological noise to predict the impact of seed banks on
neutral and selective evolution.

we find that at non-zero low temperatures the Seebeck coefficient and the
thermoelectric efficiency can be very large on the ""insulating"" side, for
chemical potentials below the (zero-temperature) localization threshold.
Corrections to the leading power-law singularity in the zero-temperature
conductivity are shown to introduce non-universal temperature-dependent
corrections to the otherwise universal functions which describe the Seebeck
coefficient, the figure of merit and the Wiedemann-Franz ratio. Next, the
thermoelectric coefficients are shown to have interesting dependences on the

Exact spectrum estimation is usually inefficient as it requires sampling rates
at or above the Nyquist rate. Using prior information on the structure of the
signal could allow near exact reconstruction at much lower sampling rates.
Sparsity of the sampled signal in the frequency domain is one of the popular
priors studied for cognitive radio applications. Reconstruction of signals
under sparsity assumptions has been studied rigorously by researchers in the
field of Compressed Sensing (CS). CS algorithms that operate on batches of
samples are known to be robust but can be computationally costly, making them
unsuitable for cheap low power cognitive radio devices that require spectrum
sensing in real time. On the other hand, on line algorithms that are based on
variations of the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm have very simple updates
so they are computationally efficient and can easily adapt in real time to
changes of the underlying spectrum. In this paper we will present two
variations of the LMS algorithm that enforce sparsity in the estimated spectrum
given an upper bound on the number of non-zero coefficients. Assuming that the
number of non-zero elements in the spectrum is known we show that under
conditions the hard threshold operation can only reduce the error of our
estimation. We will also show that we can estimate the number of non-zero
elements of the spectrum at each iteration based on our online estimations.
Finally, we numerically compare our algorithm with other on line
sparsity-inducing algorithms in the literature.

dual conformal field theories through the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. The
holographic entanglement negativity is obtained from a specific algebraic sum
of the geodesics anchored on respective intervals on the boundary which reduces
to the holographic mutual information between them. Utilizing our conjecture we
obtain the entanglement negativity of adjacent intervals in zero and finite
temperature ($1+1$)-dimensional holographic conformal field theories dual to
the bulk $AdS_3$ vacuum and the Euclidean BTZ black hole respectively. Our
holographic conjecture exactly reproduces the conformal field theory results
obtained through the replica technique, in the large central charge limit. We
briefly elucidate the corresponding issue for the $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d$ scenario.

temperature dependent quantum chemistry approach, extending beyond the
random-phase approximation. However, till now the scope of GF2 applications was
quite limited as they require computer resources which rise steeply with system
size. In each step of the self-consistent GF2 calculation there are two parts:
the estimation of the self-energy from the previous step's Green's function,
and updating the Green's function from the self-energy. The first part formally
scales as the fifth power of the system size while the second has a much
gentler cubic scaling. Here, we develop a stochastic approach to GF2 (sGF2)
which reduces the fifth power scaling of the first step to merely quadratic,
leaving the overall sGF2 scaling as cubic. We apply the method to linear
hydrogen chains containing up to 1000 electrons, showing that the approach is
numerically stable, efficient and accurate. The stochastic errors are very
small, of the order of 0.1% or less of the correlation energy for large
systems, with only a moderate computational effort. The first iteration of GF2
is an MP2 calculation that is done in linear scaling, hence we obtain an
extremely fast stochastic MP2 (sMP2) method as a by-product. While here we
consider finite systems with large band gaps where at low temperatures effects
are negligible, the sGF2 formalism is temperature dependent and general and can
be applied to finite or periodic systems with small gaps at finite

the construction of pseudodata and pseudovariances based on iteratively

Ising model prior. Here we focus on two extensively used models for genomic

the proposed method is demonstrated through both simulation studies and real

uncertainties in the estimated directions, angular widths and pre-collision

November cases diverge from 98%-60% and 100%-40%, respectively, reserving some
probability for other nature of collision. Similarly, the probability of

solution for millimeter wave (mm-wave) systems. The analog component in such
precoders, which is composed of a phase shifter network, is the key
differentiating element in contrast to conventional fully digital precoders.
While a large number of phase shifters with unquantized phases are commonly
assumed in existing works, in practice the phase shifters should be discretized
with a coarse quantization, and their number should be reduced to a minimum due
to cost and power consideration. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid
precoder implementation using a small number of phase shifters with quantized
and fixed phases, i.e., a fixed phase shifter (FPS) implementation, which
significantly reduces the cost and hardware complexity. In addition, a dynamic
switch network is proposed to enhance the spectral efficiency. Based on the
proposed FPS implementation, an effective alternating minimization (AltMin)
algorithm is developed with closed-form solutions in each iteration. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm with the FPS implementation
outperforms existing ones. More importantly, it needs much fewer phase shifters
than existing hybrid precoder proposals, e.g., $\sim$10 fixed phase shifters
are sufficient for practically relevant system settings.

a classical two-transmitter two-receiver Z-channel, wherein one transmitter
sends information to its intended receiver from the direct link while the other
transmitter sends information to both receivers from the direct and cross
links. Unlike most existing designs using (continuous) Gaussian input
distribution, we consider the practical finite-alphabet (i.e., discrete) inputs
by assuming that the widely-used quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
constellations are adopted by both transmitters. To balance the error
performance of two receivers, we apply the max-min fairness design criterion in
this paper. More specifically, we propose to jointly optimize the scaling
factors at both transmitters, which control the minimum Euclidean distance of
transmitting constellations, to maximize the smaller minimum Euclidean distance
of two resulting constellations at the receivers, subject to an individual
average power constraint at each transmitter. The formulated problem is a mixed
continuous-discrete optimization problem and is thus intractable in general. By
resorting to the Farey sequence, we manage to attain the closed-form expression
for the optimal solution to the formulated problem. This is achieved by
dividing the overall feasible region of the original optimization problem into
a finite number of sub-intervals and deriving the optimal solution in each
sub-interval. Through carefully observing the structure of the optimal
solutions in all sub-intervals, we obtain compact and closed-form expressions
for the optimal solutions to the original problem in three possible scenarios
defined by the relative strength of the cross link. Simulation studies are

between high-order activation tensors, the fully connected layers operate on
flattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has
notable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards
multilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We
address these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that
preserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor
Contraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while
preserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we
introduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a
low-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output
tensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors
end-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters. Additionally, our
layers regularize networks by imposing low-rank constraints on the activations
(TCL) and regression weights (TRL). Experiments on ImageNet show that, applied
to VGG and ResNet architectures, TCLs and TRLs reduce the number of parameters
compared to fully connected layers by more than 65% while maintaining or
increasing accuracy. In addition to the space savings, our approach's ability

credibility of user-contributed content. Prior works in this domain operate on
a static snapshot of the community, making strong assumptions about the
structure of the data (e.g., relational tables), or consider only shallow
features for text classification.
  To address the above limitations, we propose probabilistic graphical models
that can leverage the joint interplay between multiple factors in online
communities --- like user interactions, community dynamics, and textual content
--- to automatically assess the credibility of user-contributed online content,
and the expertise of users and their evolution with user-interpretable
explanation. To this end, we devise new models based on Conditional Random
Fields for different settings like incorporating partial expert knowledge for
semi-supervised learning, and handling discrete labels as well as numeric
ratings for fine-grained analysis. This enables applications such as extracting
reliable side-effects of drugs from user-contributed posts in healthforums, and
identifying credible content in news communities.
  Online communities are dynamic, as users join and leave, adapt to evolving
trends, and mature over time. To capture this dynamics, we propose generative
models based on Hidden Markov Model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Brownian
Motion to trace the continuous evolution of user expertise and their language
model over time. This allows us to identify expert users and credible content
jointly over time, improving state-of-the-art recommender systems by explicitly
considering the maturity of users. This also enables applications such as
identifying helpful product reviews, and detecting fake and anomalous reviews

diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general networks
containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical components. We can
formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal
categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of
objects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds
to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network
with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks
together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring.
Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical
circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive
wires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that
also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a
mathematically natural prop. We describe the ""behavior"" of these circuits using
morphisms between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing
theorem proved by Fong and the first author; unlike the original proof, this
new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a
morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the
signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the
Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative
Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a
result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.

environment, for example, by a chemical concentration gradient, light
intensity, gravity, or confinement. In particular, the effect of an external
flow field is important for particles swimming in a solvent fluid. For
deformable active particles such as self-propelled liquid droplets and active
vesicles, as well as microorganisms such as euglenas and neutrophils, a general
description has been developed by focusing on shape deformation. In this
review, we present our recent studies concerning the dynamics of a single
active deformable particle under an external flow field. First, a set of model
equations of active deformable particles including the effect of a general
external flow is introduced. Then, the dynamics under two specific flow
profiles is discussed: a linear shear flow, as the simplest example, and a
swirl flow. In the latter case, the scattering dynamics of the active
deformable particles by the swirl flow is also considered.

host often strong electronic correlations and are highly sensitive to atomistic

applications of theoretical approaches for the realistic description of the
electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures with correlated electrons.
First, the implementation of a flexible interface between density functional
theory and a variant of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) highly suitable for
the simulation of complex correlated structures is explained and illustrated.
On the DMFT side, this interface is largely based on recent developments of
quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization techniques allowing for efficient
descriptions of general four fermion Coulomb interactions, reduced symmetries
and spin-orbit coupling, which are explained here. With the examples of the Cr
(001) surfaces, magnetic adatoms, and molecular systems it is shown how the
interplay of Hubbard U and Hund's J determines charge and spin fluctuations and
how these interactions drive different sorts of correlation effects in
nanosystems. Non-local interactions and correlations present a particular
challenge for the theory of low dimensional systems. We present our method
developments addressing these two challenges, i.e., advancements of the
dynamical vertex approximation and a combination of the constrained random
phase approximation with continuum medium theories. We demonstrate how
non-local interaction and correlation phenomena are controlled not only by
dimensionality but also by coupling to the environment which is typically
important for determining the physics of nanosystems.

of forecast uncertainty in chaotic, physical systems. Data assimilation
techniques have been designed to exploit this phenomena, reducing the effective
dimension of the data assimilation problem to the directions of rapidly growing
errors. Recent mathematical work has, moreover, provided formal proofs of the
central hypothesis of the Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace methodology of
Anna Trevisan and her collaborators: for filters and smoothers in perfect,
linear, Gaussian models, the distribution of forecast errors asymptotically
conforms to the unstable-neutral subspace. Specifically, the column span of the
forecast and posterior error covariances asymptotically align with the span of
backward Lyapunov vectors with non-negative exponents.
  Earlier mathematical studies have focused on perfect models, and this current
work now explores the relationship between dynamical instability, the precision
of observations and the evolution of forecast error in linear models with
additive model error. We prove bounds for the asymptotic uncertainty,
explicitly relating the rate of dynamical expansion, model precision and
observational accuracy. Formalizing this relationship, we provide a novel,
necessary criterion for the boundedness of forecast errors. Furthermore, we
numerically explore the relationship between observational design, dynamical
instability and filter boundedness. Additionally, we include a detailed
introduction to the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem and to the theory and

the plane. It appears in particular as continuous limit of various discrete
models of directed forests of coalescing random walks and navigation schemes.
Radial counterparts have been considered but global invariance principles are
hard to establish. In this paper, we consider cylindrical forests which in some
sense interpolate between the directed and radial forests: we keep the topology
of the plane while still taking into account the angular component. We define
in this way the cylindric Brownian web (CBW), which is locally similar to the
planar BW but has several important macroscopic differences. For example, in
the CBW, the coalescence time between two paths admits exponential moments and
the CBW as its dual contain each a.s. a unique bi-infinite path. This pair of
bi-infinite paths is distributed as a pair of reflected Brownian motions on the
cylinder. Projecting the CBW on the radial plane, we obtain a radial Brownian
web (RBW), i.e. a family of coalescing paths where under a natural
parametrization, the angular coordinate of a trajectory is a Brownian motion.
Recasting some of the discrete radial forests of the literature on the
cylinder, we propose rescalings of these forests that converge to the CBW, and
deduce the global convergence of the corresponding rescaled radial forests to
the RBW. In particular, a modification of the radial model proposed in Coletti

increases the characteristic asymptotic decay time of the autocorrelation

higher-resolution (HR) image from the observed low-resolution (LR) image, has
received substantial attention due to its tremendous application potentials.
Despite the breakthroughs of recently proposed SR methods using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), their generated results usually lack of preserving
structural (high-frequency) details. In this paper, regarding global boundary
context and residual context as complimentary information for enhancing
structural details in image restoration, we develop a contextualized multi-task
learning framework to address the SR problem. Specifically, our method first
extracts convolutional features from the input LR image and applies one
deconvolutional module to interpolate the LR feature maps in a content-adaptive
way. Then, the resulting feature maps are fed into two branched sub-networks.
During the neural network training, one sub-network outputs salient image
boundaries and the HR image, and the other sub-network outputs the local
residual map, i.e., the residual difference between the generated HR image and
ground-truth image. On several standard benchmarks (i.e., Set5, Set14 and
BSD200), our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our SR
method on achieving both higher restoration quality and computational
efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art SR approaches. The source

However, its management in practice is still problematic. Currently, there is

Nevertheless, existing approaches do not explicitly take into account the
maintenance activities, that largely determine the software maintenance effort.
This paper proposes a 2-dimensional model of maintainability that explicitly
associates system properties with the activities carried out during
maintenance. The separation of activities and properties facilitates the
identification of sound quality criteria and allows to reason about their
interdependencies. This transforms the quality model into a structured and
comprehensive quality knowledge base that is usable in industrial project
environments. For example, review guidelines can be generated from it. The
model is based on an explicit quality metamodel that supports its systematic
construction and fosters preciseness as well as completeness. An industrial
case study demonstrates the applicability of the model for the evaluation of
the maintainability of Matlab Simulink models that are frequently used in
model-based development of embedded systems.

  singularity",,,,,"math.DS physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyses in detail the dynamics in a neighbourhood of a
G\'enot-Brogliato point, colloquially termed the G-spot, which physically
represents so-called dynamic jam in rigid body mechanics with unilateral
contact and Coulomb friction. Such singular points arise in planar rigid body
problems with slipping point contacts at the intersection between the
conditions for onset of lift-off and for the Painlev\'e paradox. The G-spot can
be approached in finite time by an open set of initial conditions in a general
class of problems. The key question addressed is what happens next. In
principle trajectories could, at least instantaneously, lift off, continue in
slip, or undergo a so-called impact without collision. Such impacts are
non-local in momentum space and depend on properties evaluated away from the
G-spot. The results are illustrated on a particular physical example, namely
the a frictional impact oscillator first studied by Leine et al.
  The answer is obtained via an analysis that involves a consistent contact
regularisation with a stiffness proportional to $1/\varepsilon^2$. Taking a
singular limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$, one finds an inner and an outer
asymptotic zone in the neighbourhood of the G-spot. Two distinct cases are
found according to whether the contact force becomes infinite or remains finite
as the G-spot is approached. In the former case it is argued that there can be
no such canards and so an impact without collision must occur. In the latter
case, the canard trajectory acts as a dividing surface between trajectories
that momentarily lift off and those that do not before taking the impact. The
orientation of the initial condition set leading to each eventuality is shown
to change each time a certain positive parameter $\beta$ passes through an
integer.

composition and formation epoch of their progenitors, through comparison of the
data with results from AGB evolution. The dust properties of PNe, when
available, were also used to further support our interpretation.
  We find that the majority ($\sim60\%$) of the Galactic PNe studied has nearly
solar chemical composition, while $\sim40\%$ of the sources investigated have
sub-solar metallicities. About half of the PNe have carbon star progenitors, in
the $1.5~M_{\odot} < M < 3~M_{\odot}$ mass range, which have formed between 300
Myr and 2 Gyr ago. The remaining PNe are almost equally distributed among PNe
enriched in nitrogen, which we interpret as the progeny of $M > 3.5~M_{\odot}$
stars, younger than 250 Myr, and a group of oxygen-rich PNe, descending from
old ($> 2$ Gyr) low-mass ($M < 1.5~M_{\odot}$) stars that never became C-stars.
  This analysis confirms the existence of an upper limit to the amount of
carbon which can be accumulated at the surface of carbon stars, probably due to
the acceleration of mass loss in the late AGB phases. The chemical composition
of the present sample suggests that in massive AGB stars of solar (or slightly
sub-solar) metallicity, the effects of third dredge up combine with hot bottom
burning, resulting in nitrogen-rich - but not severely carbon depleted -
gaseous material to be ejected.

the existence of a 5-dimensional braneworld black hole solution that is
localized close to the 3-brane and has the properties of a regular
4-dimensional one. For this purpose, the 4-dimensional part of the complete
5-dimensional spacetime is considered to be a generalized Vaidya metric, in the
context of which, the mass parameter $m$ is allowed to vary with respect to
time, while it is also allowed to have both $y$ and $r$ dependence. The
dependence on the $r$-coordinate essentially means that our black hole solution
can deviate from the conventional Schwarzschild solution. Additionally, the
dependence on the $y$-coordinate leads to a non-trivial profile of the black
hole along the extra dimension. In order to justify physically the existence of
such general mass parameter, we consider the case of two scalar fields
$\phi(v,r,y)$, $\chi(v,r,y)$ which interact with each other and they are also
non-minimally coupled to gravity via a general coupling function
$f(\phi,\chi)$. In all the cases that were investigated in the context of this
particular scenario, the result for the existence of a viable 5-dimensional
localized black hole solution was negative, a result that causes concern about
the compatibility of brane-world models with basic predictions of General
Theory of Relativity.

challenge facing modern ecologists. Recent link prediction methods rely on
trait data, however large species interaction databases are typically sparse
and covariates are limited to only a fraction of species. On the other hand,
evolutionary relationships, encoded as phylogenetic trees, can act as proxies
for underlying traits and historical patterns of parasite sharing among hosts.
We show that using a network-based conditional model, phylogenetic information
provides strong predictive power in a recently published global database of
host-parasite interactions. By scaling the phylogeny using an evolutionary
model, our method allows for biological interpretation often missing from
latent variable models. To further improve on the phylogeny-only model, we
combine a hierarchical Bayesian latent score framework for bipartite graphs
that accounts for the number of interactions per species with the host
dependence informed by phylogeny. Combining the two information sources yields
significant improvement in predictive accuracy over each of the submodels
alone. As many interaction networks are constructed from presence-only data, we
extend the model by integrating a correction mechanism for missing
interactions, which proves valuable in reducing uncertainty in unobserved
interactions.

are not obvious a priori, and their detection is often a challenge of both
scientific and practical importance, requiring a clear understanding of

component abundances, which often resembles the well-known Zipf's law. Such

potentially hindering the identification of system-specific functional
constraints or generative processes. Here, we specifically focus on the

found in different LEGO sets. To account for the effects of component
heterogeneity, we consider a simple null model, which builds
system-realizations by random draws from a universe of possible components.
Under general assumptions on abundance heterogeneity, we provide analytical
estimates of component occurrence, which quantify exhaustively the statistics

explain important features of empirical component-occurrence distributions
obtained from data on bacterial genomes, LEGO sets, and book chapters. Specific
architectural features and functional constraints can be detected from
occurrence patterns as deviations from these null predictions, as we show for

stabilizes the position of the center of mass, the orientation of the pelvis

low-priority postural task provides reference positions for each joint of the

quadratic programming optimization. Besides the exclusion of centroidal

control laws in SE(3) which do not require the use of Euler parameterization.
Validation of the framework was achieved in a scenario where the robot kept

spaces. In general,a large space of objects is arranged in such a way that,
when a further object is presented as a query, those objects most similar to

inequality property of the metric governing the space. The triangle inequality
property is equivalent to a finite embedding property, which states that any
three points of the space can be isometrically embedded in two-dimensional
Euclidean space. In this paper, we examine a class of semimetric space which is
finitely four-embeddable in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In mathematics
this property has been extensively studied and is generally known as the
four-point property. All spaces with the four-point property are metric spaces,
but they also have some stronger geometric guarantees. We coin the term
supermetric space as, in terms of metric search, they are significantly more
tractable. Supermetric spaces include all those governed by Euclidean, Cosine,
Jensen-Shannon and Triangular distances, and are thus commonly used within many
domains. In previous work we have given a generic mathematical basis for the
supermetric property and shown how it can improve indexing performance for a

also able to capture the correct physics of strongly correlated solids such as
Mott insulators. Due to strong electron localization, magnetic interactions in
such systems are dominated by superexchange, which in the simplest picture can
be regarded as the analogue of static correlation for molecules. In the present
work we investigate the performance of the RPA for evaluating both
superexchange and direct exchange interactions in the magnetic solids NiO, MnO,
Na3Cu2SbO6, Sr2CuO3, Sr2CuTeO6, and a monolayer of CrI3, which are chosen to
represent a broad variety of magnetic interactions. It is found that the RPA
can accurately correct the large errors introduced by Hartree-Fock -
independent of the input orbitals used for the perturbative expansion. However,
in most cases, accuracies similar to RPA can be obtained with DFT+U, which is

useful metric spaces possess it. These include Euclidean, Cosine and
Jensen-Shannon spaces of any dimension. A simple corollary of the n-point
property is that, for any (n+1) objects sampled from the space, there exists an
n-dimensional simplex in Euclidean space whose edge lengths correspond to the
distances among the objects. We show how the construction of such simplexes in
higher dimensions can be used to give arbitrarily tight lower and upper bounds
on distances within the original space. This allows the construction of an
n-dimensional Euclidean space, from which lower and upper bounds of the
original space can be calculated, and which is itself an indexable space with
the n-point property. For similarity search, the engineering tradeoffs are
good: we show significant reductions in data size and metric cost with little
loss of accuracy, leading to a significant overall improvement in search
performance.

of a $d-1$-dimensional manifold $M$ separating a $d$-dimensional compact set
into two parts, and an efficient algorithm classifying points according to this
approximation. In a first variant, the approximation is made of simplices that
are defined in the cubes of a regular grid covering the compact set, from
boundary points that approximate the intersection between $M$ and the edges of
the cubes. All the simplices defined in a cube share the barycentre of the
boundary points located in the cube and include simplices similarly defined in
cube facets, and so on recursively. In a second variant, the Kuhn triangulation
is used to break the cubes into simplices and the approximation is defined in
these simplices from the boundary points computed on their edges, with the same
principle. Both the approximation in cubes and in simplices define a separating
surface on the whole grid and classifying a point on one side or the other of
this surface requires only a small number (at most $d$) of simple tests. Under
some conditions on the definition of the boundary points and on the reach of
$M$, for both variants the Hausdorff distance between $M$ and its approximation
decreases like $\mathcal{O}(d n_G^{-2})$, where $n_G$ is the number of points
on each axis of the grid. The approximation in cubes requires computing less
boundary points than the approximation in simplices but the latter is always a
manifold and is more accurate for a given value of $n_G$. The paper reports
tests of the method when varying $n_G$ and the dimensionality of the space (up
to 9).

in the signal domain or in the corresponding Fourier domain. Additionally, a
warping transformation is usually required to preserve the signal energy, thus
preserving orthogonality and being invertible by its adjoint. Initially, the
design of such operators has been motivated by the idea of suitably
generalizing the properties of orthogonal time-frequency decompositions such as
wavelets and filter banks, hence the energy preservation property was
essential. Recently, warping operators have been employed for frequency
dispersion compensation in the Fourier domain or the identification of
waveforms similarity in the time domain. For such applications, the energy
preservation requirement can be given up, thus making warping a special case of
interpolation. In this context, the purpose of this work is to provide
analytical models and efficient computational algorithms for time warping with
respect to piecewise smooth warping maps by transposing and extending a
theoretical framework which has been previously introduced for frequency
warping. Moreover, the same approach is generalized to the case of warping
without energy preservation, thus obtaining a fast interpolation operator with
analytically defined and fast inverse operator.

experimental system that can be used to study quantum turbulence. A novel
feature of this system is that vortex cores now have a finite size. This means
that the vortices are no longer one dimensional features in the condensate, but
that the radial behaviour and excitations might also play an important role in
the study of quantum turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates. In this paper we
investigate these radial modes using a simplified variational model for the
vortex core. This study results in the frequencies of the radial modes, which
can be compared with the frequencies of the thoroughly studied Kelvin modes.
From this comparison we find that the lowest (l=0) radial mode has a frequency
in the same order of magnitude as the Kelvin modes. However the radial modes
still have a larger energy than the Kelvin modes, meaning that the Kelvin modes
will still constitute the preferred channel for energy decay in quantum
turbulence.

for braids with only three strands. The membership problem is decidable in NP
for $B_3$, but it becomes harder for a class of braids with more strands. In

very challenging for computers to interpret due to their sparsity and
ambiguity. We propose a data-driven approach that tackles this challenge by
learning to reconstruct 3D shapes from one or more drawings. At the core of our
approach is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts occupancy
of a voxel grid from a line drawing. This CNN provides us with an initial 3D
reconstruction as soon as the user completes a single drawing of the desired
shape. We complement this single-view network with an updater CNN that refines
an existing prediction given a new drawing of the shape created from a novel
viewpoint. A key advantage of our approach is that we can apply the updater
iteratively to fuse information from an arbitrary number of viewpoints, without
requiring explicit stroke correspondences between the drawings. We train both
CNNs by rendering synthetic contour drawings from hand-modeled shape
collections as well as from procedurally-generated abstract shapes. Finally, we
integrate our CNNs in a minimal modeling interface that allows users to
seamlessly draw an object, rotate it to see its 3D reconstruction, and refine
it by re-drawing from another vantage point using the 3D reconstruction as
guidance. The main strengths of our approach are its robustness to freehand
bitmap drawings, its ability to adapt to different object categories, and the
continuum it offers between single-view and multi-view sketch-based modeling.

an inversion method which reduces the occurrence of negative values and
improves the quantitative performance of optoacoustic imaging. Methods: We
present a novel method for optoacoustic tomography based on an entropy
maximization algorithm, which uses logarithmic regularization for attaining
non-negative reconstructions. The reconstruction image quality is further
improved using structural prior based fluence correction. Results: We report
the performance achieved by the entropy maximization scheme on numerical
simulation, experimental phantoms and in-vivo samples. Conclusion: The proposed
algorithm demonstrates superior reconstruction performance by delivering
non-negative pixel values with no visible distortion of anatomical structures.
Significance: Our method can enable quantitative optoacoustic imaging, and has
the potential to improve pre-clinical and translational imaging applications.

and compared. Dome A emerges to be the best among those evaluated, with PWV and
fluctuations smaller than the second-best site, South Pole, by more than a
factor of 2. It is found that the higher site in Ali (6,100 m) is on par with
Cerro Chajnantor (5,612 m) in terms of transmission and stability. The lower
site in Ali (5,250 m) planned for first stage of observations at 90/150GHz
provides conditions comparable to those on the Chajnantor Plateau. These
analyses confirm Ali to be an excellent mm-wave site on the Northern Hemisphere

also found in this analysis that the observing conditions at Summit Camp are
comparable to Cerro Chajnantor. Although it is more affected by the presence of

current CAD technologies appear to be contradictory and they should be improved
to be ultimately considered useful. Since 2012 deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN) have been a tremendous success in image recognition, reaching
human performance. These methods have greatly surpassed the traditional
approaches, which are similar to currently used CAD solutions. Deep CNN-s have
the potential to revolutionize medical image analysis. We propose a CAD system
based on one of the most successful object detection frameworks, Faster R-CNN.
The system detects and classifies malignant or benign lesions on a mammogram
without any human intervention. The proposed method sets the state of the art
classification performance on the public INbreast database, AUC = 0.95 . The
approach described here has achieved the 2nd place in the Digital Mammography
DREAM Challenge with AUC = 0.85 . When used as a detector, the system reaches
high sensitivity with very few false positive marks per image on the INbreast

hardening. In this paper, the effect of grain size on the hardening mechanism
of Al-Cu nanostructure is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation. Al-Cu
(50-54% Cu by weight) nanostructure having an average grain size of 4.57 to
7.26 nm are investigated for tensile simulation at different strain rate using
embedded atom method (EAM) potential at a temperature of 50~500K. It is found
that the failure mechanism of the nanostructure is governed by the temperature,
grain size as well as strain rate effect. At the high temperature of 300-500K,
the failure strength of Al-Cu nanostructure increases with the decrease of
average grain size following Hall-Petch relation. Dislocation motions are
hindered significantly when the grain size is decreased which play a vital role
on the hardening of the nanostructure. The failure is always found to initiate
at a particular Al grain due to its weak link and propagates through grain
boundary (GB) sliding, diffusion, dislocation nucleation and propagation. We
also visualize the dislocation density at different grain size to show how the
dislocation affects the material properties at the nanoscale. These results
will further aid investigation on the deformation mechanism of nanostructure.

stars. Together with newly obtained data for 17 objects, the sample contains 56
objects, the largest such sample to date. A change in linear polarization
across the Halpha line is detected in 42 (75 %) objects, which confirms the
previous finding that the circumstellar environment around these stars on small
spatial scales has an asymmetric structure, which is typically identified with
a disk. A second outcome of this research is that we confirm that Herbig Ae
stars are similar to T Tauri stars in displaying a line polarization effect,
while depolarization is more common among Herbig Be stars. This finding had
been suggested previously to indicate that Herbig Ae stars form in the same
manner than T Tauri stars through magnetospheric accretion. It appears that the
transition between these two differing polarization line effects occurs around
the B7-B8 spectral type. This would in turn not only suggest that Herbig Ae
stars accrete in a similar fashion as lower mass stars, but also that this
accretion mechanism switches to a different type of accretion for Herbig Be
stars. We report that the magnitude of the line effect caused by electron
scattering close to the stars does not exceed 2%. Only a very weak correlation
is found between the magnitude of the line effect and the spectral type or the
strength of the Halpha line. This indicates that the detection of a line effect
only relies on the geometry of the line-forming region and the geometry of the
scattering electrons.

highly (re)configurable systems, such as software product lines. Different
combinations of the optional features of such a system give rise to
combinatorially many individual system variants. We use a formal modeling
language that allows us to model systems with probabilistic behavior, possibly
subject to quantitative feature constraints, and able to dynamically install,
remove or replace features. More precisely, our models are defined in the
probabilistic feature-oriented language QFLAN, a rich domain specific language
(DSL) for systems with variability defined in terms of features. QFLAN
specifications are automatically encoded in terms of a process algebra whose
operational behavior interacts with a store of constraints, and hence allows to
separate system configuration from system behavior. The resulting probabilistic
configurations and behavior converge seamlessly in a semantics based on
discrete-time Markov chains, thus enabling quantitative analysis. Our analysis
is based on statistical model checking techniques, which allow us to scale to
larger models with respect to precise probabilistic analysis techniques. The
analyses we can conduct range from the likelihood of specific behavior to the
expected average cost, in terms of feature attributes, of specific system
variants. Our approach is supported by a novel Eclipse-based tool which
includes state-of-the-art DSL utilities for QFLAN based on the Xtext framework
as well as analysis plug-ins to seamlessly run statistical model checking
analyses. We provide a number of case studies that have driven and validated
the development of our framework.

proximity effect in these systems has accounted for the finite size of the

detrimental when the level spacing of the superconductor greatly exceeds its
energy gap. Without any fine-tuning of the size of the superconductor (on the
scale of the Fermi wavelength), the tunneling energy scale must be larger than
the level spacing in order to reach the hard gap regime which is seen
ubiquitously in the experiments. However, in this regime, the large tunneling
energy scale induces a large shift in the effective chemical potential of the
nanowire and pushes the topological phase transition to magnetic field

be chosen at each time step, each action provides a stochastic reward, and the
distribution for the reward of each action is initially unknown. However,
frequent selection of a specific action may reduce its expected reward, while
abstaining from choosing an action may cause its expected reward to increase.
Such non-stationary phenomena are observed in many real world settings such as
personalized healthcare-adherence improving interventions and targeted online
advertising. Though finding an optimal policy for general models with
non-stationarity is PSPACE-complete, we propose and analyze a new class of
models called ROGUE (Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy) bandits, which we
show in this paper can capture these phenomena and are amenable to the design
of effective policies. We first present a consistent maximum likelihood
estimator for the parameters of these models. Next, we construct finite sample
concentration bounds that lead to an upper confidence bound policy called the
ROGUE Upper Confidence Bound (ROGUE-UCB) algorithm. We prove that under proper
conditions the ROGUE-UCB algorithm achieves logarithmic in time regret, unlike
existing algorithms which result in linear regret. We conclude with a numerical
experiment using real data from a personalized healthcare-adherence improving
intervention to increase physical activity. In this intervention, the goal is
to optimize the selection of messages (e.g., confidence increasing vs.
knowledge increasing) to send to each individual each day to increase adherence
and physical activity. Our results show that ROGUE-UCB performs better in terms
of regret and average reward as compared to state of the art algorithms, and
the use of ROGUE-UCB increases daily step counts by roughly 1,000 steps a day

binary coalescences that includes the conservative dynamics, radiation
reaction, and gravitational waveform modes from the inspiral and the
merger-ringdown signals. We use the same approach as is commonly employed in
black-hole perturbation theory by introducing a relativistic parameterization
of the dynamics that is defined by the orbital geometry and consists of a set
of phase variables and quantities that evolve only due to gravitational
radiation reaction. Specializing to nonspinning binaries, we derive the EOB
evolution equations and compute the binary's radiative multipole moments that
determine the gravitational waves through a decomposition into the fundamental
frequencies of the motion. The major differences between our treatment and the
quasi-Keplerian approach often used in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations are
that the orbital parameters describe strong-field dynamics, and that expressing
the multipole moments in terms of the frequencies simplifies the calculations
and also results in an unambiguous orbit-averaging operation. While our
description of the conservative dynamics is fully relativistic, we limit
explicit derivations in the radiative sector to 1.5PN order for simplicity.
This already enables us to establish methods for computing both instantaneous
and hereditary contributions to the gravitational radiation in EOB coordinates
that have straightforward extensions to higher PN order. The weak-field, small
eccentricity limit of our results for the orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and
angular momentum agrees with known PN results when expressed in terms of
gauge-invariant quantities. We further address considerations for the numerical
implementation of the model and the completion of the waveforms to include the
merger and ringdown signals, and provide illustrative results.

Schwarzschild black hole (BH) deviates significantly from a classical state, in
spite of its apparent thermal nature. For this state, the occupation numbers of
single modes of massless asymptotic fields, such as photons, gravitons and
possibly neutrinos, are small and, as a result, their relative fluctuations are
large. The occupation numbers of massive fields are much smaller and suppressed
beyond even the expected Boltzmann suppression. It follows that this type of
thermal state cannot be viewed as classical or even semiclassical. We
substantiate this claim by showing that, in a state with low occupation
numbers, physical observables have large quantum fluctuations and, as such,
cannot be faithfully described by a mean-field or by a WKB-like semiclassical
state. Since the evolution of the BH is unitary, our results imply that the
state of the BH interior must also be non-classical when described in terms of
the asymptotic fields. We show that such a non-classical interior cannot be
described in terms of a semiclassical geometry, even though the average
curvature is sub-Planckian.

been mostly in favor of kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) type of fluctuations, but
other kinds of fluctuations with characteristics typical of magnetosonic,
whistler and ion Bernstein modes, could also play a role depending on the
plasma parameters. Here we investigate the properties of the sub-proton-scale
cascade with high-resolution hybrid-kinetic simulations of freely-decaying
turbulence in 3D3V phase space, including electron inertia effects. Two proton
plasma beta are explored: the ""intermediate"" $\beta_p=1$ and ""low""
$\beta_p=0.2$ regimes, both typically observed in solar wind and corona. The
magnetic energy spectum exhibits $k_\perp^{-8/3}$ and $k_\|^{-7/2}$ power laws

both regimes develop a spectral anisotropy consistent with $k_\|\sim
k_\perp^{2/3}$ at $k_\perp\rho_p>1$, and pronounced small-scale intermittency.
In this context, we find that the kinetic-scale cascade is dominated by
KAW-like fluctuations at $\beta_p=1$, whereas the low-$\beta$ case presents a
more complex scenario suggesting the simultaneous presence of different types
of fluctuations. In both regimes, however, a non-negligible role of ion
Bernstein type of fluctuations at the smallest scales seems to emerge.

using molecular dynamics simulations and infrared as well as nuclear magnetic
resonance experiments. Ethylammonium nitrate features a flexible
three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds with moderate strengths, which
makes it distinct from related triethylammonium-based ionic liquids. First, the
network's flexibility is manifested in a not very pronounced correlation of the
hydrogen bond geometries, which is caused by rapid interchanges of bonding
partners. The large flexibility of the network leads to a substantial
broadening of the mid-IR absorption band, with the contributions due to N-H
stretching motions ranging from 2800 to 3250~\cm. Finally, the different
dynamics are also seen in the rotational correlation of the N-H bond vector,
where a correlation time as short as 16.1~ps is observed.

require training a machine learning model on a large piano database. However,
such approaches are limited by dataset availability; additional training data
is difficult to produce, and proposed systems often perform poorly on novel
recording conditions. We propose a method to quickly synthesize arbitrary
quantities of training data, avoiding the need for curating large datasets.
Various aspects of piano note dynamics - including nonlinearity of note
signatures with velocity, different articulations, temporal clustering of
onsets, and nonlinear note partial interference - are modeled to match the
characteristics of real pianos. Our method also avoids the disentanglement
problem, a recently noted issue affecting machine-learning based approaches. We
train a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers on our generated
training data and achieve both good transcription performance on the large MAPS
piano dataset and excellent generalization qualities.

Almost everywhere, the EM analysis reveals plasma at 10 MK (visible in Fe XIX
emission) which is down to 0.1% of EM of the main 3 MK plasma. We estimate the
power law index of the hot tail of the EM to be between -8.5 and -4.4. However,
we leave an open question on the possible existence of a small minor peak at

desirable to compute control policies that force the trajectory of a bistable

target point), or in other words to solve the switching problem. It was
recently shown that, for monotone bistable systems, this problem admits
easy-to-implement open-loop solutions in terms of temporal pulses (i.e., step
functions of fixed length and fixed magnitude). In this paper, we develop this
idea further and formulate a problem of convergence to an equilibrium from an
arbitrary initial point. We show that this problem can be solved using a static
optimization problem in the case of monotone systems. Changing the initial
point to an arbitrary state allows to build closed-loop, event-based or
open-loop policies for the switching/convergence problems. In our derivations
we exploit the Koopman operator, which offers a linear infinite-dimensional
representation of an autonomous nonlinear system. One of the main advantages of
using the Koopman operator is the powerful computational tools developed for
this framework. Besides the presence of numerical solutions, the
switching/convergence problem can also serve as a building block for solving
more complicated control problems and can potentially be applied to
non-monotone systems. We illustrate this argument on the problem of
synchronizing cardiac cells by defibrillation. Potentially, our approach can be

conductivities have a nonmonotonic behavior with photon energy in the regime
between $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, as a result of the tilted parameter
$v_t$. The tilted parameter can be extracted by knowing $\epsilon_1$ and
$\epsilon_2$ from optical measurements. The maximum values of the components of
the optical conductivity do not depend on the carrier density and the tilted

nodes, where each node initially knows only its incident edges. The
communication graph is a clique with limited edge bandwidth: each two nodes
(not necessarily neighbours in the input graph) can exchange $O(\log n)$ bits.
  As in previous works, the key part of the MST algorithm is an efficient
Connected Components (CC) algorithm. However, unlike the former approaches, we
do not aim at simulating the standard Boruvka algorithm, at least at initial
stages of the CC algorithm. Instead, we develop a new technique which combines
connected components of sample sparse subgraphs of the input graph in order to
accelerate the process of uncovering connected components of the original input
graph. More specifically, we develop a sparsification technique which reduces
an initial CC problem in $O(1)$ rounds to its two restricted instances. The
former instance has a graph with maximal degree $O(\log \log n)$ as the input
-- here our sample-combining technique helps. In the latter instance, a
partition of the input graph into $O(n/\log \log n)$ connected components is
known. This gives an opportunity to apply previous algorithms to determine

addition to a series of foundational results - including a description in terms

equations for zeta functions of globally defined families of induced

Hironaka's resolution of singularities, which yields formulae of Denef-type for
the relevant zeta functions.
  In some detail, we consider representations of open compact subgroups of
reductive $p$-adic groups that are induced from parabolic subgroups. Explicit
computations are carried out by means of complementing techniques: (i)
geometric methods that are applicable via distance-transitive actions on

However, many wavefront measurement techniques implicitly approximate the
gradient of the wavefront by the gradients of the basis functions. For a finite
number of approximation terms, the transition from a basis to its gradient
might introduce an aliasing error. To simplify the measurements, another set of
functions, an ""optimal basis"" with orthogonal gradients, is often introduced,
for instance Lukosz-Braat polynomials. The article first shows that such bases
do not necessarily eliminate the aliasing error and secondly considers the
problem of finding an alias-free basis on example of second-moment based
indirect wavefront sensing methods. It demonstrates that for these methods any
alias-free basis should be formed by functions simultaneously orthogonal in two
dot-products and be composed of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. The

the Fermi surface topology and the proximity of the van-Hove singularity to the

model size is inferred from data. A recently developed methodology in this
field is small-variance asymptotic analysis, a mathematical technique for
deriving learning algorithms that capture much of the flexibility of Bayesian
nonparametric inference algorithms, but are simpler to implement and less
computationally expensive. Past work on small-variance analysis of Bayesian
nonparametric inference algorithms has exclusively considered batch models
trained on a single, static dataset, which are incapable of capturing time
evolution in the latent structure of the data. This work presents a
small-variance analysis of the maximum a posteriori filtering problem for a
temporally varying mixture model with a Markov dependence structure, which
captures temporally evolving clusters within a dataset. Two clustering
algorithms result from the analysis: D-Means, an iterative clustering algorithm
for linearly separable, spherical clusters; and SD-Means, a spectral clustering
algorithm derived from a kernelized, relaxed version of the clustering problem.
Empirical results from experiments demonstrate the advantages of using D-Means
and SD-Means over contemporary clustering algorithms, in terms of both
computational cost and clustering accuracy.

diagrammatic loop expansion in terms of so-called fat-diagrams. Our motivation
is to study some important second-order phase transitions that do exist on the
Bethe lattice but are either qualitatively different or absent in the
corresponding fully connected case. In this case the standard approach based on
a perturbative expansion around the naive mean field theory (essentially a
fully connected model) fails. On physical grounds, we expect that when the
construction is applied to a lattice in finite dimension there is a small
region of the external parameters close to the Bethe critical point where
strong deviations from mean-field behavior will be observed. In this region,
the $1/M$ expansion for the corrections diverges and it can be the starting
point for determining the correct non-mean-field critical exponents using
renormalization group arguments. In the end, we will show that the critical
series for the generic observable can be expressed as a sum of Feynman diagrams
with the same numerical prefactors of field theories. However, the contribution
of a given diagram is not evaluated associating Gaussian propagators to its
lines as in field theories: one has to consider the graph as a portion of the

a new operator, called $f$-proximal operator of $g$ and denoted by
$\mathrm{prox}^f_g$, that generalizes the classical notion. Then we prove the
decomposition formula $\mathrm{prox}_{f+g} = \mathrm{prox}_f \circ
\mathrm{prox}^f_g$. After collecting several properties and characterizations
of $\mathrm{prox}^f_g$, we prove that it coincides with the fixed points of a
generalized version of the classical Douglas-Rachford operator. This
relationship is used for the construction of a weakly convergent algorithm that
computes numerically this new operator $\mathrm{prox}^f_g$, and thus, from the
decomposition formula, allows to compute numerically $\mathrm{prox}_{f+g}$. It
turns out that this algorithm was already considered and implemented in
previous works, showing that $\mathrm{prox}^f_g$ is already present (in a
hidden form) and useful for numerical purposes in the existing literature.
However, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been explicitly expressed
in a closed formula and neither been deeply studied from a theoretical point of
view. The present paper contributes to fill this gap in the literature. Finally
we give an illustration of the usefulness of the decomposition formula in the

superhydrophobic surfaces is revisited. Attention is focussed on the local slip
boundary condition at the liquid-gas interface, which is equivalent to the
effect of a gas cavity on liquid flow. The system is characterized by a large
viscosity contrast between liquid and gas, $\mu/\mu_g \gg 1$. We interpret
earlier results, namely the dependence of the local slip length on the flow
direction, in terms of a tensorial local slip boundary condition and relate the
eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor to the texture parameters, such as
the width of the groove, $\delta$, and the local depth of the groove, $e(y,
\alpha)$. The latter varies in the direction $y$, orthogonal to the orientation
of stripes, and depends on the bevel angle of groove's edges, $\pi/2 - \alpha$,
at the point, where three phases meet. Our theory demonstrates that when
grooves are sufficiently deep their eigenvalues of the local slip length tensor
depend only on $\mu/\mu_g$, $\delta$, and $\alpha$, but not on the depth. The
eigenvalues of the local slip length of shallow grooves depend on $\mu/\mu_g$
and $e(y, \alpha)$, although the contribution of the bevel angle is moderate.
In order to assess the validity of our theory we propose a novel approach to
solve the two-phase hydrodynamic problem, which significantly facilitates and
accelerates calculations compared to conventional numerical schemes. The
numerical results show that our simple analytical description obtained for
limiting cases of deep and shallow grooves remains valid for various
unidirectional textures.

nonlinear variational inequalities of second kind in a Hilbert space. The
challenge of the present work is to take into account a perturbation on all the
data of the problem. This requires special adjustments in the definitions of
the generalized first- and second-order differentiations of the involved
operators and functions. Precisely, we extend the notions, introduced and
thoroughly studied by R.T. Rockafellar, of twice epi-differentiability and
proto-differentiability to the case of a parameterized lower semi-continuous
convex function and its subdifferential respectively. The link between these
two notions is tied to Attouch's theorem and to the new concept, introduced in
this paper, of convergent supporting hyperplanes. The previous tools allow us
to derive an exact formula of the proto-derivative of the generalized proximity
operator associated to a parameterized variational inequality, and deduce the
differentiability of the associated solution with respect to the parameter.
Furthermore, the derivative is shown to be the solution of a new variational
inequality involving semi- and twice epi-derivatives of the data. An
application is given to parameterized convex optimization problems involving
the sum of two convex functions (one of them being smooth). The case of smooth

We develop two Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which allow us to
sample from the conditional space and to perform approximated tests. The first
algorithm is based on the MCMC sampling described by Sturmfels. The second MCMC
sampling consists in a more efficient algorithm which exploits the optimal
partition of the conditional space into orbits of permutations. We thus
establish a link between standard permutation and algebraic-statistics-based
sampling. Through a simulation study we compare the exact cumulative
distribution function (cdf) with the approximated cdfs which are obtained with
the two MCMC samplings and the standard permutation sampling. We conclude that
the MCMC sampling which exploits the partition of the conditional space into
orbits of permutations gives an estimated cdf, under $H_0$, which is more
reliable and converges to the exact cdf with the least steps. This sampling
technique can also be used to build an approximation of the exact cdf when its
exact computation is computationally infeasible.

a Jeans scale which is of the solar-system scale for conventional axion mass.

input spike trains to a higher dimension of spike trains called a
feature-domain, and the output neurons are trained to build the desired spike
trains by processing the spike timing of intralayer neurons. The DSNN
performance was examined in a jittered spike train classification task which
shows more than 92\% accuracy in classifying different spike trains. The DSNN
performance is comparable with the recurrent multi-layer neural networks and
surpasses a single-layer DSNN with a 22\% margin. Synaptic dynamics have been

assessment of parkinsonism and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Methods: Nine
participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and LID completed a levodopa
infusion protocol, where symptoms were assessed at regular intervals using the
Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS). A state-of-the-art deep learning pose estimation method was used
to extract movement trajectories from videos of PD assessments. Features of the
movement trajectories were used to detect and estimate the severity of
parkinsonism and LID using random forest. Communication and drinking tasks were
used to assess LID, while leg agility and toe tapping tasks were used to assess
parkinsonism. Feature sets from tasks were also combined to predict total
UDysRS and UPDRS Part III scores. Results: For LID, the communication task
yielded the best results for dyskinesia (severity estimation: r = 0.661,
detection: AUC = 0.930). For parkinsonism, leg agility had better results for
severity estimation (r = 0.618), while toe tapping was better for detection
(AUC = 0.773). UDysRS and UPDRS Part III scores were predicted with r = 0.741
and 0.530, respectively. Conclusion: This paper presents the first application
of deep learning for vision-based assessment of parkinsonism and LID and
demonstrates promising performance for the future translation of deep learning
to PD clinical practices. Significance: The proposed system provides insight
into the potential of computer vision and deep learning for clinical
application in PD.

dependence of the correlation is obtained after the subtraction of
contributions from the most dominant harmonic coefficients. In particular, the
contribution from the triangular flow, $v_3$, is removed from the proper
correlations following the procedure implemented by the STAR collaboration. The
resultant structure observed in the correlations was sometimes attributed to
the mini-jet dynamics, but the present calculations show that a pure
hydrodynamic model gives a reasonable agreement with the main feature of the
published data. A brief discussion on the physical content of the present

working angle (IWA) possible with HST's suite of coronagraphically augmented
instruments through its mission lifetime. The STIS BAR5 image plane occulter,
however, was damaged (bent and deformed) pre-launch and had not been enabled
for GO science use following the installation of the instrument in 1997, during
HST servicing mission SM2. With the success of the HST GO 12923 program,
discussed herein, we explored and verified the functionality and utility of the
BAR5 occulter. Thus, despite its physical damage, with updates to the knowledge
of the aperture mask metrology and target pointing requirements, a robust
determination of achievable raw and PSF-subtracted stellocentric image
contrasts and fidelity was conducted. We also investigated, and herein report
on, the use of the BAR10 rounded corners as narrow-angle occulters and compare
IWA vs. contrast performance for the BAR5, BAR10, and Wedge occulters. With
that, we provide recommendations for the most efficacious BAR5 and BAR10 use
on-orbit in support of GO science. With color-matched PSF-template subtracted
coronagraphy, inclusive of a small (+/- 1/4 pixel) 3-point cross-bar dithering
strategy we recommend, we find BAR5 can deliver effective ~ 0.2"" IWA image

introduce a lower bound for the system performance that facilitates an
efficient analysis. Based on the proposed lower bound, which is mainly built on

analyze effective capacity in an ultra dense heterogeneous cellular network. We
use our proposed scalable approach to give insights about the possible

imperfect full duplex mode of operation. Numerical results and analysis are

for instance status of the topology, cable degradation and occurrence of
