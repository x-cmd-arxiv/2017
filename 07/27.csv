amplification in Linux file systems. While many researchers are tackling write
amplification in key-value stores, IO amplification in file systems has been
largely unexplored. We analyze data and metadata operations on five widely-used
Linux file systems: ext2, ext4, XFS, btrfs, and F2FS. We find that data
operations result in significant write amplification (2-32X) and that metadata
operations have a large IO cost. For example, a single rename requires 648 KB
write IO in btrfs. We also find that small random reads result in read
amplification of 2-13X. Based on these observations, we present the CReWS
conjecture about the relationship between IO amplification, consistency, and
storage space utilization. We hope this paper spurs people to design future
file systems with less IO amplification, especially for non-volatile memory
technologies.

related to the light-curve (LC) evolution (broken or unbroken power-law
function) of the optical afterglow of GRB 111209A, different techniques for the
LC decomposition, and different methods (with or without a near-infrared

2011kl. Previous studies have shown that the LCs without an early-time excess
preferred a magnetar model, a magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model, or a white dwarf tidal
disruption event model rather than the radioactive heating model. On the other
hand, the LC shows an early-time excess and dip that cannot be reproduced by
the aforementioned models, and hence the blue-supergiant model was proposed to
explain it. Here we reinvestigate the energy sources powering SN 2011kl. We
find that the two LCs without the early-time excess of SN 2011kl can be
explained by the magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model, and the LC showing the early excess
can be explained by the magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model taking into account the
cooling emission from the shock-heated envelope of the SN progenitor,
demonstrating that this SN might primarily be powered by a nascent magnetar.

to face communication, greetings, phone, and social networking sites (SNS). SNS
have drastically decreased time and distance constraints of social grooming. In
this paper, I show that two types of social grooming (elaborate social grooming
and lightweight social grooming) were discovered in a model constructed by
thirteen communication data-sets including face to face, SNS, and Chacma
baboons. The separation of social grooming methods is caused by a difference in
the trade-off between the number and strength of social relationships. The
trade-off of elaborate social grooming is weaker than the trade-off of
lightweight social grooming. On the other hand, the time and effort of
elaborate methods are higher than lightweight methods. Additionally, my model
connects social grooming behaviour and social relationship forms with these
trade-offs. By analyzing the model, I show that individuals tend to use
elaborate social grooming to reinforce a few close relationships (e.g. face to
face and Chacma baboons). In contrast, people tend to use lightweight social
grooming to maintain many weak relationships (e.g. SNS). Humans with
lightweight methods who live in significantly complex societies use various
social grooming to effectively construct social relationships.

Their stability and dynamics, arising from their topological character, have
made them ideal information carriers e.g. in racetrack memories. The success of
such a memory critically depends on the ability to stabilize and manipulate
skyrmions at low magnetic fields. The driving force for skyrmion formation is
the non-collinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction (DMI) originating
from spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It competes with both the nearest neighbour
Heisenberg exchange interaction and the magnetic anisotropy, which favour
collinear states. While skyrmion lattices might evolve at vanishing magnetic
fields, the formation of isolated skyrmions in ultra-thin films so far required
the application of an external field which can be as high as several T. Here,
we show that isolated skyrmions in a monolayer (ML) of Co epitaxially grown on
a Ru(0001) substrate can be stabilized at magnetic fields as low as 100 mT.
Even though SOC is weak in the 4d element Ru, a homochiral spin spiral ground
state and isolated skyrmions could be detected and laterally resolved using a
combination of tunneling and anisotropic tunneling magnetoresistance effect in
spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations confirm these chiral magnetic textures, even though the
stabilizing DMI interaction is weak. We find that the key factor is the absence
of magnetocristalline anisotropy in this system which enables non-collinear
states to evolve in spite of weak SOC, opening up a wide choice of materials
beyond 5d elements.

mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii interaction between excitons, (c) quantum depletion
of the excitonic condensate (Lee-Huang-Yang terms for composite bosons). In

these contributions using spectral functions. Using the vector dominance

sizable, while the shear viscosity is negligible for about all frequencies. In
the partonic phase near the transition temperature we provide an assessment of
the viscous corrections to the photon and dilepton emissions, using a
non-perturbative quark-gluon plasma with soft thermal gluonic corrections in
the form of operators of leading mass dimension. Again, the thermal bulk

generalize those constructions so that the catenoidal bridges can concentrate
along an arbitrary number of parallel circles, with the further option to
include bridges at the poles. The current constructions follow the Linearized
Doubling (LD) methodology developed before and the LD solutions constructed
here can be modified readily for use to doubling constructions of rotationally

a certain number of random initial samples. The second method utilizes the

in the context of a polytropic DM fluid with thermodynamical content. Depending
only on the polytropic exponent, $-0.103 < \Gamma \leq 0$, this unified DM
model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements performed with the
aid of the supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) standard candles, without suffering
either from the age or from the coincidence problem. To demonstrate also its
compatibility with current observational data concerning structure formation,
in the present article we discuss the evolution of cosmological perturbations
in the $\Lambda$ CDM-like (i.e., $\Gamma = 0$) limit of the polytropic DM
model. The corresponding results are quite encouraging, since, such a model
reproduces every major effect already known from conventional (i.e.,
pressureless cold dark matter - CDM) structure formation theory, such as the
constancy of metric perturbations in the vicinity of recombination and the
(late-time) Meszaros effect on their rest-mass density counterparts (Meszaros
1974). The non-zero (polytropic) pressure, on the other hand, drives the
evolution of small-scale velocity perturbations along the lines of the
root-mean-square velocity law of conventional Statistical Physics. As a
consequence, in this model ""peculiar velocities"" slightly increase, instead of
being redshifted away by cosmic expansion. What is more important is that, upon
consideration of scale-invariant metric perturbations, the spectrum of their
rest-mass density counterparts exhibits an effective power-law dependence on
the (physical) wavenumber, with the associated scalar spectral index being
equal to $n_s = 0.970$; a theoretical value that actually reproduces the
corresponding observational (Planck) result (Ade et al. 2016).

programming language has been developed to control the system. The setup has
been tested in the hysteresis loop measurements of perpendicularly magnetized

number of sensors for monitoring various conditions of the environment.
Backscatter-sensors have emerged to be a promising solution due to the
uninterruptible energy supply and relative simple hardwares. On the other hand,
backscatter-sensors with limited signal-processing capabilities are unable to
support conventional algorithms for multiple-access and channel-training. Thus,
the key challenge in designing backscatter-sensor networks is to enable readers
to accurately detect sensing-values given simple ALOHA random access, primitive
transmission schemes, and no knowledge of channel-states. We tackle this
challenge by proposing the novel framework of backscatter sensing featuring
random-encoding at sensors and statistical-inference at readers. Specifically,
assuming the on/off keying for backscatter transmissions, the practical
random-encoding scheme causes the on/off transmission of a sensor to follow a
distribution parameterized by the sensing values. Facilitated by the scheme,
statistical-inference algorithms are designed to enable a reader to infer
sensing-values from randomized transmissions by multiple sensors. The specific
design procedure involves the construction of Bayesian networks, namely
deriving conditional distributions for relating unknown parameters and
variables to signals observed by the reader. Then based on the Bayesian
networks and the well-known expectation-maximization principle, inference
algorithms are derived to recover sensing-values.

modelling correlated responses based on an extension of the Gamma-Poisson
model, where the likelihood can be expressed in closed-form. The parameters are
estimated via an Expectation/Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm, which
can be implemented using functions for fitting generalized linear models
readily available in standard statistical software packages. Compared to
existing methods, our approach avoids the need to approximate the intractable
integrals and thus the inference is exact with respect to the approximating

PAAc in the behaviour of IPN microgels across the volume phase transition
through dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and electrophoretic measurements as a function of microgel concentration and
pH. Findings: Our results highlight that aggregation is favored at increasing
weight concentration, PAAc content and pH and that a crossover PAAc content
C*_{PAAc} exists above which the ionic charges on the microgel become relevant.
Moreover we show that the softness of IPN microgels can be tuned ad hoc by
changing the PAAc/PNIPAM ratio. These findings provide new insights into the
possibility to control experimentally aggregation properties, charge and
softness of IPN microgels by varying PAAc content.

observations are respectively reminiscent of the self-amplification of friction
in a capstan or in interleaved books, as well as the physics of polymers. The
experimental data are well captured by a novel model based on these two

rely on static 3D patient data and use an unrealistic (sinusoidal) periodic
animation of the respiratory movement. Existing methods for the animation of
breathing motion support simple mathematical or patient-specific, estimated
breathing models. However with personalized breathing models for each new
patient, a heavily dose relevant or expensive 4D data acquisition is mandatory
for keyframe-based motion modeling. Given the reference 4D data, first a model
building stage using linear regression motion field modeling takes place. Then
the methodology shown here allows the transfer of existing reference
respiratory motion models of a 4D reference patient to a new static 3D patient.
This goal is achieved by using non-linear inter-patient registration to warp
one personalized 4D motion field model to new 3D patient data. This cost- and
dose-saving new method is shown here visually in a qualitative proof-of-concept
study.

quantization of Bianchi-II spacetimes with arbitrary minimally coupled matter

available quantizations: one based on the connection operator and second by
treating extrinsic curvature as connection via gauge fixing. It turns out that
for the connection based quantization, either the inverse triad modifications
or imposition of weak energy condition is necessary to obtain a resolution of
all strong singularities and geodesic completeness. In contrast, the extrinsic
curvature based quantization generically resolves all strong curvature
singularities and results in a geodesically complete effective spacetime
without inverse triad modifications or energy conditions. In both the
quantizations, weak curvature singularities can occur resulting from
divergences in pressure and its derivatives at finite densities. These are
harmless events beyond which geodesics can be extended. Our work generalizes
previous results on the generic resolution of strong singularities in the loop
quantization of isotropic, Bianchi-I and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes.

$\omega\in\mathcal{M}\Omega^{(1,0)}(\mathbb{CP}^1).$ Hence, we show that on a
compact Riemann surface of genus $g=0,$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{CP}^1,$ every
non-constant meromorphic function $f:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1$ has as many zeros as
poles, where each is counted according to multiplicities. Such an analysis
gives rise to the following result. Invoking the Riemann-Roch theorem for a
compact Riemann $X$ with canonical divisor $K,$ it follows that $deg(f)=0$ for
any principal divisor $(f):=D$ on $X.$ More precisely,
$\ell(D)-\ell(K-D)=deg(D)+1=1$ or $\ell(D)-\ell(K-D)-1=0.$ Furthermore, for a
diffeomorphism $\eta:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1$ of a certain kind, a multistep program
is implemented to show $X$ is a compact algebraic variety of dimension one,
i.e. a non-singular projective variety. Hence, we adopt a group-theoretic
approach and provide a useful heuristic, that is, a set of technical conditions
to facilitate the algebro-geometric analysis of simply connected Riemann

potential to provide rich insights into planet formation theory and
habitability. In this work, we stack the phase-folded transits of 284 viable
moon hosting Kepler planetary candidates, in order to search for satellites.
These planets range from Earth-to-Jupiter sized and from ${\sim}$0.1-to-1.0 AU
in separation - so-called ""warm"" planets. Our data processing includes two-pass
harmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection and careful
data quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with an r.m.s. of 5.1 ppm.
We find that the occurrence rate of Galilean-analog moon systems for planets
orbiting between ${\sim}$0.1 and 1.0 AU can be constrained to be $\eta<0.38$ to
95% confidence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3% confidence interval of
$\eta=0.16_{-0.10}^{+0.13}$. A single-moon model of variable size and
separation locates a slight preference for a population of short-period moons
with radii ${\sim}0.5$ $R_{\oplus}$ orbiting at 5-10 planetary radii. However,
we stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be
treated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various
physically-motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of
Galilean-analogs around warm planets places the first strong constraint on
exomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon
candidate Kepler-1625b I, which we briefly describe ahead of scheduled

the OC in the non-interacting system, with $v$ as the actual (renormalized)
Fermi velocity of Weyl quasiparticles at frequency $\Omega$, and $e_0$ is the
electron charge in vacuum. Such universal enhancement of OC, which depends only
on the number of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level ($N$), is a remarkable
consequence of an intriguing conspiracy among the quantum-critical nature of an
interacting Weyl liquid, marginal irrelevance of the long-range Coulomb
interaction and the violation of hyperscaling in three dimensions, and can
directly be measured in recently discovered Weyl as well as Dirac materials. By
contrast, a local density-density interaction produces a non-universal
correction to the OC, stemming from the non-renormalizable nature of the
corresponding interacting field theory.

explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The actual path to explosion,
however, remains elusive, with numerous plausible parent systems and explosion
mechanisms suggested. Observationally, type Ia supernovae have multiple
subclasses, distinguished by their lightcurves and spectra. This raises the
question whether these reflect that multiple mechanisms occur in nature, or
instead that explosions have a large but continuous range of physical
properties. We revisit the idea that normal and 91bg-like supernovae can be
understood as part of a spectral sequence, in which changes in temperature
dominate. Specifically, we find that a single ejecta structure is sufficient to
provide reasonable fits of both the normal type Ia supernova SN~2011fe and the
91bg-like SN~2005bl, provided that the luminosity and thus temperature of the
ejecta are adjusted appropriately. This suggests that the outer layers of the
ejecta are similar, thus providing some support of a common explosion
mechanism. Our spectral sequence also helps to shed light on the conditions
under which carbon can be detected in pre-maximum SN~Ia spectra -- we find that
emission from iron can ""fill in"" the carbon trough in cool SN~Ia. This may
indicate that the outer layers of the ejecta of events in which carbon is
detected are relatively metal poor compared to events where carbon is not

the evolution of clump size and density with time. The structure of the

clump masses ($M=0.01 - 10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and impinging fluxes ($G_0=10^2 -

the HII region of an OB star and clumps carried within quasar outflows are
treated separately. We find that the clump undergoes in both cases an initial
shock-contraction phase and a following expansion phase, which lets the
radiation penetrate in until the clump is completely evaporated. Typical
evaporation time-scales are $\simeq 0.01$ Myr in the stellar case and 0.1 Myr
in the quasar case, where the clump mass is 0.1 ${\rm M}_\odot$ and $10^3\,{\rm

intermediate separations. At more distant separations the binary fraction
appears to approach the activity fraction for single M dwarfs. Using derived
radial velocities and the proper motions, we calculate 3D space velocities for
the WD+dMs in SUPERBLINK. For the entire SUPERBLINK WD+dMs, we find a large
vertical velocity dispersion, indicating a dynamically hotter population
compared to high proper motion samples of single M dwarfs. We compare the
kinematics for systems with active M dwarfs and those with inactive M dwarfs,
and find signatures of asymmetric drift in the inactive sample, indicating that
they are drawn from an older population.

Various different realizations are possible: we demonstrate that a Maxwell

theory with a marginally running double-trace coupling. We explore its
hydrodynamic behavior at finite temperature and make contact with recent
symmetry-based formulations of magnetohydrodynamics. We also argue that
discrete global symmetries on the boundary are dual to discrete gauge theories
in the bulk. Such gauge theories have a bulk Chern-Simons description: we
clarify the conventional 0-form case and work out the 1-form case. Depending on
boundary conditions, such discrete symmetries may be embedded in continuous
higher-form symmetries that are spontaneously broken. We study the resulting
boundary Goldstone mode, which in the 1-form case may be thought of as a
boundary photon. Our results clarify how the global form of the field theory
gauge group is encoded in holography. Finally, we study the interplay of
Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms put together. We work out the operator content

reams of data suitable for investigating stellar magnetic activity of cooler

amplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate,
firstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed
to be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,
secondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective
temperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of
the light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised
periodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were
measured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We
used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of
the light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of
starspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the
temperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in
particular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with
current theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find
that the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with
solar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively)
smaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types.

the chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity;
NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent

decrease with $Q^2$ of $G_E^p/G_M^p$ continues to $Q^2 = 8.5$ GeV$^2$, but at a
slowing rate relative to the approximately linear decrease observed in earlier

clusters deeply embedded in a dark molecular cloud. The method is based on
measuring stellar surface density in wide-field infrared images using star
counting techniques. It takes advantage of the differing $H$-band luminosity
functions (HLFs) of field stars and young stellar populations and is able to
statistically associate each star in an image as a member of either the
background stellar population or a young stellar population projected on or
near the cloud. Moreover, the technique corrects for the effects of
differential extinction toward each individual star. We have tested this method
against simulations as well as observations. In particular, we have applied the
method to 2MASS point sources observed in the Orion A and B complexes, and the
results obtained compare very well with those obtained from deep Spitzer and
Chandra observations where presence of infrared excess or X-ray emission
directly determines membership status for every star. Additionally, our method
also identifies unobscured clusters and a low resolution version of the Orion
stellar surface density map shows clearly the relatively unobscured and diffuse
OB 1a and 1b sub-groups and provides useful insights on their spatial
distribution.

is expected to show a contrast of up to 100 ppm with respect to the star. At a
spectral resolving power of R=1790-2640, about 100 spectral CO2 features are
visible within the 13.2-15.8 um (3B) band, which can be combined to boost the
planet atmospheric signal by a factor 3-4, depending on the atmospheric
temperature structure and CO2 abundance. If atmospheric conditions are
favorable (assuming an Earth-like atmosphere), with this new application to the
cross-correlation technique carbon dioxide can be detected within a few days of
JWST observations. However, this can only be achieved if both the instrumental
spectral response and the stellar spectrum can be determined to a relative
precision of <= 1e-4 between adjacent spectral channels. Absolute flux
calibration is not required, and the method is insensitive to the strong

associated to the gauged $U(1)$ $B-L$ symmetry. Given the large charges
required for anomaly cancellation in the dark sector, the $B-L$ $Z'$ interacts
preferentially with this dark sector rather than with the Standard Model. This
suppresses the rate at direct detection searches and thus alleviates the
constraints on $Z'$-mediated dark matter relic abundance. The collider

natural language processing, such as syntactic parsing and semantic role
labeling that have rich output structures. Many such structured-prediction
problems require deterministic constraints on the output values; for example,
in sequence-to-sequence syntactic parsing, we require that the sequential
outputs encode valid trees. While hidden units might capture such properties,
the network is not always able to learn such constraints from the training data
alone, and practitioners must then resort to post-processing. In this paper, we
present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic
constraints on outputs without performing rule-based post-processing or
expensive discrete search. Instead, in the spirit of gradient-based training,
we enforce constraints with gradient-based inference (GBI): for each input at
test-time, we nudge continuous model weights until the network's unconstrained
inference procedure generates an output that satisfies the constraints. We
study the efficacy of GBI on three tasks with hard constraints: semantic role
labeling, syntactic parsing, and sequence transduction. In each case, the
algorithm not only satisfies constraints but improves accuracy, even when the
underlying network is state-of-the-art.

density contrast (more than 100 times the ambient density) or that they have
propagated through relatively low density (n_H < 0.1 cm^-3) regions in the
ambient medium. X-ray spectral analysis shows that the undecelerated knots have
high Si and S abundances, a lower Fe abundance and very low O abundance,
pointing to an origin in the partial Si-burning zone, which occurs in the outer
layer of the exploding white dwarf for SN Ia models. Other knots show slower
speeds and expansion indices consistent with decelerated ejecta knots or
features in the ambient medium overrun by the forward shock. Our new accurate
location for the explosion site has well-defined positional uncertainties
allowing for a great reduction in the area to be searched for faint surviving
donor stars under non-traditional single-degenerate SN Ia scenarios; because of
the lack of bright stars in the search area the traditional scenario remains
ruled out.

gives rise to combined light-matter excitations, the exciton-polaritons. These
were usually measured when the conduction band is empty, making the single
polariton physics a simple single-body problem. The situation is dramatically
different in the presence of a finite conduction band population, where the
creation or annihilation of a single exciton involves a many-body shakeup of
the Fermi sea. Recent experiments in this regime revealed a strong modification
of the exciton-polariton spectrum. Previous theoretical studies concerned with
nonzero Fermi energy mostly relied on the approximation of an immobile valence
band hole with infinite mass, which is appropriate for low-mobility samples
only; for high-mobility samples, one needs to consider a mobile hole with large
but finite mass. To bridge this gap we present an analytical diagrammatic
approach and tackle a model with short-ranged (screened) electron-hole
interaction, studying it in two complementary regimes. We find that the finite
hole mass has opposite effects on the exciton-polariton spectra in the two
regimes: In the first, where the Fermi energy is much smaller than the exciton
binding energy, excitonic features are enhanced by the finite mass. In the
second regime, where the Fermi energy is much larger than the exciton binding
energy, finite mass effects cut off the excitonic features in the polariton
spectra, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments.

a two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions

constant bias field. We study a large range of system sizes and supercritical

plays the role of the order parameter for the DPT, presents large fluctuations
that give rise to well-defined peaks in its scaled variance and its
susceptibility with respect to the bias field. The peaks are symmetric with
respect to zero bias and located at values of the bias field that increase
toward the field amplitude as an inverse logarithm of the field oscillation
period. Our results indicate that this effect is independent of the system size
for large systems, ruling out critical behavior associated with a phase
transition. Rather, it is a stochastic-resonance phenomenon that has no

reminder that the equivalence of the DPT to an equilibrium phase transition is
limited to the critical region near the critical period and zero bias.

many solar cycles. It was recently shown that the periodicity correlates with
solar activity having a shorter period during stronger cycles. Solar activity
level is generally asymmetric between northern and southern hemispheres, which
could suggest the presence of a similar behavior in the Rieger-type
periodicity. We analyse the sunspot area/number and the total magnetic flux
data for northern and southern hemispheres during solar cycles 19-23 which had
remarkable north-south asymmetry. Using wavelet analysis of sunspot area and
number during the north-dominated cycles (19-20) we obtained the periodicity of
160-165 days in the stronger northern hemisphere and 180-190 days in the weaker
southern hemisphere. On the other hand, south-dominated cycles (21-23) display
the periodicity of 155-160 days in the stronger southern hemisphere and 175-188
days in the weaker northern hemisphere. Therefore, the Rieger-type periodicity
has the north-south asymmetry in sunspot area/number data during solar cycles
with strong hemispheric asymmetry. We suggest that the periodicity is caused by
magnetic Rossby waves in the internal dynamo layer. Using the dispersion
relation of magnetic Rossby waves and observed Rieger periodicity we estimated
the magnetic field strength in the layer as 45-49 kG in more active hemispheres
(north during the cycles 19-20 and south during the cycles 21-23) and 33-40 kG
in weaker hemispheres. The estimated difference in the hemispheric field
strength is around 10 kG, which provides a challenge for dynamo models. Total
magnetic flux data during the cycle 20-23 reveals no clear north-south
asymmetry which needs to be explained in the future.

challenging problem. Most recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
shown promise for facial AU recognition, where predefined and fixed convolution
filter sizes are employed. In order to achieve the best performance, the
optimal filter size is often empirically found by conducting extensive
experimental validation. Such a training process suffers from expensive
training cost, especially as the network becomes deeper.
  This paper proposes a novel Optimized Filter Size CNN (OFS-CNN), where the
filter sizes and weights of all convolutional layers are learned simultaneously
from the training data along with learning convolution filters. Specifically,
the filter size is defined as a continuous variable, which is optimized by
minimizing the training loss. Experimental results on two AU-coded spontaneous
databases have shown that the proposed OFS-CNN is capable of estimating optimal
filter size for varying image resolution and outperforms traditional CNNs with
the best filter size obtained by exhaustive search. The OFS-CNN also beats the

$\vec{\sigma}\propto\left ( \hat{y}\cdot \hat{m}_{FeGd} \right

documented by both first principles calculations and high pressure-temperature
experiments. The predicted signature of this spin crossover in the lower mantle
is, however, subtle and difficult to geophysically observe within the mantle.
Indeed, global seismic anomalies associated with spin transitions have not yet
been recognized in seismologic studies of the deep mantle. A sensitive seismic
parameter is needed to determine the presence and amplitude of such a spin
crossover signature. The effects of spin crossovers on Bullen's parameter,
$\eta$, are assessed here for a range of compositions, thermal profiles, and
lateral variations in temperature within the lower mantle. Velocity anomalies
associated with the spin crossover in ferropericlase span a depth range near
1,000 km for typical mantle temperatures. Positive excursions of Bullen's
parameter with a maximum amplitude of $\sim$ 0.03 are calculated to be present
over a broad depth range within the mid-to-deep lower mantle: these are largest
for peridotitic and harzburgitic compositions. These excursions are highest in
amplitude for model lower mantles with large lateral thermal variations, and
with cold downwellings having longer lateral length-scales relative to hot
upwellings. We conclude that predicted deviations in Bullen's parameter due to
the spin crossover in ferropericlase for geophysically relevant compositions
may be sufficiently large to resolve in accurate seismic inversions of this
parameter, and could shed light on both the lateral variations in temperature
at depth within the lower mantle, and the amount of ferropericlase at depth.

has continued now for decades as to whether it is a precursor superconducting
gap or a pseudogap arising from some competing correlation. Failure to resolve
this has arguably delayed explaining the origins of superconductivity in these
highly complex materials. Here we effectively settle the question by
calculating a variety of thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties, exploring
the effect of a temperature-dependent pair-breaking term in the self-energy in
the presence of pairing interactions that persist well above $T_c$. We start by
fitting the detailed temperature-dependence of the electronic specific heat and
immediately can explain its hitherto puzzling field dependence. Taking this
same combination of pairing temperature and pair-breaking scattering we are
then able to simultaneously describe in detail the unusual temperature and
field dependence of the superfluid density, tunneling, Raman and optical
spectra, which otherwise defy explanation in terms a superconducting gap that
closes conventionally at $T_c$. These findings demonstrate that the gap above
$T_c$ in the overdoped regime likely originates from incoherent superconducting
correlations, and is distinct from the competing-order ""pseudogap"" that appears
at lower doping.

(2DTI). Its low-buckled atomic geometry and the enhanced spin-orbit coupling
are expected to cause a prominent quantum spin hall (QSH) effect. However, most
of the experimentally grown stanene to date displays a metallic state without a
real gap, possibly due to the chemical coupling with the substrate and the
stress applied by the substrate. Here,we demonstrate an efficient way of tuning
the atomic buckling in stanene to open a topologically nontrivial energy gap.
Via tuning the growth kinetics, we obtain not only the low-buckled 1x1 stanene
but also an unexpected high-buckled R3xR3 stanene on the Bi(111) substrate.
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study combined with density functional
theory (DFT) calculation confirms that the R3xR3 stanene is a distorted 1x1
structure with a high-buckled Sn in every three 1x1 unit cells. The
high-buckled R3xR3 stanene favors a large band inversion at the {\Gamma} point,
and the spin orbital coupling open a topologically nontrivial energy gap. The
existence of edge states as verified in both STM measurement and DFT
calculation further confirms the topology of the R3xR3 stanene. This study
provides an alternate way to tune the topology of monolayer 2DTI materials.

motor-cargo complexes (MCC) navigate the confining and crowded environment of
the cytoskeletal network and other macromolecules. Motivated by this, we study
a minimal two-state model of motor-driven cargo transport in confinement and
predict transport properties that can be tested in experiments. We assume that
the motion of the MCC is directly affected by the entropic barrier due to
confinement if it is in the passive, unbound state, but not in the active,
bound state where it moves with a constant bound velocity. We construct a

velocity, except when it results in an enhanced average binding rate and
thereby leads to a larger average velocity than when unconfined.

exploit this result to obtain DFs for the general relativistic extension of the

potential is given by $\phi(r)=-\phi_o /[1+(r/a)^{n}]^{1/n}$ ($a$ and $\phi_o$

$F_{n}=l^{n-2}\xi_{n}(\varepsilon)$. For odd $n$, we find that $\xi_n$ is a
polynomial of order $2n+1$ in $\varepsilon$, as in the case of the Hernquist
model ($n=1$), for which $F_1\propto
l^{-1}\left(2\varepsilon-1\right)\left(\varepsilon-1\right)^2$. For even $n$,
we can write $\xi_n$ in terms of incomplete beta functions (Plummer model,
$n=2$, is an example). Since we demand that $F\geq 0$ throughout the phase
space, the particular form of each $\xi_n$ leads to restrictions for the values
of $\phi_o$. For example, for the Hernquist model we find that $0\leq \phi_o

addressing this issue is to investigate how the superconducting dome traces a
shift of the ordered phase. Here, we study how the phase diagram of the

via electron irradiation, which keeps the carrier concentrations intact. With
increasing disorder, we find that the magneto-structural transition is
suppressed, indicating that the critical concentration is shifted to the lower
side. Although the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is depressed at
high concentrations ($x\gtrsim$0.28), it shows an initial increase at lower
$x$. This implies that the superconducting dome tracks the shift of the
antiferromagnetic phase, supporting the view of the crucial role played by
quantum-critical fluctuations in enhancing superconductivity in this iron-based

theory we study the limitations for obtaining de Sitter vacua. Based on this we
find that the simplest KKLT vacua with a single Kahler modulus stabilized by a
gaugino condensate cannot be uplifted to de Sitter. Rather, the uplift flattens
out due to stronger backreaction on the volume modulus than has previously been
anticipated, resulting in vacua which are meta-stable and SUSY breaking, but
that are always AdS. However, we also show that setups such as racetrack
stabilization can avoid this issue. In these models it is possible to obtain
supersymmetric AdS vacua with a cosmological constant that can be tuned to zero
while retaining finite moduli stabilization. In this regime, it seems that de
Sitter uplifts are possible with negligible backreaction on the internal
volume. We exhibit this behavior also from the 10D perspective.

combines high detection accuracy with real-time speed. However, it is widely
recognized that SSD is less accurate in detecting small objects compared to
large objects, because it ignores the context from outside the proposal boxes.
In this paper, we present CSSD--a shorthand for context-aware single-shot
multibox object detector. CSSD is built on top of SSD, with additional layers
modeling multi-scale contexts. We describe two variants of CSSD, which differ
in their context layers, using dilated convolution layers (DiCSSD) and
deconvolution layers (DeCSSD) respectively. The experimental results show that
the multi-scale context modeling significantly improves the detection accuracy.
In addition, we study the relationship between effective receptive fields
(ERFs) and the theoretical receptive fields (TRFs), particularly on a VGGNet.
The empirical results further strengthen our conclusion that SSD coupled with
context layers achieves better detection results especially for small objects
($+3.2\% {\rm AP}_{@0.5}$ on MS-COCO compared to the newest SSD), while
maintaining comparable runtime performance.

map between different robots. In this paper, we investigate, through a
theoretical study of single-input single-output (SISO) systems, the properties

map is, in general, a dynamic system. The main contribution of the paper is to
provide an algorithm for determining the properties of this optimal dynamic map
including its order and regressors (i.e., the variables it depends on). The
proposed algorithm does not require detailed knowledge of the robots' dynamics,
but relies on basic system properties easily obtainable through simple
experimental tests. We validate the proposed algorithm experimentally through
an example of transfer learning between two different quadrotor platforms.
Experimental results show that an optimal dynamic map, with correct properties

  The summary is roughly as follows: (a) neither best subset selection nor the
lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best subset selection generally
performing better in high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regimes, and the lasso
better in low SNR regimes; (b) best subset selection and forward stepwise
perform quite similarly throughout; (c) the relaxed lasso (actually, a

similar elongation, indicating that both emissions trace the disk and the
flattened envelope surrounding the protostar. The velocity gradient of the C18O

re-analyzed, identifying Keplerian rotation proportional to r^-0.5 more clearly
than the Cycle 0 observations. The Keplerian-disk radius and the dynamical
stellar mass are kinematically estimated to be ~74 AU and ~0.45 Mo,
respectively. The continuum visibility is fitted by models without any annulus
averaging, revealing that the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best-fit
model also suggests a density jump by a factor of ~5 between the disk and the
envelope, suggesting that disks around protostars can be geometrically
distinguishable from the envelope from a viewpoint of density contrast.
Importantly, the disk radius geometrically identified with the density jump is
consistent with the radius kinematically estimated. Possible origin of the

generation and limited thermal dissipation in nanoscale materials have become a
critical problem in the development of the next generation nanoelectronic
devices. Copper (Cu) is widely used conducting material in nanoelectronic
devices, and the electron-phonon scattering is the dominant contributor to the
resistivity in Cu nanowires at room temperature. Meanwhile, phonons are the
main carriers of heat in insulators, intrinsic and lightly doped
semiconductors. The thermal transport is an ensemble of phonon transport, which
strongly depends on the phonon frequency. In addition, the phonon transport in
nanoscale materials can behave fundamentally different than in bulk materials,
because of the spatial confinement. However, the size effect on electron-phonon
scattering and frequency dependent phonon transport in nanoscale materials
remain largely unexplored, due to the lack of suitable experimental techniques.
This thesis is mainly focusing on the study of carrier dynamics and acoustic
phonon transport in nanoscale materials.

ground-state of multi-strange hypernuclei is addressed within a
non-relativistic density functional approach, partially constrained by
ab-initio calculations and experimental data. The exploration of the nuclear
chart for $10<Z<120$ as a function of the strangeness number is performed by
adding hyperons to a nuclear core imposing either conserved total charge $Q$ or
conserved proton number $Z$. We find that almost all $\Lambda$ hypernuclei
present an instability with respect to the strong interaction decay of
$\Lambda$ towards $\Xi^{0,-}$ and that most of the instabilities generates
$\Xi^-$ (resp. $\Xi^0$) in the case of conserved total charge $Q$ (resp. proton
number $Z$). The strangeness number at which the first $\Xi^{0,-}$ appear is
generally lower for configurations explored in the case of conserved $Q$
compared to the case of conserved $Z$, and corresponds to the crossing between
the $\Lambda$ and the neutron or proton chemical potentials. About two to three
hundred thousands pure $\Lambda$ hypernuclei may exist before the onset of
$\Xi^{0,-}$. The largest uncertainty comes from the unknown $\Lambda\Xi$
interaction, since the $N\Lambda$ and the $N\Xi$ ones can be constrained by a
few experimental data. The uncertainty on the $\Lambda\Xi$ interaction can
still modify the previous estimation by 30-40\%, while the impact of the
unknown $\Xi\Xi$ interaction is very weak.

information security with an ultra-broadband illumination. The simplified
optical encryption system only contains one diffuser acting as the random phase
mask (RPM). Light coming from a plaintext passes through this RPM and generates
the corresponding ciphertext on a camera. The proposed system effectively
reduces problems of misalignment and coherent noise that are found in the
coherent illumination. Here, the use of ultra-broadband illumination has the
advantage of making a strong scattering and complex ciphertext by reducing the
speckle contrast. Reduction of the ciphertext size further increases the
strength of the ciphering. The unique spatial keys are utilized for the
individual decryption as the plaintext locates at different spatial positions,
and a complete decrypted image could be concatenated with high fidelity.
Benefiting from the ultra-broadband illumination and position-multiplexing, the
information of interest is scrambled together in a small ciphertext. Only the
authorized user can decrypt this information with the correct keys. Therefore,
a high performance security for a cryptosystem could be achieved.

model that only involves 0-1 probabilities, exhibiting all the advantages of
logic reasoning such as short-circuiting, intelligibility, and the ability to
provide proof trees for a query answer. In fact, we can take this further and
require that these characteristics be present even for probabilistic models
with probabilities \emph{near} 0 and 1, with graceful degradation as the model
becomes more uncertain. We also seek inference that has amortized constant time
complexity on a model's size (even if still exponential in the induced width of
a more directly relevant portion of it) so that it can be applied to huge
knowledge bases of which only a relatively small portion is relevant to typical
queries. We believe that, among the probabilistic reasoning algorithms, Belief
Propagation is the most similar to logic reasoning: messages are propagated
among neighboring variables, and the paths of message-passing are similar to
proof trees. However, Belief Propagation is either only applicable to tree
models, or approximate (and without guarantees) for precision and convergence.
In this paper we present work in progress on an Anytime Exact Belief
Propagation algorithm that is very similar to Belief Propagation but is exact
even for graphical models with cycles, while exhibiting soft short-circuiting,
amortized constant time complexity in the model size, and which can provide

provides a measure of the expansion or contraction of a unit volume. We analyze
the Jacobian at different sections of the tumor volumes obtained from
delineation done by radiation oncologists for lung cancer patients. The
delineations across the temporal sequence are compared post registration to
compute tumor areas namely, unchanged (U), newly grown (G), and reduced (R)
that have undergone changes. These three regions of the tumor are considered
for statistical analysis. In addition, statistics of non-tumor (N) regions are
taken into consideration. Sequential CBCT images of 29 patients were used in
studying the distribution of Jacobian in these four different regions, along
with a test set of 16 patients. Statistical tests performed over the dataset
consisting of first three weeks of treatment suggest that, means of the
Jacobian in the regions follow a particular order. Although, this observation
is apparent when applied to the distribution over the whole population, it is
found that the ordering deviates for many individual cases. We propose a
hypothesis to classify patients who have had partial response (PR). Early
prediction of the response was studied using only three weeks of data. The
early prediction of response of treatment was supported by a Fisher's test with
odds ratio of 5.13 and a p-value of 0.043.

$i$ of the multipartition and let the residues from $\mathbb Z/ e \mathbb Z$
increase across rows and decrease down columns. For e=2, we call a
multipartition residue-homogeneous if all nonzero rows end in nodes of the same
residue and partitions with the same corner residue have first rows of the same

Littelmann path which is unidirectional in the sense that the projection of the

consists of long paths all lying in either the second or fourth quadrant,
separated by oscillating paths with a fixed integer oscillator. The path
corresponding to such a multipartition can be constructed non-recursively using

significantly with the evolving deep convolutional neural networks. However,
the state-of-the-art object detection methods still rely on accurate bounding

without bounding box annotations, i.e, weakly supervised detection methods, are
still lagging far behind. As weakly supervised detection only uses image level
labels and does not require the ground truth of bounding box location and label
of each object in an image, it is generally very difficult to distill knowledge

paper proposes an easy-to-hard knowledge transfer scheme that incorporates easy
web images to provide prior knowledge of object appearance as a good starting
point. While exploiting large-scale free web imagery, we introduce a
sophisticated labour free method to construct a web dataset with good diversity

machines to perceive the surrounding auditory scene. However, extracting
effective representations that capture the underlying characteristics of the
acoustic events is still challenging. Previous methods mainly focused on
designing the audio features in a `hand-crafted' manner. Interestingly,
data-learnt features have been recently reported to show better performance. Up
to now, these were only considered on the frame level. In this article, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework to learn a vector representation of
an audio sequence for AEC. This framework consists of a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) encoder and an RNN decoder, which respectively transforms the
variable-length audio sequence into a fixed-length vector and reconstructs the
input sequence on the generated vector. After training the encoder-decoder, we
feed the audio sequences to the encoder and then take the learnt vectors as the
audio sequence representations. Compared with previous methods, the proposed
method can not only deal with the problem of arbitrary-lengths of audio
streams, but also learn the salient information of the sequence. Extensive
evaluation on a large-size acoustic event database is performed, and the
empirical results demonstrate that the learnt audio sequence representation
yields a significant performance improvement by a large margin compared with
other state-of-the-art hand-crafted sequence features for AEC.

early phase of the AGN evolution. However most AGNs are chemically matured and
accordingly low-metallicity AGNs are extremely rare. One approach to search for
low-metallicity AGNs systematically is utilizing the so-called BPT diagram that
consists of the [O III]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$$\lambda4861$ and [N
II]$\lambda6584$/H$\alpha$$\lambda6563$ flux ratios. Specifically,
photoionization models predict that low-metallicity AGNs show a high [O
III]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$$\lambda$4861 ratio and a relatively low [N
II]$\lambda$6584/H$\alpha$$\lambda$6563 ratio, that corresponds to the location
between the sequence of star-forming galaxies and that of usual AGNs on the BPT
diagram (hereafter ""the BPT valley""). However, other populations of galaxies
such as star-forming galaxies and AGNs with a high electron density or a high
ionization parameter could be also located in the BPT valley, not only
low-metallicity AGNs. In this paper, we examine whether most of emission-line
galaxies at the BPT valley are low-metallicity AGNs or not. We select 70
BPT-valley objects from 212,866 emission line galaxies obtained by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Among the 70 BPT-valley objects, 43 objects show firm
evidence of the AGN activity; i.e., the He II$\lambda$4686 emission and/or weak
but significant broad H$\alpha$ emission. Our analysis shows that those 43
BPT-valley AGNs are not characterized by a very high gas density nor ionization
parameter, inferring that at least 43 among 70 BPT-valley objects (i.e., $>60$
%) are low-metallicity AGNs. This suggests that the BPT diagram is an efficient
tool to search for low-metallicity AGNs.

$[\phi]^+_{Ag}$ corresponds to the public announcement of $\phi$, as known from
the literature. Unlike standard public announcements, which are {\em model

different in different states of the model. Therefore, the resulting
computations are trees of models, rather than the typical sequences. A
consequence of our semantics is that modally bisimilar states may be
distinguished in our logic. Then, we provide a stronger notion of bisimilarity

that GLAL is strictly more expressive than public announcement logic with

attempts to get at the core logical notion underlying this.
  The paper presents a sound and complete neighbourhood logic for conditional

belief and knowledge. The key notion in this paper is that of an agent a
believing P conditionally on having information Q, where it is assumed that Q
is compatible with what a knows.
  Conditional neighbourhood logic can be viewed as a core system for reasoning
about subjective plausibility that is not yet committed to an interpretation in
terms of numerical probability. Indeed, every weighted Kripke model gives rise
to a conditional neighbourhood model, but not vice versa. We show that our
calculus for conditional neighbourhood logic is sound but not complete for
weighted Kripke models. Next, we show how to extend the calculus to get
completeness for the class of weighted Kripke models.
  Neighbourhood models for conditional belief are closed under model
restriction (public announcement update), while earlier neighbourhood models
for belief as `willingness to bet' were not. Therefore the logic we present
improves on earlier neighbourhood logics for belief and knowledge. We present
complete calculi for public announcement and for publicly revealing the truth
value of propositions using reduction axioms. The reductions show that adding
these announcement operators to the language does not increase expressive
power.

combines it with a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm

The proposed constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) is
named MOEA/D-IEpsilon. It adjusts the epsilon level dynamically according to
the ratio of feasible to total solutions (RFS) in the current population. In
order to evaluate the performance of MOEA/D-IEpsilon, a new set of CMOPs with
two and three objectives is designed, having large infeasible regions (relative
to the feasible regions), and they are called LIR-CMOPs. Then the fourteen
benchmarks, including LIR-CMOP1-14, are used to test MOEA/D-IEpsilon and four
other decomposition-based CMOEAs, including MOEA/D-Epsilon, MOEA/D-SR,
MOEA/D-CDP and C-MOEA/D. The experimental results indicate that MOEA/D-IEpsilon
is significantly better than the other four CMOEAs on all of the test
instances, which shows that MOEA/D-IEpsilon is more suitable for solving CMOPs
with large infeasible regions. Furthermore, a real-world problem, namely the
robot gripper optimization problem, is used to test the five CMOEAs. The
experimental results demonstrate that MOEA/D-IEpsilon also outperforms the
other four CMOEAs on this problem.

that can be embedded into an ultrametric (more generally into a Hilbert space)
with a given distortion. Study of this problem was motivated as a non-linear
version of Dvoretzky theorem. Mendel and Naor 2007 devised the so called Ramsey
Partitions to address this problem, and showed the algorithmic applications of
their techniques to approximate distance oracles and ranking problems.
  In this paper we study the natural extension of the metric Ramsey problem to
graphs, and introduce the notion of Ramsey Spanning Trees. We ask for the
largest subset $S\subseteq V$ of a given graph $G=(V,E)$, such that there
exists a spanning tree of $G$ that has small stretch for $S$. Applied
iteratively, this provides a small collection of spanning trees, such that each
vertex has a tree providing low stretch paths to all other vertices. The union
of these trees serves as a special type of spanner, a tree-padding spanner. We
use this spanner to devise the first compact stateless routing scheme with
$O(1)$ routing decision time, and labels which are much shorter than in all
currently existing schemes.
  We first revisit the metric Ramsey problem, and provide a new deterministic
construction. We prove that for every $k$, any $n$-point metric space has a
subset $S$ of size at least $n^{1-1/k}$ which embeds into an ultrametric with
distortion $8k$. This results improves the best previous result of Mendel and
Naor that obtained distortion $128k$ and required randomization. In addition,
it provides the state-of-the-art deterministic construction of a distance
oracle. Building on this result, we prove that for every $k$, any $n$-vertex
graph $G=(V,E)$ has a subset $S$ of size at least $n^{1-1/k}$, and a spanning
tree of $G$, that has stretch $O(k \log \log n)$ between any point in $S$ and
any point in $V$.

elucidate how the switchable red- or blue-shifts of the visible emission can be

the confinement of elementary excitations in the Luttinger liquid phase. The
observed spatial separation of elementary spin and charge excitations could

enable us to detect the long-range spin nematic order. We show that the
frequency of the paramagnetic resonance peak in the ESR spectrum is shifted by
the ferroquadrupolar order parameter together with other quantities. The
ferroquadrupolar order parameter is extractable from the angular dependence of
the frequency shift. In contrast, the antiferroquadrupolar order parameter is
usually invisible in the frequency shift. Instead, the long-range
antiferroquadrupolar order yields a characteristic resonance peak in the ESR
spectrum, which we call a magnon-pair resonance peak. This resonance
corresponds to the excitation of the bound magnon pair at the wave vector $\bm
k={\bm 0}$. Reflecting the condensation of bound magnon pairs, the field
dependence of the magnon-pair resonance frequency shows a singular upturn at
the saturation field. Moreover, the intensity of the magnon-pair resonance peak
shows a characteristic angular dependence and it vanishes when the magnetic
field is parallel to one of the axes that diagonalize the weak anisotropic
interactions. We confirm these general properties of the magnon-pair resonance
peak in the spin nematic phase by studying an $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model
on the square lattice in the linear flavor-wave approximation. In addition, we
argue applications to the $S=1/2$ frustrated ferromagnets and also the $S=1/2$
orthogonal dimer spin system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, both of which are candidate
materials of spin nematics. Our theory for the antiferroquadrupolar ordered

accretion disks and its associated intense shapeup of their jets is studied via
three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The
embedded magnetic fields in the disk get amplified by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) so large as to cause an eruption of magnetic field
(recconection) and large chunks of matter episodically accrete toward the roots
of the jets upon such an event. We also find that the eruption events produce
intensive Alfv\'en pulses, which propagate through the jets. After the
eruption, the disk backs to the weakly magnetic states. Such disk activities
cause short time variabilities in mass accretion rate at the event horizon as
well as electromagnetic luminosity inside the jet. Since the dimensionless
strength parameter $a_0=eE/m_e \omega c$ of these Alfv\'en wave pulses is
extremely high for a substantial fraction of Eddington accretion rate accretion
flow onto a supermassive black hole, the Alfv\'en shocks turn into
ultrarelativistic $(a_0\gg 1)$ bow wake acceleration, manifesting into the
ultra-high energy cosmic rays and electrons which finally emit gamma-rays.
Since our GRMHD model has universality in its spatial and temporal scales, it
is applicable to a wide range of astrophysical objects ranging from those of
AGN (which is the primary target of this research), to micro-quasars.
Properties such as time variabilities of blazar gamma-ray flares and spectrum
observed by {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Observatory are well explained by linear
acceleration of electrons by the bow wake.

(GRPs) from the Crab pulsar, we performed a simultaneous observation of the
Crab pulsar with the X-ray satellite Hitomi in the 2 -- 300 keV band and the
Kashima NICT radio observatory in the 1.4 -- 1.7 GHz band with a net exposure
of about 2 ks on 25 March 2016, just before the loss of the Hitomi mission.The
timing performance of the Hitomi instruments was confirmed to meet the timing
requirement and about 1,000 and 100 GRPs were simultaneously observed at the
main and inter-pulse phases, respectively, and we found no apparent correlation
between the giant radio pulses and the X-ray emission in either the main or
inter-pulse phases.All variations are within the 2 sigma fluctuations of the
X-ray fluxes at the pulse peaks, and the 3 sigma upper limits of variations of
main- or inter- pulse GRPs are 22\% or 80\% of the peak flux in a 0.20 phase
width, respectively, in the 2 -- 300 keV band.The values become 25\% or 110\%
for main or inter-pulse GRPs, respectively, when the phase width is restricted
into the 0.03 phase.Among the upper limits from the Hitomi satellite, those in
the 4.5-10 keV and the 70-300 keV are obtained for the first time, and those in
other bands are consistent with previous reports.Numerically, the upper limits
of main- and inter-pulse GRPs in the 0.20 phase width are about (2.4 and 9.3)
$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, respectively. No significant variability in
pulse profiles implies that the GRPs originated from a local place within the
magnetosphere and the number of photon-emitting particles temporally
increases.However, the results do not statistically rule out variations
correlated with the GRPs, because the possible X-ray enhancement may appear due
to a $>0.02$\% brightening of the pulse-peak flux under such conditions.

Seismic estimates of this flow have, however, been contradictory in deeper
layers below about $0.9\,R_\odot$. Results from time-distance helioseismology
have so far been obtained using the ray approximation. Here, we perform
inversions using the Born approximation. The initial result is similar to the
result previously obtained by Jackiewicz et al. (2015) using ray kernels while
using the same set of GONG data and the SOLA inversion technique. However, we
show that the assumption of uncorrelated measurements used in earlier studies
may lead to inversion errors being underestimated by a factor of about two to
four. In a second step, refined inversions are performed using the full
covariance matrix and a regularization for cross-talk. As the results are found
to depend on the threshold used in the singular value decomposition, they were
obtained for a medium threshold ($10^{-7}-10^{-5}$, about 50% of the values
used) and a threshold lower by a factor of 10 (about 70% of the values used).
The result obtained with the medium threshold is again similar to the original,
with less latitudinal variation. However, using the lower threshold, the
inverted flow in the southern hemisphere shows two or three cells stacked
radially depending on the associated radial flows. Both the single-cell and the
multi-cell profiles are consistent with the measured travel times. All our
results confirm a shallow return flow at about $0.9\,R_\odot$.

quantum uncertainties. We show that, under equilibrium conditions, the
management of quantum noise becomes extremely flexible around the quantum
critical point of a quantum many-body system: this is due to the critical
divergence of quantum fluctuations of the order parameter, which, via
Heisenberg's inequalities, may lead to the critical suppression of the
fluctuations in conjugate observables. Taking the quantum Ising model as the
paradigmatic incarnation of quantum phase transitions, we show that it exhibits
quantum critical squeezing of one spin component, providing a scaling for the
precision of interferometric parameter estimation which, in dimensions $d \geq
2$, lies in between the standard quantum limit and the Heisenberg limit.
Quantum critical squeezing saturates the maximum metrological gain allowed by
the quantum Fisher information in $d=\infty$ (or with infinite-range
interactions) at all temperatures, and it approaches closely the bound in a
broad range of temperatures in $d=2$ and 3. This demonstrates the immediate
metrological potential of equilibrium many-body states close to quantum
criticality, which are accessible \emph{e.g.} to atomic quantum simulators via
elementary adiabatic protocols.

the main conceptual contribution, the paper introduces universal trees for the
NCA function: For a given family of rooted trees, an NCA-universal tree $S$ is
a rooted tree such that any tree $T$ of the family can be embedded into $S$
such that the embedding of the NCA in $T$ of two nodes of $T$ is equal to the
NCA in $S$ of the embeddings of the two nodes.
  As the main technical result we give explicit constructions of NCA-universal
trees of size $n^{2.318}$ for the family of rooted $n$-vertex trees and of size
$n^{1.894}$ for the family of rooted binary $n$-vertex trees. A direct
consequence is the explicit construction of NCA-labeling schemes with labels of
size $2.318\log_2 n$ and $1.894\log_2 n$ for the two families of rooted trees.
This improves on the best known such labeling schemes established by Alstrup,

quadrature in time, and the control variable by a variational type
discretization. With a space mesh size $h$ and time stepsize $\tau$, we
establish the following order of convergence for the numerical solutions of the

emergence of a set of users currently interested in that topic. Given the
temporary nature of the links between these users, being able to dynamically
identify communities of users related to this trending topic would allow for a
rapid spread of information. Indeed, individual users inside a community might
receive recommendations of content generated by the other users, or the
community as a whole could receive group recommendations, with new content
related to that trending topic. In this paper, we tackle this challenge, by
identifying coherent topic-dependent user groups, linking those who generate
the content (creators) and those who spread this content, e.g., by
retweeting/reposting it (distributors). This is a novel problem on
group-to-group interactions in the context of recommender systems. Analysis on
real-world Twitter data compare our proposal with a baseline approach that
considers the retweeting activity, and validate it with standard metrics.
Results show the effectiveness of our approach to identify communities
interested in a topic where each includes content creators and content
distributors, facilitating users' interactions and the spread of new

applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic

understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a
thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally
activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently.
In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic
thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of
the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of
perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction. The stochastic
thin-film equation is also simulated by adopting a numerical scheme based on a
spectral collocation method. The scheme allows us to explore the fluctuating
dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity
of rupture. Finally, we also study the effect of the noise intensity on the
rupture time, which is in agreement with previous works.

analyze the time-dependent decay properties of non-local observables (scalar

quantifiable probe of the coupling-dependent validity of hydrodynamics at early

analogous to the hydrodynamization time of a quark-gluon plasma. We find that
to third order in the hydrodynamic expansion, the convergence of hydrodynamics

autonomous stochastic differential equations (SDE) on the time interval $[0,T]$
with infinitely differentiable and bounded coefficients such that no strong
approximation method based on evaluation of the driving Brownian motion at
finitely many fixed times in $[0,T]$, e.g. on an equidistant grid, can converge
in absolute mean to the solution at the final time with a polynomial rate in
terms of the number of Brownian motion values that are used. In the literature
on strong approximation of SDEs, polynomial error rate results are typically
achieved under the assumption that the first order derivatives of the
coefficients of the equation satisfy a polynomial growth condition. This
assumption is violated for the pathological SDEs from the above mentioned
negative result. However, in the present article we construct an SDE with
smooth coefficients that have first order derivatives of at most linear growth
such that the solution at the final time can not be approximated with a
polynomial rate, whatever method based on observations of the driving Brownian
motion at finitely many fixed times is used. Most interestingly, it turns out
that using a method that adjusts the number of evaluations of the driving
Brownian motion to its actual path, the latter SDE can be approximated with
rate 1 in terms of the average number of evaluations that are used. To the best
of our knowledge, this is only the second example in the literature of an SDE
for which there exist adaptive methods that perform superior to non-adaptive
ones with respect to the convergence rate.

structure of the stellar component is described by Osipkov--Merritt anisotropy,
and a black hole (BH) is added at the center of the galaxy; the dark matter
halo is isotropic. First, the conditions required to have a nowhere negative
and monothonically decreasing dark matter halo density profile, are derived. We
then show that the phase-space distribution function can be recovered by using
the Lambert-Euler $W$ function, while in absence of the central BH only
elementary functions appears in the integrand of the inversion formula. The
minimum value of the anisotropy radius for consistency is derived in terms of
the galaxy parameters. The Jeans equations for the stellar component are solved
analytically, and the projected velocity dispersion at the center and at large
radii are also obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy
radius. Finally, the relevant global quantities entering the Virial Theorem are
computed analytically, and the fiducial anisotropy limit required to prevent
the onset of Radial Orbit Instability is determined as a function of the galaxy
parameters. The presented models, even though highly idealized, represent a
substantial generalization of the models presentd in Ciotti et al. (2009), and

composite fermion states is much more robust than a priori expected, emerging
even in models that explicitly break PH symmetry. We provide insight into this
fact by showing that the low energy physics of a generic repulsive 3-body
interaction is captured, to a large extent and over a range of filling factors,
by a mean field approximation that maps it into a PH symmetric 2-body
interaction. This explains why Landau level mixing, which effectively generates
such a generic 3-body interaction, is inefficient in breaking PH symmetry. As a
byproduct, our results provide a systematic construction of a 2-body
interaction which produces, to a good approximation, the Pfaffian wave function
as its ground state.

cannot be obtained directly on the real-frequency axis, but have to be
determined by a fit procedure on the Matsubara axis. In this work we present an
approach where the bath degrees of freedom are first discretized directly on
the real-frequency axis using a large number of bath sites ($\approx 50$).
Then, the bath is optimized by unitary transformations such that it separates
into two parts that are weakly coupled. One part contains the impurity site and
its interacting Green's functions can be determined with ED. The other (larger)
part is a non-interacting system containing all the remaining bath sites.
Finally, the Green's function of the full AIM is calculated via coupling these
two parts with cluster perturbation theory.

(BHT) is in a low-hard or quiescent state, the radiatively inefficient
accretion flow cannot emit enough MeV photons that are required to sustain the
force-free magnetosphere in the polar funnel via two-photon collisions. In this
charge-starved gap region, an electric field arises along the magnetic field
lines to accelerate electrons and positrons into ultra-relativistic energies.
These relativistic leptons emit copious gamma-rays via the curvature and
inverse-Compton (IC) processes. It is found that these gamma-ray emissions
exhibit a flaring activity when the plasma accretion rate stays typically
between 0.01 and 0.005 percent of the Eddington value for rapidly rotating,
stellar-mass black holes. By analyzing the detection limit determined from
archival Fermi/LAT data, we find that the 7-year averaged duty cycle of such

hindering tunability and miniaturization. Here we show that the burden of
phase-matching is surprisingly absent in parametric micro-resonators adopting
monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides as quadratic nonlinear materials. By
the exact solution of nonlinear Maxwell equations and first-principle
calculation of the semiconductor nonlinear response, we devise a novel kind of
phase-matching-free miniaturized parametric oscillator operating at
conventional pump intensities. We find that different two-dimensional
semiconductors yield degenerate and non-degenerate emission at various spectral
regions thanks to doubly-resonant mode excitation, which can be tuned through
the incidence angle of the external pump laser. In addition we show that
high-frequency electrical modulation can be achieved by doping through
electrical gating that efficiently shifts the parametric oscillation threshold.
Our results pave the way for new ultra-fast tunable micron-sized sources of

densities, in the weakly-interacting homogeneous regime, a rotonic spectrum
marks the tendency to clustering. With strong interactions, we indeed observe
cluster liquid phases emerging, characterized by the spectrum of a composite
harmonic chain. Luttinger theory has to be adapted by changing the reference
lattice density field. In both the liquid and cluster liquid phases, we find
convincing evidence of a secondary mode, which becomes gapless only at the
transition. In that region, we also measure the central charge and observe its
increase towards c = 3/2, as recently evaluated in a related extended
Bose-Hubbard model, and we note a fast reduction of the Luttinger parameter.
For 2-particle clusters, we then interpret such observations in terms of the
compresence of a Luttinger liquid and a critical transverse Ising model,
related to the instability of the reference lattice density field towards
coalescence of sites, typical of potentials which are flat at short distances.
Even in the absence of a true lattice, we are able to evaluate the spatial
correlation function of a suitable pseudo-spin operator, which manifests
ferromagnetic order in the cluster liquid phase, exponential decay in the

valuable task. We define a novel problem of generating explanations of a time
series event by (1) searching cause and effect relationships of the time series
with textual data and (2) constructing a connecting chain between them to
generate an explanation. To detect causal features from text, we propose a
novel method based on the Granger causality of time series between features
extracted from text such as N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition.
The generation of the sequence of causal entities requires a commonsense
causative knowledge base with efficient reasoning. To ensure good
interpretability and appropriate lexical usage we combine symbolic and neural
representations, using a neural reasoning algorithm trained on commonsense
causal tuples to predict the next cause step. Our quantitative and human
analysis show empirical evidence that our method successfully extracts
meaningful causality relationships between time series with textual features
and generates appropriate explanation between them.

two-dimensional numerical models of hydrodynamic convection in a Cartesian

needs its k out of all n sub-tasks to be finished. Since (n, k) fork-join
queues are prevalent in popular distributed systems, erasure coding based cloud
storages, and modern network protocols like multipath routing, estimating the
sojourn time of such queues is thus critical for the performance measurement
and resource plan of computer clusters. However, the estimating keeps to be a
well-known open challenge for years, and only rough bounds for a limited range
of load factors have been given. In this paper, we developed a closed-form
linear transformation technique for jointly-identical random variables: An
order statistic can be represented by a linear combination of maxima. This
brand-new technique is then used to transform the sojourn time of non-purging
(n, k) fork-join queues into a linear combination of the sojourn times of basic
(k, k), (k+1, k+1), ..., (n, n) fork-join queues. Consequently, existing
approximations for basic fork-join queues can be bridged to the approximations
for non-purging (n, k) fork-join queues. The uncovered approximations are then
used to improve the upper bounds for purging (n, k) fork-join queues.
Simulation experiments show that this linear transformation approach is
practiced well for moderate n and relatively large k.

\emph{edge failure} in tree-based communication networks: just replace the
failing edge with its respective swap edge, so as that the connectivity is
promptly reestablished by minimizing the rerouting and set-up costs. In this
paper, we solve the ABSE problem for the case in which $T$ is a
\emph{single-source shortest-path tree} of $G$, and our two selected swap
criteria aim to minimize either the \emph{maximum} or the \emph{average
stretch} in the swap tree of all the paths emanating from the source. Having
these criteria in mind, the obtained structures can then be reviewed as
\emph{edge-fault-tolerant single-source spanners}. For them, we propose two
efficient algorithms running in $O(m n +n^2 \log n)$ and $O(m n \log
\alpha(m,n))$ time, respectively, and we show that the guaranteed (either
maximum or average, respectively) stretch factor is equal to 3, and this is
tight. Moreover, for the maximum stretch, we also propose an almost linear $O(m
\log \alpha(m,n))$ time algorithm computing a set of \emph{good} swap edges,
each of which will guarantee a relative approximation factor on the maximum
stretch of $3/2$ (tight) as opposed to that provided by the corresponding BSE.
Surprisingly, no previous results were known for these two very natural swap
problems.

interstellar matter thus plays an important role in astrochemistry. We have
used ALMA to mosaic a small field of the Orion Bar where the critical
transition from atomic to molecular gas takes place. These observations provide
an unprecedented sharp view of this transition layer (~1"" resolution or ~414
AU). The resulting images (so far in the rotational emission of CO, HCO+,
H13CO+, SO+, SO, and reactive ions SH+ and HOC+) show the small-scale structure
in gas density and temperature, and the steep abundance gradients. The images
reveal a pattern of high-density substructures, photo-ablative gas flows and
instabilities at the edge of the molecular cloud. We have also used the IRAM
30m telescope to carry out a line-survey of the illuminated edge of the Bar in
the mm domain. Our observations reveal the presence of complex organic
molecules that were not expected in such a harsh environment. In particular, we
have reported the first detection of the unstable cis conformer of formic acid
(HCOOH) in the ISM. The energy barrier to internal rotation (the conversion
from trans to cis) is approximately 4827 cm-1. Hence, this detection is
surprising. The low inferred trans-to-cis abundance ratio of 2.8+/-1.0 supports
a photoswitching mechanism: a given conformer absorbs a FUV stellar photon that
radiatively excites the molecule to electronic states above the interconversion
barrier. Subsequent fluorescent decay leaves the molecule in a different
conformer form. This mechanism, which we have specifically studied with ab
initio quantum calculations, was not considered so far in astrochemistry
although it can affect the structure of a variety of molecules in PDRs.

a geodesic, because of forces that arise from couplings between its multipole
moments and the ambient curvature. An illustration of this fact was provided by
Wisdom, who showed that the motion of a quasi-rigid body undergoing cyclic
changes of shape in a curved spacetime deviates, in general, from a geodesic.
Wisdom's analysis, however, was recently challenged on the grounds that the
body's motion should be described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations,
and that these predict geodesic motion for the kind of body considered by
Wisdom. We attempt to shed some light on this matter by examining the motion of
an internally-moving tripod in Schwarzschild spacetime, as viewed by a Fermi
observer moving on a timelike geodesic. We find that the description of the
motion depends sensitively on a choice of cycle for the tripod's internal
motions, but also on a choice of ""center of mass"" for the tripod; a sensible
(though not unique) prescription for this ""center of mass"" produces a motion
that conforms with Wisdom's prediction: the tripod drifts away from the
observer, even when they are given identical initial conditions. We suggest
pathways of reconciliation between this conclusion and the null result that
apparently follows from the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations of motion.

MINCUT problem on dense random graphs; namely with high probability, the greedy
search for a local MINCUT of $\mathcal G(N,p)$ with $p>0$ fixed, started from a
uniform random partition, fails to find a non-trivial cut. In contrast, in the
disordered Curie--Weiss model with heavy-tailed couplings, we demonstrate that
zero-temperature dynamics has positive probability of absorbing in a random
local minimum different from the two homogenous ground states.

with a judicious implementation of the LARS operators, is responsible for
significantly better runtimes than the ones of other state-of-the-art systems

cosmic gas accretion rate. This involves comparing the comoving densities of

redshifts. We constrained gas accretion until z = 5, and we found that the gas
accretion rate density (GARD) is relatively constant in the range from z = 5 to
z = 0. This constancy in the GARD is not reflected by the SFRD, which declines
significantly between z = 1.0 and z = 0. This work suggests that the decline is
not due to a reduction in GARD.

fermionic current density in a (D+1)-dimensional locally AdS spacetime with an
arbitrary number of toroidally compactified Poincare spatial dimensions and in
the presence of a constant gauge field. The latter can be formally interpreted
in terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact
subspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary
phases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has
nonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic
functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and
tend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the
background gravitational field is small and the leading term in the
corresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field
in the locally Minkowski bulk. Unlike the Minkowskian case, in the system
consisting an equal number of fermionic and scalar degrees of freedom, with
same masses, charges and phases in the periodicity conditions, the total
current density does not vanish. In these systems, the leading divergences in
the scalar and fermionic contributions on the horizon are canceled and, as a
consequence of that, the charge flux, integrated over the coordinate
perpendicular to the AdS boundary, becomes finite. We show that in odd
spacetime dimensions the fermionic fields realizing two inequivalent
representations of the Clifford algebra and having equal phases in the
periodicity conditions give the same contribution to the VEV of the current
density. Combining the contributions from these fields, the current density in

much of the attention of the research community because of the performance gaps
of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the
most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide
spectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to
collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that
a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit
presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never
been implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year
untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag
hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which
moves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design
three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and
tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective
reading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2
protocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply
our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality
estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of
Tash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,
000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication
overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead
drop of 29.7%.

passes through zero. The equation may be analysed using a combination of WKB,

the boundary condition of a vanishing stress tensor (more precisely the
radial-azimuthal component thereof) allows smooth stable modes to exist
external to the angular momentum singularity, the innermost stable circular

A common way to tackle this problem is through the use of a shrinkage estimator

based on the implicit versions of standard steps of renormalization procedure
--- regularization, subtraction and removing the regularization. The proposed
procedure is based on the calculation of a set of convergent sums, which are
related to the original divergent sum for the non-renormalized Casimir energy.
Then one constructs a linear equations system, that connects this set of
convergent sums with the renormalized Casimir energy, which is a solution to
this equations system. This procedure slightly reduces the indeterminancy that
arises in standard procedure when we choose the particular regularization and
the explicit form of counterterm. The proposed procedure is more efficient from
the computational point of view than the standard one. It can be applied not
only for systems with the explicit transcendental equation for the spectrum,

campaign observing Ark 120 in X-rays with XMM-Newton (4$\times$120 ks, 2014
March 18-24), and NuSTAR (65.5 ks, 2014 March 22). During this very deep X-ray
campaign, the source was caught in a high flux state similar to the earlier
2003 XMM-Newton observation, and about twice as bright as the lower-flux
observation in 2013. The spectral analysis confirms the ""softer when brighter""
behaviour of Ark 120. The four XMM-Newton/pn spectra are characterized by the
presence of a prominent soft X-ray excess and a significant FeK$\alpha$
complex. The continuum is very similar above about 3 keV, while significant
variability is present for the soft X-ray excess. We find that relativistic
reflection from a constant-density, flat accretion disk cannot simultaneously
produce the soft excess, broad FeK$\alpha$ complex, and hard X-ray excess.
Instead, Comptonization reproduces the broadband (0.3-79 keV) continuum well,
together with a contribution from a mildly relativistic disk reflection
spectrum. During this 2014 observational campaign, the soft X-ray spectrum of
Ark 120 below $\sim$0.5 keV was found to be dominated by Comptonization of seed
photons from the disk by a warm ($kT_{\rm e}$$\sim$0.5 keV), optically-thick
corona ($\tau$$\sim$9). Above this energy, the X-ray spectrum becomes dominated
by Comptonization from electrons in a hot optically thin corona, while the
broad FeK$\alpha$ line and the mild Compton hump result from reflection off the
disk at several tens of gravitational radii.

proposed. The model learns from the time domain amplitude and phase information

features like higher order cyclic moments. Analyses show that the proposed
model yields an average classification accuracy of close to 90% at varying SNR
conditions ranging from 0dB to 20dB. Further, we explore the utility of this

can learn good representations of variable length time domain sequences, which
is useful in classifying modulation signals with different symbol rates. The
achieved accuracy of 75% on an input sample length of 64 for which it was not
trained, substantiates the representation power of the model. To reduce the
data communication overhead from distributed sensors, the feasibility of
classification using averaged magnitude spectrum data, or online classification
on the low cost sensors is studied. Furthermore, quantized realizations of the
proposed models are analyzed for deployment on sensors with low processing

identical for all rock fracture experiments at short times, this is not the

consequence of the aftershock identification method used and show that the true
aftershock rates might have two distinct regimes. Specifically, tests on a

General Relativity toward infinity, but modifies it at short distance. At far
short distance, gravitational force can be even repulsive. These may solve the
dark matter and energy problems, as they arise essentially from small $R/(MG)$

equivocation between an ""evidence-in-hand"" conception of knowledge and a weaker

to a trimodal logic of knowledge, knowability, and belief interpreted in
topological subset spaces in which belief is definable in terms of knowledge
and knowability. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization for this logic
as well as its uni-modal belief fragment. We then consider weaker logics that
preserve suitable translations of Stalnaker's postulates, yet do not allow for
any reduction of belief. We propose novel topological semantics for these

mathematics from an unconventional viewpoint, including number theory, gauge
theory, representation, knot theory and etc. By applying to physics, these
novel perspectives endow with a unified account of the (integer/ fractional)
quantum Hall effect. The plateaus of the Hall conductance are described by
Hecke eigensheaves of the geometric Langlands correspondence. Especially, the
particle-vortex duality, which is explained by S-duality of Chern-Simons
theory, corresponds to the Langlands duality in Wilson and Hecke operators.
Moreover the Langlands duality in the quantum group associated with the
Hamiltonian describes fractal energy spectrum structure, know as Hofstadter's
butterfly. These results suggest that the Langlands program has many physically
realistic meanings.

different strategies in transmission and receiving of data. Security, packet
delivery and routing overhead are important concerns for any protocol during
designing them. The presence and absence of malicious nodes in the network
affect a lot on the performance of the protocol. This research is mainly
focused on the study of the threats, attacks and reasons for malicious behavior
of nodes in the network for reactive routing protocols in MANETS. DSR and AODV
are the two reactive routing protocols that were considered for the study to
propose a second chance strategy to be given to the nodes considering the
reason for malicious behavior to improve the packet delivery ratio and reduce
the routing overhead in the network. A simulative study has been conducted
using Ad hoc Simulator (ASIM) considering the DSR and AODV routing protocols in
the presence of malicious nodes and in the absence of malicious nodes which
showed that the packet delivery ratio is low and routing overhead is high in
the absence of malicious nodes. The second chance strategy proposed considers
the reasons for malicious behavior and helps the node to get reintegrated in
the network to improve the packet delivery ratio and reduce the routing
overhead.

infrastructures. However, the amount of diagnostic imaging procedures has
continuously increased over the last decades, imposing several challenges
associated with the storage volume, data redundancy and availability. Cloud
platforms are focused on delivering hardware and software services over the
Internet, becoming an appealing solution for repository outsourcing. Although
this option may bring financial and technological benefits, it also presents
new challenges. In medical imaging scenarios, communication latency is a
critical issue that still hinders the adoption of this paradigm. This paper
proposes an intelligent Cloud storage gateway that optimizes data access times.
This is achieved through a new cache architecture that combines static rules
and pattern recognition for eviction and prefetching. The evaluation results,
obtained through simulations over a real-world dataset, show that cache hit
ratios can reach around 80%, leading reductions of image retrieval times by
over 60%. The combined use of eviction and prefetching policies pro- posed can
significantly reduce communication latency, even when using a small cache in
comparison to the total size of the repository. Apart from the performance
gains, the proposed system is capable of adjusting to specific workflows of
different institutions.

gap, we propose a multi-layer network to model and analyze air traffic systems.
A Route-based Airspace Network (RAN) and Flight Trajectory Network (FTN)
encapsulate critical physical and operational characteristics; an Integrated
Flow-Driven Network (IFDN) and Interrelated Conflict-Communication Network
(ICCN) are formulated to represent air traffic flow transmissions and
intervention from air traffic controllers, respectively. Furthermore, a set of
analytical metrics including network variables, complex network attributes,
controllers' cognitive complexity, and chaotic metrics are introduced and
applied in a case study of Guangzhou terminal airspace. Empirical results show
the existence of fundamental diagram and macroscopic fundamental diagram at the
route, sector and terminal levels. Moreover, the dynamics and underlying
mechanisms of ""ATCOs-flow"" interactions are revealed and interpreted by
adaptive meta-cognition strategies based on network analysis of the ICCN.
Finally, at the system level, chaos is identified in conflict system and human
behavioral system when traffic switch to the semi-stable or congested phase.
This study offers analytical tools for understanding the complex human-flow
interactions at potentially a broad range of air traffic systems, and underpins
future developments and automation of intelligent air traffic management

of the outstanding open problems in solar physics. It is generally accepted
that magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in these conversion processes.
To achieve the rapid energy release required in solar flares, an anomalous
resistivity, orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity, is often
used in MHD simulations of reconnection. Spitzer resistivity is based on
Coulomb scattering, which becomes negligible at the high energies achieved by
accelerated particles. As a result, simulations of particle acceleration in
reconnection events are often performed in the absence of any interaction
between accelerated particles and any background plasma. This need not be the
case for scattering associated with anomalous resistivity caused by turbulence
within solar flares, as the higher resistivity implies an elevated scattering
rate. We present results of test particle calculations, with and without pitch
angle scattering, subject to fields derived from MHD simulations of
two-dimensional (2D) X-point reconnection. Scattering rates proportional to the
ratio of the anomalous resistivity to the local Spitzer resistivity, as well as
at fixed values, are considered. Pitch angle scattering, which is independent
of the anomalous resistivity, causes higher maximum energies in comparison to
those obtained without scattering. Scattering rates which are dependent on the
local anomalous resistivity tend to produce fewer highly energised particles
due to weaker scattering in the separatrices, even though scattering in the
current sheet may be stronger when compared to resistivity-independent
scattering. Strong scattering also causes an increase in the number of
particles exiting the computational box in the reconnection outflow region, as
opposed to along the separatrices as is the case in the absence of scattering.

(RS) on fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in mode I. The objective of this
work is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation of a RS field in
the studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing
FCPR. This led to the development of a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES,
in which RS are introduced by weld bead deposition far from the region in which
fatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a consequence, the effect of factors
influencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes or plastic
deformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding
RS introduced in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and
the weight functions method was used to calculate the stress intensity factor
(SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack propagates into the
specimen. The evolution of cyclic stress ratio at the crack tip, Rlocal, was
then computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the cyclic stress
ratio. The results show that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR
of the welded geometry with fixed externally low R ratio (R = 0.1), but
constantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry
without RS, solicited at high cyclic stress ratio (R = 0.7). These observations
partially validate the BS7910 standard philosophy in which the remaining life
of a flawed structure in presence of tensile RS is calculated from a high
cyclic stress ratio (R > 0.5) crack propagation curve to eliminate crack
closure effects.

core is a surrogate model employing a machine-learning technique called
kriging, which is combined with data-driven basis functions to extract and
model the underlying coherent structures. This emulation framework encompasses
key design parameter sensitivity analysis, physics-guided classification of
design parameter sets, and flow evolution modeling for efficient design survey.
To better inform the model of quantifiable physical knowledge, a sensitivity
analysis using Sobol' indices and a decision tree are incorporated into the
framework. This information improves the surrogate model training process,
which employs basis functions as regression functions over the design space for
the kriging model. The novelty of the proposed approach is the construction of
the model through Common Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which allows for
data-reduction and extraction of common coherent structures. The accuracy of
prediction of mean flow features for new swirl injector designs is assessed and
the dynamic flowfield is captured in the form of power spectrum densities. This
data-driven framework also demonstrates the uncertainty quantification of
predictions, providing a metric for model fit. The significantly reduced
computation time required for evaluating new design points enables efficient
survey of the design space.
