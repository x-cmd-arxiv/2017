infrastructure increasingly rely on sensitive data obtained from private
agents, e.g., location traces collected from the users of an intelligent
transportation system. In order to encourage the participation of these agents,
it becomes then critical to design algorithms that process information in a
privacy-preserving way. This article revisits the Kalman filtering and Linear
Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problems, subject to privacy constraints. We
aim to enforce differential privacy, a formal, state-of-the-art definition of
privacy ensuring that the output of an algorithm is not too sensitive to the
data collected from any single participating agent. A two-stage architecture is
proposed that first aggregates and combines the individual agent signals before
adding privacy-preserving noise and post-filtering the result to be published.
We show a significant performance improvement offered by this architecture over
input perturbation schemes as the number of input signals increases and that an
optimal static aggregation stage can be computed by solving a semidefinite
program. The two-stage architecture, which we develop first for Kalman
filtering, is then adapted to the LQG control problem by leveraging the
separation principle. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance
improvements over differentially private algorithms without first-stage signal
aggregation.

magnetically dominated proton-electron plasmas. Reconnection is driven by
large-scale magnetic stresses in interacting current-carrying flux tubes. Our
model relies on development of current-driven instabilities on macroscopic
scales. These tilt-kink instabilities develop in an initially force-free
equilibrium of repelling current channels. Using MHD methods we study a 3D
model of repelling and interacting flux tubes in which we simultaneously evolve
test particles, guided by electromagnetic fields obtained from MHD. We identify
two stages of particle acceleration; Initially particles accelerate in the
current channels, after which the flux ropes start tilting and kinking and
particles accelerate due to reconnection processes in the plasma. The explosive
stage of reconnection produces non-thermal energy distributions with slopes
that depend on plasma resistivity and the initial particle velocity. We also
discuss the influence of the length of the flux ropes on particle acceleration
and energy distributions. This study extends previous 2.5D results to 3D
setups, providing all ingredients needed to model realistic scenarios like
solar flares, black hole flares and particle acceleration in pulsar wind
nebulae: formation of strong resistive electric fields, explosive reconnection
and non-thermal particle distributions. By assuming initial energy
equipartition between electrons and protons, applying low resistivity in
accordance with solar corona conditions and limiting the flux rope length to a
fraction of a solar radius we obtain realistic energy distributions for solar
flares with non-thermal power law tails and maximum electron energies up to 11
MeV and maximum proton energies up to 1 GeV.

gives rise to satellite peaks in the diffraction pattern of the grating. An

MS detector, we show that the optimal ML symbol-by-symbol (SS) detector can be
equivalently written in the form of a threshold-based detector, where the
optimal decision threshold is constant and depends only on the statistics of
the MC channel. The main challenge of the MS detector is the complexity
associated with the calculation of the optimal detection metric. To overcome
this issue, we propose an approximate MS detection metric which can be
expressed in closed form. To reduce complexity even further, we develop a
non-coherent decision-feedback (DF) detector and a suboptimal blind detector.
Finally, we derive analytical expressions for the bit error rate (BER) of the
optimal SS detector, as well as upper and lower bounds for the BER of the
optimal MS detector. Simulation results confirm the analysis and reveal the
effectiveness of the proposed optimal and suboptimal detection schemes compared
to a benchmark scheme that assumes perfect CSI knowledge, particularly when the
number of observations used for detection is sufficiently large.

elastic networks is characterized by a bulk topological invariant called the
polarization; materials with a well-defined uniform polarization display a
dramatic range of edge softnesses depending on the orientation of the
polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in all
three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials proposed to date, the topological
edge modes are mixed with bulk soft modes and so-called Weyl loops. Here, we
report the design of a gapped 3D topological metamaterial with a uniform
polarization that displays a corresponding asymmetry between the number of soft
modes on opposing surfaces and, in addition, no bulk soft modes. We then use
this construction to localize topological soft modes in interior regions of the

to three dimensions. We derive a general formula that relates the difference in
the number of soft modes and states of self-stress localized along the
dislocation loop to the handedness of the vector triad formed by the lattice

gravity to higher dimensions. Some models allowing a $1/N$ expansion have been
explored, most of them generating branched-polymer geometries. Recently,
enhancements yielding an additional 2d quantum-gravity (planar) phase and an
intermediate regime of proliferating baby-universes have been found. It remains
an open issue to find models escaping these lower dimensionality universality
classes.
  Here we analyse the dominant regime and critical behaviour of a range of new
models which are candidates for such effective geometries, in particular
interactions based on the utility graph $K_{3,3}$. We find that, upon proper
enhancement, the two-phase structure of a branched-polymer and a 2d gravity
regime is the common case in $U(N)$-invariant rank $D=4$ tensor models of small
orders. Not only the well known so-called necklace interactions but also
$K_{3,3}$-type interactions turn out as the source for the planar regime. We
give a systematic account of the enhancement scaling, the counting of
leading-order diagrams and the multi-critical behaviour of a wide range of
interactions, in particular for all order-6 interactions of rank 3 and 4. These
findings support the claim of universality of such mixtures of branched-polymer
and planar diagrams at criticality. In particular, this hints at the necessity
to consider new ingredients, or interactions of higher order and rank, in order
to obtain higher dimensional continuum geometry from tensor models.

the library has been linked with Siesta and Abinit, allowing them to work with
the same pseudopotential operator (with the same local part and fully non-local
projectors) thus easing the comparison of their results for the structural and
electronic properties, as shown for several example systems. This methodology
can be easily transferred to any other package that uses norm-conserving

solving for the whole camera pipeline (colour correction, tone and gamut

through the positions and shapes of galaxies with poorly resolved measurements
of their radial coordinates. While a tomographic analysis can be used to
recover some of the large-scale radial modes present in the data, this approach
suffers from a number of practical shortcomings, and the criteria to decide on
a particular binning scheme are commonly blind to the ultimate science goals.
We present a method designed to separate and compress the data into a small
number of uncorrelated radial modes, circumventing some of the problems of
standard tomographic analyses. The method is based on the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve
transform (KL), and is connected to other 3D data compression bases advocated
in the literature, such as the Fourier-Bessel decomposition. We apply this
method to both weak lensing and galaxy clustering. In the case of galaxy
clustering, we show that the resulting optimal basis is closely associated with
the Fourier-Bessel basis, and that for certain observables, such as the effects
of magnification bias or primordial non-Gaussianity, the bulk of the signal can
be compressed into a small number of modes. In the case of weak lensing we show
that the method is able to compress the vast majority of the signal-to-noise
into a single mode, and that optimal cosmological constraints can be obtained
considering only three uncorrelated KL eigenmodes, considerably simplifying the
analysis with respect to a traditional tomographic approach.

particle thresholds are prototypical open quantum systems. Theories of such
states must take into account configuration mixing effects in the presence of
strong coupling to the particle continuum space.
  ${\bf Purpose:}$ To describe structure and decays of three-body systems, we
developed a Gamow coupled-channel (GCC) approach in Jacobi coordinates by
employing the complex-momentum formalism. We benchmarked the new framework
against the complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM).
  ${\bf Methods:}$ The GCC formalism is expressed in Jacobi coordinates, so
that the center-of-mass motion is automatically eliminated. To solve the
coupled-channel equations, we use hyperspherical harmonics to describe the
angular wave functions while the radial wave functions are expanded in the
Berggren ensemble, which includes bound, scattering and Gamow states.
  ${\bf Results:}$ We show that the GCC method is both accurate and robust. Its
results for energies, decay widths, and nucleon-nucleon angular correlations
are in good agreement with the GSM results.
  ${\bf Conclusions:}$ We have demonstrated that a three-body GSM formalism
explicitly constructed in cluster-orbital shell model coordinates provides
similar results to a GCC framework expressed in Jacobi coordinates, provided
that a large configuration space is employed. Our calculations for $A=6$
systems and $^{26}$O show that nucleon-nucleon angular correlations are
sensitive to the valence-neutron interaction. The new GCC technique has many
attractive features when applied to bound and unbound states of three-body
systems: it is precise, efficient, and can be extended by introducing a
microscopic model of the core.

validates the belief that non-ergodicity plays an important role in preserving
information of quantum states undergoing lossy evolution. We also consider a

its reduced dynamics, to subsequently investigate the information loss and
nonergodicity in such dynamics. We comment on the minimal situations that

low {\it Herschel} flux densities; most are thus expected to be unlensed,
extraordinarily luminous starbursts at $z \gtrsim 4$, modulo the considerable
cross-section to gravitational lensing implied by their redshift. We observed
17 of these galaxies with NOEMA and four with ALMA, scanning through the 3-mm
atmospheric window. We have obtained secure redshifts for seven galaxies via
detection of multiple CO lines, one of them a lensed system at $z=6.027$ (two
others are also found to be lensed); a single emission line was detected in
another four galaxies, one of which has been shown elsewhere to lie at

less luminous by 0.3-0.4 dex, which goes some way to explaining our failure to
detect line emission. We show that this sample contains amongst the most
luminous known star-forming galaxies. Due to their extreme star-formation
activity, these galaxies will consume their molecular gas in $\lesssim 100$
Myr, despite their high molecular gas masses, and are therefore plausible
progenitors of the massive, `red-and-dead' elliptical galaxies at $z \approx

dust repelled by the host star's wind. The clouds are produced by avalanches:
radial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass as they shatter
background disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are
triggered from a region a few AU across -- the ""avalanche zone"" -- located on
AU Mic's primary ""birth"" ring, at a true distance of $\sim$35 AU from the star
but at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller: the avalanche
zone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring
nearest Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the
southeast, as observed. The avalanche zone marks where the primary ring
intersects a secondary ring of debris left by the catastrophic disruption of a
progenitor up to Varuna in size, less than tens of thousands of years ago. Only
where the rings intersect are particle collisions sufficiently violent to spawn
the sub-micron dust needed to seed the avalanches. We show that this picture
works quantitatively, reproducing the masses, sizes, and velocities of the
observed escaping clouds. The Lorentz force exerted by the wind's magnetic
field, whose polarity reverses periodically according to the stellar magnetic
cycle, promises to explain the observed vertical undulations. The timescale
between avalanches, about 10 yr, might be set by time variability of the wind
mass-loss rate or, more speculatively, by some self-regulating limit cycle.

progenitor black holes. In two of the four events, GW150914, and the recent
GW170104, the observed spins are most likely negative (but consistent with
zero). In the third case LVT151012 it is practically zero and only in the forth

within the field binary scenario in which positive higher spins are expected.
Considering the most favorable Wolfe Rayet (WR) progenitors we estimate the
expected spin distribution for different evolution scenarios and compare it to
the observations. With typical parameters one expects a significant fraction
($\ge 25\%$) of the mergers to have high effective spin values. However due to
uncertainties in the outcome of the common envelope phase (typical separation
and whether the stars are rotating or not) and in the late stages of massive
star evolution (the strength of the winds) one cannot rule our scenarios in
which the expected spins are low. While observations of high effective spin
events will support this scenario, further observations of negative spin events
would rule it out.

measure to the environmental medium of the host galaxy. Here we show that the

the large dispersion measure can be due to a motion effect mainly from the

IR versus UV). These diverse categories are related by a web of exact functors
expressing physical relations between the various objects/pictures. A basic
theme of this review is the emphasis on the full web of categories, rather than
on what we can learn from a single description. A second general theme is
viewing the cluster category as a sort of `categorification' of 't Hooft's
theory of quantum phases for a 4d non-Abelian gauge theory. The $S$-duality
group is best described as the auto-equivalences of the full web of categories.
This viewpoint leads to a combinatorial algorithm to search for $S$-dualities

groups are not too big, the algorithm may be effectively run on a laptop. This
viewpoint also leads to a clearer view of $3d$ mirror symmetry. For class

Potential mechanisms include the erosion of carbonaceous materials by photons
or atomic oxygen in the surface layers of the protoplanetary disk. Under
photochemically generated favorable conditions, these reactions can deplete the
near-surface abundance of carbon grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by
several orders of magnitude on short timescales relative to the lifetime of the
disk out to radii of ~20-100+ au from the central star depending on the form of
refractory carbon present. Due to the reliance of destruction mechanisms on a
high influx of photons, the extent of refractory carbon depletion is quite
sensitive to the disk's internal radiation field. Dust transport within the
disk is required to affect the composition of the midplane. In our current
model of a passive, constant-alpha disk, where alpha = 0.01, carbon grains can
be turbulently lofted into the destructive surface layers and depleted out to
radii of ~3-10 au for 0.1-1 um grains. Smaller grains can be cleared out of the

protoplanetary discs is entirely described by the disc's torque. This torque is
a complex function of the disc parameters, and essentially amounts to the sum
of two components: the Lindblad torque and the corotation torque. Known torque
formulae do not reproduce accurately the torque actually experienced in
numerical simulations by low- and intermediate- mass planets in radiative
discs. One of the main reasons for this inaccuracy is that these formulae have
been worked out in two-dimensional analyses. Here we revisit the torque formula
and update many of its dimensionless coefficients by means of tailored, three-
dimensional numerical simulations. In particular, we derive the dependence of
the Lindblad torque on the temperature gradient, the dependence of the
corotation torque on the radial entropy gradient (and work out a suitable
expression of this gradient in a three-dimensional disc). We also work out the
dependence of the corotation torque on the radial temperature gradient,
overlooked so far. Corotation torques are known to scale very steeply with the
width of the horseshoe region. We extend the expression of this width to the
domain of intermediate mass planets, so that our updated torque formula remains
valid for planets up to typically several tens of Earth masses, provided these
relatively massive planets do not significantly deplete their coorbital region.
Our torque expression can be applied to low- and intermediate-mass planets in
optically thick protoplanetary discs, as well as protomoons embedded in
circumplanetary discs.

disordered proteins (IDPs) is driven by interactions encoded by their amino
acid sequences. Little is currently known about the molecular recognition
mechanisms for distributing different IDP sequences into various cellular
membraneless compartments. Pertinent physics was addressed recently by applying
random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer theory to electrostatics, which is a
major energetic component governing IDP phase properties. RPA accounts for
charge patterns and thus has advantages over Flory-Huggins and Overbeek-Voorn
mean-field theories. To make progress toward deciphering the phase behaviors of
multiple IDP sequences, the RPA formulation for one IDP species plus solvent is
hereby extended to treat polyampholyte solutions containing two IDP species.
The new formulation generally allows for binary coexistence of two phases, each
containing a different set of volume fractions $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ for the two
different IDP sequences. The asymmetry between the two predicted coexisting
phases with regard to their $\phi_1/\phi_2$ ratios for the two sequences
increases with increasing mismatch between their charge patterns. This finding
points to a multivalent, stochastic, ""fuzzy"" mode of molecular recognition that
helps populate various IDP sequences differentially into separate phase
compartments. An intuitive illustration of this trend is provided by
Flory-Huggins models, whereby a hypothetical case of ternary coexistence is
also explored. Augmentations of the present RPA theory with a relative
permittivity $\epsilon_{\rm r}(\phi)$ that depends on IDP volume fraction
$\phi=\phi_1+\phi_2$ lead to higher propensities to phase separate, in line
with the case with one IDP species we studied previously. ...

function of galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, and the matter density of their
large scale environment. Matter densities are inferred from our ELUCID
simulation, a constrained simulation of local Universe sampled by SDSS, while
halo masses and central/satellite classification are taken from the galaxy
group catalog of Yang et al. The quenched fraction for the total population
increases systematically with the three quantities. We find that the
`environmental quenching efficiency', which quantifies the quenched fraction as
function of halo mass, is independent of stellar mass. And this independence is
the origin of the stellar mass-independence of density-based quenching
efficiency, found in previous studies. Considering centrals and satellites
separately, we find that the two populations follow similar correlations of
quenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have
experienced similar quenching processes in their host halo. We demonstrate that
satellite quenching alone cannot account for the environmental quenching
efficiency of the total galaxy population and the difference between the two
populations found previously mainly arises from the fact that centrals and
satellites of the same stellar mass reside, on average, in halos of different
mass. After removing these halo-mass and stellar-mass effects, there remains a
weak, but significant, residual dependence on environmental density, which is
eliminated when halo assembly bias is taken into account. Our results therefore
indicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter that regulates the
quenching of both centrals and satellites.

loss-based estimator for data-dependent stochastic direct and indirect effects.
The proposed method treats the intermediate confounder affected by prior

mediator using a distribution which conditions on baseline covariates and
marginalizes over the intermediate confounder. In addition, we assume the
stochastic intervention is given, conditional on observed data, which results
in a simpler estimator and weaker identification assumptions. We demonstrate
the estimator's finite sample and robustness properties in a simple simulation
study. We apply the method to an example from the Moving to Opportunity

the treatment/instrument that influenced moving to a low-poverty neighborhood,
which is the intermediate confounder. We estimate the data-dependent stochastic
direct effect of randomization to the voucher group on adolescent marijuana use

spectra of Balmer-dominated shocks (BDSs) have characteristic narrow (FWHM
$\sim$ 10 kms$^{-1}$) and broad (FWHM $\sim$ 1000 kms$^{-1}$) H$\alpha$
components. CRs affect the H$\alpha$-line parameters: heating the cold neutrals
in the interstellar medium results in broadening of the narrow H$\alpha$-line
width beyond 20 kms$^{-1}$, but also in reduction of the broad H$\alpha$-line
width due to energy being removed from the protons in the post-shock region.
For the first time we show that the width of the narrow H$\alpha$ line, much
larger than 20 kms$^{-1}$, is not a resolution or geometric effect nor a
spurious result of a neglected intermediate (FWHM $\sim$ 100 kms$^{-1}$)
component resulting from hydrogen atoms undergoing charge exchange with warm
protons in the broad-neutral precursor. Moreover, we show that a narrow line
width $\gg$ 20 kms$^{-1}$ extends across the entire NE rim, implying CR
acceleration is ubiquitous, and making it possible to relate its strength to
locally varying shock conditions. Finally, we find several locations along the

identified a set of 38 mutation operators, and implemented an infrastructure to
automatically seed mutations in Android apps with 35 of the identified

very interesting challenge to the members of the study group. Engino.net Ltd is
a Cypriot company, founded in 2004, that produces a series of toy sets -- the
Engino$^{\circledR}$ toy sets -- consisting of a number of building blocks
which can be assembled by pupils to compose toy models. Depending on the
contents of a particular toy set, the company has developed a number of models
that can be built utilizing the blocks present in the set, however the
production of a step-by-step assembly manual for each model could only be done
manually. The goal of the challenge posed by the company was to implement a
procedure to automatically generate the assembly instructions for a given toy.
In the present paper we propose a graph-theoretic approach to model the problem
and provide a series of results to solve it by employing modified versions of
well established algorithms in graph theory. An algorithmic procedure to obtain
a hierarchical, physically feasible decomposition of a given toy model, from

and IoT devices. RA is usually realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a
trusted party -- verifier -- measures integrity of a potentially compromised
remote device -- prover. Early work focused on purely software-based and fully
hardware-based techniques, neither of which is ideal for low-end devices. More
recent results have yielded hybrid (SW/HW) security architectures comprised of
a minimal set of features to support efficient and secure RA on low-end
devices.
  All prior RA techniques require on-demand operation, i.e, RA is performed in
real time. We identify some drawbacks of this general approach in the context
of unattended devices: First, it fails to detect mobile malware that enters and
leaves the prover between successive RA instances. Second, it requires the
prover to engage in a potentially expensive (in terms of time and energy)
computation, which can be harmful for critical or real-time devices.
  To address these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of self-measurement
where a prover device periodically (and securely) measures and records its own
software state, based on a pre-established schedule. A possibly untrusted
verifier occasionally collects and verifies these measurements. We present the
design of a concrete technique called ERASMUS : Efficient Remote Attestation
via Self-Measurement for Unattended Settings, justify its features and evaluate
its performance. In the process, we also define a new metric -- Quality of
Attestation (QoA). We argue that ERASMUS is well-suited for time-sensitive
and/or safety-critical applications that are not served well by on-demand RA.
Finally, we show that ERASMUS is a promising stepping stone towards handling
attestation of multiple devices (i.e., a group or swarm) with high mobility.

activity or background sources, I remain with 11 candidates that are presumably
associated with galactic disks or star formation regions. At least some of
these candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find
85 sources within 1"" of galactic nuclei. Assuming the radio persistent sources
are not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band

of luminous persistent sources of <5x10^-5 Mpc^-3, and that at any given time
only a small fraction of galaxies host a radio luminous persistent source
(<10^-3 L_*^-1). Assuming persistent sources life time of 100 yr, this implies
a birth rate of <5x10^-7 yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and
assuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources,
this sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of >0.8

superconducting core/shell nanowires subjected to the axial magnetic field. The
confinement in the radial direction results in the quantization of the electron
motion with energies determined by the radial $j$ and orbital $m$ quantum
numbers. In the external magnetic field the twofold degeneracy with respect to
the orbital magnetic quantum number $m$ is lifted which leads to the Fermi wave
vector mismatch between the paired electrons $(k, j,m,\uparrow) \leftrightarrow
(-k, j,-m,\downarrow)$. This mismatch is transfered to the nonzero total
momentum of the Cooper pairs which results in the formation of FF phase
occurring sequentially with increasing magnetic field. By changing the nanowire
radius $R$ and the superconducting shell thickness $d$, we discuss the role of
the orbital effect in the FF phase formation in both the nanowire-like ($R/d
\ll 1$) and nanofilm-like ($R/d \gg 1$) regime. We have found that the
irregular pattern of the FF phase, which appears for the case of the
nanowire-like regime, evolves towards the regular distribution, in which the FF

nanofilm-like geometry. The crossover between these two different phase
diagrams is explained as resulting from the orbital effect and the multigap

fitted to simple torsional force fields. The presented out-of-plane torsional

the problem of the vertical displacement of a single carbon atom out of the

for displacements up to about 0.5 $\AA$. The presented potential is applicable

time-varying loss functions, and time-varying constraints. The loss functions
are not fully accessible to the learner, and instead only the function values
(a.k.a. bandit feedback) are revealed at queried points. The constraints are
revealed after making decisions, and can be instantaneously violated, yet they
must be satisfied in the long term. This setting fits nicely the emerging
online network tasks such as fog computing in the Internet-of-Things (IoT),
where online decisions must flexibly adapt to the changing user preferences
(loss functions), and the temporally unpredictable availability of resources
(constraints). Tailored for such human-in-the-loop systems where the loss
functions are hard to model, a family of bandit online saddle-point (BanSaP)
schemes are developed, which adaptively adjust the online operations based on
(possibly multiple) bandit feedback of the loss functions, and the changing
environment. Performance here is assessed by: i) dynamic regret that
generalizes the widely used static regret; and, ii) fit that captures the
accumulated amount of constraint violations. Specifically, BanSaP is proved to
simultaneously yield sub-linear dynamic regret and fit, provided that the best
dynamic solutions vary slowly over time. Numerical tests in fog computation
offloading tasks corroborate that our proposed BanSaP approach offers
competitive performance relative to existing approaches that are based on

that these asteroids formed in the outer Solar System and were scattered along
with the Jupiter Trojans into their present-day positions during a chaotic
episode of dynamical restructuring. In order to explore the surface composition
of these enigmatic objects in comparison with an analogous study of Trojans
(Emery et al. 2011), we present new near-infrared spectra (0.7-2.5 $\mu$m) of
25 Hilda asteroids. No discernible absorption features are apparent in the

reported in previous studies, we classify 26 of the 28 Hildas in our spectral
sample into the so-called less-red and red sub-populations and find that the
two sub-populations have distinct average spectral shapes. Combining our
results with visible spectra, we find that Trojans and Hildas possess similar
overall spectral shapes, suggesting that the two minor body populations share a
common progenitor population. A more detailed examination reveals that while
the red Trojans and Hildas have nearly identical spectra, less-red Hildas are
systematically bluer in the visible and redder in the near-infrared than
less-red Trojans, indicating a putative broad, shallow absorption feature
between 0.5 and 1.0 $\mu$m. We argue that the less-red and red objects found in
both Hildas and Trojans represent two distinct surface chemistries and
attribute the small discrepancy between less-red Hildas and Trojans to the
difference in surface temperatures between the two regions.

stellar-mass functions (GLF and GSMF) carried out by the Dark Energy Survey
(DES). We describe the COMMODORE galaxy catalogue selected from Science
Verification images. This catalogue is made of $\sim 4\times 10^{6}$ galaxies
at $0<z\lesssim1.3$ over a sky area of $\sim155\ {\rm sq. \ deg}$ with ${\it
i}$-band limiting magnitude ${\it i}=23\ {\rm mag}$. Such characteristics are
unprecedented for galaxy catalogues and they enable us to study the evolution
of GLF and GSMF at $0<z<1$ homogeneously with the same statistically-rich
data-set and free of cosmic variance effects. The aim of this study is twofold:
i) we want to test our method based on the use of photometric-redshift
probability density functions against literature results obtained with
spectroscopic redshifts; ii) we want to shed light on the way galaxies build up
their masses over cosmic time. We find that both the ${\it i}$-band galaxy
luminosity and stellar mass functions are characterised by a double-Schechter
shape at $z<0.2$. Both functions agree well with those based on spectroscopic
redshifts. The DES GSMF agrees especially with those measured for the GAlaxy
Mass Assembly and the PRism MUlti-object Survey out to $z\sim1$. At $0.2<z<1$,
we find the ${\it i}$-band luminosity and stellar-mass densities respectively
to be constant ($\rho_{\rm L}\propto (1+z)^{-0.12\pm0.11}$) and decreasing
($\rho_{\rm Mstar}\propto (1+z)^{-0.5\pm0.1}$) with $z$. This indicates that,
while at higher redshift galaxies have less stellar mass, their luminosities do
not change substantially because of their younger and brighter stellar
populations. Finally, we also find evidence for a top-down mass-dependent
evolution of the GSMF.

ranging from regenerative medicine to commodity materials. A major drawback of
gels is their relative mechanical weakness, which worsens further under strain.
We report a new class of responsive gels with latent crosslinking moieties that
exhibit strain-stiffening behavior. This property results from the lability of
disulfides, initially isolated in a protected state, then activated to
crosslink on-demand. The active thiol groups are induced to form inter-chain
crosslinks when subjected to mechanical compression, resulting in a gel that
strengthens under strain. Molecular shielding design elements regulate the
strain-sensitivity and spontaneous crosslinking tendencies of the polymer
network. These strain-responsive gels represent a rational design of new
advanced materials with on-demand stiffening properties with potential
applications in elastomers, adhesives, foams, films, and fibers.

One of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is
increasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message
exchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. Recently, two
families of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of
atomic messages. The first one is the family of interpretation-functions. The
second is the family of witness-functions. In this paper, we show that the

various intriguing photometric and spectra characteristics. Using the archival
WISE and the newly released NEOWISE data, we found PS16dtm is experiencing a
mid-infrared (MIR) flare which started $\sim11$ days before the first optical
detection. Interpreting the MIR flare as a dust echo requires close
pre-existing dust with a high covering factor, and suggests the optical flare
may have brightened slowly for some time before it became bright detectable
from the ground. More evidence is given at the later epochs. At the peak of the
optical light curve, the new inner radius of the dust torus has grown to much
larger size, a factor of 7 of the initial radius due to strong radiation field.
At $\sim150$ days after the first optical detection, the dust temperature has
dropped well below the sublimation temperature. Other peculiar spectral
features shown by PS16dtm are the transient, prominent FeII emission lines and
outflows indicated by broad absorption lines detected during the optical flare.
Our model explains the enhanced FeII emission from iron newly released from the
evaporated dust. The observed broad absorption line outflow could be explained
by accelerated gas in the dust torus due to the radiation pressure.

valuable data. However, it is extremely hard work to manually analyze such huge
data. Thus, a method of automatic object detection is needed for satellite
images to facilitate efficient data analyses. This paper describes a new image
feature extended from higher-order local autocorrelation to the object
detection of multispectral satellite images. The feature has been extended to
extract spectral inter-relationships in addition to spatial relationships to
fully exploit multispectral information. The results of experiments with object
detection tasks conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature
extension indicate that the feature realized a higher performance compared to
existing methods.

Our approach is general, robust, and makes no other assumptions about the

automatically extract from the dataset: i) the vanishing point to calibrate the
virtual camera, and ii) the pedestrians' scales to generate a Spawn Probability
Map, which is a novel concept that guides our algorithm to place the
pedestrians at appropriate locations. After putting synthetic human-agents in
the unannotated images, we use these augmented images to train a Pedestrian
Detector, with the annotations generated along with the synthetic agents. We
conducted our experiments using Faster R-CNN by comparing the detection results
on the unannotated dataset performed by the detector trained using our approach
and detectors trained with other manually labeled datasets. We showed that our
approach improves the average precision by 5-13% over these detectors.

to be a viable black-hole entropy. In this study, as an alternative to
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, a power-law corrected entropy is applied to
Padmanabhan's holographic equipartition law to thermodynamically examine an
extra driving term in the cosmological equations for a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe at late times. Deviations from the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy generate an extra driving term (proportional to the
$\alpha$-th power of the Hubble parameter, where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless
constant for the power-law correction) in the acceleration equation, which can
be derived from the holographic equipartition law. Interestingly, the value of
the extra driving term in the present model is constrained by the second law of
thermodynamics. From the thermodynamic constraint, the order of the driving
term is found to be consistent with the order of the cosmological constant
measured by observations. In addition, the driving term tends to be
constant-like when $\alpha$ is small, i.e., when the deviation from the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is small.

domain, a common strategy is to start with a pre-trained deep neural network
and fine-tune it to the specialized domain. If the target domain covers a
smaller visual space than the source domain used for pre-training (e.g.
ImageNet), the fine-tuned network is likely to be over-parameterized. However,
applying network pruning as a post-processing step to reduce the memory
requirements has drawbacks: fine-tuning and pruning are performed
independently; pruning parameters are set once and cannot adapt over time; and
the highly parameterized nature of state-of-the-art pruning methods make it
prohibitive to manually search the pruning parameter space for deep networks,
leading to coarse approximations. We propose a principled method for jointly
fine-tuning and compressing a pre-trained convolutional network that overcomes
these limitations. Experiments on two specialized image domains (remote sensing
images and describable textures) demonstrate the validity of the proposed

that there are four classes including a human-like strategy in evolutionary
dynamics of social grooming strategies based on an evolutionary game
simulation. Social relationship strengths (as measured by frequency of social

may be due to time costs constraints on social grooming, because the costs are
too large to ignore for having many strong social relationships. Evolution of
humans' strategies of construction of social relationships may explain the
origin of human intelligence based on a social brain hypothesis. We constructed
an individual-based model to explore the evolutionary dynamics of social
grooming strategies. The model is based on behavior to win over others by
strengthening social relationships with cooperators. The results of
evolutionary simulations show the four classes of evolutionary dynamics. The
results depend on total resources and the ratio of each cooperator's resource
to the number of cooperators. One of the four classes is similar to a human
strategy, i.e. the strategies based on the Yule--Simon process of power law.

nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds by including both the
multi-angle $3\times3$ flavor mixing and the nucleosynthesis network
calculation. The number flux of energetic electron antineutrinos is raised by
collective neutrino oscillations in a $1$D supernova model for $40 M_{\odot}$
progenitor. When the gas temperature decreases down to $\sim2-3\times10^{9}$ K,
the increased flux of electron antineutrinos promotes $\nu p$ process more
actively, resulting in the enhancement of $p$-nuclei. In the early phase of
neutrino-driven wind, blowing at $0.6$ s after core bounce, oscillation effects
are prominent in inverted mass hierarchy and $p$-nuclei are synthesized up to
$^{106}\mathrm{Cd}$ and $^{108}\mathrm{Cd}$. On the other hand, in the later
wind trajectory at $1.1$ s after core bounce, abundances of $p$-nuclei are
increased remarkably by $\sim10-10^{4}$ times in normal mass hierarchy and even
reaching heavier $p$-nuclei such as $^{124}\mathrm{Xe}$, $^{126}\mathrm{Xe}$
and $^{130}\mathrm{Ba}$. The averaged overproduction factor of $p$-nuclei is
dominated by the later wind trajectories. Our results demonstrate that
collective neutrino oscillations can strongly influence $\nu p$ process, which
indicates that they should be included in the network calculations in order to
obtain precise abundances of $p$-nuclei. The conclusions of this paper depend
on the difference of initial neutrino parameters between electron and
non-electron antineutrino flavors which is large in our case. Further
systematic studies on input neutrino physics and wind trajectories are
necessary to draw a robust conclusion. However, this finding would help
understand the origin of solar-system isotopic abundances of $p$-nuclei such as
$^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru}$.

from two different neighborhood variation perspectives, and merged them into an
unified sample mining criterion deriving from Hellinger distance. Then, those
samples keeping stable correlation to their neighboring samples (i.e., having
small category variation in distribution) across the successive feature space
transformation, are automatically received labels and incorporated into the
model for incrementally training in terms of classification. Our extensive
experiments on standard image classification benchmarks (e.g., Caltech-256 and
SUN-397) demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of effectively
mining from large-scale unlabeled images, which boosts image classification
performance and achieves promising results compared to other semi-supervised
learning methods.

requirement paved the road of using space missions for detecting low-frequency
and middle-frequency GWs. The new LISA GW mission proposes to use arm length of
2.5 Gm (1 Gm = 106 km). The TAIJI GW mission proposes to use arm length of 3
Gm. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity, laser frequency noise must be
suppressed to below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise,
acceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have performed the numerical
simulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for original LISA, ASTROD-GW
and eLISA together with a LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 Gm
using the CGC 2.7/CGC2.7.1 ephemeris framework. In this paper, we follow the
same procedure to simulate the time delay interferometry numerically for the
new LISA mission and the TAIJI mission together with LISA-like missions of arm
length 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 Gm. The resulting optical path differences of the
second-generation TDI calculated for new LISA, TAIJI, and LISA-like missions or
arm length 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 Gm are well below their respective limits which the
laser frequency noise is required to be suppressed. However, for of the first
generation X, Y, and Z TDI configurations, the original requirements need to be
relaxed by 3 to 30 fold to be satisfied. For the new LISA and TAIJI, about one
order of magnitude relaxation would be good and recommended; this could be
borne on the laser stability requirement in view of recent progress in laser
stability. Compared with X, Y and Z, the X+Y+Z configuration does have a good
cancellation of path length differences and could serve as a null string
detection check. We compile and compare the resulting differences of various
TDI configurations due to the different arm lengths for various LISA-like

hole based on the three-dimensional new massive gravity by particle absorption.
If a particle moving towards the black hole enters its outer horizon, the black
hole changes because it absorbs conserved quantities of the particle. This
variation is constrained by the equations of motion for the particle. We prove
both the irreducibility of the entropy and stability of the horizon for the
black hole through this process. However, the instability of the horizon is
found in a near-extremal black hole by considering its second-order expansion.
We resolve this instability by applying an adiabatic process for the
absorption. Further, we show that the stability has the physical counterpart to
the energy spectrum of the Virasoro generator via the warped anti-de
Sitter/warped conformal field theory correspondence.

consideration sets, may evolve over time in response to changes in demographic

constructs, and available alternatives and their attributes. However, existing
representations typically overlook the influence of past experiences on present
preferences. This study develops, applies and tests a hidden Markov model with
a discrete choice kernel to model and forecast the evolution of individual
preferences and behaviors over long-range forecasting horizons. The hidden
states denote different preferences i.e. modes considered in the choice set,
and sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The evolutionary path of those
hidden states is hypothesized to be a first-order Markov process. The framework
is applied to study the evolution of travel mode preferences, or modality
styles, over time, in response to a major change in the public transportation
system. We use longitudinal travel diary from Santiago, Chile. The dataset
consists of four one-week pseudo travel diaries collected before and after the
introduction of Transantiago, a complete redesign of the public transportation
system in the city. Our model identifies four modality styles in the
population: drivers, bus users, bus-metro users, and auto-metro users. The
modality styles differ in terms of the travel modes that they consider and
their sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. At the population level,
there are significant shifts in the distribution of individuals across modality
styles before and after the change in the system, but the distribution is
relatively stable in the periods after the change. Finally, a comparison
between the proposed dynamic framework and comparable static frameworks reveals
differences in aggregate forecasts for different policy scenarios.

number of Poisson solves from $\Or(N_{e}^2)$ to $\Or(N_{e})$ when we apply the
exchange operator to occupied orbitals in an iterative method for solving the
Kohn-Sham equations, where $N_{e}$ is the number of electrons in the system to
be studied. We show that the ISDF procedure can be carried out in
$\Or(N_{e}^3)$ operations, with a much smaller pre-constant compared to methods
used in existing approaches. When combined with the recently developed
adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator formalism, which reduces the
number of times the exchange operator needs to be updated, the resulting
ACE-ISDF method significantly reduces the computational cost \REV{associated
with the exchange operator} by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to
existing approaches for a large silicon system with $1000$ atoms. We
demonstrate that the ACE-ISDF method can produce accurate energies and forces
for insulating and metallic systems, and that it is possible to obtain
converged hybrid functional calculation results for a 1000-atom bulk silicon
within 10 minutes on 2000 computational cores. We also show that ACE-ISDF can
scale to 8192 computational cores for a 4096-atom bulk silicon system. We use
the ACE-ISDF method to geometrically optimize a 1000-atom silicon system with a
vacancy defect using the HSE06 functional and computes its electronic

demonstrated that a curvature-dependent surface energy at the nanoscale

accumulated from the external intergalactic medium and a minor merger model of
unequal mass ($M_{SG}$/$M_{FG}$ ~5-10%) clusters with an age difference of a
few hundred million years. We compared our results such as the radial profile
of the SG-to-FG number ratio with observations on the assumption that the SG
stars in the observations are composed of cluster members, and confirmed that
both the ad hoc formation and merger scenarios reproduce the observed radial
trend of the SG-to-FG number ratio which shows less centrally concentrated SG
than FG stars. It is difficult to constrain the formation scenario for the
multiple populations by only using the spatial distribution of the SG stars. SG
stars originating from the merger scenario show a significant velocity
anisotropy and rotational features compared to those from the ad hoc formation
scenario. Thus, observations aimed at kinematic properties like velocity
anisotropy or rotational velocities for SG stars should be obtained to better

in gravitationally lensed quasar spectra. We investigate the effect of
gravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission line profiles and their
underlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR
models with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we
considered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various
sizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables:
$\mu^{BLR}$, the total magnification of the broad emission line; $\mu^{cont}$,
the magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and
wings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the line profile distortions. The
simulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently
observed in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the
differential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.
While the magnification of the emission line $\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on
the BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\mu^{cont}$
sets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile
distortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics. We thus built
(WCI,RBI) diagrams that can serve as diagnostic diagrams to discriminate
between the various BLR models on the basis of quantitative measurements. It
appears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the
size of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that
case, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to
produce distinctive line profile distortions for a limited number of caustic
configurations, which facilitates their discrimination.

empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator, derived using a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior,
is analyzed and compared with the well-known soft-thresholding estimator. We
obtain concentration inequalities for the Stein's unbiased risk estimate and
the loss function of both estimators. The results show that for large $n$, both
the risk estimate and the loss function concentrate on deterministic values
close to the true risk.
  Depending on the underlying $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, either the proposed
empirical Bayes (eBayes) estimator or soft-thresholding may have smaller loss.
We consider a hybrid estimator that attempts to pick the better of the
soft-thresholding estimator and the eBayes estimator by comparing their risk
estimates. It is shown that: i) the loss of the hybrid estimator concentrates
on the minimum of the losses of the two competing estimators, and ii) the risk
of the hybrid estimator is within order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ of the minimum of
the two risks. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical
results. Finally, we use the eBayes and hybrid estimators as denoisers in the
approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for compressed sensing, and show
that their performance is superior to the soft-thresholding denoiser in a wide
range of settings.

important levels of photometric and spectroscopic time-variability. When the
accretor orbits a Supergiant star, it captures a fraction of the supersonic
radiatively-driven wind which forms shocks in its vicinity. The amplitude and
stability of this gravitational beaming of the flow conditions the mass
accretion rate responsible, in fine, for the X-ray luminosity of those
Supergiant X-ray Binaries. The capacity of this low angular momentum inflow to
form a disc-like structure susceptible to be the stage of well-known
instabilities remains at stake. Using state-of-the-art numerical setups, we
characterized the structure of a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flow onto a compact
object, from the shock down to the vicinity of the accretor, typically five
orders of magnitude smaller. The evolution of the mass accretion rate and of
the bow shock which forms around the accretor (transverse structure, opening
angle, stability, temperature profile) with the Mach number of the incoming
flow is described in detail. The robustness of those simulations based on the
High Performance Computing MPI-AMRVAC code is supported by the topology of the
inner sonic surface, in agreement with theoretical expectations. We developed a
synthetic model of mass transfer in Supergiant X-ray Binaries which couples the
launching of the wind accordingly to the stellar parameters, the orbital
evolution of the streamlines in a modified Roche potential and the accretion
process. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by
the mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the alpha-force
multiplier. Provided scales such as the orbital period are known, we can trace
back the observables to evaluate the mass accretion rates, the accretion
mechanism (stream or wind-dominated) and the shearing of the inflow.

under shear flow, either in melt or solution and with different types of bonds.
This formalism is compared with the standard approach used in many previous
studies on polymer dynamics, where an apparent angular velocity $\omega$ is
obtained from relation between the tensor of inertia and angular momentum. A
common mistake is to interpret $\omega$ as the molecular rotation frequency,
which is only valid for rigid-body rotation. The Eckart frame, originally
formulated to analyze the infrared spectra of small molecules, dissects
different kinds of displacements: vibrations without angular momentum, pure
rotation, and vibrational angular momentum (leading to a Coriolis cross-term).
The Eckart frame co-rotates with the molecule with an angular frequency
$\Omega$ obtained from the Eckart condition for minimal coupling between
rotation and vibration. The standard and Eckart approaches are compared with a
straight description of the star's dynamics taken from the time autocorrelation
of the monomers positions moving around the molecule's center of mass. This is
an underdamped oscillatory signal, which can be described by a rotation
frequency $\omega_R$ and a decorrelation rate $\Gamma$. We consistently find
that $\Omega$ coincides with $\omega_R$, which determines the characteristic
tank-treading rotation of the star. By contrast, the apparent angular velocity
$\omega < \Omega$ does not discern between pure rotation and molecular
vibrations. We believe that the Eckart frame will be useful to unveil the
dynamics of semiflexible molecules where rotation and deformations are
entangled, including tumbling, tank-treading motions and breathing modes.

compound the common single person re-identification problems by introducing
changes in the relative position of persons within the group and severe

re-identification that grounds on transferring knowledge from single person
re-identification to group re-identification by exploiting sparse dictionary
learning. First, a dictionary of sparse atoms is learned using patches
extracted from single person images. Then, the learned dictionary is exploited
to obtain a sparsity-driven residual group representation, which is finally
matched to perform the re-identification. Extensive experiments on the i-LIDS

sense (explained in the text). This different (i.e., not based on the initial
value formulation but twistorial) technical background might partially explain
why the existence of vacuum solutions of this kind have not been realized so
far in spite of the fact that, apparently, their superabundance compared to the
well-known globally hyperbolic vacuum solutions is overwhelming.

three-dimensional (3D) materials with TSS, electronic bulk states often mask
the transport properties of HSDF. Recently, the high-field Hall resistance and
low-field magnetoresistance indicate that the TSS may coexist with a layered
two-dimensional electronic system (2DES). Here, we demonstrate quantum
oscillations of the Hall resistance at temperatures up to 50 K in bulk
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with a high electron density $n$ of about $2\!\cdot\!10^{19}$

behaviour of other agents, which may be non-stationary: if the other agents
adapt their strategy as well, the learning target moves. Disparate streams of
research have approached non-stationarity from several angles, which make a
variety of implicit assumptions that make it hard to keep an overview of the
state of the art and to validate the innovation and significance of new works.
This survey presents a coherent overview of work that addresses
opponent-induced non-stationarity with tools from game theory, reinforcement
learning and multi-armed bandits. Further, we reflect on the principle
approaches how algorithms model and cope with this non-stationarity, arriving
at a new framework and five categories (in increasing order of sophistication):
ignore, forget, respond to target models, learn models, and theory of mind. A
wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms is classified into a taxonomy, using
these categories and key characteristics of the environment (e.g.,
observability) and adaptation behaviour of the opponents (e.g., smooth,
abrupt). To clarify even further we present illustrative variations of one
domain, contrasting the strengths and limitations of each category. Finally, we
discuss in which environments the different approaches yield most merit, and
point to promising avenues of future research.

consequence of micro-segregated domains would be the existence of long range
domain-domain oscillatory correlations in the various atom- atom pair
correlation functions, and subsequent pre-peaks in the corresponding atom atom
structure factors, in the q-vector range corresponding to nano-sized domains.
However, no such pre-peak have ever been observed in the large corpus of
radiation scattering data published so far. Here, through large scale
simulations of aqueous-1propanol mixtures, I report that the domain pre-peak
contributions in the atom-atom structure factors exactly cancel each other in
the total scattering intensity, thus suppressing the pre-peak in agreement with
the experimental findings. This cancellation is explained by drawing an analogy
between the charge order found in ionic fluids and the segregated domain order.
This finding opens new interpretation of the well known scattering pre-peak
observed in micro-emulsions. In particular, it implies that scattering
experiment cannot detect homogeneous domain segregation, hence cannot lead to a
proper microscopic description of atom-atom correlations in domain ordered

difference method for efficiently computing sensitivities of biochemical
reactions. We employ propensity bounds of reactions to couple the simulation of

reserved by applying the rejection-based mechanism. For each simulation step,
the nominal and perturbed processes under our coupling strategy are
synchronized and often jump together, increasing their positive correlation and
hence reducing the variance of the estimator. The distinctive feature of our
approach in comparison with existing coupling approaches is that it only needs
to maintain a single data structure storing propensity bounds of reactions
during the simulation of the nominal and perturbed processes. Our approach
allows to computing sensitivities of many reaction rates simultaneously.
Moreover, the data structure does not require to be updated frequently, hence
improving the computational cost. This feature is especially useful when
applied to large reaction networks. We benchmark our method on biological
reaction models to prove its applicability and efficiency.

phase modulation on Airy pulse dynamics in pure linear regime. As a specific
example, we study the influence of cubic phase modulation (CPM) as a self
healing effect when the propagation dynamics of a finite energy Airy pulse is
perturbed under the third order dispersion (TOD). As a consequence of TOD, the
pulse flips in time domain and propagates with a reverse acceleration. This
unusual propagation characteristic can be restricted through CPM which
counterbalance the TOD induced flipping phenomenon. With proper analytical and
numerical treatment we demonstrate, how CPM not only resists the temporal
flipping but helps in preserving the pulse shape under perturbation. We put
special emphasis on the study of the Airy pulse at flipping point where it
loses its characteristic shape and converts itself to a pure Gaussian pulse. We
derive the Gaussian width analytically and demonstrate that a suitable
quadratic phase modulation can focus the Airy pulse to a point and leads to a
chirp-free Gaussian pulse. The present study is useful in understanding the

dispersion theory is used to relate the low-energy vector-isovector form
factors of the nucleon to the pion vector form factor. The additionally
required input, i.e. the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes are determined from
relativistic next-to-leading-order (NLO) baryon chiral perturbation theory
including the nucleons and optionally the Delta baryons. Two methods how to
include pion rescattering are compared: (a) solving the Muskhelishvili-Omnes
(MO) equation and (b) using an N/D approach. It turns out that the results
differ strongly from each other. Furthermore the results are compared to a
fully dispersive calculation of the (subthreshold) pion-nucleon amplitudes
based on Roy-Steiner (RS) equations. In full agreement with the findings from
the hyperon sector it turns out that the inclusion of Delta baryons is not an
option but a necessity to obtain reasonable results. The magnetic isovector
form factor depends strongly on a low-energy constant of the NLO Lagrangian. If
it is adjusted such that the corresponding magnetic radius is reproduced, then
the results for the corresponding pion-nucleon scattering amplitude (based on
the MO equation) agree very well with the RS results. Also in the electric
sector the Delta degrees of freedom are needed to obtain the correct order of
magnitude for the isovector charge and the corresponding electric radius. Yet
quantitative agreement is not achieved. If the subtraction constant that
appears in the solution of the MO equation is not taken from nucleon+Delta
chiral perturbation theory but adjusted such that the electric radius is
reproduced, then one obtains also in this sector a pion-nucleon scattering
amplitude that agrees well with the RS results.

On the one hand, there is the widely used, but often criticized, local
approach, where machine sub-systems locally couple to thermal baths. On the
other hand, in the more established global approach, thermal baths couple to
global degrees of freedom of the machine. There has been debate as to which of
these two conceptually different approaches should be used in situations out of
thermal equilibrium. Here we compare the local and global approaches against an
exact solution for a particular class of thermal machines. We consider
thermodynamically relevant observables, such as heat currents, as well as the
quantum state of the machine. Our results show that the use of a local master
equation is generally well justified. In particular, for weak inter-system
coupling, the local approach agrees with the exact solution, whereas the global
approach fails for non-equilibrium situations. For intermediate coupling, the
local and the global approach both agree with the exact solution and for strong
coupling, the global approach is preferable. These results are backed by
detailed derivations of the regimes of validity for the respective approaches.

Physical processes in the early universe have left their fingerprints in these

central task of theoretical nuclear physics. The nuclear equation of state is
an essential quantity in nuclear astrophysics and governs the properties of
neutron stars and core-collapse supernov\ae. The framework of chiral effective
field theory provides the basis for the description of nuclear interactions in
terms of a systematic low-energy expansion. In this thesis, we apply chiral
two- and three-nucleon interactions in perturbative many-body calculations of
the thermodynamic equation of state of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter. The
conceptual issues that arise concerning the consistent generalization of the
standard zero-temperature form of many-body perturbation theory to finite
temperatures are investigated in detail. The structure of many-body
perturbation theory at higher orders is examined, in particular concerning the
role of the so-called anomalous contributions. The first-order nuclear
liquid-gas phase transition is analyzed with respect to its dependence on
temperature and the neutron-to-proton ratio. Furthermore, the convergence
behavior of the expansion of the equation of state in terms of the isospin
asymmetry is examined. It is shown that the expansion coefficients beyond the
quadratic order diverge in the zero-temperature limit, implying a nonanalytic
form of the isospin-asymmetry dependence at low temperatures. This behavior is
associated with logarithmic terms in the isospin-asymmetry dependence at zero
temperature.

component, i.e. ignoring the coherent couplings, which are later added `by
hand'. Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to
be thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a
consistent \textit{global} master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis
of the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node `quantum

are obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our
model, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular
approximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes),
we observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a)
predicts the correct steady state, (b) yields the exact asymptotic heat
currents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In
contrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node
coupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the
global and local approach may be viewed as \textit{complementary} tools, best
suited to different parameter regimes.

temperature. The DM temperature does not have to follow the standard model one,
when the elastic scattering is not sufficient to maintain the kinetic
equilibrium. We study the temperature evolution of the semi-annihilating DM,
where a pair of the DM particles annihilate into one DM particle and another
particle coupled to the standard model sector. We find that the kinetic
equilibrium is maintained solely via semi-annihilation until the last stage of
the freeze-out. After the freeze-out, semi-annihilation converts the mass
deficit to the kinetic energy of DM, which leads to non-trivial evolution of
the DM temperature. We argue that the DM temperature redshifts like radiation
as long as the DM self-interaction is efficient. We dub this novel temperature
evolution as self-heating. Notably, the structure formation is suppressed at
subgalactic scales like keV-scale warm DM but with GeV-scale self-heating DM if
the self-heating lasts roughly until the matter-radiation equality. The long
duration of the self-heating requires the large self-scattering cross section,
which in turn flattens the DM density profile in inner halos. Consequently,
self-heating DM can be a unified solution to apparent failures of cold DM to
reproduce the observed subgalactic scale structure of the Universe.

SPARCOM achieves spatial resolution comparable to PALM/STORM, while capturing
the data hundreds of times faster. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical
formulation of SPARCOM, which in turn leads to an efficient numerical
implementation, suitable for large-scale problems. We further extend our method
to a general framework for sparsity based super-resolution imaging, in which
sparsity can be assumed in other domains such as wavelet or discrete-cosine,

record, yet we do not understand the processes generating them. Here we extend
theory from non-equilibrium statistical physics to describe the previously
unaccounted for fat-tailed form of fluctuations in marine invertebrate richness
through the Phanerozoic. Using this theory, known as superstatistics, we show
that the simple fact of heterogeneous origination and extinction rates between
clades and conserved rates within clades is sufficient to account for this
fat-tailed form. We identify orders and the families they subsume as the
taxonomic level at which clades experience inter-clade heterogeneity and within
clade homogeneity of rates. Following superstatistics we would posit that
orders and families are subsystems in local statistical equilibrium while the
entire system is not in equilibrium. The separation of timescales between
background origination and extinction within clades compared to the origin of
major ecological and evolutionary innovations leading to new clades allows
within-clade dynamics to reach equilibrium, while between-clade diversification
is non-equilibrial. This between clade non-equilibrium accounts for the
fat-tailed nature of the system as a whole. The distribution of shifts in
diversification dynamics across orders and families is consistent with niche
conservatism and pulsed exploration of adaptive landscapes by higher taxa.
Compared to other approaches that have used simple birth-death processes,
simple equilibrial dynamics, or non-linear theories from complexity science,
superstatistics is superior in its ability to account for both small and
extreme fluctuations in the richness of fossil taxa. Its success opens up new
research directions to better understand the evolutionary processes leading to
stasis in an adaptive landscape interrupted by innovations that lead to novel
forms.

tunable parameter r that determines the strength of the excluded-volume
interactions. In the first model chains are obtained by concatenating hard
spherocylinders of height b and diameter rb (we call them thick self- avoiding
chains). The other two models are generalizations of the tangent hard-sphere
and of the Kremer-Grest models. We show that, for a specific value r*, all
models show an optimal behavior: asymptotic long-chain behavior is observed for
relatively short chains. For r < r*, instead, the behavior can be parametrized
by using the two-parameter model that also describes the thermal crossover
close to the {\theta} point. The bonds of thick self-avoiding chains cannot
cross each other and, therefore, the model is suited for the investigation of
topological properties and for dynamical studies. Such a model also provides a
coarse-grained description of double-stranded DNA, so that we can use our
results to discuss under which conditions DNA can be considered as a model
good-solvent polymer.

obtained by analyzing 1291.51$\,$days of Borexino Phase-II data, collected
between December 2011 and May 2016 after an extensive scintillator purification
campaign. We find:
rate($pp$)$\,$=$\,$$134$$\,$$\pm$$\,$$10$$\,$($stat$)$\,$$^{\rm +6}_{\rm

These numbers are in agreement with and improve the precision of our previous
measurements. In particular, the interaction rate of $^7$Be $\nu$'s is measured
with an unprecedented precision of 2.7%, showing that discriminating between
the high and low metallicity solar models is now largely dominated by
theoretical uncertainties. The absence of $pep$ neutrinos is rejected for the
first time at more than 5$\,$$\sigma$. An upper limit of $8.1$$\,$cpd/100$\,$t
(95%$\,$C.L.) on the CNO neutrino rate is obtained by setting an additional
constraint on the ratio between the $pp$ and $pep$ neutrino rates in the fit.
This limit has the same significance as that obtained by the Borexino Phase-I
(currently providing the tightest bound on this component), but is obtained by
applying a less stringent constraint on the $pep$ $\nu$ flux.

has to reside in a region of spacetime where the Killing vector associated with
stationarity is spacelike. This raises the question of what happens to the
universal horizon in the extremal limit, where no such region exists anymore.
We use a decoupling limit approximation to study this problem. Our results
suggest that at the extremal limit, the extremal Killing horizon appears to
play the role of a degenerate universal horizon, despite being a null and not a

interaction networks, to name a few. Communities, cohesive groups of nodes,
often form in these applications, and identifying them gives insight into the
overall organization of the network. One common quality function used to
identify community structure is modularity. In Hu et al. [SIAM J. App. Math.,
73(6), 2013], it was shown that modularity optimization is equivalent to
minimizing a particular nonconvex total variation (TV) based functional over a
discrete domain. They solve this problem, assuming the number of communities is
known, using a Merriman, Bence, Osher (MBO) scheme.
  We show that modularity optimization is equivalent to minimizing a convex
TV-based functional over a discrete domain, again, assuming the number of
communities is known. Furthermore, we show that modularity has no convex
relaxation satisfying certain natural conditions. We therefore, find a
manageable non-convex approximation using a Ginzburg Landau functional, which
provably converges to the correct energy in the limit of a certain parameter.
We then derive an MBO algorithm with fewer hand-tuned parameters than in Hu et
al. and which is 7 times faster at solving the associated diffusion equation
due to the fact that the underlying discretization is unconditionally stable.
Our numerical tests include a hyperspectral video whose associated graph has
2.9x10^7 edges, which is roughly 37 times larger than was handled in the paper

with the high-resolution Solar Dynamics Observatory / Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager . To extract some statistical and physical properties of these elements
(e.g., filling factors, magnetic flux, size, lifetimes), the Yet Another
Feature Tracking Algorithm (YAFTA), a region-based method, is employed. An area
with 400$^{\prime\prime}\times$400$^{\prime\prime}$ was selected to investigate
the magnetic characteristics during the year 2011. The correlation coefficient
between filling factors of negative and positive polarities is 0.51. A broken
power law fit was applied to the frequency distribution of size and flux.
Exponents of the power-law distributions for sizes smaller and greater than 16
arcsec$^2$ were found to be -2.24 and -4.04, respectively. The exponents of
power$-$law distributions for fluxes smaller and greater than
2.63$\times$10$^{19}$ Mx were found to be -2.11 and -2.51, respectively. The
relationship between the size ($S$) and flux ($F$) of elements can be expressed
by a power-law behavior in the form of $S\propto F~^{0.69}$. The lifetime and
its relationship with the flux and size of quiet-Sun (QS) elements are studied
during three days. The code detected patches with lifetimes of about 15 hours,
which we call long-duration events. It is found that more than 95\% of the
magnetic elements have lifetimes of less than 100 minutes. About 0.05\% of the
elements were found with lifetimes of more than 6 hours. The relationships
between the size (S), lifetime (T), and the flux (F) for patches in the QS,
indicate the power$-$law relationships $S\propto T~^{0.25}$ and $F\propto
T~^{0.38}$, respectively. Executing a detrended fluctuation analysis of the
time series of new emerged magnetic elements, we find a Hurst exponent of 0.82,
which implies long-range temporal correlation in the system.

multicomponent alloy powder, in a layer-by-layer fashion with multipass laser
melting, solidification, and solid-state phase transformations, in a shorter
manufacturing time, with minimal surface finishing, and at a reasonable cost.
However, there is an increasing need for post-processing of the manufactured
parts via, for example, stress relieving heat treatment and hot isostatic
pressing to achieve homogeneous microstructure and properties at all times.
Solidification in an AM process controls the size, shape, and distribution of
the grains, the growth morphology, the elemental segregation and precipitation,
the subsequent solid-state phase changes, and ultimately the material
properties. The critical issues in this process are linked with multiphysics
(such as fluid flow and diffusion of heat and mass) and multiscale (lengths,
times and temperature ranges) challenges that arise due to localized rapid
heating and cooling during AM processing. The alloy
chemistry-process-microstructure-property-performance correlation in this

connection. In the case at hand, the connection is constant and localized along
a semi-infinite defect line (zipper). In the appropriate limit of a trivial
connection, it allows one to count spanning forests whose components contain
prescribed sites, which are of direct relevance for height correlations in the
sandpile model. Using this technique, we first rederive known 1- and 2-site
lattice correlators on the plane and upper half-plane, more efficiently than
what has been done so far. We also compute explicitly the (new) next-to-leading
order in the distances ($r^{-4}$ for 1-site on the upper half-plane, $r^{-6}$
for 2-site on the plane). We extend these results by computing new correlators
involving one arbitrary height and a few heights 1 on the plane and upper

results from the conformal point of view, and confirm the full consistency with
the specific features currently conjectured to be present in the associated

scheme assures the global minima of the geometric surface functional. The
reconstructed surface is implicitly represented by the binary segmentation of
vertices of a 3D uniform grid and a triangulated surface can be obtained by
extracting an appropriate isosurface. Unlike the discrete graph-cut solution,
the continuous global optimization entails advantages like memory requirements,
reduction of metrication errors for geometric quantities, allowing globally
optimal surface reconstruction at higher grid resolutions. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed method on several oriented point clouds captured by

to El Ni\~no Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Specifically, we present the
existence, stability, and basins of attraction of the solutions arising in the
model system in the space of these parameters: self delay, delay and
inter-region coupling strengths. The emergence or suppression of oscillations
in our models is a dynamical feature of utmost relevance, as it signals the
presence or absence of ENSO-like oscillations. In contrast to the well-known
low order model of ENSO, where the influence of the neighbouring regions on the
region of interest is modelled as external noise, we consider neighbouring
regions as a coupled deterministic dynamical systems. Different parameters
yield a rich variety of dynamical patterns in our model, ranging from steady
states and homogeneous oscillations to irregular oscillations and coexistence
of oscillatory attractors, without explicit inclusion of noise. Interestingly,
if we take the self-delay coupling strengths of the two sub-regions to be such
that the temperature of one region goes to a fixed point regime when uncoupled,
while the other system is in the oscillatory regime, then on coupling both
systems show oscillations. We explicitly obtain the basins of attraction for
the different steady states and oscillatory states in the model. Our results
might be helpful for forecasting of El Ni\~no (or La Ni\~na) progress, as it
indicates the combination of initial SST anomalies in the sub-regions that can

Starobinsky model are studied with a perturbative approach. The differential
equations for the components of the metric and the Ricci scalar are obtained
and solved by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The presence
of higher order terms in this gravity model leads to the formation of a
boundary layer near the surface of the star allowing the accommodation of the
extra boundary conditions on the Ricci scalar. Accordingly, the metric can be
different from the Schwarzschild solution near the star depending on the value
of the Ricci scalar at the surface of the star while matching the Schwarzschild
metric far from the star.

transmission for many businesses and individuals, often under the form of
plain-text tables. As their number grows, it becomes necessary to use an
algorithm to extract text and numbers instead of a human. Usual methods are
focused on regular expressions or on a strict structure in the data, but are
not efficient when we have many variations, fuzzy structure or implicit labels.
In this paper we introduce SC2T, a totally self-supervised model for
constructing vector representations of tokens in semi-structured messages by
using characters and context levels that address these issues. It can then be
used for an unsupervised labeling of tokens, or be the basis for a
semi-supervised information extraction system.

guided waves to propagating wavefronts. This is a first step towards a
comprehensive, multiscale modeling platform for metasurface antennas-large
arrays of metamaterial elements embedded in a waveguide structure that radiates
into free-space--in which the detailed electromagnetic responses of
metamaterial elements are replaced by polarizable dipoles. We present two
methods to extract the effective polarizability of a metamaterial element
embedded in a one- or two-dimensional waveguide. The first method invokes
surface equivalence principles, averaging over the effective surface currents
and charges within an element to obtain the effective dipole moments; the
second method is based on computing the coefficients of the scattered waves
within the waveguide, from which the effective polarizability can be inferred.
We demonstrate these methods on several variants of waveguide-fed metasurface
elements, finding excellent agreement between the two, as well as with
analytical expressions derived for irises with simpler geometries. Extending
the polarizability extraction technique to higher order multipoles, we confirm
the validity of the dipole approximation for common metamaterial elements. With
the effective polarizabilities of the metamaterial elements accurately
determined, the radiated fields generated by a metasurface antenna (inside and
outside the antenna) can be found self-consistently by including the
interactions between polarizable dipoles. The dipole description provides an
alternative language and computational framework for engineering metasurface
antennas, holograms, lenses, beam-forming arrays, and other electrically large,
waveguide-fed metasurface structures.

This model has been used for simulation of water vapor interaction with
individual pore by molecular dynamics in combination with the diffusion
equation method. Special investigations have been done to find dependencies
between thermostats implementations and conservation of thermodynamic and

is the surface reconstructed from given points scattered over the surface and
associated with surface normal vectors. The function is defined as a linear
combination of compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). The method
preserves the simplicity and efficiency of implicit surface interpolation with
CSRBFs and the reconstructed implicit surface owns the attributes, which are
previously only associated with globally supported or globally regularized
radial basis functions, such as exhibiting less extra zero-level sets, suitable
for inside and outside tests. First, in the coarse scale approximation, we
choose basis function centers on a grid that covers the enlarged bounding box
of the given point set and compute their signed distances to the underlying
surface using local quadratic approximations of the nearest surface points.
Then a fitting to the residual errors on the surface points and additional
off-surface points is performed with fine scale basis functions. The final
function is the sum of the two intermediate functions and is a good
approximation of the signed distance field to the surface in the bounding box.
Examples of surface reconstruction and set operations between shapes are
provided.

popular uprisings demonstrate the need for political reforms but also major
economic reforms. The Arab spring highlights the fragility of its main economic
pillars including the tourism and the foreign direct investment. In such
turbulent times, the paper examines the economic impact of migrant'
remittances, expected to have a countercyclical behavior. Our results reveal
that prior to the Arab Spring, the impacts of remittances on growth and
consumption seem negative and positive respectively, while they varyingly
influence local investment. These three relationships held in the short-run. By
considering the period surrounding the 2011 uprisings, the investment effect of
remittances becomes negative and weak in the short-and medium-run, whereas
positive and strong remittances' impacts on growth and consumption are found in
the long term.
