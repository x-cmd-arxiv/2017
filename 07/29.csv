joint exploitation of the across views information would allow for improved

which finally makes advanced deep learning methods applicable to this problem.
The seven-static-camera set-up captures realistic and challenging scenarios of
walking people.
  Notably, its camera calibration with jointly high-precision projection widens
the range of algorithms which may make use of this dataset. In aim to help
accelerate the research on automatic camera calibration, such annotations also
accompany this dataset.
  Furthermore, the rich-in-appearance visual context of the pedestrian class
makes this dataset attractive for monocular pedestrian detection as well,
since: the HD cameras are placed relatively close to the people, and the size
of the dataset further increases seven-fold.
  In summary, we overview existing multi-camera datasets and detection methods,
enumerate details of our dataset, and we benchmark multi-camera state of the

with an end-to-end perspective of the network. Self-organization as applied to
cellular networks is usually referred to Self-organizing Networks (SONs), and
it is a key driver for improving Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
(OAM) activities. SON aims at reducing the cost of installation and management
of 4G and future 5G networks, by simplifying operational tasks through the
capability to configure, optimize and heal itself. To satisfy 5G network
management requirements, this autonomous management vision has to be extended
to the end to end network. In literature and also in some instances of products
available in the market, Machine Learning (ML) has been identified as the key
tool to implement autonomous adaptability and take advantage of experience when
making decisions. In this paper, we survey how network management can
significantly benefit from ML solutions. We review and provide the basic
concepts and taxonomy for SON, network management and ML. We analyse the
available state of the art in the literature, standardization, and in the
market. We pay special attention to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
evolution in the area of network management and to the data that can be
extracted from 3GPP networks, in order to gain knowledge and experience in how
the network is working, and improve network performance in a proactive way.
Finally, we go through the main challenges associated with this line of
research, in both 4G and in what 5G is getting designed, while identifying new
directions for research.

quantum stochastic systems interacting with external bosonic fields. We
consider a cost functional in the form of the exponential moment of the

interval. An integro-differential equation is obtained for the time evolution
of this quadratic-exponential functional, which is compared with the original
quantum risk-sensitive performance criterion employed previously for
measurement-based quantum control and filtering problems. Using multi-point
Gaussian quantum states for the past history of the system variables and their
first four moments, we discuss a quartic approximation of the cost functional
and its infinite-horizon asymptotic behaviour. The computation of the
asymptotic growth rate of this approximation is reduced to solving two
algebraic Lyapunov equations. We also outline further approximations of the
cost functional, based on higher-order cumulants and their growth rates,
together with large deviations estimates. For comparison, an auxiliary
classical Gaussian Markov diffusion process is considered in a complex
Euclidean space which reproduces the quantum system variables at the level of
covariances but has different higher-order moments relevant to the
risk-sensitive criteria. The results of the paper are also demonstrated by a
numerical example and may find applications to coherent quantum risk-sensitive
control problems, where the plant and controller form a fully quantum
closed-loop system, and other settings with nonquadratic cost functionals.

that of Ba$_2$YIrO$_6$, which in spite of having a perfectly cubic structure

of weak magnetic moments. Moreover, we clearly show from Muon Spin Relaxation

This observation becomes counterintuitive, as the estimated value of SOC

magnetic response. Therefore we argue that the atomic $j-j$ coupling
description is not sufficient to explain the ground state of such systems,
where despite having strong SOC, presence of hopping triggers delocalisation of
holes, resulting in spontaneous generation of magnetic moments. Our theoretical
calculations further indicate that these moments favour formation of

quantum information processing tasks. We present results which show how one can
effectively reduce the error rate associated with a noisy quantum channel, by
counteracting its detrimental effects with another form of noise. In
particular, we consider the effect of adding on top of a purely Markovian
(Lindblad) dynamics, a more general form of dissipation, which we refer to as
generalized-Markovian noise. This noise has an associated memory kernel and the
resulting dynamics is described by an integro-differential equation. The
overall dynamics are characterized by decay rates which depend not only on the
original dissipative time-scales, but also on the new integral kernel. We find
that one can engineer this kernel such that the overall rate of decay is
lowered by the addition of this noise term. We illustrate this technique for
the case where the bare noise is described by a dephasing Pauli channel. We
analytically solve this model, and show that one can effectively double (or
even triple) the length of the channel, whilst achieving the same fidelity,
entanglement, and error threshold. We numerically verify this scheme can also
be used to protect against thermal Markovian noise (at non-zero temperature),
which models spontaneous emission and excitation processes. A physical
interpretation of this scheme is discussed, whereby the added
generalized-Markovian noise causes the system to become periodically decoupled
from the background Markovian noise.

struggle at different points in the curriculum---a common challenge for math
teachers. Cognitive Tutor Algebra I (CTA1), educational computer program,
addresses such student heterogeneity via what they term ""mastery learning,""
where students progress from one section of the curriculum to the next by
demonstrating appropriate ""mastery"" at each stage. However, when students are
unable to master a section's skills even after trying many problems, they are
automatically promoted to the next section anyway. Does promotion without
mastery impair the program's effectiveness?
  At least in certain domains, CTA1 was recently shown to improve student
learning on average in a randomized effectiveness study. This paper uses
student log data from that study in a continuous principal stratification model
to estimate the relationship between students' potential mastery and the CTA1
treatment effect. In contrast to extant principal stratification applications,
a student's propensity to master worked sections here is never directly
observed. Consequently we embed an item-response model, which measures
students' potential mastery, within the larger principal stratification model.
We find that the tutor may, in fact, be more effective for students who are
more frequently promoted (despite unsuccessfully completing sections of the
material). However, since these students are distinctive in their educational
strength (as well as in other respects), it remains unclear whether this
enhanced effectiveness can be directly attributed to aspects of the mastery
learning program.

such as the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observation of dwarf galaxies and the Planck
observation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Moreover, the DM
annihilation cross section required by the CR $e^\pm$ excess is also too large
to generate the correct DM relic density with thermal production. In this work
we use the Breit-Wigner mechanism with a velocity dependent DM annihilation
cross section to reconcile these tensions. If DM particles accounting for the
CR $e^\pm$ excess with $v\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ are very close to a
resonance in the physical pole case, their annihilation cross section in the
Galaxy reaches a maximal value. On the other hand, the annihilation cross
section would be suppressed for DM particles with smaller relative velocities

Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),
including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine
learning algorithm known as ""The Cannon""; and almost twice as many data cubes
from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous
release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of
the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the
important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both
targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS
website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to

  Bipolar and Probabilistic Approaches",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In dialogical argumentation it is often assumed that the involved parties
always correctly identify the intended statements posited by each other,
realize all of the associated relations, conform to the three acceptability
states (accepted, rejected, undecided), adjust their views when new and correct
information comes in, and that a framework handling only attack relations is
sufficient to represent their opinions. Although it is natural to make these
assumptions as a starting point for further research, removing them or even
acknowledging that such removal should happen is more challenging for some of
these concepts than for others. Probabilistic argumentation is one of the
approaches that can be harnessed for more accurate user modelling. The
epistemic approach allows us to represent how much a given argument is believed
by a given person, offering us the possibility to express more than just three
agreement states. It is equipped with a wide range of postulates, including
those that do not make any restrictions concerning how initial arguments should
be viewed, thus potentially being more adequate for handling beliefs of the
people that have not fully disclosed their opinions in comparison to Dung's
semantics. The constellation approach can be used to represent the views of
different people concerning the structure of the framework we are dealing with,
including cases in which not all relations are acknowledged or when they are
seen differently than intended. Finally, bipolar argumentation frameworks can
be used to express both positive and negative relations between arguments. In
this paper we describe the results of an experiment in which participants
judged dialogues in terms of agreement and structure. We compare our findings
with the aforementioned assumptions as well as with the constellation and
epistemic approaches to probabilistic argumentation and bipolar argumentation.

proper subgroup of $G_2$) such that $M$ admits an involution $\iota$ preserving
the $G_2$-structure. Then $M/{\langle \iota \rangle}$ is a $G_2$-orbifold, with
singular set $L$ an associative submanifold of $M$, where the singularities are
locally of the form $\mathbb R^3 \times (\mathbb R^4 / \{\pm 1\})$. We resolve
this orbifold by gluing in a family of Eguchi-Hanson spaces, parametrized by a
nonvanishing closed and coclosed $1$-form $\lambda$ on $L$. Much of the
analytic difficulty lies in constructing appropriate closed $G_2$-structures
with sufficiently small torsion to be able to apply the general existence
theorem of the first author. In particular, the construction involves solving a
family of elliptic equations on the noncompact Eguchi-Hanson space,
parametrized by the singular set $L$. We also present two generalizations of
the main theorem, and we discuss several methods of producing examples from
this construction.

be understood by introducing the concept of confined bright and dark
Fuchs-Kliewer modes, whose density of states is probed by EELS. Such a concise
formalism is the vibrational counterpart of the broadly used formalism for

Second Order sentence alone. This is interesting because if true it would
justify the restriction heuristic pro- posed in Garey and Johnson in his

of underdetermined linear systems, which is often encountered in uncertainty
quantification analysis of expensive and high-dimensional physical models. We
perform numerical investigations employing several compressive sensing solvers
that target the unconstrained LASSO formulation, with a focus on linear systems
that arise in the construction of polynomial chaos expansions. With core
solvers of l1_ls, SpaRSA, CGIST, FPC_AS, and ADMM, we develop techniques to
mitigate overfitting through an automated selection of regularization constant
based on cross-validation, and a heuristic strategy to guide the stop-sampling
decision. Practical recommendations on parameter settings for these techniques
are provided and discussed. The overall method is applied to a series of
numerical examples of increasing complexity, including large eddy simulations
of supersonic turbulent jet-in-crossflow involving a 24-dimensional input.
Through empirical phase-transition diagrams and convergence plots, we
illustrate sparse recovery performance under structures induced by polynomial
chaos, accuracy and computational tradeoffs between polynomial bases of
different degrees, and practicability of conducting compressive sensing for a
realistic, high-dimensional physical application. Across test cases studied in
this paper, we find ADMM to have demonstrated empirical advantages through
consistent lower errors and faster computational times.

loops on the hexagonal lattice, which is believed to be in the same
universality class as the spin $O(n)$ model. It has been predicted by Nienhuis
that for $0\le n\le 2$ the loop $O(n)$ model exhibits a phase transition at a
critical parameter $x_c(n)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-n}}}$. For $0<n\le 2$, the
transition line has been further conjectured to separate a regime with short
loops when $x<x_c(n)$ from a regime with macroscopic loops when $x\ge x_c(n)$.
  In this paper, we prove that for $n\in [1,2]$ and $x=x_c(n)$ the loop $O(n)$
model exhibits macroscopic loops. This is the first instance in which a loop
$O(n)$ model with $n\neq 1$ is shown to exhibit such behaviour. A main tool in
the proof is a new positive association (FKG) property shown to hold when $n
\ge 1$ and $0<x\le\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. This property implies, using techniques
recently developed for the random-cluster model, the following dichotomy:
either long loops are exponentially unlikely or the origin is surrounded by
loops at any scale (box-crossing property). We develop a 'domain gluing'
technique which allows us to employ Smirnov's parafermionic observable to rule
out the first alternative when $x=x_c(n)$ and $n\in[1,2]$.

escape rates in a periodically kicked Hamiltonian. We study a model of
particles in storage rings that is described by a chaotic symplectic map.
Ignoring the resonances, the dynamics typically has a finite region in phase
space where it is stable. Inherent noise in the system leads to particle loss
from this stable region. The competition of this noise with radiation damping,
which increases stability, determines the escape rate. Determining this
`aperture' and finding escape rates is therefore an important physical problem.
We compare the results of two different perturbation theories and a variational
method to estimate this stable region. Including noise, we derive analytical
estimates for the steady-state populations (and the resulting beam emittance),
for the escape rate in the small damping regime, and compare them with
numerical simulations.

macroscopic node problem. A second-order macroscopic traffic model, in contrast
to a first-order model, allows for variation of driving behavior across
subpopulations of vehicles in the flow. The second-order models are thus more
descriptive (e.g., they have been used to model variable mixtures of
behaviorally-different traffic, like car/truck traffic, autonomous/human-driven
traffic, etc.), but are much more complex. The second-order node problem is a
particularly complex problem, as it requires the resolution of discontinuities
in traffic density and mixture characteristics, and solving of throughflows for
arbitrary numbers of input and output roads to a node (in other words, this is
an arbitrary-dimensional Riemann problem with two conserved quantities). In
this paper, we extend the well-known ""Generic Class of Node Model"" constraints
to the second order and present a simple solution algorithm to the second-order
node problem. Our solution makes use of a recently-introduced dynamic system
characterization of the first-order node model problem, which gives insight and
intuition as to the continuous-time dynamics implicit in node models. We
further argue that the common ""supply and demand"" construction of node models
that decouples them from link models is not suitable to the second-order node
problem. Our second-order node model and solution method have immediate
applications in allowing modeling of behaviorally-complex traffic flows of
contemporary interest (like partially-autonomous-vehicle flows) in arbitrary
road networks.

the spectrum of scaling dimensions is the same as in the SYK model with real

the two indices, the scaling dimensions are the same as in the additional
sector found in the complex tensor and SYK models; the lowest $h=0$ eigenvalue
corresponds to the conserved $O(N)$ charges. A class of singlet operators may
be constructed from contracted combinations of $m$ symmetric traceless or
antisymmetric two-particle operators. Their two-point functions receive
contributions from $m$ melonic ladders. Such multiple ladders are a new
phenomenon in the tensor model, which does not seem to be present in the SYK

corrections and have quantized large $N$ scaling dimensions $k/2$. We construct
pictorial representations of various singlet operators with low $k$. For larger
$k$ we use available techniques to count the operators and show that their
number grows as $2^k k!$. As a consequence, the theory has a Hagedorn phase
transition at the temperature which approaches zero in the large $N$ limit. We
also study the large $N$ spectrum of low-lying operators in the Gurau-Witten

a premise not necessarily fulfilled for large, uncertain networks. Accordingly,
centrality measures may fail to faithfully extract the importance of nodes in
the presence of uncertainty. To mitigate these problems, we suggest a
statistical approach based on graphon theory: we introduce formal definitions

classical graph centrality measures. A key advantage of this approach is that
centrality measures defined at the modeling level of graphons are inherently
robust to stochastic variations of specific graph realizations. Using the
theory of linear integral operators, we define degree, eigenvector, Katz and
PageRank centrality functions for graphons and establish concentration
inequalities demonstrating that graphon centrality functions arise naturally as
limits of their counterparts defined on sequences of graphs of increasing size.
The same concentration inequalities also provide high-probability bounds
between the graphon centrality functions and the centrality measures on any

effective entropy of this theory grows with energy like $E \ln E$ (i.e. faster
than Hagedorn) up to energies of order $N^2$. The canonical partition function
of the model displays a deconfinement or Hawking Page type phase transition at
temperatures of order $1/\ln N$. We derive these results in the large mass
limit but argue that they are qualitatively robust to small corrections in
$J/m$.

SPTpol observations. We report the power spectra over the spherical harmonic
multipole range $50 < \ell \leq 8000$, and detect nine acoustic peaks in the
$EE$ spectrum with high signal-to-noise ratio. These measurements are the most
sensitive to date of the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra at $\ell > 1050$ and $\ell
> 1475$, respectively. The observations cover 500 deg$^2$, a fivefold increase
in area compared to previous SPTpol analyses, which increases our sensitivity
to the photon diffusion damping tail of the CMB power spectra enabling tighter
constraints on \LCDM model extensions. After masking all sources with
unpolarized flux $>50$ mJy we place a 95% confidence upper limit on residual
polarized point-source power of $D_\ell = \ell(\ell+1)C_\ell/2\pi
<0.107\,\mu{\rm K}^2$ at $\ell=3000$, suggesting that the $EE$ damping tail
dominates foregrounds to at least $\ell = 4050$ with modest source masking. We
find that the SPTpol dataset is in mild tension with the $\Lambda CDM$ model
($2.1\,\sigma$), and different data splits prefer parameter values that differ
at the $\sim 1\,\sigma$ level. When fitting SPTpol data at $\ell < 1000$ we
find cosmological parameter constraints consistent with those for $Planck$

a higher value of the expansion rate ($H_0 = 71.3 \pm

used as a diagnostic of star formation. Simulations and analytic predictions
have suggested the N-PDF is composed of a low density lognormal component and a
high density power-law component, tracing turbulence and gravitational
collapse, respectively. In this paper, we study how various properties of the
true 2D column density distribution create the shape, or ""anatomy"" of the PDF.
We test our ideas and analytic approaches using both a real, observed, PDF
based on Herschel observations of dust emission as well as a simulation that
uses the ENZO code. Using a dendrogram analysis, we examine the three main
components of the N-PDF: the lognormal component, the power-law component, and
the transition point between these two components. We find that the power-law
component of an N-PDF is the summation of N-PDFs of power-law substructures
identified by the dendrogram algorithm. We also find that the analytic solution
to the transition point between lognormal and power-law components proposed by
Burkhart, Stalpes & Collins (2017) is applicable when tested on observations
and simulations, within the uncertainties. We reconfirm and extend the results
of Lombardi, Alves & Lada (2015), which stated that the lognormal component of
the N-PDF is difficult to constrain due to the artificial choice of the map
area. Based on the resulting anatomy of the N-PDF, we suggest avoiding
analyzing the column density structures of a star forming region based solely
on fits to the lognormal component of an N-PDF. We also suggest applying the
N-PDF analysis in combination with the dendrogram algorithm, to obtain a more
complete picture of the global and local environments and their effects on the
density structures.

Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) data, we investigated the relation of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) mass ($M_{\rm PAH}$), very small grain mass ($M_{\rm VSG}$),
big grain mass ($M_{\rm BG}$) and stellar mass ($M_{\rm star}$) with galaxy
merger for 55 star-forming galaxies at redshift $z<0.2$. Using the SDSS image
at $z<0.1$ and the HST image at $z>0.1$, we divided the galaxies into merger
galaxies and non-merger galaxies with the morphological parameter asymmetry
$A$, and quantified merging stages of galaxies based on the morphological
indicators, the second-order momentum of the brightest 20$\%$ region $M_{20}$
and the Gini coefficient. We find that $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ of merger
galaxies tend to be lower than that of non-merger galaxies and there are no
systematic differences of $M_{\rm VSG}/M_{\rm BG}$ and $M_{\rm BG}/M_{\rm
star}$ between merger galaxies and non-merger galaxies. We find that galaxies
with very low $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ seem to be merger galaxies at late
stages. These results suggest that PAHs are partly destroyed at late stages of
merging processes. Furthermore, we investigated $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$
variations in radiation field intensity strength $G_0$ and the emission line
ratio of $[{\rm O\,{\scriptsize I}}]\lambda 6300/{\rm H}\alpha$ which is a
shock tracer for merger galaxies and find that $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$
decreases with increasing both $G_0$ and $[{\rm O\,{\scriptsize I}}]/{\rm

radiation fields and large-scale shocks during merging processes of galaxies.

surveys is the oldest and arguably the most economic and mass-sensitive
detection method, compared to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect surveys that
detect the hot intracluster medium. However, a perennial problem has been the
mapping of optical 'richness' measurements on to total cluster mass. Emitted at
a conformal distance of 14 Gpc, the cosmic microwave background acts as a
backlight to all intervening mass in the Universe, and therefore has been
gravitationally lensed. Here we present a calibration of cluster optical
richness at the 10 per cent level by measuring the average cosmic microwave
background lensing convergence measured by Planck towards the positions of
large numbers of optically-selected clusters, detecting the deflection of
photons by haloes of total mass of the order 10**14 solar masses. Although
mainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck lensing
reconstruction can yield nearly unbiased results for stacked clusters on
arcminute scales. The lensing convergence only depends on the redshift integral
of the fractional overdensity of matter, so this approach offers a clean
measure of cluster mass over most of cosmic history, largely independent of
baryon physics.

either an additional power-law component with a photon index of $\sim$2, or an
additional thermal component with a temperature of $\sim$2.0 keV. We
investigate the possible origin of this component and suggest that it could
arise from either the Galactic ridge X-ray emission, an unidentified pulsar
wind nebula or X-ray synchrotron emission from high-energy particles
accelerated at the shock. However, deeper, high resolution observations of this

systematic periodic approximations to time quasilattices which can be verified

\pm\, 1.8\times 10^8\ {\mathrm M_\odot}$ and star formation rate of $3.4\,
\pm\, 0.4\ {\mathrm M_\odot}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$, the LAEs lie on an extrapolation
of the star-formation main sequence (MS) to low stellar mass. Their effective
dark matter halo mass is estimated to be $4.0_{-2.9}^{+5.1} \times 10^{10}\
{\mathrm M_\odot}$ with an effective bias of $1.22^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ which is
lower than that of $z \sim 2$ LAEs ($1.8\, \pm\, 0.3$), obtained by a previous
study based on a three times smaller survey area, with a probability of $96\%$.
However, the difference in the bias values can be explained if cosmic variance
is taken into account. If such a low halo mass implies a low HI gas mass, this
result appears to be consistent with the observations of a high \lya escape
fraction. With the low halo masses and ongoing star formation, our LAEs have a
relatively high stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) and a high efficiency of
converting baryons into stars. The extended Press-Schechter formalism predicts
that at $z=0$ our LAEs are typically embedded in halos with masses similar to
that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); they will also have similar SHMRs to
the LMC, if their SFRs are largely suppressed after $z \sim 2$ as some previous
studies have reported for the LMC itself.

researchers. Early deidentification methods relying on image blurring or
pixelization were replaced in recent years with techniques based on formal
anonymity models that provide privacy guaranties and at the same time aim at
retaining certain characteristics of the data even after deidentification. The
latter aspect is particularly important, as it allows to exploit the
deidentified data in applications for which identity information is irrelevant.
In this work we present a novel face deidentification pipeline, which ensures
anonymity by synthesizing artificial surrogate faces using generative neural
networks (GNNs). The generated faces are used to deidentify subjects in images
or video, while preserving non-identity-related aspects of the data and
consequently enabling data utilization. Since generative networks are very
adaptive and can utilize a diverse set of parameters (pertaining to the
appearance of the generated output in terms of facial expressions, gender,
race, etc.), they represent a natural choice for the problem of face
deidentification. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform
experiments using automated recognition tools and human annotators. Our results
show that the recognition performance on deidentified images is close to
chance, suggesting that the deidentification process based on GNNs is highly
effective.

implications for the way that city and county governments respond to increasing

examined inter-community variation in homelessness rates to identify causal
mechanisms of homelessness (Byrne et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2003; Fargo et al.,
2013), few studies have examined time-varying homeless counts within the same
community (McCandless et al., 2016). To examine trends in homeless population
counts in the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we develop a dynamic Bayesian
hierarchical model for time-varying homeless count data. Particular care is
given to modeling uncertainty in the homeless count generating and measurement
processes, and a critical distinction is made between the counted number of
homeless and the true size of the homeless population. For each metro under
study, we investigate the relationship between increases in the Zillow Rent
Index and increases in the homeless population. Sensitivity of inference to
potential improvements in the accuracy of point-in-time counts is explored, and
evidence is presented that the inferred increase in the rate of homelessness
from 2011-2016 depends on prior beliefs about the accuracy of homeless counts.
A main finding of the study is that the relationship between homelessness and
rental costs is strongest in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and
Seattle.

surrounding dielectric constant and defect concentration can modulate the
photoluminescence and Raman spectra. Here we show that exposing the monolayer
MoS$_2$ in air to a modest laser intensity for a brief period of time enhances
simultaneously the photoluminescence (PL) intensity associated with both trions
and excitons, together with $\sim$ 3 to 5 times increase of the Raman intensity
of first and second order modes. The simultaneous increase of PL from trions
and excitons cannot be understood based only on known-scenario of depletion of
electron concentration in MoS$_2$ by adsorption of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules.
This is explained by laser induced healing of defect states resulting in
reduction of non-radiative Auger processes. This laser healing is corroborated
by an observed increase of intensity of both the first order and second order
2LA(M) Raman modes by a factor of $\sim$ 3 to 5. The A$_{1g}$ mode hardens by
$\sim$ 1.4 cm$^{-1}$ whereas the E$^1_{2g}$ mode softens by $\sim$ 1 cm$^{-1}$.
The second order 2LA(M) Raman mode at $\sim$ 440 cm$^{-1}$ shows an increase in
wavenumber by $\sim$ 8 cm$^{-1}$ with laser exposure. These changes are a
combined effect of change in electron concentrations and oxygen-induced lattice

often provide reference pixels and a reference output. These are used to remove
correlated noise. Improved Reference Sampling and Subtraction (\IRSSquare,
pronounced ""IRS-square"") is a statistical technique for using this reference
information optimally in a least squares sense. Compared to ""traditional"" H2RG
readout, \IRSSquare uses a different clocking pattern to interleave many more
reference pixels into the data than is otherwise possible. Compared to standard
reference correction techniques, \IRSSquare subtracts the reference pixels and
reference output using a statistically optimized set of frequency dependent
weights. The benefits include somewhat lower noise variance and much less
obvious correlated noise. NIRSpec's \IRSSquare images are cosmetically clean,
with less $1/f$ banding than in traditional data from the same system. This
article describes the \IRSSquare clocking pattern and presents the equations
that are needed to use \IRSSquare in systems other than NIRSpec. For NIRSpec,
applying these equations is already an option in the calibration pipeline. As
an aid to instrument builders, we provide our prototype \IRSSquare calibration
software and sample \JWST NIRSpec data. The same techniques are applicable to
other detector systems, including those based on Teledyne's H4RG arrays. The

In the case of cognitive radio (CR) networks, the problem of interference is

producing any harmful interference to the primary user (PU) system. Thus, it is
essential to investigate the impact of interference caused to the PUs so that
its detrimental effect on the performance of the PU system performance is
reduced. Study of cognitive interference generally includes developing a model
to statistically demonstrate the power of cognitive interference at the PUs,
which then can be utilized to examine different performance measures. Having

is that it is ${\cal NP}$-complete to decide whether a given digraph $D$ has a
$2$-partition $(V_1,V_2)$ such that $B_D(V_1,V_2)$ is strongly connected. This
holds even if we require the input to be a highly connected eulerian digraph.

demonstrate this with charge-stabilized polymer microspheres and non-spherical

the investigation of picosecond magnetization dynamics at sub-micron length
scales by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The spatial
resolution of conventional (focused) Kerr microscopy using a microscope
objective lens is determined by the optical diffraction limit so that the
nanoscale character of the magnetization dynamics is lost. Here we present a
platform to overcome this limitation by means of a near-field TRSKM that
incorporates an atomic force microscope (AFM) with optical access to a metallic
AFM probe with a nanoscale aperture at its tip. We demonstrate the near-field
capability of the instrument through the comparison of time-resolved polar Kerr
images of magnetization dynamics within a microscale NiFe rectangle acquired
using both near-field and focused TRSKM techniques at a wavelength of 800 nm.
The flux-closure domain state of the in-plane equilibrium magnetization
provided the maximum possible dynamic polar Kerr contrast across the central
domain wall, and enabled an assessment of the magneto-optical spatial
resolution of each technique. Line profiles extracted from the Kerr images
demonstrate that the near-field spatial resolution was enhanced with respect to
that of the focused Kerr images. Furthermore, the near-field polar Kerr signal
(~1 mdeg) was more than half that of the focused Kerr signal, despite the
potential loss of probe light due to internal reflections within the AFM tip.
We have confirmed the near-field operation by exploring the influence of the
tip-sample separation, and have determined the spatial resolution to be ~550 nm
for an aperture with a sub-wavelength diameter of 400 nm. The spatial
resolution of the near-field TRSKM was in good agreement with finite element

to very large message communication of GPU buffers during the training phase.

star includes growing differential rotation whose form and growth rate are
determined by gravitational-radiation reaction. With no magnetic field, the
angular velocity of a fluid element grows exponentially until the mode reaches
its nonlinear saturation amplitude and remains nonzero after saturation. With a
background magnetic field, the differential rotation winds up and amplifies the
field, and previous work where large mode amplitudes were considered suggests
that the amplification may damp out the instability. A background magnetic
field, however, turns the saturated time-independent perturbations
corresponding to adding differential rotation into perturbations whose
characteristic frequencies are of order the Alfv\'en frequency. As found in
previous studies, we argue that magnetic- field growth is sharply limited by
the saturation amplitude of an unstable mode. In contrast to previous work,
however, we show that if the amplitude is small, i.e., of order 10^(-4), then
the limit on the magnetic-field growth is stringent enough to prevent the loss
of energy to the magnetic field from damping or significantly altering an
unstable r-mode in nascent neutron stars with normal interiors and in cold
stars whose interiors are type II superconductors. We show this result first
for a toy model, and we then obtain an analogous upper limit on magnetic field

investigate the impact forces and splash evolution of diving wedges as a
function of the wedge opening angle. A gradual transition from impactful to
smooth entry is observed as the wedge angle decreases. After submersion, diving
wedges experience significantly smaller drag forces (two-fold smaller) than
immersed wedges. Our experimental findings compare favorably with existing
force models upon the introduction of empirically-based corrections. We
experimentally characterize the shapes of the cavity and splash created by the
wedge and find that they are independent of the entry velocity at short times,
but that the splash exhibits distinct variations in shape at later times. We
propose a one-dimensional model of the splash that takes into account gravity,
surface tension and aerodynamics forces. The model shows, in conjunction with
experimental data, that the splash shape is dominated by the interplay between
a destabilizing Venturi-suction force due to air rushing between the splash and
the water surface and a stabilizing force due to surface tension. Taken
together, these findings could direct future research aimed at understanding

loss of phase, and therefore structure recovery is often complicated and not
always uniquely-defined. Here, we introduce the method of in-flight holography,
where we use nanoclusters as reference X-ray scatterers in order to encode
relative phase information into diffraction patterns of a virus. The resulting
hologram contains an unambiguous three-dimensional map of a virus and two

  Class Imbalance and Concept Drift (LPCICD'17)",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the wide application of machine learning algorithms to the real world,
class imbalance and concept drift have become crucial learning issues. Class
imbalance happens when the data categories are not equally represented, i.e.,
at least one category is minority compared to other categories. It can cause
learning bias towards the majority class and poor generalization. Concept drift
is a change in the underlying distribution of the problem, and is a significant
issue specially when learning from data streams. It requires learners to be
adaptive to dynamic changes.
  Class imbalance and concept drift can significantly hinder predictive
performance, and the problem becomes particularly challenging when they occur
simultaneously. This challenge arises from the fact that one problem can affect
the treatment of the other. For example, drift detection algorithms based on
the traditional classification error may be sensitive to the imbalanced degree
and become less effective; and class imbalance techniques need to be adaptive
to changing imbalance rates, otherwise the class receiving the preferential
treatment may not be the correct minority class at the current moment.
Therefore, the mutual effect of class imbalance and concept drift should be
considered during algorithm design.
  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the areas of
class imbalance learning and concept drift in order to encourage discussions
and new collaborations on solving the combined issue of class imbalance and
concept drift. It provides a forum for international researchers and
practitioners to share and discuss their original work on addressing new
challenges and research issues in class imbalance learning, concept drift, and
the combined issues of class imbalance and concept drift. The proceedings
include 8 papers on these topics.

Measuring the diffusion coefficient as a function of diffusion time makes in
vivo diffusion MRI uniquely sensitive to the cellular features about three
orders of magnitude below imaging resolution. However, there is a longstanding
debate, regarding which contribution --- intra- or extra-cellular --- is more
relevant in the overall time-dependence of the diffusion metrics. Here we
resolve this debate in the human brain white matter. By varying not just the
diffusion time, but also the gradient pulse duration of a standard diffusion
pulse sequence, we identify a functional form of the measured time-dependent
diffusion coefficient transverse to white matter tracts in 5 healthy
volunteers. This specific functional form is shown to originate from the
extra-axonal space, and provides estimates of the fiber packing correlation
length for axons in a bundle. Our results offer a metric for the outer axonal
diameter, a promising candidate marker for demyelination in neurodegenerative
diseases. From the methodological perspective, our analysis demonstrates how
competing models, which describe different physics yet interpolate standard
measurements equally well, can be distinguished based on their prediction for
an independent ""orthogonal"" measurement.

believed to be the products of mass transfer from an AGB companion, which has
long since become a white dwarf. The surface abundances of CEMP-s stars are
thus commonly assumed to reflect the nucleosynthesis output of the first AGB
stars. We have previously shown that, for this to be the case, some physical
mechanism must counter atomic diffusion in these nearly fully radiative stars,
which otherwise leads to surface abundance anomalies clearly inconsistent with
observations. Here we take into account angular momentum accretion by these
stars. We compute in detail the evolution of typical CEMP-s stars from the
ZAMS, through the mass accretion, and up the RGB for a wide range of specific
angular momentum of the accreted material, corresponding to rotation velocities
between about 0.3 and 300 km/s. We find that only for specific angular momentum
above 1e+17 cm2/s (rotation velocities above 20 km/s) angular momentum
accretion directly causes chemical dilution of the accreted material. This
could nevertheless be relevant to CEMP-s stars, which are observed to rotate
more slowly, if they undergo continuous angular momentum loss akin to
solar-like stars. In models with rotation velocities characteristic of CEMP-s
stars, rotational mixing primarily serves to inhibit atomic diffusion, such
that the maximal surface abundance variations (with respect to the composition
of the accreted material) prior to first dredge-up remain within about 0.4 dex
without thermohaline mixing or about 0.5-1.5 dex with thermohaline mixing. Even
in models with the lowest rotation velocities (under a km/s), rotational mixing
is able to severely inhibit atomic diffusion, compared to non-rotating models.
We thus conclude that it offers a natural solution to the problem posed by
atomic diffusion and cannot be neglected in models of CEMP-s stars.

transitions between these phases are correlated with jumps in the
velocity-force curves that are similar to the behavior observed at dynamical
phase transitions in driven particle systems with quenched disorder such as
vortices in type-II superconductors. In some cases the transitions between
phases are associated with negative differential mobility in which the average
absolute velocity of either species decreases with increasing drive. We also
consider the situation where the drive is applied to only one species as well
as systems in which both species are driven in the same direction with
different drive amplitudes. Finally, we discuss how the transitions we observe

isolate the benefits of individual MMU components (e.g., TLBs versus page table

thermal convection using high-resolution calculations. In statistically steady
turbulence, the injected and dissipated energies are balanced. This means that
a large amount of energy is continuously converted to internal energy via
dissipation. As in thermal convection downflows are colder than upflows, the
inhomogeneity of the dissipation potentially changes the convection structure.
Our investigation on the inhomogeneity of the dissipation shows the following.
1. More dissipation is seen around the bottom of the calculation domain, and
this tendency is promoted with the magnetic field. 2. The dissipation in the
downflow is much larger than that in the upflow. The dissipation in the
downflow is more than 80% of the total at maximum. This tendency is also
promoted with the magnetic field. 3. Although 2D probability density functions
of the kinetic and magnetic dissipations versus the vertical velocity are
similar, the kinetic and magnetic dissipations are not well correlated. Our
result suggests that the spatial inhomogeneity of the dissipation is
significant and should be considered when modeling a small-scale strong
magnetic field generated with an efficient small-scale dynamo for
low-resolution calculations.

formula by adding random parity constraints can be traced back to the seminal
work of Valiant and Vazirani, showing that NP is as easy as detecting unique
solutions. While theoretically sound, the random parity constraints in that
construction have the following drawback: each constraint, on average, involves
half of all variables. As a result, the branching factor associated with
searching for models that also satisfy the parity constraints quickly gets out
of hand. In this work we prove that one can work with much shorter parity
constraints and still get rigorous mathematical guarantees, especially when the
number of models is large so that many constraints need to be added. Our work
is based on the realization that the essential feature for random systems of
parity constraints to be useful in probabilistic model counting is that the
geometry of their set of solutions resembles an error-correcting code.

pairs of objects. We call relation a triplet of the form (subject, predicate,
object) where the predicate is typically a preposition (eg. 'under', 'in front

Learning such relations is challenging as the objects have different spatial
configurations and appearances depending on the relation in which they occur.
Another major challenge comes from the difficulty to get annotations,
especially at box-level, for all possible triplets, which makes both learning
and evaluation difficult. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First,
we design strong yet flexible visual features that encode the appearance and
spatial configuration for pairs of objects. Second, we propose a
weakly-supervised discriminative clustering model to learn relations from
image-level labels only. Third we introduce a new challenging dataset of
unusual relations (UnRel) together with an exhaustive annotation, that enables
accurate evaluation of visual relation retrieval. We show experimentally that
our model results in state-of-the-art results on the visual relationship
dataset significantly improving performance on previously unseen relations

the surface magnetic field to be at least around some tens of kG. In contrast

calculate timescales for typical forms of dissipation and find that thermal

occurs, which requires temperatures above about 10 MeV and gradients over
lengthscales of 0.1 km or less. On the other hand, if direct-Urca processes
remain suppressed, leaving modified-Urca processes to establish flavor
equilibrium, then bulk viscous dissipation could provide significant damping to
density oscillations observed right after the merger. When comparing with data

learning fashion. Such design leverages the strengths of FCN for pixel-level

The residual learning connection reformulates the vehicle count regression as
learning residual functions with reference to the sum of densities in each

feature map resolution, we propose a Hyper-Atrous combination to integrate
atrous convolution in FCN and combine feature maps of different convolution

X-ray binaries (LMXB), provide constraints on NS masses and radii and
consequently the equation of state of NS cores. In such analyses various
assumptions are made without knowing if they are justified. We have analyzed
X-ray burst spectra from the LMXB 4U 1608-52, with the aim of studying how the
different persistent emission components react to the bursts. During some
bursts in the soft spectral state we find that there are two variable
components; one corresponding to the burst blackbody component and another
optically thick Comptonized component. We interpret the latter as the spreading
layer between the NS surface and the accretion disc, which is not present
during the hard state bursts. We propose that the spectral changes during the
soft state bursts are driven by the spreading layer that could cover almost the
entire NS in the brightest phases due to the enhanced radiation pressure
support provided by the burst, and that the layer subsequently returns to its
original state during the burst decay. When deriving the NS mass and radius
using the soft state bursts two assumptions are therefore not met: the NS is
not entirely visible and the burst emission is reprocessed in the spreading
layer, causing distortions of the emitted spectrum. For these reasons the NS
mass and radius constraints using the soft state bursts are different compared
to the ones derived using the hard state bursts.

soliton buildup dynamics of ultrafast fiber lasers operating both in anomalous
and net-normal dispersion regimes. Based on the advanced experimental
methodologies of spatio-temporal reconstruction and dispersive Fourier
transform (DFT), the soliton booting dynamics are analyzed in the time and
spectral domains. It was found that the booting dynamics of conventional and
dissipative solitons operating in the anomalous and net-normal dispersion
regimes, respectively, are different from each other due to the different pulse
shaping mechanisms. In particular, the spectral interference pattern with
strong relaxation oscillation behavior was observed near the mode-locking
transition for conventional soliton, while no relaxation oscillation of
spectral pattern was obtained for dissipative soliton. We firstly revealed that
the spectral pattern distributions are induced by the transient structured
soliton formation during the pulse shaping from the noise background. The
experimental results were verified by the theoretical simulations. The obtained
results would provide a general guideline for understanding the soliton booting
dynamics in ultrafast fiber lasers, and will prove to be fruitful to the

extract meaningful patterns. This is especially the case when dealing with
textual data. Recent studies in machine learning, information theory and
network science have developed several novel instruments to extract the
semantics of unstructured data, and harness it to build a network of relations.
Such approaches serve as an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction and
pattern detection. This paper applies semantic network science to extract
ideological proximity in the international arena, by focusing on the data from
General Debates in the UN General Assembly on the topics of high salience to
international community. UN General Debate corpus (UNGDC) covers all high-level
debates in the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2014, covering all UN member
states. The research proceeds in three main steps. First, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) is used to extract the topics of the UN speeches, and
therefore semantic information. Each country is then assigned a vector
specifying the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate
output is then used in to construct a network of countries based on information
theoretical metrics where the links capture similar vectorial patterns in the
topic distributions. Topology of the networks is then analyzed through network
properties like density, path length and clustering. Finally, we identify
specific topological features of our networks using the map equation framework
to detect communities in our networks of countries.

methods) or only the neighbourhood (local methods) of the link to predict.
Global methods are believed the best. Is this common belief well-founded?
Stochastic-Block-Model (SBM) is a global method believed as one of the best
link-predictors, therefore it is considered a reference for comparison. But,
our results suggest that SBM, whose computational time is high, cannot in
general overcome the Cannistraci-Hebb (CH) network automaton model that is a
simple local-learning-rule of topological self-organization proved as the
current best local-based and parameter-free deterministic rule for
link-prediction. To elucidate the reasons of this unexpected result, we
formally introduce the notion of local-ring network automata models and their
relation with the nature of common-neighbours' definition in complex network
theory. After extensive tests, we recommend Structural-Perturbation-Method
(SPM) as the new best global method baseline. However, even SPM overall does
not outperform CH and in several evaluation frameworks we astonishingly found
the opposite. In particular, CH was the best predictor for synthetic networks
generated by the Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model, and its
performance in PSO networks with community structure was even better than using
the original internode-hyperbolic-distance as link-predictor. Interestingly,
when tested on non-hyperbolic synthetic networks the performance of CH
significantly dropped down indicating that this rule of network
self-organization could be strongly associated to the rise of hyperbolic
geometry in complex networks. The superiority of global methods seems a
""misleading belief"" caused by a latent geometry bias of the few small networks
used as benchmark in previous studies. We propose to found a latent geometry
theory of link-prediction in complex networks.

time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at
the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by
multi-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations
performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective
boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical
analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science.
In this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a
one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from
multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose
a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of
lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from $\sim$
50 Myr to $\sim$ 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective
penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain
the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional
assumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the
convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar
rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration
of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing
a possible explanation for the long standing problem of lithium depletion in
pre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that
its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.

NP-hard. Which $k$ is a given value.
  We deal with both single and multiple reflecting mirrors, and also specular
or diffuse types of reflections.
  In specular reflection, a single incoming direction is reflected into a
single outgoing direction. In this paper diffuse reflection is regarded as
reflecting lights at all possible angles from a given surface.
  The paper deals with finding mirror-edges to add \emph{at least} $k$ units of
area to $VP(q)$. In the case of specular type of reflections we only consider
single reflections, and the multiple case is still open.
  Specular case of the problem is more tricky. We construct a simple polygon
for every given instance of a 3-SAT problem. There are some specific spikes
which are visible only by some particular mirror-edges. Consequently, to have
minimum number of mirror-edges it is required to choose only one of these
mirrors to see a particular spike. There is a reduction polygon which contains
a clause-gadget corresponding to every clause, and a variable-gadget
corresponding to every variable.
  3-SAT formula has $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, so the minimum number of
mirrors required to add an area of at least $k$ to $V P(q)$ is $l = 3m+n+1$ if
and only if the 3-SAT formula is satisfiable.
  This reduction works in these two cases: adding at least $k$ vertex of $\P$
to $VP(q)$, and expanding $VP(q)$ at least $k$ units of area.

  scientific journals",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following criticisms against the journal Impact Factor, new journal influence
scores have been developed such as the Eigenfactor or the Prestige Scimago
Journal Rank. They are based on PageRank type algorithms on the cross-citations
transition matrix of the citing-cited network. The PageRank algorithm performs
a smoothing of the transition matrix combining a random walk on the data
network and a teleportation to all possible nodes with fixed probabilities (the
damping factor being $\alpha= 0.85$). We reinterpret this smoothing matrix as
the mean of a posterior distribution of a Dirichlet-multinomial model in an
empirical Bayes perspective. We suggest a simple yet efficient way to make a
clear distinction between structural and sampling zeroes. This allows us to
contrast cases with self-citations included or excluded to avoid overvalued
journal bias. We estimate the model parameters by maximizing the marginal
likelihood with a Majorize-Minimize algorithm. The procedure ends up with a
score similar to the PageRank ones but with a damping factor depending on each
journal. The procedures are illustrated with an example about cross-citations
among 47 statistical journals studied by Varin et. al. (2016).

types of violations of the locality. The standard Bell inequalities cannot
characterize the multipartite correlations that are generated by multiple
sources. The main problem is that no computationally efficient method is
available for constructing useful Bell inequalities for general quantum
networks. In this work, we show a significant improvement by presenting new,
explicit Bell-type inequalities for general networks including cyclic networks.
These nonlinear inequalities are related to the matching problem of an
equivalent unweighted bipartite graph that allows constructing a
polynomial-time algorithm. For the quantum resources consisting of bipartite
entangled pure states and generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states,
we prove the generic non-multilocality of quantum networks with multiple

with respect to the presented Tsirelson's bound for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

Measurements of the shadow sizes around the black holes can help to evaluate

shadow is affected due to charge as well as spin. The shadow is a dark zone
covered by a deformed circle, and the size of the shadow decreases with an
increase in the charge $q$ when compared with the five-dimensional Myers-Perry

optimal fitting parameters of RR with such $\alpha$, which can be further
utilized to predict new data. Since indefinite dense Hamiltonian simulation has
been adopted as a key subroutine, our algorithm can efficiently handle

widely accepted that the long-range Coulomb interaction is too weak to generate
a dynamical excitonic gap in graphene with a perfect Dirac cone. We study the
impact of the deformation of Dirac cone on dynamical gap generation. When a
uniaxial strain is applied to graphene, the Dirac cone is made elliptical in
the equal-energy plane and the fermion velocity becomes anisotropic. The
applied uniaxial strain has two effects: it decreases the fermion velocity; it
increases the velocity anisotropy. After solving the Dyson-Schwinger gap
equation, we show that dynamical gap generation is promoted by the former
effect, but is suppressed by the latter one. For suspended graphene, we find
that the systems undergoes an excitonic insulating transition when the strain
is roughly 7.34$\%$. We also solve the gap equation in case the Dirac cone is
tiled, which might be realized in the organic material
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$I$_{3}$, and find that the tilt of Dirac cone can
suppress dynamical gap generation. It turns out that the geometry of the Dirac
cone plays an important role in the formation of excitonic pairing.

topological-insulators is investigated by using Landauer-buttiker formalism.
The chiral selective tunneling is addressed in such systems which leads to
transport gap and as a consequence current blocking. This quantum blocking of
transport occurs when the magnetic states with opposite chirality are aligned
energetically. This can be obsereved when an electron tunnels through a barrier
or well of magnetic potential induced by the exchange field. It is proved and
demonstrated that this chiral transition rule fails when structural inversion
asymmetric potential or an in-plane magnetization is turning on. This new
finding is useful to interpret quantum transport through topological-insulator
thin films especially to shed light on longitudinal conductance behavior of
quantum anomalous Hall effect. Besides, one can design electronic devices by
means of magnetic topological-insulator thin films based on the chiral
selective tunneling leading to negative differential resistance.

handle large scale variations, we always need to compute feature maps multiple
times for multi-scale object detection, which has the bottleneck of
computational cost in practice. To address this, we devise a recurrent scale
approximation (RSA) to compute feature map once only, and only through this map
can we approximate the rest maps on other levels. At the core of RSA is the
recursive rolling out mechanism: given an initial map at a particular scale, it
generates the prediction at a smaller scale that is half the size of input. To
further increase efficiency and accuracy, we (a): design a scale-forecast
network to globally predict potential scales in the image since there is no
need to compute maps on all levels of the pyramid. (b): propose a landmark
retracing network (LRN) to trace back locations of the regressed landmarks and
generate a confidence score for each landmark; LRN can effectively alleviate
false positives caused by the accumulated error in RSA. The whole system can be
trained end-to-end in a unified CNN framework. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed algorithm is superior against state-of-the-art methods on face
detection benchmarks and achieves comparable results for generic proposal
generation. The source code of RSA is available at

to optical distance measurement. It takes advantage of a widely-observed
phenomenon in photodetector devices: a nonlinear, irradiance-dependent
photoresponse. This means that the output from a sensor is dependent on the
total number of photons incident and the size of the area in which they fall.
With a certain arrangement of sensor and lens, this phenomenon will cause the
output of the sensor to change based on how far in or out of focus an object
is. We call this the FIP effect. Here we demonstrate how to use the FIP effect
for distance measurements. We show that this technique works with different
sensor materials, device types, as well as visible and near infrared light. In
principle, any sensor exhibiting a photoresponse that depends nonlinearly on
irradiance could be used with the FIP technique. It is our belief that the FIP
technique can become an important method for measuring distance.

  systems: A review",,"IEEEAccess, 2021","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3081742",,"cs.SE math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Component-based software development (CBSD) is an alternative approach to
constructing software systems that offers numerous benefits, particularly in
decreasing the complexity of system design. However, deploying components into
a system is a challenging and error-prone task. Model-checking is one of the
reliable methods to systematically analyze the correctness of a system. It is a
bruce-force checking of the system's state space that assists to significantly
expand the level of confidence in the system. Nevertheless, model-checking is
limited by a critical problem called state-space explosion (SSE). To benefit
from model-checking, an appropriate method is required to reduce SSE. In the
past two decades, a great number of SSE reduction methods have been proposed
containing many similarities, dissimilarities, and unclear concepts in some
cases. This research, firstly, plans to present a review of SSE handling
methods and classify them based on their similarities, principle, and
characteristics. Second, it investigates the methods for handling the SSE
problem in the verification process of CBSD and provides insight into the
potential limitations, underlining the key challenges for future research
efforts.
