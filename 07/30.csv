found in a variety of industrial and natural applications (e.g. urban planning,
fracking, submerged vegetation). One important realization of this system is at
the bottom of rivers, where surface waters of the river permeate the deposited
sediment and exchange their contents with subsurface waters. Obtaining a
complete picture of this process, known as hyporheic exchange, is important for
the understanding and maintenance of water quality and river ecology. Given the
wide range of length scales (mm to km) and corresponding time scales of
interest, reduced-order numerical models (e.g. stochastic particle tracking,
advection-dispersion equations) are often used to study the transport of mass
and momentum in this system. However, the many scales associated with
surface/subsurface mixing make the development of a high-fidelity model for
turbulent scalar transport a formidable challenge. In an effort to capture
transport behavior at the pore scale, this work is focused on development of a
detailed, three-dimensional flow model for the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of
turbulent flow over a permeable bed. A rigorous assessment of the computational
mesh, domain size and turbulence model is performed. Concurrently, the
double-averaging methodology is used to study the large-scale, persistent flow
behavior in the presence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity. It is found that
accurate resolution of the largest turbulent scales is necessary to develop a
complete picture of interfacial transport, and that these large structures are
felt deeper within the bed. Additionally, the development of a particle
tracking software module is detailed. This module provides a foundation for the
extraction of Lagrangian dispersion information from the LES, which will
eventually be used to physically inform reduced-order models.

developed for classification and clustering of Low Probability of Intercept

by a pulse compression waveform which is either frequency-modulated or
phase-modulated. The proposed model can classify and cluster different
modulation types such as linear frequency modulation, non linear frequency
modulation, polyphase Barker, polyphase P1, P2, P3, P4, Frank and Zadoff codes.
The classification method focuses on the introduction of a new prior
distribution for the model hyper-parameters that gives us the possibility to
handle sensitivity of mixture models to initialization and to allow a less
restrictive modeling of data. Inference is processed through a Variational
Bayes method and a Bayesian treatment is adopted for model learning, supervised
classification and clustering. Moreover, the novel prior distribution is not a
well-known probability distribution and both deterministic and stochastic
methods are employed to estimate its expectations. Some numerical experiments
show that the proposed method is less sensitive to initialization and provides
more accurate results than the previous state of the art mixture models.

analysis if the worst case bias does not hold in every pair. In this paper, we
show that for binary data, the standard approach can be calibrated in terms of
the average bias in a pair rather than worst case bias. When the worst case
bias and average bias differ, the average bias interpretation results in a less
conservative sensitivity analysis and more power. In many studies, the average
case calibration may also carry a more natural interpretation than the worst
case calibration and may also allow researchers to incorporate additional data
to establish an empirical basis with which to calibrate a sensitivity analysis.

their nuclear and local galactic environment. However, the distance of the
outflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained, which limits
our understanding of their kinetic power as a cosmic feedback channel.
Therefore, the impact of AGN outflows on their host galaxies is uncertain.
However, when the density of the outflows is known, their distance can be
immediately obtained from their modelled ionization parameter. With the new
self-consistent PhotoIONization (PION) model in the SPEX code, we are able to
calculate detailed level populations, including the ground and metastable
levels. This enables us to determine under what physical conditions the
metastable levels are significantly populated. We then identify characteristic
lines from these metastable levels in the 1 -- 2000 {\AA} wavelength range. In
the large density range of $n_H \in (10^6, 10^{20} m^{-3}$, the metastable
levels 2s 2p $(^3P_{0-2})$ in Be-like ions can be significantly populated. For
B-like ions, merely the first excited level 2s$^2$ 2p $(^2P_{3/2})$ can be used
as a density probe. For C-like ions, the first two excited levels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$
($^3P_1$ and $^3P_2$) are better density probes than the next two excited
levels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$ ($^1S_0$ and $^1D_2$). Different ions in the same
isoelectronic sequence cover not only a wide range of ionization parameter, but
also a wide range of density. On the other hand, within the same isonuclear
sequence, less ionized ions probe lower density and smaller ionization
parameter. Finally, we re-analyzed the high-resolution grating spectra of NGC
5548 observed with Chandra in January 2002, using a set of PION components to
account for the ionized outflow. We derive lower (or upper) limits of plasma
density in five out of six PION components, based on the presence (or absence)

intensity from the range of 10^21-10^23 W/cm^2, predicted for the Extreme Light
Infrastructure (ELI) lasers currently built in Europe, with a thin hydrocarbon
(CH) target. A special attention is paid to the effect of the laser pulse
intensity and polarization (linear-LP, circular-CP) as well as the target
thickness on the proton energy spectrum, the proton beam spatial distribution
and the proton pulse shape and intensity. It is shown that for the highest,
ultra-relativistic intensities (10^23 W/cm^2) the effect of laser polarization
on the proton beam parameters is relatively weak and for both polarizations
quasi-monoenergetic proton beams of the mean proton energy about 2 GeV and
dE/E=0.3 for LP and dE/E=0.2 for CP are generated from the 0.1 micrometer CH
target. At short distances from the irradiated target (below 50 micrometers),
the proton pulse is very short (below 20 fs), and the proton beam intensities
reach extremely high values above 10^21 W/cm^2, which are much higher than
those attainable in conventional accelerators. Such proton beams can open the
door for new areas of research in high energy-density physics and nuclear
physics as well as can also prove useful for applications in materials research

impurities immersed in a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and for various
relative coupling strengths tuned by the Fano-Feshbach resonance technique.
Here we report extensive numerical simulations on a closely related problem:
the collision between a bosonic impurity made of few $^{41}$K atoms and a BEC
made of $^{87}$Rb atoms in a quasi one-dimensional configuration and under a
weak harmonic axial confinement. For small values of the interspecies
interaction strength (no matter the sign of it), we find that the impurity,
which starts from outside the BEC, simply oscillates back and forth the BEC
cloud, but the frequency of oscillation depends on the interaction strength.
For intermediate couplings, after a few cycles of oscillation the impurity is
captured by the BEC and strongly changes its amplitude of oscillation. In the
strong interaction regime, if the interspecies interaction is attractive, a
local maximum (bright soliton) in the density of BEC occurs where the impurity
is trapped; instead, if the interspecies interaction is repulsive, the impurity
is not able to enter in the BEC cloud and the reflection coefficient is close
to one. On the other hand, if the initial displacement of the impurity is
increased, the impurity is able to penetrate in the cloud leading to the
appearance of a moving hole (dark soliton) in the BEC.

extremely strong intensity variations across images on all spatial scales.
Source extraction in such images with methods based on global thresholding may
bring unacceptably large numbers of spurious sources in bright areas while
failing to detect sources in low-background or low-noise areas. It would be
highly beneficial to subtract background and equalize the levels of small-scale
fluctuations in the images before extracting sources or filaments. This paper
describes getimages, a new method of background derivation and image
flattening. It is based on median filtering with sliding windows that
correspond to a range of spatial scales from the observational beam size up to
a maximum structure width $X_{\lambda}$. The latter is a single free parameter
of getimages that can be evaluated manually from the observed image
$\mathcal{I}_{\lambda}$. The median filtering algorithm provides a background
image $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}_{\lambda}$ for structures of all widths below
$X_{\lambda}$. The same median filtering procedure applied to an image of
standard deviations $\mathcal{D}_{\lambda}$ derived from a
background-subtracted image $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}_{\lambda}$ results in a
flattening image $\tilde{\mathcal{F}}_{\lambda}$. Finally, a flattened
detection image
$\mathcal{I}_{{\lambda}\mathrm{D}}{\,=\,}\tilde{\mathcal{S}}_{\lambda}{/}\tilde{\mathcal{F}}_{\lambda}$
is computed, whose standard deviations are uniform outside sources and
filaments. Detecting sources in such greatly simplified images results in much
cleaner extractions that are more complete and reliable. As a bonus, getimages
reduces various observational and map-making artifacts and equalizes noise
levels between independent tiles of mosaicked images.

densely interacting, contiguous chromatin regions playing important roles in
regulating gene expression. A few algorithms have been proposed to detect TADs.
In particular, the structure of Hi-C data naturally inspires application of
community detection methods. However, one of the drawbacks of community
detection is that most methods take exchangeability of the nodes in the network
for granted; whereas the nodes in this case, i.e. the positions on the
chromosomes, are not exchangeable. We propose a network model for detecting
TADs using Hi-C data that takes into account this non-exchangeability. In
addition, our model explicitly makes use of cell-type specific CTCF binding
sites as biological covariates and can be used to identify conserved TADs
across multiple cell types. The model leads to a likelihood objective that can
be efficiently optimized via relaxation. We also prove that when suitably
initialized, this model finds the underlying TAD structure with high
probability. Using simulated data, we show the advantages of our method and the
caveats of popular community detection methods, such as spectral clustering, in
this application. Applying our method to real Hi-C data, we demonstrate the
domains identified have desirable epigenetic features and compare them across
different cell types.

burning of a neutron star (NS). We have used relativistic magneto-hydrostatic
(MHS) conservation equations for studying the PT from nuclear matter (NM) to
quark matter (QM). We found that the shock-induced phase transition (PT) is
likely if the density of the star core is more than three times nuclear
saturation ($\rho_s$) density. The conversion process from NS to quark star
(QS) is found to be an exothermic process beyond such densities. The burning
process at the star center most likely starts as a deflagration process.
However, there can be a small window at lower densities where the process can
be a detonation one. At small enough infalling matter velocities the resultant
magnetic field of the QS is lower than that of the NS. However, for a higher
value of infalling matter velocities, the magnetic field of QM becomes larger.
Therefore, depending on the initial density fluctuation and on whether the PT
is a violent one or not the QS could be more magnetic or less magnetic. The PT
also have a considerable effect on the tilt of the magnetic axis of the star.
For smaller velocities and densities the magnetic angle are not affected much
but for higher infalling velocities tilt of the magnetic axis changes suddenly.
The magnetic field strength and the change in the tilt axis can have a
significant effect on the observational aspect of the magnetars.

limits of this trade-off, and then propose a detection strategy that achieves
these limits. We then consider a special case, where there is no trade-off
between security and efficiency. In other words, our detection strategy can
achieve the maximal efficiency and the maximal security simultaneously. Two
extensions of the secure hypothesis testing problem are also studied and
fundamental limits and achievability results are provided: 1) a subset of
sensors, namely ""secure"" sensors, are assumed to be equipped with better
security countermeasures and hence are guaranteed to be benign, 2) detection
performance with unknown number of compromised sensors. Numerical examples are
given to illustrate the main results.

context remains a challenging task. Detectors learned from a public dataset can
only work with a fixed list of categories, while training from scratch usually
requires a large amount of training data with detailed annotations. This work
aims to explore a novel approach -- learning object detectors from documentary
films in a weakly supervised manner. This is inspired by the observation that
documentaries often provide dedicated exposition of certain object categories,
where visual presentations are aligned with subtitles. We believe that object
detectors can be learned from such a rich source of information. Towards this
goal, we develop a joint probabilistic framework, where individual pieces of
information, including video frames and subtitles, are brought together via
both visual and linguistic links. On top of this formulation, we further derive
a weakly supervised learning algorithm, where object model learning and
training set mining are unified in an optimization procedure. Experimental
results on a real world dataset demonstrate that this is an effective approach
to learning new object detectors.

We assign the flat optical conductivity to the transitions between
quasi-two-dimensional Dirac bands near the Fermi level. In contrast to
graphene, $\sigma_{\rm{flat}}$ is not supposed to be universal but related to
the length of the nodal line in the reciprocal space, $k_{0}$. When
$\sigma_{\rm{flat}}$ and $k_{0}$ are connected by a simple model, we find good
agreement between experiment and theory. Due to the spin-orbit coupling, the
discussed Dirac bands in ZrSiS possess a small gap $\Delta$, for which we
determine an upper bound max($\Delta$) = 30 meV from our optical measurements.
At low temperatures the momentum-relaxation rate collapses, and the

Model (NMSSM), the lightest neutralino with bino or singlino as its dominant
component is customarily taken as dark matter (DM) candidate. Since light
Higgsinos favored by naturalness can strength the couplings of the DM and thus
enhance the DM-nucleon scattering rate, the tension between naturalness and DM
direct detection results becomes more and more acute with the improved
experimental sensitivity. In this work, we extend the NMSSM by inverse seesaw
mechanism to generate neutrino mass, and show that in certain parameter space
the lightest sneutrino may act as a viable DM candidate, i.e. it can annihilate
by multi-channels to get correct relic density and meanwhile satisfy all
experimental constraints. The most striking feature of the extension is that
the DM-nucleon scattering rate can be naturally below its current experimental
bounds regardless of the higgsino mass, and hence it alleviates the tension
between naturalness and DM experiments. Other interesting features include that
the Higgs phenomenology becomes much richer than that of the original NMSSM due
to the relaxed constraints from DM physics and also due to the presence of
extra neutrinos, and that the signatures of sparticles at colliders are quite
different from those with neutralino as DM candidate.

and machine learning. However, there is a lack of general understanding
regarding consistency, splitting rules and influence of the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the statistical properties of existing
methods from several interesting perspectives. First, we show that traditional
splitting rules with censored outcomes rely on a biased estimation of the
within-node failure distribution. To exactly quantify this bias, we develop a
concentration bound of the within-node estimation based on non i.i.d. samples
and apply it to the entire forest. Second, we analyze the entanglement between
the failure and censoring distributions caused by univariate splits, and show
that without correcting the bias at an internal node, survival tree and forest
models can still enjoy consistency under suitable conditions. In particular, we
demonstrate this property under two cases: a finite-dimensional case where the
splitting variables and cutting points are chosen randomly, and a
high-dimensional case where the covariates are weakly correlated. Our results
can also degenerate into an independent covariate setting, which is commonly
used in the random forest literature for high-dimensional sparse models.
However, it may not be avoidable that the convergence rate depends on the total
number of variables in the failure and censoring distributions. Third, we
propose a new splitting rule that compares bias-corrected cumulative hazard
functions at each internal node. We show that the rate of consistency of this
new model depends only on the number of failure variables, which improves from
non-bias-corrected versions. We perform simulation studies to confirm that this
can substantially benefit the prediction error.

extend the outcome weighted learning to right censored survival data without

semiparametric modeling of the censoring and failure times as done in

approach proposed in [zhu2012recursively] to nonparametrically impute the
survival time in two different ways. The first approach replaces the reward of
each individual by the expected survival time, while in the second approach
only the censored observations are imputed by their conditional expected

performance compared to existing methods. We also illustrate the proposed

from sparsely collected data or under-sampled measurements, which are
practically important for few-view CT, tomosynthesis, interior tomography, and
so on. To perform sparse-data CT, the iterative reconstruction commonly use
regularizers in the CS framework. Currently, how to choose the parameters
adaptively for regularization is a major open problem. In this paper, inspired
by the idea of machine learning especially deep learning, we unfold a
state-of-the-art ""fields of experts"" based iterative reconstruction scheme up
to a number of iterations for data-driven training, construct a Learned
Experts' Assessment-based Reconstruction Network (""LEARN"") for sparse-data CT,
and demonstrate the feasibility and merits of our LEARN network. The
experimental results with our proposed LEARN network produces a competitive
performance with the well-known Mayo Clinic Low-Dose Challenge Dataset relative
to several state-of-the-art methods, in terms of artifact reduction, feature
preservation, and computational speed. This is consistent to our insight that
because all the regularization terms and parameters used in the iterative
reconstruction are now learned from the training data, our LEARN network
utilizes application-oriented knowledge more effectively and recovers
underlying images more favorably than competing algorithms. Also, the number of
layers in the LEARN network is only 12, reducing the computational complexity
of typical iterative algorithms by orders of magnitude.

non-separable) programs, which are usually difficult to solve by interior point
methods or other Newton-type methods due to the non-smoothness or the
prohibitive computation and storage complexity for Hessians and matrix
inversions. Instead, they are often solved by first order gradient based
methods or decomposition based methods. The conventional primal-dual
subgradient method, also known as the Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa subgradient method,
is a low complexity algorithm with an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ convergence time.
Recently, a new Lagrangian dual type algorithm with a faster $O(1/\epsilon)$
convergence time is proposed in Yu and Neely (2017). However, if the objective
or constraint functions are not separable, each iteration of the Lagrangian
dual type method in Yu and Neely (2017) requires to solve a unconstrained
convex program, which can have huge complexity. This paper proposes a new
primal-dual type algorithm with $O(1/\epsilon)$ convergence for general
constrained convex programs. Each iteration of the new algorithm can be
implemented in parallel with low complexity even when the original problem is
composite and non-separable.

Dp-branes, dual to the temperature of different flavors at finite R-charge, in

embeds type IIB probe flavor Dp-branes into the Klebanov-Witten gravity dual of
conformal gauge theory, with the embedding parameter, given by the minimal
radial extension of the probes, setting the IR scale of conformal and chiral
flavor symmetry breakdown. We show that when the minimal extension is positive
definite and additional spin is switched on, the induced world volume metrics
of only certain type IIB probe branes admit thermal horizons and Hawking
temperatures despite the absence of black holes in the bulk. We find that the
world volume black hole nucleation is non-trivial and depends on the world
volume dimension and topology of the non-trivial internal cycle wrapped by the
probe. We find, in addition, that by varying the minimal extension of the
probe, large hierarchies of temperature scales get produced, with the
temperature behavior varying dramatically, depending on the type of probe. We
also derive the energy-stress tensor of the thermal probes and study their
backreaction and energy dissipation. We show that at the IR scale the
backreaction is non-negligible and find the energy can flow from the probes to
the bulk, dual to the energy dissipation from the flavor sectors into the gauge
theory.

breather, the simplest space periodic, one-mode perturbation of the unstable
background, limiting our considerations to the simplest case of one unstable
mode. In agreement with recent theoretical findings of the authors, in the
situation in which the round-off errors are negligible with respect to the
perturbations due to the discrete scheme used in the numerical experiments, the
split-step Fourier method (SSFM), the numerical output is well-described by a
suitable genus 2 finite-gap solution of NLS. This solution can be written in
terms of different elementary functions in different time regions and,
ultimately, it shows an exact recurrence of rogue waves described, at each
appearance, by the Akhmediev breather. We discover a remarkable empirical
formula connecting the recurrence time with the number of time steps used in
the SSFM and, via our recent theoretical findings, we establish that the SSFM
opens up a vertical unstable gap whose length can be computed with high
accuracy, and is proportional to the inverse of the square of the number of
time steps used in the SSFM. This neat picture essentially changes when the
round-off error is sufficiently large. Indeed experiments in standard double
precision show serious instabilities in both the periods and phases of the
recurrence. In contrast with it, as predicted by the theory, replacing the
exact Akhmediev Cauchy datum by its first harmonic approximation, we only
slightly modify the numerical output. Let us also remark, that the first rogue
wave appearance is completely stable in all experiments and is in perfect
agreement with the Akhmediev formula and with the theoretical prediction in
terms of the Cauchy data.

  Neighborhoods","17 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Very few K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) ensembles exist, despite the efficacy of
this approach in regression, classification, and outlier detection. Those that
do exist focus on bagging features, rather than varying k or bagging
observations; it is unknown whether varying k or bagging observations can
improve prediction. Given recent studies from topological data analysis,
varying k may function like multiscale topological methods, providing stability
and better prediction, as well as increased ensemble diversity.
  This paper explores 7 KNN ensemble algorithms combining bagged features,
bagged observations, and varied k to understand how each of these contribute to
model fit. Specifically, these algorithms are tested on Tweedie regression
problems through simulations and 6 real datasets; results are compared to
state-of-the-art machine learning models including extreme learning machines,
random forest, boosted regression, and Morse-Smale regression.
  Results on simulations suggest gains from varying k above and beyond bagging
features or samples, as well as the robustness of KNN ensembles to the curse of
dimensionality. KNN regression ensembles perform favorably against
state-of-the-art algorithms and dramatically improve performance over KNN
regression. Further, real dataset results suggest varying k is a good strategy
in general (particularly for difficult Tweedie regression problems) and that
KNN regression ensembles often outperform state-of-the-art methods.
  These results for k-varying ensembles echo recent theoretical results in
topological data analysis, where multidimensional filter functions and
multiscale coverings provide stability and performance gains over
single-dimensional filters and single-scale covering. This opens up the
possibility of leveraging multiscale neighborhoods and multiple measures of
local geometry in ensemble methods.

films due to its unique, reversible crystal phase transition from monoclinic
(M1) to rutile (R) at its critical temperature (T$_c$) which corresponds to a
change in optical properties: above T$_c$, VO$_2$ films exhibit a decreased
transmittance for wavelengths of light in the near-infrared region. However, a
high transmittance modulation often sacrifices luminous transmittance which is
necessary for commercial and residential applications of this technology. In
this study, we explore the potential for synthesis of VO$_2$ films in a matrix
of metal oxide nanocrystals, using In$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$, and ZnO as diluents.
We seek to optimize the annealing conditions to yield desirable optical
properties. Although the films diluted with TiO$_2$ and ZnO failed to show
transmittance modulation, those diluted with In$_2$O$_3$ exhibited strong
thermochromism. Our investigation introduces a novel window film consisting of
a 0.93 metal ionic molar ratio VO$_2$-In$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystalline matrix,
demonstrating a significant increase in luminous transmittance without any
measurable impact on thermochromic character. Furthermore, solution-processing
mitigates costs, allowing this film to be synthesized 4x-7x cheaper than
industry standards. This study represents a crucial development in film
chemistry and paves the way for further application of VO$_2$ nanocomposite
films in chromogenic fenestration.
