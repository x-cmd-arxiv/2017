molecular systems. It is founded on the observation that the energy scale of
the electron dynamics in a molecule is larger than that of the nuclei. A very
similar physical picture can be used to describe QCD states containing heavy
quarks as well as light-quarks or gluonic excitations. In this work, we derive
the Born--Oppenheimer approximation for QED molecular systems in an effective
field theory framework by sequentially integrating out degrees of freedom
living at energies above the typical energy scale where the dynamics of the
heavy degrees of freedom occurs. In particular, we compute the matching
coefficients of the effective field theory for the case of the $H^+_2$ diatomic
molecule that are relevant to compute its spectrum up to ${\cal O}(m\alpha^5)$.
Ultrasoft photon loops contribute at this order, being ultimately responsible
for the molecular Lamb shift. In the effective field theory the scaling of all
the operators is homogeneous, which facilitates the determination of all the
relevant contributions, an observation that may become useful for
high-precision calculations. Using the above case as a guidance, we construct
under some conditions an effective field theory for QCD states formed by a
color-octet heavy quark-antiquark pair bound with a color-octet light-quark
pair or excited gluonic state, highlighting the similarities and differences
between the QED and QCD systems. Assuming that the multipole expansion is
applicable, we construct the heavy-quark potential up to next-to-leading order
in the multipole expansion in terms of nonperturbative matching coefficients to
be obtained from lattice QCD.

media and investigate all possible anomalous scattering processes due

the scattering processes in near-critical flows are well described by a
linearized Korteweg-de Vries equation. Within our theoretical model greybody
factors are neglected, that is, the mode co-moving with the flow decouples from
the other ones. We also exhibit a flow example with an exact expression for the
effective temperature. We see that this temperature coincides with the Hawking
one only when the dispersive length scale is much smaller than the flow
gradient scale. We apply the same method in inhomogeneous flows without an
analogue horizon. In this case, the spectrum coefficients decrease with
decreasing frequencies. Our findings are in agreement with previous numerical
works, generalizing their findings to arbitrary flow profiles. Our analytical

  Effective Liouville","22 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We point out that the quantum dynamical map of an open quantum system can be
generated by an effective Liouville operator. The effective Liouville shows the
dynamical breaking of time reversibility. This breaking of reversibility is
expressed by the effective Liouville's discrete spectrum having negative
imaginary parts. This generated dynamics of open quantum systems is capable of
memory effects described by a frequency dependence of the spectrum. When memory
effects can be neglected or smoothed out, the effective Liouville generates the
well known semi-group dynamics of open systems in the Markov approximation. The
spectral analysis of the effective Liouville -with or without memory- allows to
represent the quantum dynamical map and expectation values of physical
quantities by metric expressions using complex eigenvalues and bi-orthonormal
eigenmodes. The long time dynamics is dominated by the zero-mode, which forms
the stationary state of the open system. The relaxation time scale $\tau$ is
set by the inverse of the smallest negative imaginary part of the non-vanishing
effective eigenvalues of the effective Liouville. In generic cases of
system-environment-coupling this time scale $\tau$ is the relevant scale for
both, the relaxation of diagonal elements (populations) and the decay of
off-diagonal elements (coherences) of an initial density matrix in the
stationary state's diagonal representation. It also sets the time scale after
which the entropy tends to its stationary value. The effective Liouville and
its spectral content thus give a framework to study the dynamic breaking of
time reversibility, memory effects, decoherence, relaxation to a stationary
state and the role of entropy in open quantum systems.

transmission of uncoded messages or the coded messages of [1] for delivery.
Moreover, a lower bound on the delivery rate of redundant requests is derived
based on a cutset bound argument. The performance of the adaptive method is
investigated through numerical examples of the delivery rate of several
specific demand vectors as well as the average delivery rate of a caching

evidence has accumulated in favor of a quantum spin liquid, the debate is still
open as to whether it is a $Z_2$ spin liquid with very short-range correlations
(some kind of Resonating Valence Bond spin liquid), or an algebraic spin-liquid
with power-law correlations. To address this issue, we have pushed the program
started by Rokhsar and Kivelson in their derivation of the effective quantum
dimer model description of Heisenberg models to unprecedented accuracy for the
spin-1/2 kagome, by including all the most important virtual singlet
contributions on top of the orthogonalization of the nearest-neighbor valence
bond singlet basis. Quite remarkably, the resulting picture is a competition
between a $Z_2$ spin liquid and a diamond valence bond crystal with a 12-site
unit cell, as in the DMRG simulations of Yan, Huse and White. Furthermore, we
found that, on cylinders of finite diameter $d$, there is a transition between
the $Z_2$ spin liquid at small $d$ and the diamond valence bond crystal at
large $d$, the prediction of the present microscopic description for the 2D
lattice. These results show that, if the ground state of the spin-1/2 kagome
antiferromagnet can be described by nearest-neighbor singlet dimers, it is a
diamond valence bond crystal, and, a contrario, that, if the system is a

measure a strong microlensing parallax signal, which yields the masses of the
host star, $M_* = 0.58\pm 0.11 M_\odot$, and planet $m_p = 0.54\pm 0.10 M_{\rm

half-Jupiter mass planet orbiting a half-solar mass star at very roughly half
of Jupiter's orbital distance from the Sun. The source stars are slightly
evolved, and by requiring them to lie on the same isochrone, we can constrain
the source to lie in the near side of the bulge at a distance of $D_S = 6.9 \pm

Analysis (CCA) has been generalised to the non-linear setting via deep neural
networks. Existing deep CCA models typically first decorrelate the feature
dimensions of each view before the different views are maximally correlated in
a common latent space. This feature decorrelation is achieved by enforcing an
exact decorrelation constraint; these models are thus computationally expensive
due to the matrix inversion or SVD operations required for exact decorrelation
at each training iteration. Furthermore, the decorrelation step is often
separated from the gradient descent based optimisation, resulting in
sub-optimal solutions. We propose a novel deep CCA model Soft CCA to overcome
these problems. Specifically, exact decorrelation is replaced by soft
decorrelation via a mini-batch based Stochastic Decorrelation Loss (SDL) to be
optimised jointly with the other training objectives. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed soft CCA is more effective and efficient than existing
deep CCA models. In addition, our SDL loss can be applied to other deep models
beyond multi-view learning, and obtains superior performance compared to

equations with stiff terms, characterized by a (small) scaling parameter. In

Carlo methods suffer of severe time step limitations in these situations, due
to the fact that the characteristic speeds go to infinity in the diffusion

differ by several orders of magnitude in the domain. To circumvent these time
step limitations, we construct a new, asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo method
that is stable independently of the scaling parameter and degenerates to a
standard probabilistic approach for solving the limiting equation in the

modified equation in which the characteristic speeds do not grow indefinitely
when the scaling factor tends to zero. The resulting modified equation can
readily be discretized by a Monte Carlo scheme, in which the particles combine
a finite propagation speed with a time-step dependent diffusion term. We show

typically leads to higher out-of-network cost for patient and increases barrier
for care coordination, which is particularly problematic for Accountable Care
Organization (ACO) as the in-network providers are financially responsible for
patient quality and outcome. We aim to design a data-driven method to identify
naturally occurring provider networks driven by diabetic patient choices, and
understand the relationship among provider composition, patient composition,
and service leakage pattern. We construct a healthcare provider network based
on patients' historical medical insurance claims. A community detection
algorithm is used to identify naturally occurring communities of collaborating
providers. Finally, import-export analysis is conducted to benchmark their
leakage pattern and identify further leakage reduction opportunity. The design
yields six major provider communities with diverse profiles. Some communities
are geographically concentrated, while others tend to draw patients with
certain diabetic co-morbidities. Providers from the same healthcare institution

we identify patient-driven provider organization by surfacing providers who

different conditions of interest by using labeled data during training. For
example, scenarios can be conditioned on weather events~(e.g. high wind day) or

Even if the latter have precise requirements, the quality of individual workers

  When the problem involves only a single skill or type of job, it is
essentially a type of bandit problem, and can be solved with standard
algorithms. However, we develop an algorithm that can perform matching for
workers with multiple skills hired for multiple jobs with multiple

multi-task problems, comparing with the bounded $\epsilon$-first algorithm, as
well as an oracle that knows the true skills of workers. One of the algorithms

propose an algorithm to characterize the stable throughput region numerically,
and show its sheer computational complexity for large queue lengths. To lend
tractability and explore the nature of design parameters optimization at the
cognitive node, we next focus on two simpler systems, namely, finite battery
queue with infinite relay queue and finite relay queue with infinite battery
queue (referred henceforth as dominant system $1$ and $2$, respectively). For
each proposed dominant system, we investigate the maximum service rate of the
cognitive node subject to stability conditions. Despite the complexity of the
formulated optimization problems, due to their non-convexity, we exploit the
problems' structure to transform them into linear programs. Thus, we are able
to solve them efficiently using standard linear programming solvers. Our
numerical results demonstrate that, in practical systems, finite battery and
relay queues achieve the same level of benefits of a system with infinite queue
sizes, when their sizes are sufficiently large. They also reveal that the
achievable stable throughput region significantly expands when the arrival rate

universality described by the power law between the initial value of one

exponent is found to be 1/2, which is independent of the details of the
porosity evolution law. We can regard the dynamic earthquake slip process as a

bits received with small reliability. The retransmissions are used to
accumulate the reliabilities of individual bits. Unlike the conventional
automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes, the proposed scheme does not require a
checksum for the error detection. The bits to be retransmitted are reported as
a combination number, or two synchronized random number generators (RNGs) at
the transmitter and receiver are used to greatly compress the feedback message.
The bitwise retransmission decisions and/or combining can be performed after
the demodulation or after the channel decoding at the receiver. The bit-error
rate (BER) expressions are derived for the case of one and two retransmissions,
and verified by computer simulations. Assuming three specific retransmission
strategies, the scheme parameters are optimized to minimize the overall BER.
For the same number of retransmissions and packet length, the proposed schemes
always outperform the frequently used stop-and-wait ARQ. The impact of feedback
errors is also considered. Finally, practical designs of the bitwise
retransmissions for data fusion from sensor nodes in Zigbee, Wifi and Bluetooth

to a weighted average of their already filled neighbors. However, there is
flexibility in terms of the order in which pixels are filled, the weights used
for averaging, and the neighborhood that is averaged over. Varying these
degrees of freedom leads to different algorithms, and indeed the literature
contains several methods falling into this general class. All of them are very
fast, but at the same time all of them leave undesirable artifacts such as
""kinking"" (bending) or blurring of extrapolated isophotes. Our objective in
this paper is to build a theoretical model, based on a continuum limit and a
connection to stopped random walks, in order to understand why these artifacts
occur and what, if anything, can be done about them. At the same time, we
consider a semi-implicit extension in which pixels in a given shell are solved
for simultaneously by solving a linear system. We prove (within the continuum
limit) that this extension is able to completely eliminate kinking artifacts,
which we also prove must always be present in the direct method. Although our
analysis makes the strong assumption of a square inpainting domain, it makes
weak smoothness assumptions and is thus applicable to the low regularity
inherent in images.

civil applications such as surveying, building monitoring, and infrastructure
condition assessment. Quadcopters, however, are relatively sensitive to noises
and disturbances so that their performance may be quickly downgraded in the
case of inadequate control, system uncertainties and/or external disturbances.
In this study, we deal with the quadrotor low-level control by proposing a
robust scheme named the adaptive second-order quasi-continuous sliding mode
control (adaptive 2-QCSM). The ultimate objective is for robust attitude
control of the UAV in monitoring and inspection of built infrastructure. First,
the mathematical model of the quadcopter is derived considering nonlinearity,
strong coupling, uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. The control
design includes the selection of the sliding manifold and the development of
quasi-continuous second-order sliding mode controller with an adaptive gain.
Stability of the overall control system is analysed by using a global Lyapunov
function for convergence of both the sliding dynamics and adaptation scheme.
Extensive simulations have been carried out for evaluation. Results show that
the proposed controller can achieve robustness against disturbances or
parameter variations and has better tracking performance in comparison with
experimental responses of a UAV in a real-time monitoring task.

overall packet loss, where the E2E delay includes queueing delay and
transmission delay, and the overall packet loss consists of queueing delay

proactive packet dropping in deep fading. Transmit power, bandwidth and number

enable to design communication systems which operate within the regions close
to the theoretical capacity limits. Ever-increasing demand for wireless
communications and emerging numerous high-capacity services, data rates and
applications mandate providers to employ more bandwidth-oriented solutions to
meet the requirements. It is clear that such rates could only be achieved by
employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the- art technology. Considering the
fact that bands in the range of 275GHz-3000GHz, which are known as Terahertz
(THz) bands, are not allocated yet for specific active services around the
globe, there is an enormous potential to achieve the desired data rates.
Although THz bands look promising to achieve data rates on the order of several
tens of Gbps, realization of fully operational THz communications systems
obliges to carry out a multi- disciplinary effort including statistical
propagation and channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs,
reconfigurable platforms, advanced signal processing algorithms and techniques
along with upper layer protocols equipped with various security and privacy
levels. Therefore, in this study, several important statistical parameters for
line-of-sight (LOS) channels are measured. High resolution frequency domain
measurements are carried out at single-sweep within a span of 60GHz. Impact of
antenna misalignment under LOS conditions is also investigated. By validating
exponential decay of the received power in both time and frequency domain, path
loss exponent is examined for different frequencies along with the
frequency-dependent path loss phenomenon. Furthermore, impact of humidity is
also tested under LOS scenario. Measurement results are presented along with
relevant discussions and future directions are provided as well.

examples show that steady-state upscaling is rate dependent, in accordance with
previous work. In this respect we introduce a scale-dependent capillary number
to estimate the balance between viscous and capillary forces. The difference
between the limit solutions can be large, and we show that the intermediate
flow rates can span several orders of magnitude. This substantiate the need for
rate-dependent steady-state upscaling in a range of flow scenarios. We
demonstrate that steady-state upscaling converges from the capillary to the
viscous limit solution as the flow rate increases, and we identify a simple
synthetic model where the convergence fails to be monotone. Two different sets

upscaling by performing dynamic flow simulation at the reservoir scale, both on

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a coded cache content placement where
coded chunks of original files are stored in servers based on the files
popularity distribution. In our scheme, upon each request arrival at the
delivery phase, by dispatching enough coded chunks to the request origin from
the nearest servers, the requested file can be decoded.
  Here, we show that if $n$ requests arrive randomly at $n$ servers, the
proposed scheme results in the maximum load of $O(1)$ in the network. This
result is shown to be valid under various assumptions for the underlying
network topology. Our results should be compared to the maximum load of two
baseline schemes, namely, nearest replica and power of two choices strategies,
which are $\Theta(\log n)$ and $\Theta(\log \log n)$, respectively. This
finding shows that using coding, results in a considerable load balancing
performance improvement, without compromising communications cost performance.
This is confirmed by performing extensive simulation results, in non-asymptotic

addressed: What can be said about the growth of the coefficient $A$ if all

fast outward-moving arch-like structures above the disk midplane. No model can
readily explain the characteristics of these features. We present a model
aiming to reproduce the dynamics of these structures, more specifically their
high projected speeds and their apparent position. We test the hypothesis of
dust emitted by a point source and then expelled from the system by the strong
stellar wind of this young, M-type star. In this model, we make the assumption
that the dust grains follow the same dynamics as the structures. We perform
numerical simulations of test particle trajectories to explore the available
parameter space, in particular the radial location $R_{0}$ of the dust
producing parent body and the size of the dust grains as parameterized by
$\beta$ (ratio of stellar wind and radiation pressure forces over gravitation).
We consider both the case of a static and an orbiting parent body. We find
that, for all considered scenarii, there is always a set of ($R_0, \beta$)
parameters able to fit the observed features. The common characteristics of
these solutions is that they all require a high value of $\beta$, of around 6.
This means that the star is probably very active and the grains composing the
structures are sub-micronic, in order to reach such high $\beta$ values. As for
the location of the hypothetical parent body, we constrain it to lie around 8
au (orbiting case) or 28 au (static case). We show that the scenario of
sequential dust releases by an unseen, punctual parent body is able to explain
the radial behaviour of the observed structures. We predict the evolution of
the structures to help future observations to discriminate between the
different parent body configurations that have been considered. We expect new
structures to appear on the northwest side of the disk in the coming years.

Differential Algebra (J.F. Ritt, 1950 and E. Kolchin, 1973) and Algebraic
Analysis (M. Kashiwara, 1970). Identifying the differential indeterminates of
Ritt and Kolchin with the jet coordinates of Spencer, the idea is to study
Differential Duality by using only linear differential operators with
coefficients in a differential field. In particular, the linearized second
order Einstein equations are parametrizing the first order Cauchy stress
equations but cannot themselves be parametrized. In the framework of
Homological Algebra, this result is not coherent with the vanishing of certain
first and second extension modules. As a byproduct, we shall prove that
gravitation and electromagnetism must only depend on the second order jets

these new methods in order to study contact transformations in arbitrary odd

at large $D$. By using the $1/D$ expansion in the near horizon region we derive
the effective equations that describe the dynamics of the EGB black strings.
The uniform and non-uniform black strings are obtained as the static solutions
of the effective equations. From the perturbation analysis of the effective
equations, we find that thin EGB black strings suffer from the Gregory-Laflamme
instablity and the GB term weakens the instability when the GB coefficient is
small, however, when the GB coefficient is large the GB term enhances the
instability. Furthermore, we numerically solve the effective equations to study
the non-linear instability. It turns out that the thin black strings are
unstable to developing inhomogeneities along their length, and at late times
they asymptote to the stable non-uniform black strings. The behavior is
qualitatively similar to the case in the Einstein gravity. Compared with the
black string instability in the Einstein gravity at large D, when the GB
coefficient is small the time needed to reach to final state increases, but
when the GB coefficient is large the time to reach to final state decreases.
Starting from the point of view in which the effective equations can be
interpreted as the equations for the dynamical fluid, we evaluate the transport
coefficients and find that the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy
density agrees with that obtained previously in the membrane paradigm after
taking the large $D$ limit.

its detection based on the quadrature arm of the coherent Early-minus-Late

EmL) and/or in-phase arm (I EmL) for a vector tracking loop (VTL), using an
observation window of N samples. Performance analysis of the suggested
detectors is done on multipath signal data acquired from the multipath
environment simulator developed by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) as well as
on multipath data from real GPS signals. Application of the detection tests to
correlator outputs of scalar and vector tracking loops shows that they may be
used to exclude multipath contaminated satellites from the navigation solution.
These detection techniques can be extended to other Global Navigation Satellite

first revisit the well-known Lifshitz-Slyozov model, which takes into account
only polymerization and depolymerization, and we show that, when nucleation is
included, the system goes to a trivial equilibrium: all polymers fragmentize,
going back to very small polymers. Taking into account only polymerization and
fragmentation, modeled by the classical growth-fragmentation equation, also
leads the system to the same trivial equilibrium, whether or not nucleation is
considered. However, also taking into account a depolymer-ization reaction term
may surprisingly stabilize the system, since a steady size-distribution of
polymers may then emerge, as soon as polymeriza-tion dominates depolymerization
for large sizes whereas depolymerization dominates polymerization for smaller
ones-a case which fits the classical assumptions for the Lifshitz-Slyozov
equations, but complemented with fragmentation so that "" Ostwald ripening ""

First, we employ the two-photon polymerization method to fabricate the

finite number of elements, thus providing a unique tool to define the exact
number of scattering elements in the structure by a naked eye. Then, we study
theoretically the transmission spectra of both honeycomb single layer and 2D
structures of parallel dielectric circular rods. When the dielectric constant
of the rod materials $\varepsilon$ is increasing, we reveal that a
two-dimensional photonic graphene structure transforms into a metamaterial when
the lowest TE${}_{01}$ Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap. We also
observe two Dirac points in the band structure of 2D photonic graphene at the
$K$ point of the Brillouin zone and demonstrate a manifestation of the Dirac
lensing for the TM polarization. The performance of the Dirac lens is that the
2D photonic graphene layer converts a wave from point source into a beam with
flat phase surfaces at the Dirac frequency for the TM polarization.

resistivity and condense into the superfluid. However, the origin of the
linear-$T$ resistivity behavior and its relationship to the strongly correlated
superconductivity remain a mystery. Here we report a universal relation
$d\rho/dT=(\mu_0k_B/\hbar)\lambda^2_L$, which bridges the slope of the

significant differences in the strength of electronic correlations, transport

in strongly correlated superconductors could be described as a hydrodynamic
diffusive transport, with the diffusion coefficient ($D$) approaching the

determine the maximal flux contribution by DM annihilation to both the M31
gamma-ray spectrum and that of the Milky-Way galactic centre. We limit the
energy range between 1 and 12 GeV in M31 and galactic centre spectra due to the
limited range of former's data, as well as to encompass the high-energy
gamma-ray excess observed in the latter target. In so doing, we will make use
of Fermi-LAT data for all mentioned targets, as well as diffuse radio data for
the Coma cluster. The multi-target strategy using both Coma and Reticulum II to
derive cross-section limits, as well as multi-frequency data, ensures that our
results are robust against the various uncertainties inherent in modelling of
indirect DM emissions.
  Our results indicate that, when a Navarro-Frenk-White (or shallower) radial
density profile is assumed, severe constraints can be imposed upon the fraction
of the M31 and galactic centre spectra that can be accounted for by DM, with
the best limits arising from cross-section constraints from Coma radio data and
Reticulum II gamma-ray limits. These particular limits force all the studied
annihilation channels to contribute 1% or less to the total integrated
gamma-ray flux within both M31 and galactic centre targets. In contrast,
considerably more, 10-100%, of the flux can be attributed to DM when a
contracted Navarro-Frenk-White profile is assumed. This demonstrates how
sensitive DM contributions to gamma-ray emissions are to the possibility of
cored profiles in galaxies.

052320 (2015)], the generality of the concatenated five-qubit code has been
investgated when noises of the principal system and the auxiliary environment
are assumed to be the same. In the error correction with concatenated code,
tiny differences (in fidelity or independent errors) between initial quantum
channels may introduce different effective channels in the next level, and
therefore, it is necessary to study a meaningful question: Does five-qubit code
still work efficiently when errors on different qubits are different? In the
present work, it is discovered that even errors for different qubits are
arbitrary, the five-qubit code still works efficiently. Since it is much easier
and more accurate to measure the fidelity, one can construct quantum error
correction with five-qubit code according to the initial channel fidelity, and
it is not necessary to know the complete information of the initial channel.
Moreover, when the initial channel fidelity is below $0.992$, the fidelity
threshold for five-qubit code is the fidelity of the effective channel after
error correction in bit-flip channels.

the physical interpretation of the M-distribution allows to split the optical

reciprocity is general, fundamental, and is operant for other physical systems
like electromagnetics, acoustics, and optics, there is significant interest in
understanding systems that are not reciprocal, or exhibit non-reciprocity.
However, most studies of non-reciprocity have occurred in bulk-scale structures
for dynamic problems involving time reversal symmetry. As a result, little is
known about the mechanisms governing static non-reciprocal responses,
particularly in atomically-thin two-dimensional materials like graphene. Here,
we use classical atomistic simulations to demonstrate that out of plane
ripples, which are intrinsic to graphene, enable significant, multiple orders
of magnitude enhancements in the statically non-reciprocal response of graphene
metamaterials. Specifically, we find that a striking interplay between the
ripples and the stress fields that are induced in the metamaterials due to
their geometry impact the displacements that are transmitted by the
metamaterial, thus leading to a significantly enhanced static non-reciprocal
response. This study thus demonstrates the potential of two-dimensional

large computational costs. Motivated by this, we propose matrix exponential
approximation of holding times, resulting in pseudo-MJLSPOM representation,
i.e., where the transition rates could be negative. Such a representation is of
relatively low order, and maintains the same optimality conditions as for the
MJLSPOM representation, but could violate non-negativity of holding-time
density functions. A two-step procedure consisting of a local pulling-up
modification and a filtering technique is constructed to enforce
non-negativity.

an open problem as the phenomenon can be reproduced using models based on
Markov processes. In these cases a notion of spurious memory is introduced. A
good example of Markov processes with spurious memory is stochastic process
driven by a non-linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). This example is
at odds with models built using fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We analyze
differences between these two cases seeking to establish possible empirical
tests of the origin of the observed long-range memory. We investigate
probability density functions (PDFs) of burst and inter-burst duration in
numerically obtained time series and compare with the results of fBm. Our
analysis confirms that the characteristic feature of the processes described by
a one-dimensional SDE is the power-law exponent $3/2$ of the burst or
inter-burst duration PDF. This property of stochastic processes might be used
to detect spurious memory in various non-equilibrium systems, where observed
macroscopic behavior can be derived from the imitative interactions of agents.

activities (sleeping, working and eating) are systematically contrasted against
light/dark conditions related to latitude.
  The analysis reveals that winter sunrise is a synchronizer for labor start
time below 54{\deg} where they occur within the winter civil twilight region.
Winter sunset is a source of synchronization for labor end times.
  Winter terminator also punctuate meal times in Europe with dinner times
occurring 3h after winter sunset time within a strip of 1h, which is 40%
narrower than variability of dinner local times.
  The sleep-wake cycle of laborers in a weekday is shown to be related to
winter sunrise whereas standard population's cycle appears to be irrespective
of latitude.
  The significance of the winter terminator depends on two competing factors
average daily labor time (some 7h30m) and winter daytime ---the shortest
photoperiod---. Winter terminator gains significance when shortest photoperiod
roughly matches to daily labor time plus a reasonable lunch break. That is
within a latitude range from 38{\deg} to 54{\deg}.
  The significance of winter terminator as a source of synchronization is also
related to contemporary year round time schedules: the shortest photoperiod
represents the worst case scenario the society faces.
  Average daily sleep times show little trend with the shortest photoperiod
slope 5min/h for a Pearson coefficient $r^2=0.242$. Average labor time may have
a weak coupling with the shortest photoperiod: slope 29min/h for $r^2=0.338$.

flexibility allows us to test a wide range of different analytical
prescriptions for the dust attenuation curve, including the well-known Calzetti

curves computed under the assumption of our reference double power-law model
are in very good agreement with those derived, in previous works, with
radiative transfer (RT) SED fitting. We investigate the position of our
galaxies in the IRX-$\beta$ diagram and find this to be consistent with grayer
slopes, on average, in the UV. We also find evidence for a flattening of the
attenuation curve in the NIR with respect to more classical Calzetti-like
recipes. This larger NIR attenuation yields larger derived stellar masses from
SED fitting, by a median factor of $\sim$ 1.4 and up to a factor $\sim$10 for
the most extreme cases. The star formation rate appears instead to be more
dependent on the total amount of attenuation in the galaxy. Our analysis
highlights the need for a flexible attenuation curve when reproducing the

based on the Hi self-absorption method, which leads to a physical radius of
29.0 pc for the ~(0.7-2.0)x10e5 years old remnant with an expansion velocity of

conductivity is smaller and its dependence on magnetic field is weaker. Finally

equations which depend on one Bond number $Bo$ are derived for a liquid film
flow down the outside of a horizontal cylinder and a sphere. They can be
simplified to one-dimensional form due to the symmetries. The general structure
of the two-dimensional and axisymmetric capillary waves under high $Bo$
condition is focused on. An asymptotic theory is used to solve for the
free-surface profiles in the outer and inner region, respectively. Even though
the evolution in the outer region is essentially different, there are inherent
similarities in the inner region because the capillary ridges are proved to
degenerate into the one-parameter family in high $Bo$ limit. Using appropriate
numerical techniques, some parametric studies are performed on the profiles of
the capillary waves. The spreading of the front recorded from the outer
solutions quantitatively accords with the scaling laws in a top region at early
time, but deviates obviously at later time. The comparison between the
composite solutions constructed using the asymptotic theory and direct
solutions calculated from the evolution equations is highlighted via both the
global and local features. Agreement between the composite solutions and the
direct solutions is good for high $Bo$ cases. This asymptotic behavior is
common on both of cylindrical and spherical surfaces and not affected by the
partial wetting process.

appropriate for a low-energy description of the rare-earth nickelate
LuNiO$_{3}$ involving the partially occupied $e_g$ states only. The calculation
uses the constrained random-phase approximation and reveals that the effective
on-site Coulomb repulsion is strongly reduced by screening effects involving
the oxygen-$p$ and nickel-$t_{2g}$ states. The long-range component of the
effective low-energy interaction is also found to be sizeable. As a result, the
effective on-site interaction between parallel-spin electrons is reduced down
to a small negative value. This validates effective low-energy theories of
these materials proposed earlier. Electronic structure methods combined with
dynamical mean-field theory are used to construct and solve an appropriate
low-energy model and explore its phase diagram as a function of the on-site
repulsion and Hund's coupling. For the calculated values of these effective
interactions we find, in agreement with experiments, that LuNiO$_{3}$ is a
metal without disproportionation of the $e_g$ occupancy when considered in its
orthorhombic structure, while the monoclinic phase is a disproportionated
insulator.

time evolution arises as an effective description of the interaction of the
measured system with the measuring device. The dynamics we present is a
two-step dynamics: the first step is the non-selective measurement or
decoherence, which is known to be described by the linear, deterministic
Lindblad equation. The second step is a process from the resulted decohered
state to a pure state, which is described by an effective non-linear `randomly

Eddington value due to appearance of accretion columns. The height of the
columns can be comparable to the neutron star radius. The columns produce the
X-rays detected by the observer directly and illuminate the stellar surface,
which reprocesses the X-rays and causes additional component of the observed
flux. The geometry of the column and the illuminated part of the surface
determines the radiation beaming. Curved space-time affects the angular flux
distribution. We construct a simple model of the beam patterns formed by direct
and reflected flux from the column. We take into account the possibility of
appearance of accretion columns, whose height is comparable to the neutron star
radius. We argue that depending on the compactness of the star the flux from
the column can be either strongly amplified due to gravitational lensing, or
significantly reduced due to column eclipse by the star. The eclipses of high
accretion columns result in specific features in pulse profiles. Their
detection can put constraints on the neutron star radius. We speculate that
column eclipses are observed in X-ray pulsar V 0332+53, leading us to the
conclusion of large neutron star radius in this system ($\sim15\,{\rm km}$ if
$M\sim 1.4M_\odot$). We point out that the beam pattern can be strongly
affected by scattering in the accretion channel at high luminosity, which has
to be taken into account in the models reproducing the pulse profiles.

have been many experimental and theoretical investigations for the spin
detection based on the use of probe spins. A probe spin shows the precession
due to dipole-dipole interaction from a target spin, and measurement results of
the probe spin allow us to estimate the state of the target spin. Here, we
investigate performance of single-spin detection when using an ensemble of
probe spins. Even though the ensemble of probe spins inevitably induces
projection noise that could hinder the signal from the target spin,
optimization of the configuration of the spin ensemble improves the sensitivity
such that enhancement of the signal can be much larger than the projection
noise. The probe-spin ensemble is especially useful at a large distance from
the target spin, where it is difficult for a single spin to read out the target
spin within a reasonable repetition time. Our results pave the way for a new
strategy to realize efficient single-spin detections.

information-theoretic framework to address these questions and show that every
symmetric quantum process on a system has a highly rigid decomposition in terms
of the flow of symmetry-breaking degrees of freedom between each subsystem and
its environment. The decomposition has a natural causal structure that can be
represented diagrammatically and makes explicit gauge degrees of freedom
between subsystems. The framework also provides a novel quantum information
perspective on lattice gauge theories and a method to gauge general quantum
processes beyond Lagrangian formulations. This procedure admits a simple
resource-theoretic interpretation, and thus offers a natural context in which
features such as information flow and entanglement in gauge theories and
quantum thermodynamics could be studied. The framework also provides a flexible
toolkit with which to analyse the structure of general quantum processes. As an
application, we make use of a `polar decomposition' for quantum processes to
discuss the repeatable use of quantum resources and to provide a novel
perspective in terms of the coordinates induced on the orbit of a local process

simultaneous analyses of the temporal evolution in several chromospheric
stellar lines, namely, the Ca II H and K lines, Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta,
Hepsilon, the Ca II infrared triplet line, and He I D3. Observations were
carried out with a time resolution of approximately 1 min for a duration of
four hours, including a complete planetary transit. We determine the energy
released during the flare in all studied chromospheric lines combined to be
about 8.7e31 erg, which puts this event at the upper end of flare energies
observed on the Sun. Our analysis does not reveal any significant delay of the
flare peak observed in the Balmer and Ca II H and K lines, although we find a
clear difference in the temporal evolution of these lines. The He I D3 shows
additional absorption possibly related to the flare event. Based on the flux
released in Ca II H and K lines during the flare, we estimate the soft X-ray
flux emission to be 7e30 erg. The observed flare can be ranked as a moderate
flare on a K-type star and confirms a rather high activity level of HD 189733
host star. The cores of the studied chromospheric lines demonstrate the same
behavior and let us study the flare evolution. We demonstrate that the activity
of an exoplanet host star can play an important role in the detection of
exoplanet atmospheres, since these are frequently discovered as an additional
absorption in the line cores. A possible star-planet interaction responsible
for a flare occurrence during a transit can neither be confirmed nor ruled out.

carry out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of simple bead-spring
stars and neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy experiments on center labeled
polyethylene stars. This labeling scheme unique to neutron scattering allows us
to directly observe the branch point motion on the molecular scale by measuring
the dynamic structure factor. We investigate the cases of different
functionalities f = 3, 4 and 5 for different arm lengths. The analysis of the
branch point fluctuations reveals a stronger localization with increasing
functionality, following 2/f-scaling. The dynamic structure factors of the
branch point are analyzed in terms of a modified version, incorporating dynamic
tube dilution (DTD), of the Vilgis-Boue model for cross-linked networks [J.
Polym. Sci. B 1988, 26, 2291-2302]. In DTD the tube parameters are renormalized
with the tube survival probability \phi(t). As directly measured by the
simulations, \phi(t) is independent of f and therefore the theory predicts no
f-dependence of the relaxation of the branch point. The theory provides a good
description of the NSE data and simulations for intermediate times. However,
the simulations, which have access to much longer time scales, reveal the
breakdown of the DTD prediction since increasing the functionality actually
leads to a slower relaxation of the branch point.

luminosity problem: most protostars are less luminous than theoretically
predicted. One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU
Ori-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in
the high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes,
which replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion
outbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics
in FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk
happens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V346 Nor at
1.3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density
and velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel
maps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found
that V346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a
prominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central $\sim$700 au, the
circumstellar matter forms a flattened pseudo-disk where material is infalling
with conserved angular momentum. Within $\sim$350 au, the velocity profile is
more consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 0.1
$M_{\odot}$. We determined an infall rate from the envelope onto the disk of
6$\times$10$^{-6}\,M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, a factor of few higher than the
quiescent accretion rate from the disk onto the star, hinting for a mismatch
between the infall and accretion rates as the cause of the eruption.

terms. In the paper, to show how the renormalization scheme dependence changes
when more loop terms have been included, we discuss the sensitivity of pQCD
prediction on the scheme parameters by using the scheme-dependent $\{\beta_{m
\geq 2}\}$-terms. We adopt two four-loop examples, $e^+ e^- \to {\rm hadrons}$
and $\tau$ decays into hadrons, for detailed analysis. Our results show that
under the conventional scale setting, by including more-and-more loop terms,
the scheme dependence of the pQCD prediction cannot be reduced as efficiently
as that of the scale dependence. Thus a proper scale-setting approach should be
important to reduce the scheme dependence. We observe that the principle of
minimum sensitivity could be such a scale-setting approach, which provides a
practical way to achieve optimal scheme and scale by requiring the pQCD
approximate be independent to the ""unphysical"" theoretical conventions.

physical properties that black phosphorus (BP) offers and could be feasibly
synthesized by simple solution-based methods. It is comprised of non-covalently
bound parallel Te chains, among which covalent-like feature appears. This
feature is, we believe, another demonstration of the previously found
covalent-like quasi-bonding (CLQB) where wavefunction hybridization does occur.
The strength of this inter-chain CLQB is comparable with that of intra-chain
covalent bonding, leading to closed stability of several Te allotropes. It also
introduces a tunable bandgap varying from nearly direct 0.31 eV (bulk) to
indirect 1.17 eV (2L) and four (two) complex, highly anisotropic and
layer-dependent hole (electron) pockets in the first Brillouin zone. It also
exhibits an extraordinarily high hole mobility (~10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs) and strong
optical absorption along the non-covalently bound direction, nearly isotropic
and layer-dependent optical properties, large ideal strength over 20%, better
environmental stability than BP and unusual crossover of force constants for
interlayer shear and breathing modes. All these results manifest that the
few-layer Te is an extraordinary-high-mobility, high optical absorption,
intrinsic-anisotropy, low-cost-fabrication, tunable bandgap, better
environmental stability and nearly direct bandgap semiconductor. This
""one-dimension-like"" few-layer Te, together with other geometrically similar
layered materials, may promote the emergence of a new family of layered

  adaptation",,,,,"cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings work well only
under a common assumption that the labeled training data (source domain) and
unlabeled testing data (target domain) are drawn from the same distribution.
When the distribution changes, most fault diagnosis models need to be rebuilt
from scratch using newly recollected labeled training data. However, it is
expensive or impossible to annotate huge amount of training data to rebuild
such new model. Meanwhile, large amounts of labeled training data have not been
fully utilized yet, which is apparently a waste of resources. As one of the
important research directions of transfer learning, domain adaptation (DA)
typically aims at minimizing the differences between distributions of different
domains in order to minimize the cross-domain prediction error by taking full
advantage of information coming from both source and target domains. In this
paper, we present one of the first studies on unsupervised DA in the field of
fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under varying working conditions and a
novel diagnosis strategy based on unsupervised DA using subspace alignment (SA)
is proposed. After processed by unsupervised DA with SA, the distributions of
training data and testing data become close and the classifier trained on
training data can be used to classify the testing data. Experimental results on
the 60 domain adaptation diagnosis problems under varying working condition in
Case Western Reserve benchmark data and 12 domain adaptation diagnosis problems
under varying working conditions in our new data are given to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed methods can effectively
distinguish not only bearing faults categories but also fault severities.

determine the cosmic-ray reconstruction efficiency in MicroBooNE. Data are
acquired with this external muon counter stack placed in three different
positions, corresponding to cosmic rays intersecting different parts of the
detector. The data reconstruction efficiency of tracks in the detector is found
to be $\epsilon_{\mathrm{data}}=(97.1\pm0.1~(\mathrm{stat}) \pm
1.4~(\mathrm{sys}))\%$, in good agreement with the Monte Carlo reconstruction
efficiency $\epsilon_{\mathrm{MC}} = (97.4\pm0.1)\%$. This analysis represents
a small-scale demonstration of the method that can be used with future data
coming from a recently installed cosmic-ray tagger system, which will be able
to tag $\approx80\%$ of the cosmic rays passing through the MicroBooNE
detector.

cost and fast query speed. By using supervised information, supervised hashing
can significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently, discrete
supervised hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in
supervised hashing. On one hand, hashing is essentially a discrete optimization
problem. Hence, utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete
(binary) coding procedure can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the
accuracy. On the other hand, deep hashing, which integrates deep feature
learning and hash-code learning into an end-to-end architecture, can enhance
the feedback between feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in
discrete supervised hashing is to adopt supervised information to directly
guide the discrete coding procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to
adopt the supervised information to directly guide the deep feature learning
procedure. However, there have not existed works which can use the supervised
information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature
learning procedure in the same framework. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep hashing method, called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH), to address
this problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize
supervised information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and
deep feature learning procedure, and thus enhance the feedback between these
two important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can
outperform other state-of-the-art baselines, including both discrete hashing
and deep hashing baselines, for image retrieval.

surveyed the area. We compute 3d fields of finite--size Lyapunov exponents

spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the Lagrangian Coherent

curtain-like LCSs delimit the boundaries of the whole filamentary structure
whose general properties match well the observations. The filament interior is
characterized by small dispersion of fluid elements. Furthermore, we identify a
weak LCS separating the filament into a warmer vein and a colder filament
associated with the interaction of a mesoscale eddy with the upwelling front.
The cold upwelled water parcels move along the filament conserving their
density. The filament itself is characterized by small dispersion of fluid
elements in its interior. The comparison of LCSs with potential temperature and
salinity gradient fields shows that the outer limits of the filament coincide
with regions of large hydrographic gradients, similar to those observed,
explaining the isolation of the interior of the filament with the surrounding
waters. We conclude that the Lagrangian analysis used in this work is useful in
explaining the dynamics of cross-shore exchanges of materials between coastal

formulation combines the advantages of a conformal and traceless formulation,
with the suppression of constraint violations given by the damping terms, but
being first order in time and space, it is particularly suited for a
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) implementation. The strongly hyperbolic first-order
formulation has been obtained by making careful use of first and second-order
ordering constraints. A proof of strong hyperbolicity is given for a selected
choice of standard gauges via an analytical computation of the entire
eigenstructure of the FO-CCZ4 system. The resulting governing partial
differential equations system is written in non-conservative form and requires
the evolution of 58 unknowns. A key feature of our formulation is that the
first-order CCZ4 system decouples into a set of pure ordinary differential
equations and a reduced hyperbolic system of partial differential equations
that contains only linearly degenerate fields. We implement FO-CCZ4 in a
high-order path-conservative arbitrary-high-order-method-using-derivatives

resulting transverse traceless modes by $h_{ab}^{\TT}$. However, while
discussing gravitational waves emitted by an isolated system --typically in a
later section-- the relevant modes are extracted using a `projection operator'
that is local in physical space. These modes are also called
transverse-traceless and again labeled $h_{ab}^{\TT}$, implying that this is
just a reformulation of the previous notion. But the two notions are
conceptually distinct and the difference persists even in the asymptotic
region. We show that this confusion arises already in Maxwell theory that is

of approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement by introducing
more middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n
stages for the RK method, which is very time and memory consuming for a high
order method. On the other hand, the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method
can be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy using less middle
stages, once the time derivatives of the flux function is used.The gas kinetic
scheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the
second-order or third-order GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a
family of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed. As an extension of
the previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages
will be developed in this paper. Based on the same 5th-order WENO
reconstruction, the performance of gas kinetic schemes from the 2nd- to the

5th-order scheme can achieve the theoretical order of accuracy for the Euler

coupling of inviscid and viscous terms in the GKS formulation. In comparison
with Riemann solver based 5th-order RK method, the high order GKS has
advantages in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, for all test
cases. It provides a promising direction for the development of high-order CFD

superfluid order parameter tensor is characterized by six independent
components with explicit momentum dependence induced by color-orbit coupling.
The nodal superfluid phases are topological in nature, and the low temperature
phase diagram of color-flip field versus interaction parameter exhibits a
pentacritical point, where all five nodal color superfluid phases converge.
These results are in sharp contrast to the case of zero color-flip and
color-orbit fields, where the system has perfect U(3) symmetry and possess a
superfluid phase that is characterized by fully gapped quasiparticle
excitations with a single complex order parameter with no momentum dependence
and by inert unpaired fermions representing a non-superfluid component.
Furthermore, we analyse the order parameter tensor in a total pseudo-spin
basis, investigate its momentum dependence in the singlet, triplet and quintet
sectors, and compare the results with the simpler case of spin-1/2 fermions in

sudden increase in the spectral peak reaching a few MeV. Such a dramatic change
in the spectral evolution in case of a single pulse burst is reported for the

explore the extent to which dark matter halos in this model, and under what

analytically explore the lensing properties of the model -- finding that a pure
WaveDM density profile, a soliton profile, produces a weaker lensing effect
than other similar cored profiles. Then we analyze models with a soliton
embedded in an NFW profile, as has been found in numerical simulations of
structure formation. We use a benchmark model with a boson mass of
$m_a=10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, for which we see that there is a bi-modality in the
contribution of the external NFW part of the profile, and actually some of the
free parameters associated with it are not well constrained. We find that for
configurations with boson masses $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, a range of
masses preferred by dwarf galaxy kinematics, the soliton profile alone can fit
the data but its size is incompatible with the luminous extent of the lens
galaxies. Likewise, boson masses of the order of $10^{-21}{\rm eV}$, which
would be consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints and consist of more compact
soliton configurations, necessarily require the NFW part in order to reproduce
the observed Einstein radii. We then conclude that lens systems impose a
conservative lower bound $m_a > 10^{-24}$ and that the NFW envelope around the
soliton must be present to satisfy the observational requirements.

high-resolution recording of animal trajectories, sometimes coupled with the
identification of stereotyped changes of body pose or other behaviors of
interest. Analysis and interpretation of such data represents a challenge: the
timing of animal behaviors may be stochastic and modulated by kinematic
variables, by the interaction with the environment or with the conspecifics
within the animal group, and dependent on internal cognitive or behavioral
state of the individual. Existing models for collective motion typically fail
to incorporate the discrete, stochastic, and internal-state-dependent aspects
of behavior, while models focusing on individual animal behavior typically
ignore the spatial aspects of the problem. Here we propose a probabilistic
modeling framework to address this gap. Each animal can switch stochastically
between different behavioral states, with each state resulting in a possibly
different law of motion through space. Switching rates for behavioral
transitions can depend in a very general way, which we seek to identify from
data, on the effects of the environment as well as the interaction between the
animals. We represent the switching dynamics as a Generalized Linear Model and
show that: (i) forward simulation of multiple interacting animals is possible
using a variant of the Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm; (ii)
formulated properly, the maximum likelihood inference of switching rate
functions is tractably solvable by gradient descent; (iii) model selection can
be used to identify factors that modulate behavioral state switching and to
appropriately adjust model complexity to data. To illustrate our framework, we
apply it to two synthetic models of animal motion and to real zebrafish
tracking data.

Quantitative analysis of fetal brain development requires automatic brain
tissue segmentation that is typically preceded by segmentation of the
intracranial volume (ICV). This is challenging because fetal MR images
visualize the whole moving fetus and in addition partially visualize the
maternal body. This paper presents an automatic method for segmentation of the
ICV in fetal MR images. The method employs a multi-scale convolutional neural
network in 2D slices to enable learning spatial information from larger context
as well as detailed local information. The method is developed and evaluated
with 30 fetal T2-weighted MRI scans (average age $33.2\pm1.2$ weeks
postmenstrual age). The set contains $10$ scans acquired in axial, $10$ in
coronal and $10$ in sagittal imaging planes. A reference standard was defined
in all images by manual annotation of the intracranial volume in $10$
equidistantly distributed slices. The automatic analysis was performed by
training and testing the network using scans acquired in the representative
imaging plane as well as combining the training data from all imaging planes.
On average, the automatic method achieved Dice coefficients of 0.90 for the
axial images, 0.90 for the coronal images and 0.92 for the sagittal images.
Combining the training sets resulted in average Dice coefficients of 0.91 for
the axial images, 0.95 for the coronal images, and 0.92 for the sagittal
images. The results demonstrate that the evaluated method achieved good
performance in extracting ICV in fetal MR scans regardless of the imaging

distribution of time averages in deterministic Anosov C-systems. On the one
hand, in probability theory, our interest dwells on three basic topics: the
laws of large numbers, the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated
logarithm for sequences of real-valued random variables. On the other hand we
have chaotic, uniformly hyperbolic Anosov C-systems defined on tori which have
mixing of all orders and nonzero Kolmogorov entropy. These extraordinary
ergodic properties of deterministic Anosov C-systems ensure that the above
classical limit theorems for sums of independent random variables in
probability theory are fulfilled by the time averages for the sequences
generated by the C-systems. The MIXMAX generator of pseudorandom numbers
represents the C-system for which the classical limit theorems are fulfilled.

  polystyrene particles","14 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Here we present an experimental observation of the self-organization effect
of the polystyrene particles formed by acoustically-induced interaction forces.
Two types of stable configurations are observed experimentally: one is
mechanically equilibrium and featured by nonzero inter-particle separations,
and the other corresponds to a close-packed assembly, which is formed by strong
attractions among the aggregated particles. For the former case involving two
or three particles, the most probable inter-particle separations (counted for
numerous independent initial arrangements) agree well with the theoretical
predictions. For the latter case, the number of the final stable configurations
grows with the particle number, and the occurrence probability of each
configuration is interpreted by a simple geometric model.

the mechanical response spectra of a phase-sensitive degenerate parametric

coherent amplication, reaching a Q factor of ~ 3*10^8 and a f*Q product of ~
8*10^14 at room temperature. The thermomechanical noise squeezing close to -3
dB limitation is also achieved. This system integrates the electrical, optical

properties of SiN membranes, and can be a useful platform for studying cavity
optoelectromechanics.

contingent behavior is present. Surely, if mechanisms promoting positive
assortment between cooperators are present, then cooperators may beat
defectors, because cooperators would collect greater payoffs. In the context of
evolutionary game theory, individuals that always cooperate cannot win the
competition against defectors in well-mixed populations. Here, we study the
evolution of a population where fitness is obtained in repeated public goods
games and players have a fixed probability of playing the next round. As a
result, the group size decreases during the game. The population is well-mixed
and there are only two available strategies: always cooperate (ALLC) or always
defect (ALLD). Through numerical calculation and analytical approximations we
show that cooperation can emerge if the players stay playing the game, but not
for too long. The essential mechanism is the interaction between the transition
from strong to weak altruism, as the group size decreases, and the existence of
an upper limit to the number of rounds representing limited time availability.

and complexity. It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a
wide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning,
to aspects like innovation and decision making. Given that an extensive
documentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is
possible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this
sport. Here we use one of the most extensive chess databases in the world to
construct two networks of chess players. One of the networks includes games
that were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the
Internet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such
as degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure.
We complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play
as node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show
that in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise
and that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is
also present.

(MVP-ENM) is proposed for biomolecular normal mode analysis. The multiscale
virtual particle model is proposed for the discretization of biomolecular
density data in different scales. Essentially, the model works as the
coarse-graining of the biomolecular structure, so that a delicate balance
between biomolecular geometric representation and computational cost can be
achieved. To form ""connections"" between these multiscale virtual particles, a
new harmonic potential function, which considers the influence from both mass
distributions and distance relations, is adopted between any two virtual
particles. Unlike the previous ENMs that use a constant spring constant, a
particle-dependent spring parameter is used in MVP-ENM. Two independent models,
i.e., multiscale virtual particle based Gaussian network model (MVP-GNM) and
multiscale virtual particle based anisotropic network model (MVP-ANM), are
proposed. Even with a rather coarse grid and a low resolution, the MVP-GNM is
able to predict the Debye-Waller factors (B-factors) with considerable good
accuracy. Similar properties have also been observed in MVP-ANM. More
importantly, in B-factor predictions, the mismatch between the predicted
results and experimental ones is predominantly from higher fluctuation regions.
Further, it is found that MVP-ANM can deliver a very consistent low-frequency
eigenmodes in various scales. This demonstrates the great potential of MVP-ANM
in the deformation analysis of low resolution data. With the multiscale
rigidity function, the MVP-ENM can be applied to biomolecular data represented
in density distribution and atomic coordinates. Further, the great advantage of
my MVP-ENM model in computational cost has been demonstrated by using two
poliovirus virus structures. Finally, the paper ends with a conclusion.
