importance for developing OLAP applications, to trace causes of errors in
production systems, and to audit the operations of a database. However,
debugging transactions is hard for several reasons: 1) after the execution of a
transaction, its input is no longer available for debugging, 2) internal states
of a transaction are typically not accessible, and 3) the execution of a
transaction may be affected by concurrently running transactions. We present a
debugger for transactions that enables non-invasive, post-mortem debugging of
transactions with provenance tracking and supports what-if scenarios (changes
to transaction code or data). Using reenactment, a declarative replay technique
we have developed, a transaction is replayed over the state of the DB seen by
its original execution including all its interactions with concurrently
executed transactions from the history. Importantly, our approach uses the
temporal database and audit logging capabilities available in many DBMS and
does not require any modifications to the underlying database system nor
transactional workload.

high relevance for high energy density physics, inertial confinement fusion and
materials science. Although the pressures in the multi-megabar range can be
produced by the shocks generated with a large variety of methods, the higher
pressures, in the sub-gigabar or gigabar range, are achievable only with
nuclear explosions or laser-driven shocks. However, the laser-to-shock energy
conversion efficiency in the laser-based methods currently applied is low and,
as a result, multi-kilojoule multi-beam lasers have to be used to produce such
extremely high pressures. In this paper, the generation of high-pressure shocks
in the newly proposed collider in which the projectile impacting a solid target
is driven by the laser-induced cavity pressure acceleration (LICPA) mechanism
is investigated using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. A special
attention is paid to the dependence of shock parameters and the laser-to-shock
energy conversion efficiency on the impacted target material and the laser
driver energy. It has been found that both in case of low-density and
high-density solid targets the shock pressures in the sub-gigabar range can be
produced in the LICPA-based collider with the laser energy of only a few
hundred of joules, and the laser-to-shock energy conversion efficiency can
reach values of 10 to 20 percent, by an order of magnitude higher than the
conversion efficiencies achieved with other laser-based methods used so far.

create mock fields for each survey. We apply the selection function in the form
of colour and magnitude cuts of the respective survey to the mock fields to
replicate the observed source sample. We make a basic comparison between the
models to check which best reproduces the observed sample distribution. We
carry out a quantitative comparison between the synthetic MDF from the mock

on the MDF and on the vertical metallicity gradient. Using both models, we find
a negligible effect of the selection function on the MDF for APOGEE, LAMOST,

metallicity gradients as well, though GALAXIA and TRILEGAL have steeper and
shallower slopes, respectively, than the observed gradient. After applying
correction terms on the metallicities of RAVE and LAMOST with respect to our
reference APOGEE sample, our observed vertical metallicity gradients between
the four surveys are consistent within 1-sigma. We also find consistent

mean vertical metallicity gradient of -0.241+/-0.028 dex kpc-1. There is a
significant scatter in the estimated gradients in the literature, but our

to minimize the error on training samples, while improving generalization by
keeping the model complexity low. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

hidden layer neurons in the resultant networks learn features that are crisp,

that initially had Type Ib optical spectrum, but after $t = 130$ d it developed
a Type IIn spectrum with prominent H$\alpha$ lines, suggesting the onset of
strong circumstellar interaction. Our first VLBI observation was at $t = 384$
d, and we find that the outer radius of SN 2014C was $(6.40 \pm 0.26) \times
10^{16}$ cm (for a distance of 15.1 Mpc), implying an average expansion
velocity of $19300 \pm 790$ \kms\ up to that time. At our last epoch, SN 2014C
was moderately resolved and shows an approximately circular outline but with an
enhancement of the brightness on the W side. The outer radius of the radio
emission at $t = 1057$ d is $(14.9 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{16}$ cm. We find that
the expansion between $t = 384$ and 1057 d is well described by a constant
velocity expansion with $v = 13600 \pm 650$ \kms. SN 2014C had clearly been
substantially decelerated by $t = 384$ d. Our measurements are compatible with
a scenario where the expanding shock impacted upon a shell of dense

at other wavelengths, but had progressed through the dense shell by the time of

computer simulations. However, both of these methods are error prone and thus
are not suitable for analyzing systems used in safety-critical domains, like

reason about the correctness of its classical properties, such as existence,
linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, modulation, time scaling, time
reversal and differentiation in time domain, and its relationships with Fourier
Cosine, Fourier Sine and Laplace transforms. We use our proposed formalization

rhythm. This adds to the time-varying feature of the glucose metabolism process
and places challenges on the blood glucose (BG) control of patients with Type 1
Diabetes Mellitus. This paper presents a Model Predictive Controller that takes
the periodic IS into account, in order to enhance BG control. The future effect
of the IS is predicted using a machine learning technique, namely, a customized
Gaussian Process (GP), based on historical training data. The training data for
the GP is continuously updated during closed-loop control, which enables the
control scheme to learn and adapt to intra-individual and inter-individual
changes of the circadian IS rhythm. The necessary state information is provided
by an Unscented Kalman Filter. The closed-loop performance of the proposed
control scheme is evaluated for different scenarios (including fasting,
announced meals and skipped meals) through in silico studies on simulation
models of G\""ottingen Minipigs.

emulsion droplet immersed in an isotropic fluid under an electric field, which
is either uniform or rotating with constant speed. The overall dynamics depend
strongly on the magnitude and on the direction (with respect to the cholesteric
axis) of the applied field, on the anchoring of the director at the droplet
surface and on the elasticity. If the surface anchoring is homeotropic and a
uniform field is parallel to the cholesteric axis, the director undergoes deep
elastic deformations and the droplet typically gets stuck into metastable
states which are rich in topological defects. When the surface anchoring is
tangential, the effects due to the electric field are overall less dramatic, as
a small number of topological defects form at equilibrium. The application of
the field perpendicular to the cholesteric axis usually has negligible effects
on the defect dynamics. The presence of a rotating electric field of varying
frequency fosters the rotation of the defects and of the droplet as well,
typically at lower speed than that of the field, due to the inertia of the
liquid crystal. If the surface anchoring is homeotropic a periodic motion is
found. Our results represent a first step to understand the dynamical response
of a cholesteric droplet under an electric field and its possible application
in designing novel liquid crystal-based devices.

production accelerators capable of <5pJ per operation at the board level.
However, with the slowing of CMOS scaling, new paradigms will be required to
achieve the next several orders of magnitude in performance per watt gains.
Using an analog resistive memory (ReRAM) crossbar to perform key matrix
operations in an accelerator is an attractive option. This work presents a
detailed design using a state of the art 14/16 nm PDK for of an analog crossbar
circuit block designed to process three key kernels required in training and
inference of neural networks. A detailed circuit and device-level analysis of
energy, latency, area, and accuracy are given and compared to relevant designs
using standard digital ReRAM and SRAM operations. It is shown that the analog
accelerator has a 270x energy and 540x latency advantage over a similar block
utilizing only digital ReRAM and takes only 11 fJ per multiply and accumulate
(MAC). Compared to an SRAM based accelerator, the energy is 430X better and
latency is 34X better. Although training accuracy is degraded in the analog

over a similar digital-only version of this accelerator block suggest that
continued optimization of analog resistive memories is valuable. This detailed

theory (TDDFT), a noninteracting electron model, which predicts charge exactly.
An exchange-correlation potential is included in the Hamiltonian to enforce
this property. We have previously investigated such systems on bounded domains

consider local density approximations (LDA) for building the
exchange-correlation potential, as part of a set of quantum corrections.
Existence and uniqueness of solutions are established separately within a
framework for general quantum corrections, including time-history potentials

summary, we are able to demonstrate a unique weak solution, on an arbitrary
time interval, for a general class of quantum corrections, including those

data movements within a group of processes. The efficiency of collective
communication operations depends on the actual algorithm, its implementation,
and the specific communication problem (type of communication, message size,
number of processes). Many MPI libraries provide numerous algorithms for
specific collective operations. The strategy for selecting an efficient
algorithm is often times predefined (hard-coded) in MPI libraries, but some of
them, such as Open MPI, allow users to change the algorithm manually. Finding
the best algorithm for each case is a hard problem, and several approaches to
tune these algorithmic parameters have been proposed. We use an orthogonal
approach to the parameter-tuning of MPI collectives, that is, instead of
testing individual algorithmic choices provided by an MPI library, we compare
the latency of a specific MPI collective operation to the latency of
semantically equivalent functions, which we call the mock-up implementations.
The structure of the mock-up implementations is defined by self-consistent
performance guidelines. The advantage of this approach is that tuning using
mock-up implementations is always possible, whether or not an MPI library
allows users to select a specific algorithm at run-time. We implement this
concept in a library called PGMPITuneLib, which is layered between the user
code and the actual MPI implementation. This library selects the
best-performing algorithmic pattern of an MPI collective by intercepting MPI
calls and redirecting them to our mock-up implementations. Experimental results
show that PGMPITuneLib can significantly reduce the latency of MPI collectives,
and also equally important, that it can help identifying the tuning potential
of MPI libraries.

comparisons. Given a collection of $n$ items and a few pairwise comparisons
across them, one wishes to identify the set of $K$ items that receive the
highest ranks. To tackle this problem, we adopt the logistic parametric model
--- the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where each item is assigned a latent
preference score, and where the outcome of each pairwise comparison depends
solely on the relative scores of the two items involved. Recent works have made
significant progress towards characterizing the performance (e.g. the mean
square error for estimating the scores) of several classical methods, including
the spectral method and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, where
they stand regarding top-$K$ ranking remains unsettled.
  We demonstrate that under a natural random sampling model, the spectral
method alone, or the regularized MLE alone, is minimax optimal in terms of the
sample complexity --- the number of paired comparisons needed to ensure exact
top-$K$ identification, for the fixed dynamic range regime. This is
accomplished via optimal control of the entrywise error of the score estimates.
We complement our theoretical studies by numerical experiments, confirming that
both methods yield low entrywise errors for estimating the underlying scores.
Our theory is established via a novel leave-one-out trick, which proves
effective for analyzing both iterative and non-iterative procedures. Along the
way, we derive an elementary eigenvector perturbation bound for probability
transition matrices, which parallels the Davis-Kahan $\sin\Theta$ theorem for
symmetric matrices. This also allows us to close the gap between the $\ell_2$
error upper bound for the spectral method and the minimax lower limit.

in the search for rare events (e.g., double beta decay, dark matter detection).
Traditional measurement techniques require long counting times to measure low
sample rates in the presence of much larger instrumental backgrounds. To
address this, a commercially available instrument developed by XIA uses pulse
shape analysis to discriminate alpha emissions produced by the sample from
those produced by other surfaces of the instrument itself. Experience with this
system has uncovered two residual sources of background: cosmogenics and radon
emanation from internal components. A development program is underway to
enhance the system and extend the pulse shape analysis technique further, so
that these residual sources can be identified and rejected as well.
  In this paper, we review the theory of operation and pulse shape analysis
techniques used in XIA`s alpha counter, and briefly explore data suggesting the
origin of the residual background terms. We will then present our approach to
enhance the system`s ability to identify and reject these terms. Finally, we
will describe a prototype system that incorporates our concepts and
demonstrates their feasibility.

distribution $q$, are $p$ and $q$ close or far? This question of ""identity
testing"" has received significant attention in the case of testing whether $p$
and $q$ are equal or far in total variation distance. However, in recent work,
the following questions have been been critical to solving problems at the
frontiers of distribution testing:
  -Alternative Distances: Can we test whether $p$ and $q$ are far in other
distances, say Hellinger?
  -Tolerance: Can we test when $p$ and $q$ are close, rather than equal? And if
so, close in which distances?
  Motivated by these questions, we characterize the complexity of distribution
testing under a variety of distances, including total variation, $\ell_2$,
Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, and $\chi^2$. For each pair of distances $d_1$ and
$d_2$, we study the complexity of testing if $p$ and $q$ are close in $d_1$
versus far in $d_2$, with a focus on identifying which problems allow strongly
sublinear testers (i.e., those with complexity $O(n^{1 - \gamma})$ for some
$\gamma > 0$ where $n$ is the size of the support of the distributions $p$ and
$q$). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for each case. We also study
these questions in the case where we only have samples from $q$ (equivalence
testing), showing qualitative differences from identity testing in terms of
when tolerance can be achieved. Our algorithms fall into the classical paradigm
of $\chi^2$-statistics, but require crucial changes to handle the challenges
introduced by each distance we consider. Finally, we survey other recent
results in an attempt to serve as a reference for the complexity of various
distribution testing problems.

Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the gl\snia\ yield of the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the
precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST gl\sneia.
Microlensing has a negligible effect on the LSST gl\snia\ yield, but it can be
increased by a factor of $\sim$2 to 930 systems using a novel photometric
identification technique based on spectral template fitting. Crucially, the
microlensing of gl\sneia\ is achromatic until 3 rest-frame weeks after the
explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time
delay indicators. By fitting simulated flux and color observations of
microlensed gl\sneia\ with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we
forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for
LSST, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color
curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light curve observations
it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4\%). About
70\% of LSST gl\snia\ images should be discovered during the achromatic phase,
indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if
prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for
microlensing, the 1--2 day time delay on the recently discovered gl\snia\
iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.

$\Delta^\mathrm{LT} = 1-A_2/A_0$ that is more sensitive to the dynamics in the
region where $A_0$ and $A_2$ are both small. We find that the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections have an important impact on the $p_{T,Z}$
distributions for several of the angular coefficients, and are essential to
provide an adequate description of the data. The compatibility of the available
ATLAS and CMS data is reassessed by performing a partial $\chi^2$ test with
respect to the central theoretical prediction which shows that
$\chi^2/N_\mathrm{data}$ is significantly reduced by going from

hierarchy problem without resorting to anthropic or other fine-tuning
arguments. This mechanism introduces an axion-like field, dubbed the relaxion,
whose expectation value determines the electroweak hierarchy as well as the QCD
strong CP violating $\bar{\theta}$ parameter. During an inflationary period,
the Higgs mass squared is selected to be negative and hierarchically small in a
theory which is consistent with 't Hooft's technical naturalness criteria.
However, in the original model proposed by Graham, Kaplan and Rajendran (2015),
the relaxion does not solve the strong CP problem, and in fact contributes to
it, as the coupling of the relaxion to the Higgs field and the introduction of
a linear potential for the relaxion produces large strong CP violation. We
resolve this tension by considering inflation with a Hubble scale which is
above the QCD scale but below the weak scale, and estimating the Hubble
temperature dependence of the axion mass. The relaxion potential is thus very
different during inflation than it is today. We find that provided the
inflationary Hubble scale is between the weak scale and about 3 GeV, the
relaxion resolves the hierarchy, strong CP, and dark matter problems in a way
that is technically natural.

this result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson

leading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,

that the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that
the Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the

departure from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from
numerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show
that, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson
parametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects
which increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength. This theoretical study
is complemented by experimental characterization of the output field of a

WFIRST can achieve by centering on the diffraction spikes of highly saturated
stars. This measurement principle is strongly facilitated by the WFIRST H4RG
detectors, which confine excess charges within the potential well of saturated
pixels. By adopting a simplified analytical model of the diffraction spike
caused by a single support strut obscuring the telescope aperture, integrated
over the WFIRST pixel size, we predict the performance of this approach with
the Fisher-matrix formalism. We discuss the validity of the model and find that
10 ${\mu}$as astrometric precision is achievable with a single 100 s exposure

necessary to schedule quantum gates in a way that minimizes the number of
operations. There are three constraints that have to be satisfied: the order or
dependency of the quantum gates in the specific algorithm, the fact that any
qubit may be involved in at most one gate at a time, and the restriction that
two-qubit gates are implementable only between connected qubits. The last
aspect implies that the compilation depends not only on the algorithm, but also
on hardware properties like connectivity. Here we suggest a two-step approach
in which logical gates are initially scheduled neglecting connectivity
considerations, while routing operations are added at a later step in a way
that minimizes their overhead. We rephrase the subtasks of gate scheduling in
terms of graph problems like edge-coloring and maximum subgraph isomorphism.
While this approach is general, we specialize to a one dimensional array of
qubits to propose a routing scheme that is minimal in the number of exchange
operations. As a practical application, we schedule the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm in a linear geometry and quantify the reduction in the

colour-selected populations of galaxies as tracers of linear large-scale
motions. We empirically select volume-limited samples of blue and red galaxies
as to minimise the systematic error on the estimate of the growth rate
$f\sigma_8$ from the anisotropy of the two-point correlation function. To this
end, rather than rigidly splitting the sample into two colour classes we define
the red/blue fractional contribution of each object through a weight based on
the $(U-V)$ colour distribution. Using mock surveys that are designed to
reproduce the observed properties of VIPERS galaxies, we find the systematic
error in recovering the fiducial value of $f\sigma_8$ to be minimized when
using a volume-limited sample of luminous blue galaxies. We model non-linear
corrections via the Scoccimarro extension of the Kaiser model, finding
systematic errors on $f\sigma_8$ of below $1-2\%$, using scales as small as 5
$h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. We interpret this result as indicating that selection of
luminous blue galaxies maximises the fraction that are central objects in their
dark matter haloes; this in turn minimises the contribution to the measured
$\xi(r_p,\pi)$ from the 1-halo term, which is dominated by non-linear motions.
The gain is inferior if one uses the full magnitude-limited sample of blue
objects, consistent with the presence of a significant fraction of blue,
fainter satellites dominated by non-streaming, orbital velocities. We measure a
value of $f\sigma_8=0.45 \pm 0.11$ over the single redshift range $0.6\le z\le
1.0$, corresponding to an effective redshift for the blue galaxies
$\left<z\right>=0.85$. Including in the likelihood the potential extra
information contained in the blue-red galaxy cross-correlation function does
not lead to an appreciable improvement in the error bars, while it increases
the systematic error.

composition is a fossil record connecting the evolution of the various stellar
components of galaxies to the interaction with the environment by in- and
outflows. The Magneticum simulations allow to study halos across a large range
of masses and environments, from massive galaxy clusters containing hundreds of
galaxies down to isolated field galaxies. They include a detailed treatment of
the chemo-energetic feedback from the stellar component and its evolution as
well as feedback from the evolution of supermassive black holes. Following the
detailed evolution of various metal species and their relative composition due
to continuing enrichment of the IGM and ICM by SNIa, SNII and AGB winds of the
evolving stellar population reveals the complex interplay of local star
formation processes, mixing, global baryonic flows, secular galactic evolution
and environmental processes. We present results from the Magneticum simulations
on the chemical properties of simulated galaxies and galaxy clusters, carefully
comparing them to observations. We show that the simulations already reach a
very high level of realism within their complex descriptions of the
chemo-energetic feedback, successfully reproducing a large number of observed
properties and scaling relations. Our simulated galaxies clearly indicate that
there are no strong secondary parameters (like star formation rates at fixed
redshift) driving the scatter in these scaling relations. The remaining
differences clearly point to detailed physical processes which have to be
included into future simulations.

measurement while skewness and kurtosis measurements will be primarily limited
by thermal noise. The sensitivity can be improved by performing frequency
binning and windowing. In addition, we find that strong sample variance
fluctuation in the kurtosis measured from an individual field of observation

halo and bulge of the Milky Way, we have constructed chemical evolution models
for the low-mass proto-Galactic subsystems such as globular clusters (GCs).
Unlike previous studies, we assume that supernova blast waves undergo blowout
without expelling the pre-enriched gas, while relatively slow winds of massive
stars (WMS), together with the winds and ejecta from low and intermediate mass
asymptotic-giant-branch stars (AGBs), are all locally retained in these less
massive systems. We find that the observed Na-O anti-correlation in metal-poor
GCs can be reproduced, when multiple episodes of starbursts are allowed to
continue in these subsystems. Specific star formation history (SFH) with
decreasing time intervals between the stellar generations, however, is required
to obtain this result, which is in good agreement with the parameters obtained
from our stellar evolution models for the horizontal-branch. The ""mass budget
problem"" is also much alleviated by our models without ad-hoc assumptions on
star formation efficiency (SFE) and initial mass function (IMF). We also
applied these models to investigate the origin of super-helium-rich red clump
stars in the metal-rich bulge as recently suggested by Lee et al. (2015). We
find that chemical enrichments by the WMS can naturally reproduce the required
helium enhancement (dY/dZ = 6) for the second generation stars. Disruption of
proto-GCs in a hierarchical merging paradigm would have provided helium
enhanced stars to the bulge field.

better localization accuracy compared with single region proposal network

which obtain tight or nearly tight approximations to social welfare. In our
settings, buyers arrive online and purchase bundles of items; buyers' values
for the bundles are drawn from known distributions. This problem is closely
related to the so-called prophet-inequality of Krengel and Sucheston and its
extensions in recent literature. Motivated by applications to cloud economics,
we consider two kinds of buyer preferences. In the first, items correspond to
different units of time at which a resource is available; the items are
arranged in a total order and buyers desire intervals of items. The second
corresponds to bandwidth allocation over a tree network; the items are edges in
the network and buyers desire paths.
  Because buyers' preferences have complementarities in the settings we
consider, recent constant-factor approximations via item prices do not apply,
and indeed strong negative results are known. We develop static, anonymous
bundle pricing mechanisms.
  For the interval preferences setting, we show that static, anonymous bundle
pricings achieve a sublogarithmic competitive ratio, which is optimal (within
constant factors) over the class of all online allocation algorithms, truthful
or not. For the path preferences setting, we obtain a nearly-tight logarithmic
competitive ratio. Both of these results exhibit an exponential improvement
over item pricings for these settings. Our results extend to settings where the
seller has multiple copies of each item, with the competitive ratio decreasing

say that $E$ is a $G$-Weyl CM field.
  Let $N_{2d}^{\textrm{Weyl}}(X,G)$ count the $G$-Weyl CM fields $E$ of degree
$2d$ with discriminant $|d_E| \leq X$ and define \begin{align*}
N_{2d}^{\textrm{Weyl}}(X):=\sum_{G \leq S_d}N_{2d}^{\textrm{Weyl}}(X,G).

degree $2d$ with discriminant $|d_E| \leq X$. Assuming a weak form of the upper
bound in Malle's conjecture which is known to be true in many cases, we build
upon an approach of Kl\""uners to prove that \begin{align*}
\frac{N_{2d}^{\textrm{Weyl}}(X,G)}{N_{2d}^{\textrm{cm}}(X)} = C(d, G) +
O(X^{-\alpha(d,G)}) \end{align*} and \begin{align}

constants $C(d,G), \alpha(d,G)$, and $\beta(d)$.
  We then apply these distribution results to study the Colmez conjecture.
Using the recently proved averaged Colmez conjecture, we deduce that the Colmez
conjecture is true for $G$-Weyl CM fields. Combined with (0.1), we conclude
that the Colmez conjecture is true for an asymptotic density of 100% of CM
fields of degree $2d$; in other words, the Colmez conjecture is true for a

computational and communication needs. In order to ease the pressure on
resources, research indicates that in many cases a low precision representation
(1-2 bit per parameter) of weights and other parameters can achieve similar
accuracy while requiring less resources. Using quantized values enables the use
of FPGAs to run NNs, since FPGAs are well fitted to these primitives; e.g.,
FPGAs provide efficient support for bitwise operations and can work with
arbitrary-precision representation of numbers.
  This paper presents a new streaming architecture for running QNNs on FPGAs.
The proposed architecture scales out better than alternatives, allowing us to
take advantage of systems with multiple FPGAs. We also included support for
skip connections, that are used in state-of-the art NNs, and shown that our
architecture allows to add those connections almost for free. All this allowed
us to implement an 18-layer ResNet for 224x224 images classification, achieving
57.5% top-1 accuracy.
  In addition, we implemented a full-sized quantized AlexNet. In contrast to
previous works, we use 2-bit activations instead of 1-bit ones, which improves
AlexNet's top-1 accuracy from 41.8% to 51.03% for the ImageNet classification.
Both AlexNet and ResNet can handle 1000-class real-time classification on an
FPGA.
  Our implementation of ResNet-18 consumes 5x less power and is 4x slower for
ImageNet, when compared to the same NN on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Smaller NNs,
that fit a single FPGA, are running faster then on GPUs on small (32x32)

efficiency of the spin transfer from the electrons to the nuclei as reflected
by a maximum nuclear field of 0.9 T in a tilted external magnetic field of 1 T
strength only. This high efficiency is due to a low leakage of spin out of the
polarized nuclear system, because mechanisms of spin relaxation other than the
hyperfine interaction are strongly suppressed, leading to a long nuclear
relaxation time of up to 1000 s. A key ingredient to that end is the low
impurity concentration inside the heterostructure, while the electrostatic
potential from charged impurities in the surrounding barriers becomes screened
through illumination by which the spin relaxation time is increased compared to
keeping the system in the dark. This finding indicates a strategy for obtaining
high nuclear spin polarization as required for long-lasting carrier spin
coherence.

approach of deriving multi-year probabilities of default (PDs) from one-year
PDs, the latter normally being available from Basel ratings. Rating transition
matrices have gained in importance with the newly adopted IFRS 9 accounting
standard. Here, the multi-year PDs can be used to calculate the so-called
expected credit losses (ECL) over the entire lifetime of relevant credit
assets. A typical approach for estimating the rating transition matrices relies
on calculating empirical rating migration counts and frequencies from rating
history data. For small portfolios, however, this approach often leads to zero
counts and high count volatility, which makes the estimations unreliable and
unstable, and can also produce counter-intuitive prediction patterns such as
non-parallel/crossing forward PD patterns. This paper proposes a structural
model which overcomes these problems. We make a plausible assumption of an
underlying autoregressive mean-reverting ability-to-pay process. With only
three parameters, this sparse process can well describe an entire typical
rating transition matrix, provided the one-year PDs of the rating classes are
specified. The transition probabilities produced by the structural approach are
well-behaved by design. The approach significantly reduces the statistical
degrees of freedom of the estimated transition probabilities, which makes the
rating transition matrix more reliable for small portfolios. The approach can
be applied to data with as few as 50 observed rating transitions. Moreover, the
approach can be efficiently applied to data consisting of continuous PDs (prior
to rating discretization). In the IFRS 9 context, the approach offers an
additional merit: it can easily account for the macroeconomic adjustments,
which are required by the IFRS 9 accounting standard.

stable). However, discriminating between those theories with experiments has
remained elusive because of spontaneous ice nucleation. Here we measure the
sound velocity in liquid water stretched to negative pressure, and derive an
experimental equation of state, which reveals compressibility anomalies. We
show by rigorous thermodynamic relations how these anomalies are intricately

time-independent sequences, in which the actual time span between events is
irrelevant and the distance between events is simply the difference between

sequences is applicable for data such as natural languages, e.g., dealing with
words in a sentence, it is inappropriate and inefficient for many real world
events that are observed and collected at unequally spaced points of time as
they naturally arise, e.g., when a person goes to a grocery store or makes a
phone call. The time span between events can carry important information about
the sequence dependence of human behaviors. In this work, we propose a set of
methods for using time in sequence prediction. Because neural sequence models
such as RNN are more amenable for handling token-like input, we propose two
methods for time-dependent event representation, based on the intuition on how
time is tokenized in everyday life and previous work on embedding
contextualization. We also introduce two methods for using next event duration
as regularization for training a sequence prediction model. We discuss these
methods based on recurrent neural nets. We evaluate these methods as well as
baseline models on five datasets that resemble a variety of sequence prediction
tasks. The experiments revealed that the proposed methods offer accuracy gain
over baseline models in a range of settings.

shown that weak solutions become smooth instantaneously and stay so over all

For very soft potentials we obtain a conditional regularity result, hinging on
what may be described as a nonlinear Morrey space bound, assumed to hold
uniformly over time. This bound always holds in the case of moderately soft
potentials, and nearly holds for general potentials, including Coulomb. This
latter phenomenon captures the intuition that for moderately soft potentials,
the dissipative term in the equation is of the same order as the quadratic term
driving the growth (and potentially, singularities). In particular, for the
Coulomb case, the conditional regularity result shows a rate of regularization
much stronger than what is usually expected for regular parabolic equations.
The main feature of our proofs is the analysis of the linearized Landau

Here we compute the mean flow generated close to an undulating wall that emits
internal waves in a viscous, linearly stratified two-dimensional Boussinesq

boundary conditions dramatically impacts the generated boundary streaming. In
the no-slip scenario, the early time Reynolds stress divergence within the
viscous boundary layer is much stronger than within the bulk while also driving
flow in the opposite direction. Whatever the boundary condition, boundary
streaming is however dominated by bulk streaming at a larger time. Using a WKB

to an idealised model of wave-mean flow interactions known to reproduce the
salient features of the quasi-biennial oscillation. The presence of wave
boundary layers has a quantitative impact on the flow reversals.

related to a CLT but with bi-modal distributions as limits. The results show,
in part, that experimentally measuring the diffusion scaling law can determine
the point transformation (for monomial point transformations). We also show
that AD in the original, physical position is actually ND when viewed in terms
of displacements in an appropriately transformed position variable. Finally, we

shed light on the machinery behind Bayesian variants of these methods. In

HBwS, the antenna array is fed by an analog beamforming matrix with $\bar{L}$
input ports, where $\bar{L}$ is larger than the number of up/down-conversion
chains $\bar{K}$. A bank of switches connects the instantaneously best
$\bar{K}$ out of the $\bar{L}$ input ports to the up/down-conversion chains.
The analog beamformer is designed based on average channel statistics and
therefore needs to be updated only infrequently, while the switches operate
based on instantaneous channel knowledge. HBwS allows use of simpler hardware
in the beamformer that only need to adjust to the statistics, while also
enabling the effective analog beams to adapt to the instantaneous channel
variations via switching. This provides better user separability, beamforming
gain, and/or simpler hardware than some conventional hybrid schemes. In this

regression with unknown residual variances, where the set of active predictors
is allowed to evolve over time. To capture time-varying variable selection
uncertainty, we introduce new dynamic shrinkage priors for the time series of
regression coefficients. These priors are characterized by two main
ingredients: smooth parameter evolutions and intermittent zeroes for modeling
predictive breaks. More formally, our proposed Dynamic Spike-and-Slab (DSS)
priors are constructed as mixtures of two processes: a spike process for the
irrelevant coefficients and a slab autoregressive process for the active
coefficients. The mixing weights are themselves time-varying and depend on
lagged values of the series. Our DSS priors are probabilistically coherent in
the sense that their stationary distribution is fully known and characterized
by spike-and-slab marginals. For posterior sampling over dynamic regression
coefficients, model selection indicators as well as unknown dynamic residual
variances, we propose a Dynamic SSVS algorithm based on forward-filtering and
backward-sampling. To scale our method to large data sets, we develop a Dynamic
EMVS algorithm for MAP smoothing. We demonstrate, through simulation and a
topical macroeconomic dataset, that DSS priors are very effective at separating
active and noisy coefficients. Our fast implementation significantly extends
the reach of spike-and-slab methods to large time series data.

teleportation for wireless mesh backbone networks, in amplitude and phase
damping channels. After analyzing the quantum multihop protocol, we select a
four-qubit cluster state as the quantum channel for the protocol. The quantum
channel linking the intermediate nodes has been established via entanglement
swapping based on four-qubit cluster state. Also, we established the classical
and the quantum route in a distributed manner. We show that from the source
node to the destination node, quantum information can be teleported hop-by-hop
through an amplitude damping channel. We show that the quantum teleportation
could be successful if the sender node performs Bell state measurements (BSM),
and the receiver introduces auxiliary particles, applies positive operative
value measure and then utilizes corresponding unitary transformation to recover
the transmitted state. We scrutinize the success probability of transferring
the quantum state through a noisy channel. We found that optimum probability
would be attained if decoherence rate of amplitude damping channel ($\xi_a$) is
zero or the number of hops ($N$) is above $75$. Our numerical results evince
susceptibility of success probability to $\xi_a$ and $N$. It has been shown
that as the decoherence increases, the fidelity exponentially decays until it
vanishes. This decay is as a consequence of information loss from the system to
the surrounding. However, the fidelity can be enhanced by considering fewer

access to the low frequency sky in a commensal fashion, operating independently

continuous coverage through an aperture array (called ngLOBO-Low) below 150 MHz
and by accessing the primary focus of the ngVLA antennas (called ngLOBO-High)
above 150 MHz. ngLOBO preconditions include a) non-interference and b) low
relative cost (<5%) with respect to ngVLA.
  ngLOBO has three primary scientific missions: (1) Radio Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (Radio-LSST): one naturally wide beam, commensal with ngVLA, will
conduct a continuous synoptic survey of large swaths of the sky for both slow
and fast transients; (2) This same commensal beam will provide complementary
low frequency images of all ngVLA targets and their environment {\it when such
data enhances their value}. (3) Independent beams from the ngLOBO-Low aperture
array will conduct research in astrophysics, Earth science and space weather
applications, engaging new communities and attracting independent resources. If
ngVLA operates down to 2 GHz or lower, ngLOBO data will enhance ngVLA
calibration and dynamic scheduling. Finally, non-variable field sources outside
the ngVLA field of view can be harvested for serendipitous science, e.g.
population studies for thermal and non-thermal continuum sources.
  The ngVLA will be a superb, high frequency instrument; ngLOBO will allow it
to participate in the worldwide renaissance in low frequency science as well.

large times. In principle, such a power-law scaling invalidates the hypothesis
of perfect separability. Nonetheless, we address the problem from a pragmatic
point of view by studying the fidelity obtained through separate control as a
function of the intercrossing separation. This procedure may be a good approach
to achieve approximate adiabatic driving of a specific instantaneous eigenstate

""circuits""), called ""balanced"", such that no theta subgraph contains exactly
two balanced circles. A biased graph has two natural matroids, the frame
matroid and the lift matroid. A classical question in matroid theory is whether
a matroid can be embedded in a projective geometry. There is no known general
answer, but for matroids of biased graphs it is possible to give algebraic
criteria. Zaslavsky has previously given such criteria for embeddability of
biased-graphic matroids in Desarguesian projective spaces; in this paper we
establish criteria for the remaining case, that is, embeddability in an
arbitrary projective plane that is not necessarily Desarguesian.
  The criteria depend on the embeddability of a quasigroup associated to the
graph into the additive or multiplicative loop of a ternary coordinate ring for
the plane. A 3-node biased graph is equivalent to an abstract partial 3-net;
thus, we have a new algebraic criterion for an abstract 3-net to be realized in
a non-Desarguesian projective plane. We work in terms of a special kind of
3-node biased graph called a biased expansion of a triangle. Our results apply
to all finite 3-node biased graphs because, as we prove, every such biased
graph is a subgraph of a finite biased expansion of a triangle. A biased
expansion of a triangle, in turn, is equivalent to an isostrophe class of
quasigroups, which is equivalent to a $3$-net. Much is not known about
embedding a quasigroup into a ternary ring, so we do not say our criteria are
definitive. For instance, it is not even known whether there is a finite
quasigroup that cannot be embedded in any finite ternary ring. If there is,
then there is a finite rank-3 matroid (of the corresponding biased expansion)
that cannot be embedded in any finite projective plane---a presently unsolved
problem.

repetition rate vortex beam source tunable in the near-IR wavelength range.
Based on single-pass optical parametric generation of Yb-fiber laser of vortex
order lp=1 in a 50 mm long MgO doped periodically poled LiNbO3 crystal, the
source produces signal beam in vortex profile of order ls=1 across 1433-1553
nm. Additionally, the source produces broadband idler radiation tunable across
3379-4132 nm in the Gaussian beam profile. We observed that the vortex profile
of the pump beam is always transferred to the signal beam due to the highest
overlapping integral among the interacting beams and the idler maintains a
Gaussian spatial profile owing to conservation of orbital angular momentum in
optical parametric processes. For pump power of 4.72 W, the signal and idler
beams have maximum power of 1.7 W at 1509 nm and 0.48 W at 3625 nm
respectively. The signal vortex beam has output pulses of width 637 fs at a
repetition rate of 78 MHz. The signal (idler) has spectral width of 4.3 nm
(129.5 nm) and passive peak-to-peak power fluctuation better than 3% (1.1%)

a result, for cross-entropy trained models, beam decoding can sometimes yield

to the structure of a knowledge graph typically assume that entities are
embedded in a connected space and that relations imply similarity. However,
useful knowledge graphs often contain diverse entities and relations (with
potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these
assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting,
a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly
modeling pairwise relations. Our framework can directly incorporate a variety
of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph
completion. Further, it allows users to encode, learn, and extract information
about relation semantics. We present both linear and neural instantiations of
the framework. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing
retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on
simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drug--disease

a generalized entropy $s_{\nu}$ (with $\nu=2$). Herein, the whole thermodynamic

$s_{\nu}$, with $\nu>1$, covering the $\nu=2$ (vortices in type-II

polarized Raman spectroscopy with up to eight excitation energies. The main
E2g1 and A1g modes near 250 cm-1 appear as a single peak in the Raman spectrum
taken without consideration of polarization but are resolved by using
circularly polarized Raman scattering. The resonance behaviors of the E2g1 and
A1g modes are examined. Firstly, both the E2g1 and A1g modes are enhanced near
resonances with the exciton states. The A1g mode exhibits Davydov splitting for
trilayers or thicker near some of the exciton resonances. The low-frequency
Raman spectra show shear and breathing modes involving rigid vibrations of the
layers and also exhibit strong dependence on the excitation energy. An
unidentified peak at ~19 cm-1 that does not depend on the number of layers
appears near resonance with the B exciton state at 1.96 eV (632.8 nm). The
strengths of the intra- and inter-layer interactions are estimated by comparing
the mode frequencies and Davydov splitting with the linear chain model, and the
contribution of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction to the inter-layer
interaction turns out to be about 34% of the nearest-neighbor interaction. Fano
resonance is observed for 1.58-eV excitation, and its origin is found to be the
interplay between two-phonon scattering and indirect band transition.

excitation properties of repulsive Fermi polarons in 1D, which can also exhibit
a negative $m^*$ in the super Tonks-Girardeau regime. By analyzing the total
spin, quasi-momentum distribution and pair correlations, we conclude that the
negative $m^*$ is irrelevant to the instability towards ferromagnetism or phase
separation, but rather an intrinsic feature of collective excitations for
fermions in the strongly repulsive regime. Surprisingly, for large and negative
$m^*$, such excitation is accompanied with a spin density modulation when the
majority fermions move closer to the impurity rather than being repelled far
away, contrary to the picture of phase separation. These results suggest an
alternative interpretation of negative $m^*$ as observed in recent LENS

Chinese citizen astronomers have made a visible contribution in the discoveries

discovery, such as visual classification, long-term monitoring of objects, and
data mining. From a questionnaire survey that aimed to investigate the

predominantly male ($92\%$) who mostly reside in economically developed
provinces. A large fraction ($69\%$) of the respondents are students and young
professionals younger than the age of 25, which differs significantly from the
occupation and age distribution of typical Chinese Internet users as well as
the user distribution of large international citizen science projects such as
the Galaxy Zoo. This suggests that youth generation in China is more willing to

we find that interests in astronomy, desire to learn new knowledges, have a fun

factors for Chinese citizen astronomers to participate research. This also

machine learning. While the matrix rank is often approximated by the convex
nuclear norm, the use of nonconvex low-rank regularizers has demonstrated
better empirical performance. However, the resulting optimization problem is
much more challenging. Recent state-of-the-art requires an expensive full SVD
in each iteration. In this paper, we show that for many commonly-used nonconvex
low-rank regularizers, a cutoff can be derived to automatically threshold the
singular values obtained from the proximal operator. This allows such operator
being efficiently approximated by power method. Based on it, we develop a
proximal gradient algorithm (and its accelerated variant) with inexact proximal
splitting and prove that a convergence rate of O(1/T) where T is the number of
iterations is guaranteed. Furthermore, we show the proposed algorithm can be
well parallelized, which achieves nearly linear speedup w.r.t the number of
threads. Extensive experiments are performed on matrix completion and robust
principal component analysis, which shows a significant speedup over the
state-of-the-art. Moreover, the matrix solution obtained is more accurate and
has a lower rank than that of the nuclear norm regularizer.

animal or plant species), hierarchical clusterings are more descriptive than a
flat clustering. A hierarchical clustering over $n$ elements is represented by
a rooted binary tree with $n$ leaves, each corresponding to one element. The
subtrees rooted at interior nodes capture the clusters. In this paper, we study
active learning of a hierarchical clustering using only ordinal queries. An
ordinal query consists of a set of three elements, and the response to a query
reveals the two elements (among the three elements in the query) which are
""closer"" to each other than to the third one. We say that elements $x$ and $x'$
are closer to each other than $x""$ if there exists a cluster containing $x$ and
$x'$, but not $x""$.
  When all the query responses are correct, there is a deterministic algorithm
that learns the underlying hierarchical clustering using at most $n \log_2 n$
adaptive ordinal queries. We generalize this algorithm to be robust in a model
in which each query response is correct independently with probability $p >
\frac{1}{2}$, and adversarially incorrect with probability $1 - p$. We show
that in the presence of noise, our algorithm outputs the correct hierarchical
clustering with probability at least $1 - \delta$, using $O(n \log n + n
\log(1/\delta))$ adaptive ordinal queries. For our results, adaptivity is
crucial: we prove that even in the absence of noise, every non-adaptive
algorithm requires $\Omega(n^3)$ ordinal queries in the worst case.

realized as marginals of a single channel. This paper addresses the general
structure of the incompatibility of completely positive channels with a fixed
quantum input space and with general outcome operator algebras. We define a
compatibility relation for such channels by identifying the composite outcome
space as the maximal (projective) $C^\ast$-tensor product of outcome algebras.
We show theorems that characterize this compatibility relation in terms of the
concatenation and conjugation of channels, generalizing the recent result for
channels with quantum outcome spaces. These results are applied to the positive
operator valued measures (POVMs) by identifying each of them with the
corresponding quantum-classical (QC) channel. We also give a characterization
of the maximality of a POVM with respect to the post-processing preorder in
terms of the conjugate channel of the QC channel. We consider another
definition of compatibility of normal channels by identifying the composite
outcome space with the normal tensor product of the outcome von Neumann
algebras. We prove that for a given normal channel the class of normally
compatible channels is upper bounded by a special class of channels called
tensor conjugate channels. We show the inequivalence of the $C^\ast$- and
normal compatibility relations for QC channels, which originates from the
possibility and impossibility of copying operations for commutative von Neumann
algebras in $C^\ast$- and normal compatibility relations, respectively.

the need for multi-mode and more PGs is stronger, to achieve the required

proposed. All possible clutch topology and modes for one existing configuration

either speed (e.g., with correlation filters) or accuracy (e.g., with deep
features). Real-time and high accuracy tracking algorithms, however, remain
scarce. In this paper we study the problem from a new perspective and present a
novel parallel tracking and verifying (PTAV) framework, by taking advantage of
the ubiquity of multi-thread techniques and borrowing from the success of
parallel tracking and mapping in visual SLAM. Our PTAV framework typically
consists of two components, a tracker T and a verifier V, working in parallel
on two separate threads. The tracker T aims to provide a super real-time
tracking inference and is expected to perform well most of the time; by
contrast, the verifier V checks the tracking results and corrects T when
needed. The key innovation is that, V does not work on every frame but only
upon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust the tracking according
to the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV enjoys both the high
efficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative power by V. In our
extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, TC128
and UAV20L, PTAV achieves the best tracking accuracy among all real-time
trackers, and in fact performs even better than many deep learning based
solutions. Moreover, as a general framework, PTAV is very flexible and has
great rooms for improvement and generalization.

very small investment period. So, the Toroids are not created from nothing nor
have a limited monetary base. The minimum investment period can be very small,
for example one day, and you keep the interest but you can return the Toroids
and refund your collateral. That is a one-side only peg to a deflationary

capital involved is smaller. Rebasement has a quick positive start to
incentivize early adopters that see only big growth in their TRD account during

near the interface is shown to increase the phase space available for phonon
mode conversion and to enhance thermal interface conductance at moderate levels

it is desirable to automatically adapt the features to a certain image or class

textures and ground truth segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework to
learn features for texture segmentation when no such training data is
available. The cost function for our learning process is constructed to match a
commonly used segmentation model, the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model.
This means that the features are learned such that they provide an
approximately piecewise constant feature image with a small jump set. Based on
this idea, we develop a two-stage algorithm which first learns suitable
convolutional features and then performs a segmentation. We note that the
features can be learned from a small set of images, from a single image, or
even from image patches. The proposed method achieves a competitive rank in the
Prague texture segmentation benchmark, and it is effective for segmenting
histological images.

a predetermined number of iterations, or until convergence of the solution,
frequently sampling too many or too few datapoints for end-to-end runtime

to the discrete Landau levels in quantum Hall regime. We find that the

panoply of methods used for data exploration, visualisation is often the
starting point and even the guiding reference for scientific thought. However,
this is a volume of data that cannot be efficiently explored using traditional
tools, techniques, and habits.
  Aims: We aim to provide a global visual exploration service for the Gaia
archive, something that is not possible out of the box for most people. The
service has two main goals. The first is to provide a software platform for
interactive visual exploration of the archive contents, using common personal
computers and mobile devices available to most users. The second aim is to
produce intelligible and appealing visual representations of the enormous
information content of the archive.
  Methods: The interactive exploration service follows a client-server design.
The server runs close to the data, at the archive, and is responsible for
hiding as far as possible the complexity and volume of the Gaia data from the
client. This is achieved by serving visual detail on demand. Levels of detail
are pre-computed using data aggregation and subsampling techniques. For DR1,
the client is a web application that provides an interactive multi-panel
visualisation workspace as well as a graphical user interface.
  Results: The Gaia archive Visualisation Service offers a web-based
multi-panel interactive visualisation desktop in a browser tab. It currently
provides highly configurable 1D histograms and 2D scatter plots of Gaia DR1 and
the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) with linked views. An innovative
feature is the creation of ADQL queries from visually defined regions in plots.

Within these, robots are bound to face unexpected external disturbances like
accidental human or tool collisions. Robots must develop the capacity to
respond to unexpected events. That is not only identifying the sudden anomaly,
but also deciding how to handle it. In this work, we contribute a recovery
policy that allows a robot to recovery from various anomalous scenarios across
different tasks and conditions in a consistent and robust fashion. The system
organizes tasks as a sequence of nodes composed of internal modules such as
motion generation and introspection. When an introspection module flags an
anomaly, the recovery strategy is triggered and reverts the task execution by
selecting a target node as a function of a state dependency chart. The new
skill allows the robot to overcome the effects of the external disturbance and
conclude the task. Our system recovers from accidental human and tool
collisions in a number of tasks. Of particular importance is the fact that we
test the robustness of the recovery system by triggering anomalies at each node
in the task graph showing robust recovery everywhere in the task. We also
trigger multiple and repeated anomalies at each of the nodes of the task
showing that the recovery system can consistently recover anywhere in the
presence of strong and pervasive anomalous conditions. Robust recovery systems
will be key enablers for long-term autonomy in robot systems. Supplemental info

using 18-band Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting in mid-infrared

to be missed in optical, UV and soft X-ray observations. Mid-IR light can help
us to recover them in an obscuration free way using their thermal emission. On
the other hand, Star-Forming Galaxies (SFG) also have strong PAH emission
features in mid-IR. Hence, establishing an accurate method to separate
populations of AGN and SFG is important. However, in previous mid-IR surveys,
only 3 or 4 filters were available, and thus the selection was limited. We
combined AKARI's continuous 9 mid-IR bands with WISE and Spitzer data to create
18 mid-IR bands for AGN selection. Among 4682 galaxies in the AKARI NEP deep
field, 1388 are selected to be AGN hosts, which implies an AGN fraction of
29.6$\pm$0.8$\%$ (among them 47$\%$ are Seyfert 1.8 and 2). Comparing the
result from SED fitting into WISE and Spitzer colour-colour diagram reveals
that Seyferts are often missed by previous studies. Our result has been tested

systems with very evolved companions. Here, we focus on understanding the
origin and determining the properties of the high-velocity outflow observed in
one such system. We present a quantitative analysis of BD+46$^{\circ}$442, a
post-AGB binary which shows active mass transfer that leads to the creation of
a disk-driven outflow or jet. We obtained high-resolution optical spectra from
the HERMES spectrograph, mounted on the 1.2m Flemish Mercator Telescope. By
performing a time-series analysis of the Halpha profile, we dissected the
different components of the system. We deduced the jet geometry by comparing
the orbital phased data with our jet model. In order to image the accretion
disk around the companion of BD+46$^{\circ}$442, we applied the technique of
Doppler tomography. The orbital phase-dependent variations in the Halpha
profile can be related to an accretion disk around the companion, from which a
high-velocity outflow or jet is launched. Our model shows that there is a clear
correlation between the inclination angle and the jet opening angle. The
latitudinally dependent velocity structure of our jet model shows a good
correspondence to the data, with outflow velocities at least higher than
400km/s. We show that BD+46$^{\circ}$442, is a result of a binary interaction
channel. The origin of the fast outflow in this system can be attributed to a
gaseous disk around the secondary component, which is most likely a main
sequence star. Our analysis suggests the outflow to have a rather wide opening
angle instead of being strongly collimated. Similar orbital phase-dependent
Halpha profiles are commonly observed in post-AGB binaries. Post-AGB binaries
provide ideal test bets to study jet formation and launching mechanisms over a
wide range of orbital conditions.

Hochschild cohomology of algebras arising from a linear category with finitely
many objects and zero compositions. For this purpose, we consider such a
category using an ad hoc quiver $Q$, with an algebra associated to each vertex
and a bimodule to each arrow. The computation relies on cohomological functors
that we introduce, and on the combinatorics of the quiver. One point extensions
are occurrences of this situation, and Happel's long exact sequence is a
particular case of the long exact sequence of cohomology that we obtain via the
study of trajectories of the quiver. We introduce cohomology along paths, and
we compute it under suitable Tor vanishing hypotheses. The cup product on
Hochschild cohomology enables us to describe the connecting homomorphism of the
long exact sequence.
  Algebras arising from a linear category where the quiver is the round trip
one, provide square matrix algebras which have two algebras on the diagonal and
two bimodules on the corners. If the bimodules are projective, we show that
five-terms exact sequences arise. If the bimodules are free of rank one, we
provide a complete computation of the Hochschild cohomology. On the other hand,
if the corner bimodules are projective without producing new cycles, Hochschild
cohomology in large enough degrees is that of the product of the algebras on
the diagonal.
  As a by-product, we obtain some families of bound quiver algebras which are
of infinite global dimension, and have Hochschild cohomology zero in large
enough degrees.

interactions inside the system, which contains gravitational, electromagnetic
fields, the dynamic unit vector field describing the velocity of an aether, and
the pseudoscalar field associated with the axionic dark matter. The specific
feature of this model is that the axion field controls the dynamics of the
aether through the guiding functions incorporated into the Jacobson's
constitutive tensor. Depending on the state of the axion field these guiding
functions can control and switch on or switch off the influence of
acceleration, shear, vorticity and expansion of the aether flow on the state of
physical system as a whole. We obtain new exact solutions, which possess the
pp-wave symmetry, and indicate them by the term pp-wave aether modes in
contrast to the pure pp-waves, which can not propagate in this field
conglomerate. These exact solutions describe a specific dynamic state of the
pseudoscalar field, which corresponds to one of the minima of the axion
potential, and switches off the influence of shear and expansion of the aether
flow; the model does not impose restrictions on the Jacobson's coupling
constants and on the axion mass. Properties of these new exact solutions are
discussed.

both challenges by proposing a novel yet simple dynamic linear programming
discriminant (DLPD) rule for binary classification. Different from the usual
static linear discriminant analysis, the new method is able to capture the
changing distributions of the underlying populations by modeling their means
and covariances as smooth functions of covariates of interest. Under an
approximate sparse condition, we show that the conditional misclassification
rate of the DLPD rule converges to the Bayes risk in probability uniformly over
the range of the variables used for modeling the dynamics, when the
dimensionality is allowed to grow exponentially with the sample size. The
minimax lower bound of the estimation of the Bayes risk is also established,
implying that the misclassification rate of our proposed rule is minimax-rate
optimal. The promising performance of the DLPD rule is illustrated via
extensive simulation studies and the analysis of a breast cancer dataset.

measured before the outburst are in the mean of values measured for moderately

attributed to submicrometre-sized particles composed of absorbing material or
to porous fractal-like aggregates such as those collected by the Rosetta in
situ dust instruments. The power law index of the dust size distribution is in
the range 2-3. The sudden increase of infrared emission associated to the

300 K to up to 630 K) and a change of the dust colour at 2-2.5 $\mu$m from red
to blue colours, revealing the presence of very small grains ($\leq$ 100 nm) in
the outburst material. In addition, the measured large bolometric albedos
($\sim$ 0.7) indicate bright grains in the ejecta, which could either be
silicatic grains, implying the thermal degradation of the carbonaceous

smallest such set is denoted by $\gamma_{t[1, k]}(G)$. We consider $[1,
k]$-sets that are also independent. Note that not every graph has an
independent $[1, k]$-set. For graphs having an independent $[1, k]$-set, we
define $[1, k]$-independence numbers which is denoted by $\gamma_{i[1, k]}(G)$.
In this paper, we investigate the existence of $[1,k]$-sets in lexicographic
products $G\circ H$. Furthermore, we completely characterize graphs which their
lexicographic product has at least one total $[1,k]$-set. Also, we determine
$\gamma_{[1, k]}(G\circ H)$, $\gamma_{t[1, k]}(G\circ H)$ and $\gamma_{i[1,
k]}(G\circ H)$. Finally, we show that finding smallest total $[1, k]$-set is
$NP$-complete.

(UAV) as a mobile data collector for the ground sensor nodes (SNs) is an
energy-efficient technique to prolong the network lifetime. Specifically, since
the UAV can sequentially move close to each of the SNs when collecting data
from them and thus reduce the link distance for saving the SNs' transmission
energy. In this letter, considering a general fading channel model for the
SN-UAV links, we jointly optimize the SNs' wake-up schedule and UAV's
trajectory to minimize the maximum energy consumption of all SNs, while
ensuring that the required amount of data is collected reliably from each SN.
We formulate our design as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. By
applying the successive convex optimization technique, an efficient iterative

recognition using zone-wise information. Because of complex nature due to
compound characters, modifiers, overlapping and touching, etc., character
segmentation and recognition is a tedious job in Indic scripts (e.g.
Devanagari, Bangla, Gurumukhi, and other similar scripts). To avoid character
segmentation in such scripts, HMM-based sequence modeling has been used earlier
in holistic way. This paper proposes an efficient word recognition framework by
segmenting the handwritten word images horizontally into three zones (upper,
middle and lower) and recognize the corresponding zones. The main aim of this
zone segmentation approach is to reduce the number of distinct component
classes compared to the total number of classes in Indic scripts. As a result,
use of this zone segmentation approach enhances the recognition performance of
the system. The components in middle zone where characters are mostly touching
are recognized using HMM. After the recognition of middle zone, HMM based
Viterbi forced alignment is applied to mark the left and right boundaries of
the characters. Next, the residue components, if any, in upper and lower zones
in their respective boundary are combined to achieve the final word level
recognition. Water reservoir feature has been integrated in this framework to
improve the zone segmentation and character alignment defects while
segmentation. A novel sliding window-based feature, called Pyramid Histogram of
Oriented Gradient (PHOG) is proposed for middle zone recognition. An exhaustive
experiment is performed on two Indic scripts namely, Bangla and Devanagari for
the performance evaluation. From the experiment, it has been noted that
proposed zone-wise recognition improves accuracy with respect to the
traditional way of Indic word recognition.

of over 100 ns at room temperature in monolayer MoSe$_2$. These long lifetimes
are accompanied by an intriguing temperature dependence of the Kerr amplitude,
which increases with temperature up to 50 K and then abruptly switches sign.
Using ab initio simulations we explain the latter behavior in terms of the
intrinsic electron-phonon coupling and the activation of transitions to
secondary valleys. The phonon-assisted scattering of the photo-excited
electron-hole pairs prepares a valley spin polarization within the first few ps
after laser excitation. The sign of the total valley magnetization, and thus
the Kerr amplitude, switches as a function of temperature, as conduction and
valence band states exhibit different phonon-mediated inter-valley scattering
rates. However, the electron-phonon scattering on the ps time scale does not
provide an explanation for the long spin lifetimes. Hence, we deduce that the
initial spin polarization must be transferred into spin states which are
protected from the intrinsic electron-phonon coupling, and are most likely
resident charge carriers which are not part of the itinerant valence or
conduction band states.

Presumed to have a small rocky core, a deep interior comprising ~70% heavy
elements surrounded by a more dilute outer envelope of H2 and He, Uranus and
Neptune are fundamentally different from the better-explored gas giants Jupiter
and Saturn. Because of the lack of dedicated exploration missions, our
knowledge of the composition and atmospheric processes of these distant worlds
is primarily derived from remote sensing from Earth-based observatories and
space telescopes. As a result, Uranus's and Neptune's physical and atmospheric
properties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the
Solar System not well understood. Exploration of an ice giant system is
therefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (including the
magnetosphere, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior) challenge our
understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main
scientific goals to be addressed by a future in situ exploration of an ice
giant. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, about 5 scale
heights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i)
the formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the

severe streaking and shadow artifacts. Metal artifacts are caused by nonlinear
beam-hardening effects combined with other factors such as scatter and Poisson
noise. In this paper, we propose an implant-specific method that extracts
beam-hardening artifacts from CT images without affecting the background image.
We found that in cases where metal is inserted in the water (or tissue), the
generated beam-hardening artifacts can be approximately extracted by
subtracting artifacts generated exclusively by metals. We used a deep learning
technique to train nonlinear representations of beam-hardening artifacts
arising from metals, which appear as shadows and streaking artifacts. The
proposed network is not designed to identify ground-truth CT images (i.e., the
CT image before its corruption by metal artifacts). Consequently, these images
are not required for training. The proposed method was tested on a dataset
consisting of real CT scans of pelvises containing simulated hip prostheses.
The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning method successfully
extracts both shadowing and streaking artifacts.

larger family of observables than previously envisioned, such as those built
from continuous and nonlinear functionals of the density profiles. The general
expression of the observable aperture mass depends on reduced shear profile
making it a rather involved function of the projected density field. Because of
this difficulty, an approximation that is commonly employed consists in
replacing the reduced shear by the shear in such a construction neglecting
therefore non-linear effects. We were precisely able to quantify how this
approximation affects the $\hat{M}_{ap}$ statistical properties. In particular
we derive the corrective term for the skewness of the $\hat{M}_{ap}$ and

schemes have recently been developed to relate the halo density contrast
$\delta_h$ with the underlying density contrast $\delta$, divergence of
velocity $\theta$ and their higher-order derivatives. This is done by
constructing invariants such as $s, t, \psi,\eta$. We show how the generating
function formalism in Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) can be used
to show that many of the additional terms based on extended Galilean and
Lifshitz symmetry actually do not make any contribution to the higher-order

vertices of $\delta$ and $\theta$, the higher-order derivatives and the bias
coefficients. We also compute the cumulant correlators (CCs) for two different
tracer populations. These perturbative results are valid for tree-level
contributions but at an arbitrary order. We also take into account the
stochastic nature bias in our analysis. Extending previous results of a local
polynomial model of bias, we express the one-point cumulants ${\cal S}_N$ and
their two-point counterparts, the CCs i.e. ${\cal C}_{pq}$, of biased tracers

regime and two important parameters that have long been waited for: the core
rotation rate, and the asymptotic equidistant period spacing of these g modes.
The GOLF instrument on board the SOHO space observatory has provided two
decades of full-disk helioseismic data. In the present study, we search for
possible collective frequency modulations that are produced by periodic changes
in the deep solar structure. Such modulations provide access to only very low
frequency g modes, thus allowing statistical methods to take advantage of their
asymptotic properties. For oscillatory periods in the range between 9 and
nearly 48 hours, almost 100 g modes of spherical harmonic degree 1 and more
than 100 g modes of degree 2 are predicted. They are not observed individually,
but when combined, they unambiguouslyprovide their asymptotic period
equidistance and rotational splittings, in excellent agreement with the
requirements of the asymptotic approximations. Previously, p-mode
helioseismology allowed the g-mode period equidistance parameter $P_0$ to be
bracketed inside a narrow range, between approximately 34 and 35 minutes. Here,
$P_0$ is measured to be 34 min 01 s, with a 1 s uncertainty. The previously
unknown g-mode splittings have now been measured from a non-synodic reference
with very high accuracy, and they imply a mean weighted rotation of 1277 $\pm$
10 nHz (9-day period) of their kernels, resulting in a rapid rotation frequency
of 1644 $\pm$ 23 nHz (period of one week) of the solar core itself, which is a
factor 3.8 $\pm$ 0.1 faster than the rotation of the radiative envelope. The g
modes are known to be the keys to a better understanding of the structure and
dynamics of the solar core. Their detection with these precise parameters will
certainly stimulate a new era of research in this field.

tasks. This allows the learning of less noisy representations, and enables
unreliable predictors to exploit knowledge from the reliable predictors via the
shared latent features. Such asymmetric knowledge transfer through shared
features is also more scalable and efficient than inter-task asymmetric
transfer. We validate our Deep-AMTFL model on multiple benchmark datasets for

phase-lock between a train of laser pulses emitted by a mode-locked laser and a
surface acoustic wave generated electrically by the transducer. The transducer
design is based on a multi-harmonic split-finger architecture for the
excitation of a fundamental surface acoustic wave and a discrete number of its
overtones. Simply by introducing a variation of the transducer's periodicity
$p$, a frequency chirp is added. This combination results in wide frequency
bands for each harmonic. The transducer's conversion efficiency from the
electrical to the acoustic domain was characterized optomechanically using
single quantum dots acting as nanoscale pressure sensors. The ability to
generate surface acoustic waves over a wide band of frequencies enables
advanced acousto-optic spectroscopy using mode-locked lasers with fixed
repetition rate. Stable phase-locking between the electrically generated
acoustic wave and the train of laser pulses was confirmed by performing
stroboscopic spectroscopy on a single quantum dot at a frequency of 320 MHz.
Finally, the dynamic spectral modulation of the quantum dot was directly
monitored in the time domain combining stable phase-locked optical excitation
and time-correlated single photon counting. The demonstrated scheme will be
particularly useful for the experimental implementation of surface acoustic
wave-driven quantum gates of optically addressable qubits or collective quantum
states or for multi-component Fourier synthesis of tailored nanomechanical
waveforms.

far, this has not been achieved because of the impedance mismatch within

that 14 fs optical pulses in the near-infrared (NIR) can drive electronic

pulses propagate in microscopic striplines on a millimeter scale. We exploit
femtosecond photoswitches based on tunneling barriers in nanoscale metal
junctions to drive the pulses. The non-linear ultrafast response is based on a
combination of plasmonically enhanced, multi-photon absorption and quantum

gravitational lensing is a primary tool to study the total mass distribution in
such systems. Combined with X-ray and optical analyses, mass maps of cluster
mergers reconstructed from weak-lensing observations have been used to
constrain the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. The dynamically
complex Abell 520 (A520) cluster is an exceptional case, even among merging
systems: multi-wavelength observations have revealed a surprising high
mass-to-light concentration of dark mass, the interpretation of which is
difficult under the standard assumption of effectively collisionless dark
matter. We revisit A520 using a new sparsity-based mass-mapping algorithm to
independently assess the presence of the puzzling dark core. We obtain
high-resolution mass reconstructions from two separate galaxy shape catalogs
derived from Hubble Space Telescope observations of the system. Our mass maps
agree well overall with the results of previous studies, but we find important
differences. In particular, although we are able to identify the dark core at a
certain level in both data sets, it is at much lower significance than has been
reported before using the same data. As we cannot confirm the detection in our

pleiotropy), and the MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) method, in which
a genetic variant may be directly associated with the outcome not via the risk
factor of interest, so long as the direct effects of the variants on the

in terms of plausibility of the assumption needed for consistent causal

employ the vortex Mott states formed by superconducting vortices in a regular
array of pinning sites. The applied electric current delocalizes vortices and
drives the dynamic vortex Mott transition. Here we report the critical behavior
of the vortex system as it crosses the DMT line, driven by either current or
temperature. We find universal scaling with respect to both, expressed by the
same scaling function and characterized by a single critical exponent
coinciding with the exponent for the thermodynamic Mott transition. We develop
a theory for the DMT based on the parity reflection-time reversal (PT) symmetry
breaking formalism and find that the nonequilibrium-induced Mott transition has
the same critical behavior as thermal Mott transition. Our findings demonstrate
the existence of physical systems in which the effect of nonequilibrium drive
is to generate effective temperature and hence the transition belonging in the

are suitable to understand usability issues and user requirements early.
Nevertheless, users are often dissatisfied with the usability of a resulting
software. Apparently, previously explored information was lost or no longer
accessible during the development phase. Scenarios are one effective practice
to describe behavior. However, they are commonly notated in natural language
which is often improper to capture and communicate interaction knowledge
comprehensible to developers and users. The dynamic aspect of interaction is
lost if only static descriptions are used. Digital prototyping enables the
creation of interactive prototypes by adding responsive controls to hand- or
digitally drawn mockups. We propose to capture the events of these controls to
obtain a representation of the interaction. From this data, we generate videos,
which demonstrate interaction sequences, as additional support for textual
scenarios. Variants of scenarios can be created by modifying the captured event
sequences and mockups. Any change is unproblematic since videos only need to be

characterized by large and heterogeneous groups of stakeholders, such as
municipalities, companies, interest groups, citizens, women and men, young
people and children. Current techniques for participation are slow, laborious
and costly, and they tend to miss out on many stakeholders or interest groups.
We propose a triple shift in perspective: (1) Discourse is reframed as a
requirements process with the explicit goal to state software, hardware, and
organizational requirements. (2) Due to the above-mentioned characteristics of
spatial planning problems, we suggest using techniques of requirements
engineering (RE) and CrowdRE for getting stakeholders (e.g. user groups)

transverse spin relaxation times of magnetic single adatoms deposited on
metallic substrates. Our analysis based on time-dependent density functional
theory shows that the longitudinal time, $T_{\parallel}$, is of order
femtosecond while the transverse time, $T_{\perp}$, is of order picosecond,
i.e. $T_{\perp}\gg T_{\parallel}$. This comes as a consequence of the different
energy scales of the corresponding processes: $T_{\parallel}$ involves
spin-density excitations of order eV, while $T_{\perp}$ is governed by atomic
spin-excitations of order meV. Comparison to available inelastic scanning
tunneling spectroscopy $\mathrm{d}I/\mathrm{d}V$ experimental curves shows that
the order of magnitude of $T_{\perp}$ agrees well with our results. Regarding
$T_{\parallel}$, the time scale calculated here is several orders of magnitude
faster than what has been measured up to now; we therefore propose that an
ultrafast laser pulse measuring technique is required in order to access the
ultrafast spin-dynamics described in this work.

low-energy systems. We show that, while these terms imply the Majorana
condition, the opposite is not always true when more than one flavour is
involved. This is an important aspect for the low-energy realizations of the
Majorana mass terms exploiting superfluid pairings, because in this case the
Majorana condition is not implemented in the spinor space, but in an internal
(flavour) space. Moreover, these mass terms generally involve opposite
effective chiralities, similarly to a Dirac mass term. The net effect of these
features is that the Majorana condition does not imply a Majorana mass term.
Accordingly the obtained Majorana spinors, as well as the resulting symmetry
breaking pattern and low-energy spectrum, are qualitatively different from the
ones known in particle physics. This result has important phenomenological
consequences, e.g. implies that these mass terms are unsuitable to induce an
effective see-saw mechanism, proposed to give mass to neutrinos. Finally, we
introduce and discuss schemes based on space-dependent pairings with nonzero
total momentum to illustrate how genuine Majorana mass terms may emerge in
low-energy quantum systems.

with a spin locked perpendicularly to it in the surface plane. While the
principal spin generation capability of topological insulators is well
established, comparatively little is known about the interaction of the spins
with external stimuli like polarized light. We observe a helical,
bias-dependent photoconductance at the lateral edges of topological Bi2Te2Se
platelets for perpendicular incidence of light. The same edges exhibit also a
finite bias-dependent Kerr angle, indicative of spin accumulation induced by a
transversal spin Hall effect in the bulk states of the Bi2Te2Se platelets. A

longitudinal photoconductance and photocurrent phenomena, but consistent with
the accumulated spins being transported in the side facets of the platelets.

hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we
develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which
learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the

future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop,
generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video
prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable
from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the
future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the
future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual
motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations
with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational
autoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion

significantly decreasing the critical magnetic field of the Fredericksz
transition (the magnetic Fredericksz threshold) in a mixture of nematic liquid
crystals and ferromagnetic particles, the so-called ferronematics. This
phenomenon has rarely been measured, usually due to soft homeotropic anchoring
induced at the nanoparticle surface. Here we present an optical study of the
magnetic Fredericksz transition combined with a light scattering study of the
classical nematic liquid crystal, 5CB, doped with 6 nm diameter magnetic and
non-magnetic nanoparticles. Surprisingly, for both nanoparticles, we observe at
room temperature a net decrease of the threshold field of the Fredericksz
transition at low nanoparticle concentrations, which appears associated with a
coating of the nanoparticles by a brush of polydimethylsiloxane copolymer
chains inducing planar anchoring of the director on the nanoparticle surface.
Moreover the magnetic Fredericksz threshold exhibits non-monotonic behaviour as
a function of the nanoparticle concentration for both types of nanoparticles,
first decreasing down to a value from 23\% to 31\% below that of pure 5CB, then
increasing with a further increase of nanoparticle concentration. This is
interpreted as an aggregation starting at around 0.02 weight fraction that
consumes more isolated nanoparticles than those introduced when the
concentration is increased above $c = 0.05$ weight fraction (volume fraction
$3.5 \times 10^{-2}$). This shows the larger effect of isolated nanoparticles
on the threshold with respect to aggregates. From dynamic light scattering
measurements we deduced that, if the decrease of the magnetic threshold when
the nanoparticle concentration increases is similar for both kinds of
nanoparticles, the origin of this decrease is different for magnetic and
non-magnetic nanoparticles. For non-magnetic nanoparticles, the behavior may be
associated with a decrease of the elastic constant due to weak planar
anchoring. For magnetic nanoparticles there are non-negligible local magnetic
interactions between liquid crystal molecules and magnetic nanoparticles,
leading to an increase of the average order parameter. This magnetic
interaction thus favors an easier liquid crystal director rotation in the
presence of external magnetic field, able to reorient the magnetic moments of
the nanoparticles along with the molecules.

Our study focusses on the formation and evolution of terrestrial-like planets

to analyse the long-term dynamical stability of the resulting systems. A
semi-analytic model was used to define the properties of a protoplanetary disk

$\sim$2.7 au for a solar-mass star. Then, it was used to describe the evolution
of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase up to the formation of
the Jupiter-mass planet, and we used the results as the initial conditions to
carry out N-body simulations of planetary accretion. Our simulations produce
three different classes of planets in the HZ: 'water worlds', with masses
between 2.75 $M_{\oplus}$ and 3.57 $M_{\oplus}$ and water contents of 58% and
75% by mass, terrestrial-like planets, with masses ranging from 0.58
$M_{\oplus}$ to 3.8 $M_{\oplus}$ and water contents less than 1.2% by mass, and
'dry worlds', simulations of which show no water. A relevant result suggests
the efficient coexistence in the HZ of a Jupiter-mass planet and a
terrestrial-like planet with a percentage of water by mass comparable to the
Earth. Moreover, our study indicates that these planetary systems are
dynamically stable for at least 1 Gyr. Systems with a Jupiter-mass planet

of the Bose enhancement of the optical transition dipole moment between the
initial atomic state and an intermediate molecular state. We study the effect
of Bose enhancement by measuring the transition Rabi frequency in a BEC and by
comparing it with measurements for two atoms in sites of a Mott insulator. By
breaking the dimers' bond and directly observing the separated atoms, we
measure the molecular inelastic collision rate parameters. We discuss the

derive the generating function across the whole phase diagram, using an
obstinate kernel method. This gives the leading behaviour of the Renyi entropy

the result for a Bernoulli measure and we conjecture that this holds for all
Renyi entropies. Within the maximal current phase the correction to the leading
behaviour is logarithmic in the system size. Finally, we remark upon a special
property of equilibrium systems whereby discontinuities in the Renyi entropy
arise away from phase transitions, which we refer to as secondary transitions.

the notion that these are specific to equilibrium cases.

quasar spectra show Civ emission line without suffering from a heavy
atmospheric absorption, we estimate the black hole mass (M$_{BH}$) and
Eddington ratio (L/L$_{Edd}$) of them. The inferred log M$_{BH}$ are
9.04+/-0.14 and 8.53+/-0.20, respectively. In addition, the inferred log
(L/L$_{Edd}$) are -1.00+/-0.15 and -0.42+/-0.22, respectively. If we adopt that
L/L$_{Edd}$= constant or $\propto$ (1+z)^2, the seed black hole masses
(M$_{seed}$) of our z~5 faint quasars are expected to be >10^5 M$_\odot$ in
most cases. We also compare the observational results with a mass accretion
model where angular momentum is lost due to supernova explosions (Kawakatu &
Wada 2008). Accordingly, M$_{BH}$ of the z~5 faint quasars in our sample can be
explained even if M$_{seed}$ is ~10^3M$_\odot$. Since z~6 luminous qusars and
our z~5 faint quasars are not on the same evolutionary track, z~6 luminous
quasars and our z~5 quasars are not the same populations but different
populations, due to the difference of a period of the mass supply from host
galaxies. Furthermore, we confirm that one can explain M$_{BH}$ of z~6 luminous

improvement on paired/unpaired image-to-image translation, such as
photo$\rightarrow$ sketch and artist painting style transfer. However, existing
models can only be capable of transferring the low-level information (e.g.
color or texture changes), but fail to edit high-level semantic meanings (e.g.,
geometric structure or content) of objects. On the other hand, while some
researches can synthesize compelling real-world images given a class label or
caption, they cannot condition on arbitrary shapes or structures, which largely
limits their application scenarios and interpretive capability of model
results. In this work, we focus on a more challenging semantic manipulation
task, which aims to modify the semantic meaning of an object while preserving
its own characteristics (e.g. viewpoints and shapes), such as
cow$\rightarrow$sheep, motor$\rightarrow$ bicycle, cat$\rightarrow$dog. To
tackle such large semantic changes, we introduce a contrasting GAN
(contrast-GAN) with a novel adversarial contrasting objective. Instead of
directly making the synthesized samples close to target data as previous GANs
did, our adversarial contrasting objective optimizes over the distance
comparisons between samples, that is, enforcing the manipulated data be
semantically closer to the real data with target category than the input data.
Equipped with the new contrasting objective, a novel mask-conditional
contrast-GAN architecture is proposed to enable disentangle image background
with object semantic changes. Experiments on several semantic manipulation
tasks on ImageNet and MSCOCO dataset show considerable performance gain by our
contrast-GAN over other conditional GANs. Quantitative results further
demonstrate the superiority of our model on generating manipulated results with
high visual fidelity and reasonable object semantics.

  in Semi-Metric Spaces",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a unified framework for sampling, clustering and
embedding data points in semi-metric spaces. For a set of data points
$\Omega=\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ in a semi-metric space, we consider a
complete graph with $n$ nodes and $n$ self edges and then map each data point
in $\Omega$ to a node in the graph with the edge weight between two nodes being
the distance between the corresponding two points in $\Omega$. By doing so,
several well-known sampling techniques can be applied for clustering data
points in a semi-metric space. One particularly interesting sampling technique
is the exponentially twisted sampling in which one can specify the desired
average distance from the sampling distribution to detect clusters with various
resolutions.
  We also propose a softmax clustering algorithm that can perform a clustering
and embed data points in a semi-metric space to a low dimensional Euclidean
space. Our experimental results show that after a certain number of iterations
of ""training"", our softmax algorithm can reveal the ""topology"" of the data from
a high dimensional Euclidean. We also show that the eigendecomposition of a
covariance matrix is equivalent to the principal component analysis (PCA).
  To deal with the hierarchical structure of clusters, our softmax clustering
algorithm can also be used with a hierarchical clustering algorithm. For this,
we propose a partitional-hierarchical algorithm, called $i$PHD, in this paper.
Our experimental results show that those algorithms based on the maximization
of normalized modularity tend to balance the sizes of detected clusters and
thus do not perform well when the ground-truth clusters are different in sizes.
Also, using a metric is better than using a semi-metric as the triangular
inequality is not satisfied for a semi-metric and that is more prone to
clustering errors.

in the nano-optomechanical devices, in contrast to the Maxwell Stress Tensor
(MST). In this work, we apply first principles to show explicitly why these
methods must agree with the MST formalism in linear lossless systems. We apply
the RTOF multi-port, to show that the optical force expression on these devices
can be extended to analyze multiple light sources, broadband sources, and
multimode devices, with multiple degrees of freedom. We also show that the DR
method, when expressed as a function of the derivative of the effective index
performed at a fixed wave vector, may be misinterpreted and lead to
overestimated results.

variables (CVs) and generates a spectrum that is bluer than the observed UV
spectra [Puebla et al 2007]. X-ray observations of these systems reveal an
optically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the
disk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing
the inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation
radius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that
better fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV
spectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the
VY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a
cold modified disk ($\dot{M} \sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,
the slightly modified disk ($\dot{M} \sim 6 \times 10^{-9}M_{\odot}$/yr)
completely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray
observations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with
ADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely
launching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD
temperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the
X-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small
CV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the
International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same
order as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U
Gem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's.

flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to
understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale
chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning
tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured,
high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what
are the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either
failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate
feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an
attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a
unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin
factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of
multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and
to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome
trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it
to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions
per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in
human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention
scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature
visualization methods such as saliency map.

proposed multi-state model can be regarded as a generalisation of the commonly
applied set of closed population models to a multi-state form. The model
permits individuals to move between the different discrete states, whilst
allowing heterogeneity within the capture probabilities. A closed-form
expression for the likelihood is presented in terms of a set of sufficient
statistics. The link between existing models for capture heterogeneity are
established, and simulation is used to show that the estimate of population
size can be biased when movement between states is not accounted for. The
proposed unconditional approach is also compared to a conditional approach to
assess estimation bias. The model derived in this paper is motivated by a real

modified nested set model, originally described by Celko and applied to
hydrodynamic models by Haag and Shokoufandeh in 2017. The proposed algorithm
creates watershed boundaries by marching around the edges of its' corresponding
region, never entering the internal area. In contrast to existing algorithms
that scales in proportional to the area of the underlying region, the
complexity of the HSM algorithm is proportional to the boundary length. Results

two-qubit invariants of Makhlin and Jing et. al. These invariants allow to
fully reconstruct any two-qubit state up to local unitaries. We demonstrate
that measuring 3 invariants is sufficient to find, e.g., the optimal Bell
inequality violation. These invariants can be measured with local or nonlocal
measurements. We show that the nonlocal strategy that follows from Makhlin's
invariants is more resource-efficient than local strategy following from the
invariants of Jing et al. To measure all of the Makhlin's invariants directly
one needs to use both two-qubit singlet and three-qubit W-state projections on
multiple copies of the two-qubit state. This problem is equivalent to a
cordinate system handness measurement. We demonstrate that these 3-qubit
measurements can be performed by utilizing Hong-Ou-Mandel interference which
gives significant speedup in comparison to the classical handness measurement.

by optical forces. The dispersion forces are calculated using a modified
Lifshitz theory, in order to take into account the device thickness and
material s dielectric permittivities, which are obtained from experimental
optical data and validated by means of a rigorous 3D FDTD simulation. We also
take into account the mechanical nonlinearity of the waveguide, which is caused
by its large deflection relative to its thickness, due to the nanoscale device
dimensions. The nonlinear mechanical analytical model is also validated using a
3D FEM simulation. Our results show that, under appropriate design conditions,
it is possible to attain a no pull in critical point due only to the optical
force; therefore, in principle, it would be possible to control the device
total deflection just by controlling the optical power. However, the dispersion
forces usually impose a pull in critical point to the device and establish a
minimal initial gap between the waveguide and the substrate. Furthermore, we
show that the geometric nonlinearity effect may be exploited in order to avoid
or minimize the pull in and, therefore, the device collapse.

hundredths of days observed in the pre-outburst light curve of the classical
nova KT Eri continue after the outburst but appear not to be strictly periodic.
Furthermore, the long term post-outburst light curve exhibits modulations with
quasi-periods of quite different length. Thus, these variations cannot be due
to aspect related variations in a system with a giant component similar to some

randomly selected features as its centroids, and learns a one-hot encoder by
one-nearest-neighbor optimization. The estimator generates a sparse
representation for each data point. Then, we construct a nonlinear kernel
matrix from the sparse representation of data. One major advantage of the
proposed kernel method is that it is relatively insensitive to its free
parameters, and therefore, it can produce reasonable results without parameter
tuning. Another advantage is that it is simple. We conjecture that the proposed
method can find its applications in many learning tasks or methods where sparse
representation or kernel matrix is explored. In this preliminary study, we have
applied the kernel matrix to spectral clustering. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the kernel generated by the proposed method outperforms the
well-tuned Gaussian RBF kernel. This abstract paper is used to protect the

out strong stochastic effects in the optical spectra. In addition, we also
analyze deep colour-magnitude diagrams of the clusters to provide independent

age-spreads in the clusters, a top-heavy initial mass function, different SSP
models and the role of red supergiant stars (RSG). We find that the strong

increased fraction of about 20 per cent by luminosity of RSG above what is
predicted by canonical stellar evolution models. Given the uncertainties in
stellar evolution at Myr ages, we cannot presently rule-out the presence of Myr
age-spreads in these clusters. Our work combines different wavelengths as well

Although there has been extensive research on recognition of facial
expressions, the performance of existing approaches is challenged by facial
occlusions. Facial occlusions are often treated as noise and discarded in
recognition of affective states. However, hand over face occlusions can provide
additional information for recognition of some affective states such as
curiosity, frustration and boredom. One of the reasons that this problem has
not gained attention is the lack of naturalistic occluded faces that contain
hand over face occlusions as well as other types of occlusions. Traditional
approaches for obtaining affective data are time demanding and expensive, which
limits researchers in affective computing to work on small datasets. This
limitation affects the generalizability of models and deprives researchers from
taking advantage of recent advances in deep learning that have shown great
success in many fields but require large volumes of data. In this paper, we
first introduce a novel framework for synthesizing naturalistic facial
occlusions from an initial dataset of non-occluded faces and separate images of
hands, reducing the costly process of data collection and annotation. We then
propose a model for facial occlusion type recognition to differentiate between
hand over face occlusions and other types of occlusions such as scarves, hair,
glasses and objects. Finally, we present a model to localize hand over face
occlusions and identify the occluded regions of the face.

pre-processing step and then extracted patches are passed through a DCNN, which
assigns an output label to the central pixel of each patch. Morphological
operators are used for post-processing to remove small false positives around
the edges. A two-phase weighted training method is introduced and evaluated

non-negligible source of the excited-state contamination in lattice simulations
at the physical point. It is shown that baryon chiral perturbation theory
(ChPT) can be employed to calculate the contamination due to two-particle
nucleon-pion states in various nucleon observables. Results to leading order
are presented for the nucleon axial, tensor and scalar charge and three Mellin
moments of parton distribution functions: the average quark momentum fraction,
the helicity and the transversity moment. Taking into account experimental and
phenomenological results for the charges and moments the impact of the
nucleon-pion-states on lattice estimates for these observables can be
estimated. The nucleon-pion-state contribution leads to an overestimation of
all charges and moments obtained with the plateau method. The overestimation is
at the 5-10% level for source-sink separations of about 2 fm. Existing lattice
data is not in conflict with the ChPT predictions, but the comparison suggests
that significantly larger source-sink separations are needed to compute the
charges and moments with few-percent precision.

a catalyst. We show that the amount of `resource' contained in a given state,
in the asymptotic scenario, is equal to the regularized relative entropy of
resource of that state, which then yields a straightforward operational meaning
to this quantity. Such an answer has been long sought for in any resource
theory since the usefulness of a state in information-processing tasks is
directly related to the amount of resource the state possesses in the
beginning. While we need to place a few assumptions in our resource theoretical
framework, it is still general enough and includes quantum resource theory of
entanglement, coherence, asymmetry, non-uniformity, purity, contextuality,
stabilizer computation and the classical resource theory of randomness
extraction as special cases. Since our resource theoretic framework includes
entanglement theory, our result also implies that the amount of noise one has
to inject locally in order to erase all entanglement contained in an entangled
state is equal to the regularized relative entropy of entanglement, resolving
an open question posted in [Groisman et al., Phys. Rev. A. 72: 032317, 2005].
On the way to prove the main result, we also quantify the amount of resource
contained in a state in the one-shot setting (where one only has a single copy

employs a recently developed technique of convex-split lemma.

array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has detected Vela X as one of
the brightest known sources of TeV gamma rays. The bulk of the gamma-ray
emission measured using H.E.S.S. coincides with an elongated structure known
from X-ray observations and dubbed the cocoon, that seemingly emanates from the
region of the pulsar wind termination shock. The spectral energy distribution
of the cocoon peaks at around 10 TeV, and then presents a cutoff that can be
precisely measured with H.E.S.S. owing to the extreme brightness of the source.
Electrons radiating inverse-Compton gamma rays in the cutoff region are the
same responsible for the X-ray synchrotron emission at energies $> 1$ keV.
Therefore, Vela X provides a unique test case, in which we can constrain the
densities and spectra of accelerated leptons in the cutoff regime, as well as
the magnetic field properties, with minimal modeling assumptions. Thanks to the
proximity/large apparent size of the source, this can be done in a
spatially-resolved fashion across the PWN. We will present an analysis of

of the Fokker-Planck equation with a discrete representation of the shift
(Koopman) operator on a set of basis functions generated via the diffusion maps
algorithm. While the choice of these basis functions is provably optimal under
appropriate conditions, computing these basis functions is quite expensive
since it requires the eigendecomposition of an $N\times N$ diffusion matrix,
where $N$ denotes the data size and could be very large. For large-scale
forecasting problems, only a few leading eigenvectors are computationally
achievable. To overcome this computational bottleneck, a new set of basis
functions constructed by orthonormalizing selected columns of the diffusion
matrix and its leading eigenvectors is proposed. This computation can be
carried out efficiently via the unpivoted Householder QR factorization. The
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm will be shown in both

lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$. This walk can traverse the same face twice, but crosses
any edge at most once. The weight of a walk is a product of local weights: each
square visited by the walk yields a weight that depends on the way the walk
passes through it. The local weights are parametrised by angles
$\theta\in[\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}]$ and satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation.
The self-avoiding walk is embedded in the plane by replacing the square faces
of the grid with rhombi with corresponding angles.
  By means of the Yang-Baxter transformation, we show that the 2-point function
of the walk in the half-plane does not depend on the rhombic tiling (i.e. on
the angles chosen). In particular, this statistic coincides with that of the
self-avoiding walk on the hexagonal lattice. Indeed, the latter can be obtained
by choosing all angles $\theta$ equal to $\frac{\pi}{3}$.
  For the hexagonal lattice, the critical fugacity of SAW was recently proved
to be equal to $1+\sqrt{2}$. We show that the same is true for any choice of
angles. In doing so, we also give a new short proof to the fact that the
partition function of self-avoiding bridges in a strip of the hexagonal lattice
tends to 0 as the width of the strip tends to infinity. This proof also yields
a quantitative bound on the convergence.

limit for the minimum size scale of spotty structures that develop dynamically.
Quantum shear suppression is given by gradients of the quantum terms of J's
vorticity. Used as a new measure of quantum dynamics applied to several
evolving closed conservative 1D bound state systems, we find that shear
suppression explains the saturation at Zurek's scale limit and additionally
singles out special quantum states.

satisfied. If the constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously, it is
desirable to identify the core problems among them. Such cores are called
minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes). The more MUSes are identified, the more
information about the conflicts among the constraints is obtained. However, a
full enumeration of all MUSes is in general intractable due to the large number
(even exponential) of possible conflicts. Moreover, to identify MUSes
algorithms must test sets of constraints for their simultaneous satisfiabilty.
The type of the test depends on the application domains. The complexity of
tests can be extremely high especially for domains like temporal logics, model
checking, or SMT. In this paper, we propose a recursive algorithm that
identifies MUSes in an online manner (i.e., one by one) and can be terminated
at any time. The key feature of our algorithm is that it minimizes the number
of satisfiability tests and thus speeds up the computation. The algorithm is
applicable to an arbitrary constraint domain and its effectiveness demonstrates
itself especially in domains with expensive satisfiability checks. We benchmark
our algorithm against state of the art algorithm on Boolean and SMT constraint
domains and demonstrate that our algorithm really requires less satisfiability
tests and consequently finds more MUSes in given time limits.

issue of second-order gauge transformations on the CMB. By introducing two
rules (needed to handle the subtle issues), we prove the gauge invariance of

address them in a systematic way, it is necessary to assess a large number of
scenarios. Given this, we propose a frequency stability assessment framework
based on a time-series approach that facilitates the analysis of a large number
of future power system scenarios. We use this framework to assess the frequency
stability of the Australian future power system by considering a large number
of future scenarios and sensitivity of different parameters. By doing this, we
identify a maximum non-synchronous instantaneous penetration range from the
frequency stability point of view. Further, to reduce the detrimental impacts
of high NS-RES penetration on system frequency stability, a dynamic inertia
constraint is derived and incorporated in the market dispatch model. The
results show that such a constraint guarantees frequency stability of the
system for all credible contingencies. Also, we assess and quantify the
contribution of synchronous condensers, synthetic inertia of wind farms and a
governor-like response from de-loaded wind farms on system frequency stability.
The results show that the last option is the most effective one.

that models the effects of stochastic media on particle transport by generating
on-the-fly the material interfaces seen by the random walkers during their

solving the approximate Levermore-Pomraning equations for linear particle
transport, enables a considerable speed-up with respect to transport in
quenched disorder, where ensemble-averaging of the Boltzmann equation with
respect to all possible realizations is needed. However, CLS intrinsically
neglects the correlations induced by the spatial disorder, so that the accuracy
of the solutions obtained by using this algorithm must be carefully verified
with respect to reference solutions based on quenched disorder realizations.
When the disorder is described by Markov mixing statistics, such comparisons
have been attempted so far only for one-dimensional geometries, of the rod or
slab type. In this work we extend these results to Markov media in
two-dimensional (extruded) and three-dimensional geometries, by revisiting the
classical set of benchmark configurations originally proposed by Adams, Larsen

discrepancies between CLS and reference solutions for scalar particle flux and

synchronization model, introduced here, implicates these oscillations in the
combination of cortical association mechanisms with stimulus-response and
reinforcement mechanisms in the basal ganglia. In the core mechanism of the
model, oscillatory patterns in cortex are selected by and routed through the
basal ganglia to the thalamus phase-coherently, then circulated back to widely
separated areas of cortex, synchronizing those areas and functionally
connecting them. Corticostriatal and striatonigral conduction delays are
crucial to this mechanism, and evidence suggests that these delays are
unusually long, and unusually varied, in arrangements that might facilitate
learning of useful time alignments and associated resonant frequencies. Other
structural arrangements in the basal ganglia show further specialization for
this role, with convergence in the inputs from cortex, and divergence in many
of the return paths to cortex, that systematically reflect corticocortical
anatomical connectivity. The basal ganglia also target the dopaminergic,
cholinergic, and serotonergic centers of the brainstem and basal forebrain, and
the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, structures broadly implicated in the
modulation of oscillatory network activity and expressions of plasticity. By
learning to coordinate these various output channels, the basal ganglia are
positioned to facilitate and synchronize activity in selected areas of cortex,

arises in the ${N}$ when the product of anomalous Green's functions of the

radial and azimuthal velocities in the outer disc. From the variations of the
in-plane velocities with the Galactocentric radius for the younger and older
populations, we find that both radial and azimuthal velocities are not
axisymmetric at $8<R<14\,kpc$. The two red clump populations show that the mean
radial velocity is negative within $R\sim9\,kpc$ and positive beyond. This is
likely because of the perturbation induced by the rotating bar. The cross-zero
radius, $R\sim9$\, kpc, essentially indicates the rough location of the outer
Lindblad resonance (OLR) radius. Given the circular speed of 238\,km$\rm
s^{-1}$, then the pattern speed of the bar can be approximated as $45$\,km$\rm
s^{-1}\rm kpc^{-1}$. The young red clump stars show larger mean radial velocity
than the old population by about 3$\,km\rm s^{-1}$ between $R\sim9$ and
12\,kpc. This is possibly because the younger population is more sensitive to
the perturbation than the older one. The radial profiles of the mean azimuthal
velocity for the two populations show an interesting U-shape, i.e. at
$R<10.5\,kpc$, the azimuthal velocity declines with $R$ by about 10$\,km\rm
s^{-1}$, while at $R>10.5$ it increases with $R$ to 240-245$\,km\rm s^{-1}$. It
is not clear why the mean azimuthal velocity shows the U-shape along the
Galactic anti-centre direction. Meanwhile, the azimuthal velocity for the
younger population is slightly larger than the older one and the difference
moderately declines with $R$. Beyond $R\sim12\,kpc$, the azimuthal velocities
for the two populations are indistinguishable.

misclassify so-called ""adversarial examples"": maliciously generated images
formed by making imperceptible modifications to pixel values. With growing
interest in deep learning for security applications, it is important for
security experts and users of machine learning to recognize how learning
systems may be attacked. Due to the complex nature of deep learning, it is
challenging to understand how deep models can be fooled by adversarial
examples. Thus, we present a web-based visualization tool,
Adversarial-Playground, to demonstrate the efficacy of common adversarial
methods against a convolutional neural network (CNN) system.
Adversarial-Playground is educational, modular and interactive. (1) It enables
non-experts to compare examples visually and to understand why an adversarial
example can fool a CNN-based image classifier. (2) It can help security experts
explore more vulnerability of deep learning as a software module. (3) Building
an interactive visualization is challenging in this domain due to the large
feature space of image classification (generating adversarial examples is slow
in general and visualizing images are costly). Through multiple novel design
choices, our tool can provide fast and accurate responses to user requests.
Empirically, we find that our client-server division strategy reduced the
response time by an average of 1.5 seconds per sample. Our other innovation, a
faster variant of JSMA evasion algorithm, empirically performed twice as fast
as JSMA and yet maintains a comparable evasion rate.

transmissions in order to guarantee a strong security in wireless networks. In
this work, we examine the possibility and achievable performance of covert
communication in one-way relay networks. Specifically, the relay is greedy and
opportunistically transmits its own information to the destination covertly on
top of forwarding the source's message, while the source tries to detect this
covert transmission to discover the illegitimate usage of the resource (e.g.,
power, spectrum) allocated only for the purpose of forwarding source's
information. We propose two strategies for the relay to transmit its covert
information, namely fixed-rate and fixed-power transmission schemes, for which
the source's detection limits are analysed in terms of the false alarm and miss
detection rates and the achievable effective covert rates from the relay to
destination are derived. Our examination determines the conditions under which
the fixed-rate transmission scheme outperforms the fixed-power transmission
scheme, and vice versa, which enables the relay to achieve the maximum
effective covert rate. Our analysis indicates that the relay has to forward the
source's message to shield its covert transmission and the effective covert
rate increases with its forwarding ability (e.g., its maximum transmit power).

computation of the eigenvalues (discrete or solitonic spectrum) of the
non-Hermitian version of the Zakharov-Shabat spectral problem, this article
delivers new algorithms that combine the best features of the existing ones and
thereby allays their relative weaknesses. Our algorithm is modelled within the
remit of the so-called direct nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) associated with
the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. First, we present the data for
the calibration of methods comparing the relative errors associated with the
computation of the continuous NF spectrum. Then each method is paired with
different numerical algorithms for finding zeros of a complex-valued function
to obtain the eigenvalues. Next we describe a new class of methods based on the
contour integrals evaluation for the efficient search of eigenvalues. After
that, we introduce a new hybrid method, one of our main results: the method
combines the advances of contour integral approach and makes use of the
iterative algorithms at its second stage for the refined eigenvalues search.
The veracity of our new hybrid algorithm is established by estimating the
convergence speed and accuracy across three independent test profiles. Along
with the development of a new approach for the computation of the eigenvalues,
our study also addresses the problem of computation of the so-called norming
constants associated with the eigenvalues. We show that our formalism
effectively amounts to accurate and fast enough computation of residues of the
reflection coefficient in the upper complex half-plane of the spectral
parameter.

stabilize the training of deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed
method modifies a family of activation functions as nonlinearity generators
(NGs). NGs make the activation functions linear symmetric for their inputs to
lower model capacity, and automatically introduce nonlinearity to enhance the
capacity of the model during training. The proposed method can be considered an
unusual form of regularization: the model parameters are obtained by training a
relatively low-capacity model, that is relatively easy to optimize at the
beginning, with only a few iterations, and these parameters are reused for the
initialization of a higher-capacity model. We derive the upper and lower bounds
of variance of the weight variation, and show that the initial symmetric
structure of NGs helps stabilize training. We evaluate the proposed method on
different frameworks of convolutional neural networks over two object
recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). Experimental results
showed that the proposed method allows us to (1) speed up the convergence of
training, (2) allow for less careful weight initialization, (3) improve or at
least maintain the performance of the model at negligible extra computational
cost, and (4) easily train a very deep model.

serves as one of the most common parasites in the world. For a successful lytic
cycle, T. gondii must traverse biological barriers in order to invade host
cells, and as such, motility is critical for its virulence. Calcium signaling,
governed by fluctuations in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentrations, is
utilized universally across life and regulates many cellular processes,
including the stimulation of T. gondii virulence factors such as motility.
Therefore, increases in cytosolic calcium, called calcium oscillations, serve
as a means to link and quantify the intracellular signaling processes that lead
to T. gondii motility and invasion. Here, we describe our work extracting,
quantifying and modeling motility patterns of T. gondii before and after the
addition of pharmacological drugs and/or extracellular calcium. We demonstrate
a computational pipeline including a robust tracking system using optical flow
and dense trajectory features to extract T. gondii motility patterns. Using
this pipeline, we were able to track changes in T.gondii motility in response
to cytosolic Ca2+ fluxes in extracellular parasites. This allows us to study
how Ca2+ signaling via release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and/or from
extracellular Ca2+ entry relates to motility patterns, a crucial first step in
developing countermeasures for T. gondii virulence.

datasets and practically usable information for vehicle engineers and
researchers. The proposed web-based driving scenario database preprocesses
massive raw traffic data collected in chronological order into an organized
scenario-based dataset by applying a set of categorization algorithms to label
the naturalistic driving data with six different critical driving scenarios.
TrafficNet opens not only the scenario library but also the source code of
these categorization methods to the public, which will foster more

Dermatology discipline due to its moderate resolution and penetration depth.
OCT images however contain a grainy pattern, called speckle, due to the use of
a broadband source in the configuration of OCT. So far, a variety of filtering
(de-speckling) techniques is introduced to reduce speckle in OCT images. Most
of these methods are generic and can be applied to OCT images of different
tissues. The ambition of this work is to provide a de-speckling framework
specialized for filtering skin tissues for the community to utilize, adapt or
build upon. In this paper, we present an adaptive cluster-based filtering
framework, optimized for speckle reduction of OCT skin images. In this
framework, by considering the layered structure of skin, first the OCT skin
images are segmented into differentiable layers utilizing clustering
algorithms, and then each cluster is de-speckled individually using adaptive
filtering techniques. In this study, hierarchical clustering algorithm and
adaptive Wiener filtering technique are utilized to develop the framework. The
proposed method is tested on optical solid phantoms with predetermined optical
properties. The method is also tested on healthy human skin images. The results
show that the proposed cluster-based filtering method can effectively reduce
the speckle and increase the signal-to-noise ratio and contrast while
preserving the edges in the image. The proposed cluster-based filtering
framework enables researchers to develop unsupervised learning solutions for
de-speckling OCT skin images using adaptive filtering methods, or extend the
framework to new applications.

numerically and experimentally reported by using subwavelength thickness panels
in a transmission problem. The panels are composed of a periodic array of
varying cross-section waveguides, each of them being loaded by an array of
Helmholtz resonators (HRs) with graded dimensions. The low cut-off frequency of
the absorption band is fixed by the resonance frequency of the deepest HR, that
reduces drastically the transmission. The preceding HR is designed with a
slightly higher resonance frequency with a geometry that allows the impedance
matching to the surrounding medium. Therefore, reflection vanishes and the
structure is critically coupled. This results in perfect sound absorption at a
single frequency. We report perfect absorption at 300 Hz for a structure whose
thickness is 40 times smaller than the wavelength. Moreover, this process is
repeated by adding HRs to the waveguide, each of them with a higher resonance
frequency than the preceding one. Using this frequency cascade effect, we
report quasi-perfect sound absorption over almost two frequency octaves ranging
from 300 to 1000 Hz for a panel composed of 9 resonators with a total thickness
of 11 cm, i.e., 10 times smaller than the wavelength at 300 Hz.

dissipative particle dynamics with dynamic virtual particle allocation method
(SDPD-DV) for modeling and simulation of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded

The physical domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries,
periodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the
domain are represented with boundary particles which have an assigned position,
wall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid domain is
discretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for
nearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell
and Verlet-list approaches and utilizes large rectangular cells for
computational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in the
proximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual
particles in its truncated support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a
virtual particle are identical to those of the corresponding fluid particle.
Additional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient, planar,
Couette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m
from the bottom stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good
agreement with the analytical solutions. Additional SDPD-DV verification is
accomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number
flow of water over a cylinder of radius . The SDPD-DV field velocity and
pressure are compared with those obtained by FLUENT.

valleytronic operations. They exhibit two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin
zone, and the valley populations can be directly controlled and determined
using circularly polarized optical excitation and emission. The
photoluminescence polarization reflects the ratio of the two valley
populations. A wide range of values for the degree of circularly polarized
emission, Pcirc, has been reported for monolayer WS2, although the reasons for
the disparity are unclear. Here we optically populate one valley, and measure
Pcirc to explore the valley population dynamics at room temperature in a large
number of monolayer WS2 samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition.
Under resonant excitation, Pcirc ranges from 2% to 32%, and we observe a
pronounced inverse relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and
Pcirc. High quality samples exhibiting strong PL and long exciton relaxation
time exhibit a low degree of valley polarization, and vice versa. This behavior
is also demonstrated in monolayer WSe2 samples and transferred WS2, indicating
that this correlation may be more generally observed and account for the wide
variations reported for Pcirc. Time resolved PL provides insight into the role
of radiative and non-radiative contributions to the observed polarization.
Short non-radiative lifetimes result in a higher measured polarization by
limiting opportunity for depolarizing scattering events.
