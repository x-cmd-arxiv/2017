power-law fall-off leads to a long-range interaction between the kink and the
antikink. We investigate how the scattering scenarios depend on the initial
velocities of the colliding kinks. In particular, we observe the `escape
windows' -- the escape of the kinks after two or more collisions, explained by
the resonant energy exchange between the translational and vibrational modes.
In order to elucidate this phenomenon, we also analyze the excitation spectra
of a solitary kink and of a composite kink+antikink configuration.

theoretical models that predict the dominant multipoles (l,m) of the radiation

the subdominant multipoles to binary black hole gravitational waveforms, given
a frequency-domain model for the dominant multipoles. The amplitude and phase
of the original model are appropriately stretched and rescaled using
post-Newtonian results (for the inspiral), perturbation theory (for the
ringdown), and a smooth transition between the two. No additional tuning to
numerical-relativity simulations is required. We apply a variant of this method
to the non-precessing PhenomD model. The result, PhenomHM, constitutes the
first higher-multipole model of spinning black-hole binaries, and currently
includes the (l,m) = (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3) radiative

PhenomHM is more accurate than dominant-multipole-only models for all binary

chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond is an attractive candidate to aid in

inhomogeneous structure, CVD diamond membranes exhibit a 3D anisotropic thermal
conductivity which may result in significantly different cooling performance
from expected in a given application. In this work, time domain
thermoreflectance (TDTR) is used to measure the thermal properties of an
11.8-{\mu}m CVD diamond membrane from its nucleation side. Starting with a spot
size diameter larger than the thickness of the membrane, measurements are made
at various modulation frequencies from 1.2 MHz to 11.6 MHz to tune the heat
penetration depth, and subsequently the part of diamond sampled by TDTR. We
divide the membrane into ten sublayers and assume isotropic thermal
conductivity in each sublayer. From this, we observe a 2D gradient of the
depth-dependent thermal conductivity for this membrane. By measuring the same
region with a smaller spot size at multiple frequencies, the in-plane and
cross-plane thermal conductivity are extracted respectively. Through this use
of multiple spot sizes and modulation frequencies, the 3D anisotropic thermal
conductivity of CVD diamond membrane is experimentally obtained by fitting the
experimental data to a thermal model. This work provides insight toward an
improved understanding of heat conduction inhomogeneity in CVD polycrystalline

these, this paper discusses different methods for their aggregation into
typical periods. Each aggregation method is applied to a different type of
energy system model, making the methods fairly incomparable. To overcome this,
the different aggregation methods are first extended so that they can be
applied to all types of multidimensional time series and then compared by
applying them to different energy system configurations and analyzing their
impact on the cost optimal design. It was found that regardless of the method,
time series aggregation allows for significantly reduced computational
resources. Nevertheless, averaged values lead to underestimation of the real
system cost in comparison to the use of representative periods from the
original time series. The aggregation method itself, e.g. k means clustering,
plays a minor role. More significant is the system considered: Energy systems
utilizing centralized resources require fewer typical periods for a feasible
system design in comparison to systems with a higher share of renewable
feed-in. Furthermore, for energy systems based on seasonal storage, currently
existing models integration of typical periods is not suitable.

binary star system and passing stars with masses ranging from 0.1$M_{\odot}$ to
10$M_{\odot}$. We focus on binaries consisting of two Sun-like stars with
various orbital separations $a_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}$ from 50 au to 200 au
initially on circular-planar orbits. We treat the problem statistically since
each sequence is cloned 1000 times. Our study shows that orbits of binaries
initially at $a_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}$ = 50 au will slightly be perturbed by
each close encounter and exhibit a small deviation in eccentricity (+0.03) and
in periapsis distance (+1 and -2 au) around the mean value. However increasing
$a_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}$ will drastically increase these variances: up to
+0.45 in eccentricity and between +63 au and -106 au in periapsis, leading to a
higher rate of disrupted binaries up to 50% after the sequence of close
encounters. Even though the secondary star can remain bound to the primary,
$\sim$20% of the final orbits will have inclinations greater than 10$^{\circ}$.
As planetary formation already takes place when stars are still members of
their birth cluster, we show that the variances in eccentricity and periapsis
distance of Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets will inversely decrease with
$a_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}$ after successive fly-bys. This leads to higher
ejection rate at $a_{\scriptscriptstyle 0}$ = 50 au but to a higher extent for
Saturn-likes (60%) as those planets' apoapsis distances cross the critical
stability distance for such binary separation.

We use nonspinning template waveforms towards the signals emitted from
aligned-spin NS-NS binaries, in which the spins of the NSs are aligned with the
orbital angular momentum. We use the TaylorF2 waveform model, which can
generate inspiral waveforms emitted from aligned-spin compact binaries. We
employ the single effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$ to represent the
effect of two component spins ($\chi_1, \chi_2$) on the wave function. For a
target system, we choose a binary consisting of the same component masses of
$1.4 M_{\odot}$ and consider the spins up to $\chi_i= 0.4$, We investigate
fitting factors of the nonspinning templates to evaluate their efficiency in
gravitational wave searches for the aligned-spin NS-NS binaries. We find that
the templates can achieve the fitting factors exceeding $0.97$ only for the
signals in the range of $-0.2 \lesssim \chi_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0$. Therefore,
we demonstrate the necessity of using aligned-spin templates not to lose the
signals outside that range. We also show how much the recovered total mass can
be biased from the true value depending on the spin of the signal.

predictor to a prediction set. The resulting set keeps good statistical
properties of the original estimator under standard assumptions, and guarantees
valid average coverage even when the model is misspecified. A main challenge in
applying conformal prediction in modern applications is efficient computation,
as it generally requires an exhaustive search over the entire output space. In
this paper we develop an exact and computationally efficient conformalization
of the Lasso and elastic net. The method makes use of a novel piecewise linear
homotopy of the Lasso solution under perturbation of a single input sample
point. As a by-product, we provide a simpler and better justified online Lasso
algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Our derivation also reveals an
interesting accuracy-stability trade-off in conformal inference, which is
analogous to the bias-variance trade-off in traditional parameter estimation.
The practical performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated using both
synthetic and real data examples.

supply nodes. In this paper we develop a more realistic model for two
interdependent networks in which each node has its own supply threshold, i.e.,
they need the support of a minimum number of supply nodes to remain functional.
In addition, we analyze different conditions of internal node failure due to
disconnection from nodes within its own network. We show that several local
internal failure conditions lead to similar nontrivial results. When there are
no internal failures the model is equivalent to a bipartite system, which can
be useful to model a financial market. We explore the rich behaviors of these
models that include discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. Using the
generating functions formalism, we analytically solve all the models in the
limit of infinitely large networks and find an excellent agreement with the
stochastic simulations.

the signal strengths. The common assumption is that only a few signals are
strong and most of the signals are zero or close (collectively) to zero.
However, such a requirement might not be valid in many real-life applications.
In this article, we are interested in conducting large-scale inference in
models that might have signals of mixed strengths. The key challenge is that
the signals that are not under testing might be collectively non-negligible
(although individually small) and cannot be accurately learned. This article
develops a new class of tests that arise from a moment matching formulation. A
virtue of these moment-matching statistics is their ability to borrow strength
across features, adapt to the sparsity size and exert adjustment for testing
growing number of hypothesis. GRoup-level Inference of Parameter, GRIP, test
harvests effective sparsity structures with hypothesis formulation for an
efficient multiple testing procedure. Simulated data showcase that GRIPs error
control is far better than the alternative methods. We develop a minimax
theory, demonstrating optimality of GRIP for a broad range of models, including
those where the model is a mixture of a sparse and high-dimensional dense

results in classical and quantum cryptography. In such a setting, one takes the
location of honest players into account, and uses the fact that information
cannot travel faster than the speed of light to limit the abilities of
dishonest agents. For example, various relativistic bit commitment protocols
have been proposed. Although it has been shown that bit commitment is
sufficient to construct oblivious transfer and thus multiparty computation,
composing specific relativistic protocols in this way is known to be insecure.
A composable framework is required to perform such a modular security analysis
of construction schemes, but no known frameworks can handle models of
computation in Minkowski space.
  By instantiating the systems model from the Abstract Cryptography framework
with Causal Boxes, we obtain such a composable framework, in which messages are
assigned a location in Minkowski space (or superpositions thereof). This allows
us to analyse relativistic protocols and to derive novel possibility and
impossibility results. We show that (1) coin flipping can be constructed from
the primitive channel with delay, (2) biased coin flipping, bit commitment and
channel with delay are all impossible without further assumptions, and (3) it
is impossible to improve a channel with delay. Note that the impossibility
results also hold in the computational and bounded storage settings. This
implies in particular non-composability of all proposed relativistic bit
commitment protocols, of bit commitment in the bounded storage model, and of
biased coin flipping.

Motivated by this observation, we present a model study of nematic and chiral
superconductivity induced by odd-parity fluctuations. We show that odd-parity
fluctuations in the two-component $E_u$ representation of $D_{3d}$ crystal
point group can generate attractive interaction in both the even-parity
$s$-wave and odd-parity $E_u$ pairing channels, but repulsive interaction in
other odd-parity pairing channels. Coulomb repulsion can suppress $s$-wave
pairing relative to $E_u$ pairing, and thus the latter can have a higher
critical temperature. $E_u$ pairing has two distinct phases: a nematic phase
and a chiral phase, both of which can be realized in our model. When $s$-wave
and $E_u$ pairings have similar instability temperature, we find an
intermediate phase in which both types of pairing coexist.

fundamental to planet formation. In all models of early growth, there are
several processes that can inhibit grains from reaching larger sizes.
Nevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must be rapid.
If a small number of 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc,
then gas drag effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids
from beyond their gravitationally focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced
accretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid rates, in principle. We
present self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle
integration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth
due to pebble accretion. Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of
particle sizes and disc conditions. We also explore analytic estimates of
planetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift due to the
accretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we
consider, there is a clearly preferred particle size for accretion that depends
on the properties of the accreting planetesimal and the local disc conditions.
For solids much smaller than the preferred particle size, accretion rates are
significantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow around
the planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates
consistent with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble
accretion highlight the timescales that are needed for the growth of large
objects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal sizes.

s^{-1}$, at z~2-4. All but 3 QSOs show unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities
$L_{2-10}\geq10^{45} \,erg \,s^{-1}$. Thanks to their extreme radiative output
across the Mid-IR-to-X-ray range, WISSH QSOs offer the opportunity to
significantly extend and validate the existing relations involving $L_{2-10}$.
We study $L_{2-10}$ as a function of (i) X-ray-to-Optical (X/O) flux ratio,
(ii) mid-IR luminosity ($L_{MIR}$), (iii) $L_{Bol}$ as well as (iv)
$\alpha_{OX}$ vs. the 2500$\mathring{A}$ luminosity. We find that WISSH QSOs
show very low X/O(<0.1) compared to typical AGN values; $L_{2-10}/L_{MIR}$
ratios significantly smaller than those derived for AGN with lower luminosity;
large X-ray bolometric corrections $k_{\rm Bol,X}\sim$ 100-1000; and steep
$-2<\alpha_{OX}<-1.7$. These results lead to a scenario where the X-ray
emission of hyper-luminous quasars is relatively weaker compared to
lower-luminosity AGN. Models predict that such an X-ray weakness can be
relevant for the acceleration of powerful high-ionization emission line-driven
winds, commonly detected in the UV spectra of WISSH QSOs, which can in turn
perturb the X-ray corona and weaken its emission. Accordingly, hyper-luminous
QSOs represent the ideal laboratory to study the link between the AGN energy
output and wind acceleration. Additionally, WISSH QSOs show very large BH
masses ($\log[M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}]$>9.5). This enables a more robust modeling
of the $\Gamma-M_{BH}$ relation by increasing the statistics at high masses. We
derive a flatter $\Gamma$ dependence than previously found over the broad range
5 <$\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})$ < 11.

source plane we recover the host galaxy morphology to within a few hundred
parsecs of the central AGN, and map the extended Lyman-$\alpha$ emission to its
physical origin on one side of the host galaxy at radii $\sim$0.5-2 kpc from
the central AGN. There are clear morphological differences between the
Lyman-$\alpha$ and rest-frame ultraviolet stellar continuum emission from the
quasar host galaxy. Furthermore, the relative velocity profiles of quasar
Lyman-$\alpha$, host galaxy Lyman-$\alpha$, and metal lines in outflowing gas
reveal differences in the absorbing material affecting the AGN and host galaxy.
These data indicate the presence of patchy local intervening gas in front of
the central quasar and its host galaxy. This interpretation is consistent with
the central luminous quasar being obscured across a substantial fraction of its

of the FP zero-point evolution. The rate of $M/L$ evolution is consistent with
galaxies evolving passively. By using single stellar population models, we find
an average age of $2.33^{+0.86}_{-0.51}$ Gyr for the $\log

Keplerian disk is flanked by a low angular momentum and low viscosity flow

hole. The post-shock region which behaves as a Compton cloud becomes
progressively smaller during the outburst as the spectra change from the hard
state to the soft state in order to satisfy Rankine-Hugoniot relation in
presence of cooling. The resonance oscillation of the shock wave which causes
low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) also allows us to obtain the
shock location from each observed QPO frequency. Applying the theory of
transonic flow with Compton cooling and viscosity, we obtain the viscosity
parameter $\alpha_{SK}$ required for the shock to form at those places in the
low-Keplerian component. When we compare the evolution of $\alpha_{SK}$ for
each outburst, we arrive at a major conclusion: In each source, the advective
flow component typically requires exactly a similar value of $\alpha_{SK}$ when
transiting from one spectral state to another (e.g., from hard state to soft
state through intermediate states and the other way around in the declining
phase). Most importantly, these $\alpha_{SK}$ values in the low-angular
momentum advective component are fully self-consistent in the sense that they
remain below critical value $\alpha_{cr}$ required to form a Keplerian disk.
For a further consistency check, we compute the $\alpha_K$ of the Keplerian
component, and find that in each of the objects, $\alpha_{SK}$ $<$
$\alpha_{cr}$ $<$ $\alpha_K$.

representing them as a linear combination of a previously learned basis set of

finding an optimal low-rank approximation of the set of tasks the agent will
face in a domain. We use non-negative matrix factorization to discover this
minimal basis set of tasks, and show that the technique learns intuitive
decompositions in a variety of domains. Our method has several qualitatively
desirable features: it is not limited to learning subtasks with single goal
states, instead learning distributed patterns of preferred states; it learns
qualitatively different hierarchical decompositions in the same domain
depending on the ensemble of tasks the agent will face; and it may be
straightforwardly iterated to obtain deeper hierarchical decompositions.

but realistic parameter values: enhanced Rashba spin-orbit coupling due to
proximity to a transition metal dichalcogenide like WS$_{2}$, and enhanced
Zeeman field due to exchange coupling with a magnetic insulator like EuS under
applied magnetic field. The presence of s--wave superconductivity, induced
either by proximity or by decoration with alkali metal atoms like Ca or Li,
leads to a topological superconducting phase with Majorana end modes. The
topological phase is highly sensitive to the application of uniaxial strain,
with a transition to the trivial state above a critical strain well below
$0.1\%$. This sensitivity allows for real space manipulation of Majorana
fermions by applying non-uniform strain profiles. Similar manipulation is also
possible by applying inhomogeneous Zeeman field or chemical potential.

pattern recognition concepts and methods such as principal component analysis

investigate the variation among BJTs belonging to integrated circuits known as
transistor arrays. It was shown that a good deal of the devices variance can be
captured using only two PCA axes. It was also verified that, though
substantially small variation of parameters is observed for BJT from the same
array, larger variation arises between BJTs from distinct arrays, suggesting
the consideration of device characteristics in more critical analog designs. As
a consequence of its supervised nature, LDA was able to provide a substantial
separation of the BJT into clusters, corresponding to each transistor array. In
addition, the LDA mapping into two dimensions revealed a clear relationship
between the considered measurements. Interestingly, a specific mapping
suggested by the PCA, involving the total harmonic distortion variation
expressed in terms of the average voltage gain, yielded an even better
separation between the transistor array clusters.

introduction of generic conditions that each trial step is required to satisfy,

These conditions center around a new subproblem that can be approximately

layer, many studies have been devoted to find out if there are any general and
universal characteristic features that can distinguish water molecules inside
the protein hydration layer from bulk. Given that the surface itself varies
from protein to protein, and that each surface facing the water is
heterogeneous, search for universal features has been elusive. Here, we perform
atomistic molecular dynamics simulation in order to propose and demonstrate
that such defining characteristics can emerge if we look not at average
properties but the distribution of relaxation times. We present results of
calculations of distributions of residence times and rotational relaxation
times for four different protein-water systems, and compare them with the same
quantities in the bulk. The distributions in the hydration layer is unusually
broad and log-normal in nature, due to the simultaneous presence of peptide
backbones that form weak hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic amino acid side chains
that form no hydrogen bond and charged polar groups that form strong hydrogen
bond with the surrounding water molecules. The broad distribution is
responsible for the non-exponential dielectric response and also agrees with
large specific heat of the hydration water. Our calculations reveal that while
the average time constant is just about 2-3 times larger than that of bulk
water, it provides a poor representation of the real behaviour. In particular,
the average leads to the erroneous conclusion that water in the hydration layer
is bulk-like. However, the observed and calculated lower value of static
dielectric constant of hydration layer remained difficult to reconcile with the
broad distribution observed in dynamical properties. We offer a plausible
explanation of these unique properties.

employed adiabatic radial and nonradial pulsation periods for low-mass white

that were derived by simulating the nonconservative evolution of a binary
system consisting of an initially $1 M_{\odot}$ ZAMS star and a $1.4 M_{\odot}$
neutron star companion. We estimated the mean period spacing for the stars
under study and then we used the comparison between the observed period spacing
with the average of the computed period spacings for our grid of models to
constrain the stellar mass. We also employed the individual observed periods of
every known pulsating low-mass white dwarf star, to search for a representative
seismological model. We found that even though the stars under analysis exhibit
few periods and the period fits show multiplicity of solutions, it is possible
to find seismological models whose mass and effective temperature are in
agreement with the values given by spectroscopy, for most of the cases. In the
two cases where we could extract the period spacing from the set of observed
periods, this method led to values of the stellar masses substantially larger

atmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the
statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure
perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as
a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several
surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil
structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such
surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil
properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with
the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be
distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such
surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure
time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series
cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical
and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of
the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a
distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the
underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a
scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey
using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil
occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our
results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five
low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.

recognition and learning tasks using a universal recipe; training a deep model
on a very large dataset of supervised examples. However, this approach is
rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images
is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways
for choosing images to be labelled from a very large collection (ie. active
learning).
  Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in
the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs in batch setting.
Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as
core-set selection, ie. choosing set of points such that a model learned over
the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further
present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected
subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm,
we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our
characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large
margin.

response via alloying with transition metals that can substitute for Al in the
wurtzite lattice. Herein, we report density functional theory calculations of
structure and properties of the Cr-AlN system for Cr concentrations ranging
past the wurtzite-rocksalt transition point. By studying the different
contributions to the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, we propose that
the physical origin of the enhanced piezoelectricity in Cr$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N
alloys is the increase of the internal parameter $u$ of the wurtzite structure
upon substitution of Al with the larger Cr ions. Among a set of
wurtzite-structured materials, we have found that Cr-AlN has the most sensitive
piezoelectric coefficient with respect to alloying concentration. Based on
these results, we propose that Cr-AlN is a viable piezoelectric material whose
properties can be tuned via Cr composition; we support this proposal by
combinatorial synthesis experiments, which show that Cr can be incorporated in
the AlN lattice up to 30\% before a detectable transition to rocksalt occurs.
At this Cr content, the piezoelectric modulus $d_{33}$ is approximately four
times larger than that of pure AlN. This finding, combined with the relative
ease of synthesis, may propel Cr-AlN as the prime piezoelectric material for
applications such as resonators and acoustic wave generators.

Keplerian Doppler shifts. Photospheric activity produces subtle differences in
the shapes of absorption lines due to differences in how temperature or
pressure affects the atomic transitions. In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts
affect every spectral line in the same way. With high enough S/N and high
enough resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to
disentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet

present for both counter-propagating GAEs, which are routinely excited in NSTX,

family of games is the fact that the agents do not have any exogenously given
fundamental value for the asset, and they deduce the value of their position
from the bid and ask prices posted by other agents (i.e. they are pure
speculators). As a result, in such a game, the reward function of each agent,
at the time of stopping, depends directly on the controls of other players. The
equilibrium problem leads naturally to a system of coupled control-stopping
problems (or, equivalently, Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential
Equations (RBSDEs)), in which the individual reward functions (or, reflecting
barriers) depend on the value functions (or, solution components) of other
agents. The resulting system, in general, presents multiple mathematical
challenges due to the non-standard form of coupling (or, reflection). In the
present case, this system is also complicated by the fact that the continuous
controls of the agents, describing their posted bid and ask prices, are
constrained to take values in a discrete grid. The latter feature reflects the
presence of a positive tick size in the market, and it creates additional
discontinuities in the agents reward functions (or, reflecting barriers).

when using galaxies, rather than dark matter particles, to estimate the
velocity dispersion of a galaxy cluster, a property known to be tightly
correlated with cluster mass. The simulations consist of 30 clusters spanning a
mass range $14.0 \le \log_{10}(M_{\rm 200c}/\mathrm{M_\odot}) \le 15.4$, with
their sophisticated sub-grid physics modelling and high numerical resolution
(sub-kpc gravitational softening) making them ideal for this purpose. We find
that selecting galaxies by their total mass results in a velocity dispersion
that is 5-10 per cent higher than the dark matter particles. However, selecting
galaxies by their stellar mass results in an almost unbiased ($<5$ per cent)
estimator of the velocity dispersion. This result holds out to $z=1.5$ and is
relatively insensitive to the choice of cluster aperture, varying by less than
5 per cent between $r_{\rm 500c}$ and $r_{\rm 200m}$. We show that the velocity
bias is a function of the time spent by a galaxy inside the cluster
environment. Selecting galaxies by their total mass results in a larger bias
because a larger fraction of objects have only recently entered the cluster and
these have a velocity bias above unity. Galaxies that entered more than $4 \,
\mathrm{Gyr}$ ago become progressively colder with time, as expected from
dynamical friction. We conclude that velocity bias should not be a major issue
when estimating cluster masses from kinematic methods.

super-solar abundance ratios of [Zn/Fe] at low metallicities, which decrease

  Existing interactive-proof games largely fall into two categories: either as
games of cooperation such as multi-prover interactive proofs and cooperative
rational proofs, where the provers work together as a team; or as games of
conflict such as refereed games, where the provers directly compete with each
other in a zero-sum game. Neither of these extremes truly capture the strategic
nature of service providers in outsourcing applications. How to design and
analyze non-cooperative interactive proofs is an important open problem.
  In this paper, we introduce a mechanism-design approach to define a
multi-prover interactive-proof model in which the provers are rational and
non-cooperative---they act to maximize their expected utility given others'
strategies. We define a strong notion of backwards induction as our solution
concept to analyze the resulting extensive-form game with imperfect
information.
  Our protocols provide utility gap guarantees, which are analogous to
soundness gap in classic interactive proofs. At a high level, a utility gap of
u means that the protocol is robust against provers that may not care about a
utility loss of 1/u.
  We fully characterize the complexity of our proof system under different
utility gap guarantees. For example, we show that with a polynomial utility
gap, the power of non-cooperative rational interactive proofs is exactly
P^NEXP.

of gradient descent, often with great success. However, existing non-asymptotic
analyses of first-order optimization algorithms typically employ a gradient
smoothness assumption that is too strong to be applicable in the case of deep
neural networks. To address this, we propose an algorithm named duality
structure gradient descent (DSGD) that is amenable to non-asymptotic
performance analysis, under mild assumptions on the training set and network
architecture. The algorithm can be viewed as a form of layer-wise coordinate
descent, where at each iteration the algorithm chooses one layer of the network
to update. The decision of what layer to update is done in a greedy fashion,
based on a rigorous lower bound on the improvement of the objective function
for each choice of layer. In the analysis, we bound the time required to reach
approximate stationary points, in both the deterministic and stochastic
settings. The convergence is measured in terms of a parameter-dependent family
of norms that is derived from the network architecture and designed to confirm
a smoothness-like property on the gradient of the training loss function. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of DSGD in several neural network
training scenarios.

combinatorics, their inability to answer the now settled Topological Tverberg
Conjecture has made apparent the need to move beyond the use of Borsuk--Ulam
type theorems alone. This impression holds as well for one of the most famous
problems in the field, dating back to 1960, which seeks the minimum dimension
$d:=\Delta(m;k)$ such that any $m$ mass distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be
simultaneously equipartitioned by $k$ hyperplanes. Precise values of
$\Delta(m;k)$ have been obtained in few cases, and the best-known general upper
bound $U(m;k)$ typically far exceeds the conjectured-tight lower bound arising
from degrees of freedom. Following the ""constraint method"" of Blagojevi\'c,
Frick, and Ziegler originally used for Tverberg-type results and recently to
the present problem, we show how the imposition of further conditions -- on the
hyperplane arrangements themselves (e.g., orthogonality, prescribed flat
containment) and/or the equipartition of additional masses by successively
fewer hyperplanes (""cascades"") -- yields a variety of optimal results for
constrained equipartitions of $m$ mass distributions in dimension $U(m;k)$,
including in dimensions \textit{below} $\Delta(m+1;k)$, which are still
extractable via equivariance. Among these are families of exact values for full
orthogonality as well as cascades which maximize the ""fullness"" of the
equipartition at each stage, including some strengthened equipartitions in
dimension $\Delta(m;k)$ itself.

models, suitable coupling conditions at the network nodes are crucial.
Frequently, the evolution of traffic flow on each network edge is described in
a lane-averaged fashion using a single-class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.
At off-ramps, split ratios (i.e., what percentage of traffic exits the highway)
are prescribed that can be drawn from historic data. In this situation,
classical FIFO coupling conditions yield unrealistic results, in that a clogged
off-ramp yields zero flux through the node. As a remedy, non-FIFO conditions
have been proposed. However, as we demonstrate here, those lead to spurious
re-routing of vehicles. Then, a new coupling model, FIFOQ, is presented that
preserves the desirable properties of non-FIFO models, while not leading to any
spurious re-routing.

reticular-, pedunculopontine tegmental- and pontine reticular nuclei are
related to the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Approach. The three targeted
nuclei are collinear, therefore a single-shank MEA was designed in order to
contact them. The silicon-based device was equipped with 3*4 recording sites,
located according to the geometry of the brain regions. Furthermore, a
microdrive was developed to allow fine actuation and post-implantation
relocation of the probe. The probe was attached to a rigid printed circuit
board, which was fastened to the microdrive. A flexible cable was designed in
order to provide not only electronic connection between the probe and the
amplifier system, but sufficient freedom for the movements of the probe as
well. Main results. The microdrive was stable enough to allow precise electrode
targeting into the tissue via a single track. The microelectrodes on the probe
were suitable for recording neural activity from the three targeted brainstem
areas. Significance. The system offers a robust solution to provide long-term
interface between an array of precisely defined microelectrodes and deep-brain
areas of a behaving rodent. The microdrive allowed us to fine-tune the probe
location and easily scan through the regions of interest.

tracking observables and on spacecraft orbits. We show that this term, only
partially accounted for in the standard formulation of computed space
observables, can actually be relevant for future missions with high nominal
tracking accuracies or for the re-processing of old missions. We present
several applications of our formulation to Earth flybys, the NASA GRAIL and the

minimize the size of synthesized counterexample programs.
  These algorithms symbolically evaluate typecheckers and interpreters,

interpreters poses efficiency challenges, which are caused by having to merge
execution paths of the various possible input programs. Our main contribution

applications requiring high-throughput data streaming, low-latency biosignal

automatically adjust stimulation parameters in a closed-loop fashion. It
combines custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), an on-board

recordings of local field potentials (LFP) and real-time cancellation of
stimulation artifacts in a behaving nonhuman primate (NHP). We use WAND to
demonstrate a closed-loop stimulation paradigm to disrupt movement preparatory

leveraging custom ASICs for both neural recording and electrical stimulation

significantly advance both neuroscientific discovery and preclinical

velocities (V$_{exp}$) of different ions as derived from their collisionally
excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines (ORLs). V$_{exp}$ are
analysed as a function of the ionisation potential of ions that at first
approximation represents the distance of the ion to the central star. In most
cases the kinematics of ORLs is incompatible with the kinematics of CELs at the
same ionisation potential, specially if CELs and ORLs of the same ion are
considered. In general V$_{exp}$ from ORLs is lower than V$_{exp}$ from CELs
indicating that, if the gas is in ionisation equilibrium, ORLs are emitted by a
gas located closer to the central star. The velocity field derived from CELs
shows a gradient accelerating outwards as predicted from hydrodynamic modelling
of PNe ionisation structures. The velocity field derived from ORLs is
different, in many cases the velocity gradient is flatter or nonexistent and
high and low ionised species present nearly the same V$_{exp}$. In addition,
the FWHM(ORLs) is usually smaller that the FWHM(CELs). Our interpretation is
that ORLs are mainly emitted by a plasma that coexists with the plasma emitting
CELs, but does not fit the ionisation structures predicted by models. Such a
plasma should have been ejected in a different event that the plasma emitting
CELs.

rapidly spinning black holes (BHs) known to date, reaching spin parameters $a
\gtrsim 0.84$. However, there are several effects that can severely limit the
maximum BH spin parameter that could be obtained from direct collapse, such as
tidal synchronization, magnetic core-envelope coupling and mass loss. Here we
propose an alternative scenario where the BH is produced by a {\it failed}
supernova (SN) explosion that is unable to unbind the stellar progenitor. A
large amount of fallback material ensues, whose interaction with the secondary
naturally increases its overall angular momentum content, and therefore, the
spin of the BH when accreted. Through SPH hydrodynamic simulations, we studied
the unsuccessful explosion of a $8M_{\odot }$ pre-SN star in a close binary
with a $12M_{\odot}$ companion with an orbital period of $\approx1.2$ days,
finding that it is possible to obtain a BH with a high spin parameter
$a\gtrsim0.8$ even when the expected spin parameter from direct collapse is $a
\lesssim 0.3$. This scenario also naturally explains the atmospheric metal
pollution observed in HMXRB stellar companions.

preserves the maximum information flow between layers by a densely-connected

redundant feature maps by encouraging feature reuse and hence requires fewer

In this work, a novel neural network model specified for representing logical

defined. Inhibitory links are introduced besides exciting links. Different from
current numeric ANNs, one end of an inhibitory link connects an exciting link
rather than a neuron. Inhibitory links inhibit the connected exciting links
conditionally to make this neural network model represent logical relations
correctly. This model can simulate the operations of Boolean logic gates, and
construct complex logical relations with the advantages of simpler neural
network structures than recent works in this area. This work provides some
ideas to make neural networks represent logical relations more directly and
efficiently, and the model could be used as the complement to current numeric

training deep learning models. The prevailing practice is to use cross entropy
loss function that penalizes the probability given to all the answers in the
vocabulary except the single most common answer for the particular question.
However, the VQA evaluation function compares the predicted answer with all the
ground-truth answers for the given question and if there is a matching, a
partial point is given. This causes a discrepancy between the model's cross
entropy loss and the model's accuracy as calculated by the VQA evaluation
function. In this work, we propose a novel loss, termed as soft cross entropy,
that considers all ground-truth answers and thus reduces the loss-accuracy

released from a hypervelocity impact on a binary asteroid. We performed
numerical simulations of the post-impact dynamics of the ejecta cloud in the
framework of the current mission scenario of AIDA mission project. A grid
search of launching sites of ejecta was defined over the globe of Didymoon, and
considering a wide range of possible ejection speeds, we determined the
dependency of ejecta fate on launching sites (projectile impact sites) and
speeds. This range allows us to track all the complex cases that include
different types of dynamical fates. Two major mechanisms are found to be
working broadly during the post-ejection evolution of the ejecta cloud: 1)
ejecta on mean motion resonance orbits with Didymoon produce long-term
quasi-periodic showers onto Didymoon over at least a couple of weeks after the
projectile impact, 2) ejecta on non-resonant orbits produce a rapid and high
re-accretion flux. This rapid and high flux occurs just once because ejecta on
such orbits leave the system unless they experience a collision during their
first encounter. For the second part of this study, we performed full-scale
simulations of the ejecta cloud released from 6 hypothetical impact sites. We
considered two kinds of material composing Didymoon's subsurface and then
combined a power-law size distribution of the ejecta with an ejection speed
distribution. We find that the ejecta cloud evolution can be divided in two
periods. It starts with a first violent period (<10 hr) with fast re-accretion
or ejection from the system. A second period is found to be more sensitive to
the launching site than the first one. During this second period, ejecta will
either re-accrete or being ejected from the system, depending both on their
sizes and on their average survival time in close proximity of the binary
components.

the sum of the radiation and centrifugal forces at the stellar surface be
smaller than the inward pull of the gravity. Once the accreting protostar
reaches such a marginal state, the star cannot spin up more and is not allowed
to accrete more gas with inward angular momentum flux. So far, however, the
effect of stellar radiation on the structure of the accretion disk has not been
properly taken into account in discussing the effect of $\Omega\Gamma$-limit on
the first star formation. Here, we obtain a series of the steady accretion-disk
solutions considering such effect and find solutions without net angular
momentum influx to the stars with arbitrary rotation rates, in addition to
those with finite angular momentum flows. The accretion of positive angular
momentum flows pushes the star beyond the $\Omega\Gamma$-limit, which is
allowed only with the external pressure provided by the circumstellar disk. On
the other hand, the accretion with no net angular momentum influx does not
result in the spin-up of the star. Thus, the existence of the solution with no
net angular momentum influx indicates that the protostars can keep growing in
mass by accretion even after they reach the $\Omega\Gamma$-limit.

on whether the theory is able to reproduce the inferred flat rotation curves of

which renders the motion of test particles non-geodesic. By studying the weak
field limit of the resulting equations of motion, we demonstrate that in the
Newtonian limit the acceleration law induced by the non-minimal coupling
reduces to a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)-like one. In this way, it is
possible to reproduce the successes of MOND, namely the explanation for the
flat galactic rotation curves and the Tully-Fisher relation, within the
framework of mimetic gravity, without the need for particle dark matter. The
scale-dependence of the recovered acceleration scale opens up the possibility
of addressing the missing mass problem not only on galactic but also on cluster

stability of these configurations is determined via eigen analysis of the
geometric constructions. The eigen decomposition reveals a connection between
the cluster's reactions and the types of external disturbance. Numerical
simulations are performed to verify the analytical results. The gravitational
N-body code pkdgrav is used to mimic the responses of the cluster under
intermittent non-dispersive impacts. We statistically confirm that the
stability index, the total gravitational potential and the volume of inertia
ellipsoid show consistent tendency of variation. A common regime is found in
which the clusters tend towards crystallization under intermittent impacts,
i.e., only the configurations with high structural stability survive under the
external disturbances. The results suggest the trivial non-disruptive impacts
might play an important role in the rearrangement of the constituent blocks,
which may strengthen these rubble piles and help to build a robust structure
under impacts of similar magnitude. The final part of this study consists of
systematic simulations over two parameters, the projectile momentum and the
rotational speed of the cluster. The results show a critical value exists for
the projectile momentum, as predicted by theory, below which all clusters
become responseless to external disturbances; and the rotation proves to be

The presence of highly attenuating materials in the scan field causes an
inconsistent sinogram, that does not match the range space of the Radon
transform. When the mismatched data are entered into the range space during CT
reconstruction, streaking and shading artifacts are generated owing to the
inherent nature of the inverse Radon transform. The proposed learning method
aims to repair inconsistent sinograms by removing the primary metal-induced
beam-hardening factors along the metal trace in the sinogram. Taking account of
the fundamental difficulty in obtaining sufficient training data in a medical
environment, the learning method is designed to use simulated training data and
a patient-type specific learning model is used to simplify the learning
process. The feasibility of the proposed method is investigated using a
dataset, consisting of real CT scan of pelvises containing hip prostheses. The
anatomical areas in training and test data are different, in order to
demonstrate that the proposed method extracts the beam hardening features,
selectively. The results show that our method successfully corrects sinogram
inconsistency by extracting beam-hardening sources by means of deep learning.

context of second-price ad auctions: how should an ad platform optimally reveal
information about the ad opportunity to the advertisers in order to maximize
revenue? We consider a model in which bidders' valuations depend on a random
state of the ad opportunity. Different from previous work, we focus on a more
practical, and challenging, situation where the space of possible realizations
of ad opportunities is extremely large. We thus focus on developing algorithms
whose running time is independent of the number of ad opportunity realizations.
  We examine the auctioneer's algorithmic question of designing the optimal
signaling scheme. When the auctioneer is restricted to send a public signal to
all bidders, we focus on a well-motivated Bayesian valuation setting in which
the auctioneer and bidders both have private information, and present two main
results: 1. we exhibit a characterization result regarding approximately
optimal schemes and prove that any constant-approximate public signaling scheme
must use exponentially many signals; 2. we present a ""simple"" public signaling
scheme that serves as a constant approximation under mild assumptions. We then
initiate an exploration on the power of being able to send different signals
privately to different bidders. Here we examine a basic setting where the
auctioneer knows bidders' valuations, and exhibit a polynomial-time private
scheme that extracts almost full surplus even in the worst Bayes Nash

the fundamental and practical aspects of contemporary material sciences.
Recently, black phosphorus (BP) consisting of stacked layers of phosphorene was
experimentally observed to show a widely tunable band gap by means of the
deposition of potassium (K) atoms on the surface, thereby allowing great
flexibility in design and optimization of electronic and optoelectronic
devices. Here, based on the density-functional theory calculations, we
demonstrates that the donated electrons from K dopants are mostly localized at
the topmost BP layer and such a surface charging efficiently screens the K ion
potential. It is found that, as the K doping increases, the extreme surface
charging and its screening of K atoms shift the conduction bands down in
energy, i.e., towards higher binding energy, because they have more charge near
the surface, while it has little influence on the valence bands having more
charge in the deeper layers. This result provides a different explanation for
the observed tunable band gap compared to the previously proposed giant Stark
effect where a vertical electric field from the positively ionized K overlayer
to the negatively charged BP layers shifts the conduction band minimum
${\Gamma}_{\rm 1c}$ (valence band minimum ${\Gamma}_{\rm 8v}$) downwards
(upwards). The present prediction of ${\Gamma}_{\rm 1c}$ and ${\Gamma}_{\rm
8v}$ as a function of the K doping reproduces well the widely tunable band gap,
anisotropic Dirac semimetal state, and band-inverted semimetal state, as
observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment. Our findings
shed new light on a route for tunable band gap engineering of 2D materials
through the surface doping of alkali metals.

which have an elegant theory, efficient error detection, and many known
examples. Constructing stabilizer codes of length $n$ is equivalent to
constructing subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n$ which are
""isotropic"" under the symplectic bilinear form defined by $\left\langle
(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}),(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d}) \right\rangle =
\mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{d} - \mathbf{b}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{c}$. As a
result, many, but not all, ideas from the theory of classical error correction
can be translated to quantum error correction. One of the main theoretical
contribution of this article is to study stabilizer codes starting with a
different symplectic form.
  In this paper, we concentrate on cyclic codes. Modifying the symplectic form
allows us to generalize the previous known construction for linear cyclic
stabilizer codes, and in the process, circumvent some of the Galois theoretic
no-go results proved there. More importantly, this tweak in the symplectic form
allows us to make use of well known error correcting algorithms for cyclic
codes to give efficient quantum error correcting algorithms. Cyclicity of error
correcting codes is a ""basis dependent"" property. Our codes are no more
""cyclic"" when they are derived using the standard symplectic forms (if we
ignore the error correcting properties like distance, all such symplectic forms
can be converted to each other via a basis transformation). Hence this change
of perspective is crucial from the point of view of designing efficient
decoding algorithm for these family of codes. In this context, recall that for
general codes, efficient decoding algorithms do not exist if some widely
believed complexity theoretic assumptions are true.

The VLA and VLBA data reveal a one-sided core-jet structure at roughly the same
position angles, providing evidence of an AGN outflow. The absence of dual
parsec-scale radio cores puts the binary black hole picture in doubt for the
case of KISSR1219. The high brightness temperatures of the parsec-scale core
and jet components ($>10^6$ K) are consistent with this interpretation. Doppler
boosting with jet speeds of $\gtrsim0.55c$ to $\gtrsim0.25c$, going from
parsec- to kpc-scales, at a jet inclination $\gtrsim50^\circ$ can explain the
jet one-sidedness in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. A blue-shifted broad emission line
component in [O {\sc iii}] is also indicative of an outflow in the emission
line gas at a velocity of $\sim350$ km s$^{-1}$, while the [O {\sc i}] doublet
lines suggest the presence of shock-heated gas. A detailed line ratio study
using the MAPPINGS III code further suggests that a shock+precursor model can
explain the line ionization data well. Overall, our data suggest that the radio
outflow in KISSR1219 is pushing the emission line clouds, both ahead of the jet
and in a lateral direction, giving rise to the double peak emission line
spectra.

$\cal F$-Contraction when $\cal F$ is a simple family of graphs such as trees

$\cal F$ generalizes the family of trees. In particular, we define this

the energy precision is better than $15\,\%$. A rough estimation of the shower
energy and of $X_\mathrm{max}$ is even possible with only a single antenna
station when using the shower geometry measured by Tunka-133. Moreover, by
using exactly the same external calibration source for the antennas as at the

  Projections",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have become ubiquitous for applications related to
visual recognition and language understanding tasks. However, it is often
prohibitive to use typical neural networks on devices like mobile phones or
smart watches since the model sizes are huge and cannot fit in the limited
memory available on such devices. While these devices could make use of machine
learning models running on high-performance data centers with CPUs or GPUs,
this is not feasible for many applications because data can be privacy
sensitive and inference needs to be performed directly ""on"" device.
  We introduce a new architecture for training compact neural networks using a
joint optimization framework. At its core lies a novel objective that jointly
trains using two different types of networks--a full trainer neural network
(using existing architectures like Feed-forward NNs or LSTM RNNs) combined with
a simpler ""projection"" network that leverages random projections to transform
inputs or intermediate representations into bits. The simpler network encodes
lightweight and efficient-to-compute operations in bit space with a low memory
footprint. The two networks are trained jointly using backpropagation, where
the projection network learns from the full network similar to apprenticeship
learning. Once trained, the smaller network can be used directly for inference
at low memory and computation cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
approach at significantly shrinking the memory requirements of different types
of neural networks while preserving good accuracy on visual recognition and
text classification tasks. We also study the question ""how many neural bits are
required to solve a given task?"" using the new framework and show empirical
results contrasting model predictive capacity (in bits) versus accuracy on
several datasets.

syndrome of three consistency issues. This paper describes our efforts in their
analysis and treatment. The first issue is the training speed inconsistency in
different layers. We propose to address it with an intuitive,
simple-to-implement, low footprint second-order method. The second issue is the
scale inconsistency between the layer inputs and the layer residuals. We
explain how second-order information provides favorable convenience in removing
this roadblock. The third and most challenging issue is the inconsistency in
residual propagation. Based on the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, we
provide a mathematical characterization of the famous vanishing gradient
problem. Thus, an important design principle for future optimization and neural
network design is derived. We conclude this paper with the construction of a
novel contractive neural network.

Rock--Paper--Scissors model, as occurring in both stochastic individual-based
models of finite populations and in the deterministic replicator equations. The
mean-field replicator equations are valid in the limit of large populations
and, in the presence of mutation and unbalanced payoffs, they exhibit an
attracting limit cycle. The period of this cycle depends on the rate of
mutation; specifically, the period grows logarithmically as the mutation rate
tends to zero. We find that this behaviour is not reproduced in stochastic
simulations with a fixed finite population size. Instead, demographic noise
present in the individual-based model dramatically slows down the progress of
the limit cycle, with the typical period growing as the reciprocal of the
mutation rate. Here we develop a theory that explains these scaling regimes and
delineates them in terms of population size and mutation rate. We identify a
further intermediate regime in which we construct a stochastic differential
equation model describing the transition between stochastically-dominated and
mean-field behaviour.

as such (without the necessity of an external cloak). The proposed method is
based on the uncoupling of the scattered waves from the incident radiation by
judiciously manipulating the scattering potential of a given object. We show
that such a procedure is able to yield optical invisibility for any arbitrarily
shaped object within any specified frequency bandwidth by simply employing
isotropic non-magnetic dielectric materials, without the usage of loss or gain
material. The validity of the design principle has been verified by direct
experimental observations of the spatial electric field profiles and scattering
patterns at the microwave regime. Our alternative self-cloaking strategy may
have profound implications especially in noninvasive probing and cloaked sensor
applications, where the wave penetrability into the sensor region is essential
together with its invisibility to minimize the field distortion.

quasars that have been detected at very high energy (VHE, $E>100\,$GeV) gamma
rays. It is a very active source across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
VHE observations in May 2016 with H.E.S.S. and MAGIC revealed an exceptionally
strong flare, which lasted for less than two nights, and exhibited a peak flux
of about 0.8 times the flux of the Crab Nebula above $200\,$GeV. The flare
provides the first evidence of intranight variability at VHE in this source.
While optical observations with ATOM reveal a counterpart at optical
frequencies, Fermi-LAT observations reveal only low flux variability at high
energy (HE, $E>100\,$ MeV) gamma rays. Interestingly, the HE spectral index
significantly hardens during the peak of the VHE flare, indicating a strong
shift of the peak frequency of the high energy component. Given the expected
strong absorption due to the broad-line region, the VHE emission region cannot
be located deep within that region.

the enumeration of transitive triples, do not reflect the theoretical
statements about transitivity they aim to describe. These statements are often
formulated as comparative conditional probabilities, but these are not directly
reflected by simple functions of enumerations. We think that a better approach
is obtained by considering the linear regression coefficient of ties
$i\,\rightarrow\,j$ on the number of two-paths
$i\,\rightarrow\,k\rightarrow\,j$ for the $(n-2)$ possible intermediate nodes
$k$. Two measures of transitivity based on correlation coefficients between the
existence of a tie and the existence, or the number, of two-paths are
developed, and called ""Transitivity Phi"" and ""Transitivity Correlation"". Some
desirable properties for these measures are studied and compared to existing
clustering coefficients, in both random (Erd\""os-Renyi) and in stylized
networks (windmills). Furthermore, it is shown that under the condition of zero
Transitivity Correlation, the total number of transitive triples is determined
by four underlying features of any directed graph: size, density, reciprocity,
and the covariance between indegrees and outdegrees. Also, it is demonstrated
that plotting conditional probability of ties, given the number of two-paths,
provides valuable insights into empirical regularities and irregularities of
transitivity patterns.

domain thermoviscous wave equations (TWE), derived from the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) poses a Helmholtz problem, solution to which
yields a discrete set of complex eigenfunctions and eigenvalue pairs. The
proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) -- reverses such
procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or more unknown
impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain, via spatial integration of the
TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned conditions on other
boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order spatial
discretization of the TWEs on an unstructured staggered grid arrangement. Only
the momentum equation is extended to the center of each IB face where pressure
and velocity components are co-located and treated as unknowns. The iHS is
finally closed via assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over
the IBs, corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the
IB. The iHS procedure can be carried out independently for different
frequencies, making it embarrassingly parallel, and able to return the complete
broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any desired frequency
range to arbitrary numerical precision. The iHS approach is first validated
against Rott's theory for viscous rectangular and circular ducts. The impedance
of a toy porous cavity with a complex geometry is then reconstructed and
validated with companion fully compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes
simulations resolving the cavity geometry. Verification against one-dimensional
impedance test tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary
conditions (TDIBC) is also carried out. Finally, results from a preliminary
analysis of a thermoacoustically unstable cavity are presented.

novel model-based image analysis, which reconstructs phage positions by solving
the inverse problem of image formation. This framework is tested on

A QGC is a subset of a group code. In contrast with group codes, QGCs are not
closed under group addition. The parameters of the QGC can be chosen such that
the size of $\mathcal{C}+\mathcal{C}$ is equal to any number between
$|\mathcal{C}|$ and $|\mathcal{C}|^2$ . We analyze the performance of a
specific class of QGCs. This class of QGCs is constructed by assigning
single-letter distributions to the indices of the codewords in a group code.
Then, the QGC is defined as the set of codewords whose index is in the typical
set corresponding to these single-letter distributions. The asymptotic
performance limits of this class of QGCs is characterized using single-letter
information quantities. Corresponding covering and packing bounds are derived.
It is shown that the point-to-point channel capacity and optimal
rate-distortion function are achievable using QGCs. Coding strategies based on
QGCs are introduced for three fundamental multi-terminal problems: the
K\""orner-Marton problem for modulo prime-power sums, computation over the
multiple access channel (MAC), and MAC with distributed states. For each
problem a single-letter achievable rate-region is derived. It is shown, through
examples, that the coding strategies improve upon the previous strategies based
on unstructured codes, linear codes and group codes.

Most existing frameworks focus on using static images to learn object
detectors. However, these detectors often fail to generalize to videos because
of the existing domain shift. Therefore, we investigate learning these
detectors directly from boring videos of daily activities. Instead of using
bounding boxes, we explore the use of action descriptions as supervision since
they are relatively easy to gather. A common issue, however, is that objects of
interest that are not involved in human actions are often absent in global
action descriptions known as ""missing label"". To tackle this problem, we
propose a novel temporal dynamic graph Long Short-Term Memory network (TD-Graph
LSTM). TD-Graph LSTM enables global temporal reasoning by constructing a
dynamic graph that is based on temporal correlations of object proposals and
spans the entire video. The missing label issue for each individual frame can
thus be significantly alleviated by transferring knowledge across correlated
objects proposals in the whole video. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale
daily-life action dataset (i.e., Charades) demonstrates the superiority of our
proposed method. We also release object bounding-box annotations for more than
5,000 frames in Charades. We believe this annotated data can also benefit other
research on video-based object recognition in the future.

spatial distribution of the stopping position of protons. They are compared to
each other and to semi-empirical data, using the mean proton range, the
longitudinal and lateral variation of individual proton ranges, and the
fraction of primary protons lost to nuclear interactions. This comparison is
performed in two homogeneous materials and in a detector geometry designed for
proton Computed Tomography. The three MC software packages agree well, and
sufficiently reproduce the semi-empirical data. Some discrepancies are
observed, such as less lateral beam spreading in GATE/Geant4, and a small
deficiency in the MCNP6 proton range in water: This is consistent with
previously published data. Due to the general agreement, the choice of
simulation framework may be made on personal preferences. It is important to
note that the choice of physics packages, simulation parameter settings and
material definitions are important aspects when performing MC simulations, both

$E^2=p^2c^2+{\mathbb A}\; p^{\alpha} c^{\alpha}$, where ${\mathbb A}$ denotes
the magnitude of dispersion and $E$ and $p$ are the energy and momentum of the
gravitational wave, we estimate the projected constraints on the modified
dispersion from observations of compact binary mergers by third- generation
ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer as
well as the space-based detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find
that third-generation detectors would bound dispersion of gravitational waves
much better than their second-generation counterparts. The Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna, with its extremely good low-frequency sensitivity, would place
stronger constraints than the ground-based detectors for $\alpha \leq 1$,
whereas for $\alpha > 1$, the bounds are weaker. We also study the effect of
the spins of the compact binary constituents on the bounds.

actions. In this paper we propose a novel trainable detector for recognizing
human poses based on the analysis of the skeleton. The main idea is that a
skeleton pose can be described by the spatial arrangements of its joints.
Starting from this consideration, we propose a trainable pose detector, that
can be configured on a prototype skeleton in an automatic configuration
process. The result of the configuration is a model of the position of the
joints in the concerned skeleton. In the application phase, the joint positions
contained in the model are compared with the ones of their homologous joints in
the skeleton under test. The similarity of two skeletons is computed as a
combination of the position scores achieved by homologous joints. In this paper
we describe an action classification method based on the use of the proposed
trainable detectors to extract features from the skeletons. We performed
experiments on the publicly available MSDRA data set and the achieved results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

seen as an exit event from a certain part S of the conformational state space.
Determining exit rates (i.e, for SDE-based simulations exiting from a given

rarely is obviously hard to solve by straight forward simulation methods.
Finding a low variance procedure for computing rare event statistics is still

classical theory of Young-Laplace. For chemically homogeneous surfaces, this
angle is a constant.
  We study the minimal-energy configurations of liquid drops on rough surfaces.
Here the actual angle is still constant for homogeneous surfaces, but the
apparent angle can fluctuate widely. A limit theorem is introduced for minimal
energy configuration, where the rigid surface converges to a smooth one, but
the roughness parameter is kept constant. It turns out that the limit of
minimal energy configurations correspond to liquid drop on a smooth surface
with an appropriately defined effective chemical interaction energy. It turns
out that the effective chemical interaction depends linearly on the roughness
in a certain range of parameters, corresponding to full wetting. Outside this
range the most stable configuration corresponds to a partial wetting and the
effective interaction energy depends on the geometry in an essential way.
  This result partially justifies and extends Wenzel and Cassie's laws and can
be used to deduce the actual inclination angle in the most stable state, where
the apparent one is known by measurement. This, in turn, may be applied to
deduce the roughness parameter if the interfacial energy is known, or visa

maximum a posteriori (MAP) network structure. In the case of discrete Bayesian
networks, MAP networks are selected by maximising one of several possible
Bayesian Dirichlet (BD) scores; the most famous is the Bayesian Dirichlet
equivalent uniform (BDeu) score from Heckerman et al (1995). The key properties
of BDeu arise from its uniform prior over the parameters of each local
distribution in the network, which makes structure learning computationally
efficient; it does not require the elicitation of prior knowledge from experts;
and it satisfies score equivalence.
  In this paper we will review the derivation and the properties of BD scores,
and of BDeu in particular, and we will link them to the corresponding entropy
estimates to study them from an information theoretic perspective. To this end,
we will work in the context of the foundational work of Giffin and Caticha
(2007), who showed that Bayesian inference can be framed as a particular case
of the maximum relative entropy principle. We will use this connection to show
that BDeu should not be used for structure learning from sparse data, since it
violates the maximum relative entropy principle; and that it is also
problematic from a more classic Bayesian model selection perspective, because
it produces Bayes factors that are sensitive to the value of its only
hyperparameter. Using a large simulation study, we found in our previous work
(Scutari, 2016) that the Bayesian Dirichlet sparse (BDs) score seems to provide
better accuracy in structure learning; in this paper we further show that BDs
does not suffer from the issues above, and we recommend to use it for sparse
data instead of BDeu. Finally, will show that these issues are in fact
different aspects of the same problem and a consequence of the distributional
assumptions of the prior.

regular cell complex. In the first two papers we characterized 3-ball Sturm
attractors $\mathcal{A}$ as 3-cell templates $\mathcal{C}$. The
characterization involves bipolar orientations and hemisphere decompositions
which are closely related to the geometry of the fast unstable manifolds. An
equivalent combinatorial description was given in terms of the Sturm
permutation, alias the meander properties of the shooting curve for the
equilibrium ODE boundary value problem. It involves the relative positioning of
extreme 2-dimensionally unstable equilibria at the Neumann boundaries $x=0$ and
$x=1$, respectively, and the overlapping reach of polar serpents in the
shooting meander. In the present paper we apply these descriptions to

irradiation from its F type host star. The planet is surrounded by a
translucent exosphere which overfills the Roche lobe and produces
line-blanketing absorption in the near-UV. The planet is losing mass. Another
unusual property of the WASP-12 system is that observed chromospheric emission
from the star is anomalously low: WASP-12 is an extreme outlier amongst
thousands of stars when the log $R^{'}_{HK}$ chromospheric activity indicator
is considered. Occam's razor suggests these two extremely rare properties
coincide in this system because they are causally related. The absence of the
expected chromospheric emission is attributable to absorption by a diffuse
circumstellar gas shroud which surrounds the entire planetary system and fills
our line of sight to the chromospherically active regions of the star. This
circumstellar gas shroud is probably fed by mass loss from WASP-12b. The
orbital eccentricity of WASP-12b is small but may be non-zero. The planet is
part of a hierarchical quadruple system; its current orbit is consistent with
prior secular dynamical evolution leading to a highly eccentric orbit followed
by tidal circularization. When compared with the Galaxy's population of
planets, WASP-12b lies on the upper boundary of the sub-Jovian desert in both
the $(M_{\rm P}, P)$ and $(R_{\rm P}, P)$ planes. Determining the mass loss
rate for WASP-12b will illuminate the mechanism(s) responsible for the
sub-Jovian desert.

improving cosmological constraints with respect to number counts only results,

$\max{f(n,2,c),f(n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor,c)}$ edges. Recently, F\""uredi et

that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph on $n$ vertices with circumference $c$ such

member of two well-characterized families which we define as
$\mathcal{X}_{n,c}$ and $\mathcal{Y}_{n,c}$. We prove that if $G$ is a
2-connected graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$ and
circumference $c$ such that $10\leq c<n$ and
$e(G)>\max{f(n,k+1,c),f(n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor-1,c)}$, then one of the
following holds: (i) $G$ is a subgraph of $W_{n,k,c}$ or
$W_{n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor,c}$, (ii) $k=2$, $c$ is odd, and $G$ is a

$k\geq 3$ and $G$ is a subgraph of the union of a clique $K_{c-k+1}$ and some
cliques $K_{k+1}$'s, where any two cliques share the same two vertices.

exist prior to and independent of measurement, which is incompatible with
quantum mechanics. Leggett and Garg put forward a practical criterion capable
of identifying violations of macrorealism, and so far experiments performed on
microscopic and mesoscopic systems have always ruled out in favor of quantum
mechanics. However, a macrorealist can always assign the cause of such
violations to the perturbation that measurements effect on such small systems,
and hence a definitive test would require using non-invasive measurements,
preferably on macroscopic objects, where such measurements seem more plausible.
However, the generation of truly macroscopic quantum superposition states
capable of violating macrorealism remains a big challenge. In this work we
propose a setup that makes use of measurements on the polarization of light, a
property which has been extensively manipulated both in classical and quantum
contexts, hence establishing the perfect link between the microscopic and
macroscopic worlds. In particular, we use Leggett-Garg inequalities and the
criterion of no-signaling in time to study the macrorealistic character of
light polarization for different kinds of measurements, in particular with
different degrees of coarse-graining. Our proposal is non-invasive for coherent
input states by construction. We show for states with well defined photon
number in two orthogonal polarization modes, that there always exists a way of
making the measurement sufficiently coarse-grained so that a violation of
macrorealism becomes arbitrarily small, while sufficiently sharp measurements
can always lead to a significant violation.

hydrophilic (methylated $\beta$CD; ME$\beta$CD and hydroxypropyl $\beta$CD;
HP$\beta$CD) and hydrophobic derivatives (ethylated $\beta$CD; ET$\beta$CD)
were explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvation free

2,6-DM$\beta$CD, 2,3,6-TM$\beta$CD, 6-HP$\beta$CD, 2,6-HP$\beta$CD and
2,6-ET$\beta$CD in non-polar solvents (cyclohexane; CHX and octane; OCT) were
stably formed in symmetric cyclic cavity shape through their intramolecular
hydrogen bonds. In contrast, $\beta$CDs in polar solvents (methanol; MeOH and
water; WAT) exhibited large structural changes and fluctuations leading to
significant deformations of their cavities. Hydrogen bonding with polar
solvents was found to be one of the major contributors to this behavior:
solvent-\b{eta}CD hydrogen bonding strongly competes with intramolecular
bonding leading to significant changes in structural stability of $\beta$CDs.
The exception to this is the hydrophobic 2,6-ET$\beta$CD which retained its
spherical cavity in all solvents. Based on this, it is proposed that
2,6-ET$\beta$CD can act as a sustained release drug carrier.

Our targets have all previously been subject to long term radial velocity
observations to detect orbiting bodies, and satisfy the criteria used by
Johnson et al. (2006) to select survey stars that may have had A-type (or early
F-type) main-sequence progenitors. The sample actually spans a somewhat wider
range in mass, from $\approx 1\,\rm M_{\odot}$ up to $\approx 1.7\,\rm
M_{\odot}$. Whilst for five of the seven stars the reported discovery mass from
spectroscopy exceeds the mass estimated using asteroseismology, there is no
strong evidence for a significant, systematic bias across the sample. Moreover,
comparisons with other masses from the literature show that the absolute scale
of any differences is highly sensitive to the chosen reference literature mass,
with the scatter between different literature masses significantly larger than
reported error bars. We find that any mass difference can be explained through
use of differing constraints during the recovery process. We also conclude that
underestimated uncertainties on the input parameters can significantly bias the
recovered stellar masses, which may have contributed to the controversy on the
mass scale for retired A stars.

the capacity to partition processing into distinct data sequences (e.g.,

this difficulty presenting the points of the moduli space of special Bohr -

  Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2017)",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe an approach to identify the name of a piece of
piano music, based on a short audio excerpt of a performance. Given only a
description of the pieces in text format (i.e. no score information is
provided), a reference database is automatically compiled by acquiring a number
of audio representations (performances of the pieces) from internet sources.
These are transcribed, preprocessed, and used to build a reference database via
a robust symbolic fingerprinting algorithm, which in turn is used to identify
new, incoming queries. The main challenge is the amount of noise that is
introduced into the identification process by the music transcription algorithm
and the automatic (but possibly suboptimal) choice of performances to represent
a piece in the reference database. In a number of experiments we show how to
improve the identification performance by increasing redundancy in the
reference database and by using a preprocessing step to rate the reference
performances regarding their suitability as a representation of the pieces in
question. As the results show this approach leads to a robust system that is
able to identify piano music with high accuracy -- without any need for data
annotation or manual data preparation.

traffic fluidity. Therefore, the agents depend strongly on a heterogeneous

a spatial graph. It is defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance to the
graph distance between these vertices. It is often used as an average, for
instance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively to all the
other vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. In some
cases, one needs to process the Straightness between not only vertices, but
also any other points constituting the graph of interest. Suppose for instance
that our graph represents a road network and we do not want to limit ourselves
to crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to be a
starting point or destination. In this situation, the standard approach
consists in: 1) discretizing the graph edges, 2) processing the
vertex-to-vertex Straightness considering the additional vertices resulting
from this discretization, and 3) performing the appropriate average on the
obtained values. However, this discrete approximation can be computationally
expensive on large graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. In
this article, we adopt a continuous approach to average the Straightness over
the edges of spatial graphs. This allows us to derive 5 distinct measures able
to characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as
individual vertices and edges. Our method is generic and could be applied to
other measures designed for spatial graphs. We perform an experimental
evaluation of our continuous average Straightness measures, and show how they
behave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. Moreover, we
also study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is
globally less demanding in terms of both processing time and memory usage. Our

for large systems is the computation of the values of the Slater determinants

determinant of a dense matrix. This is most commonly iteratively evaluated
using a rank-1 Sherman-Morrison updating scheme to avoid repeated explicit
calculation of the inverse. The overall computational cost is therefore
formally cubic in the number of electrons or matrix size. To improve the
numerical efficiency of this procedure, we propose a novel multiple rank
delayed update scheme. This strategy enables probability evaluation with
application of accepted moves to the matrices delayed until after a
predetermined number of moves, K. The accepted events are then applied to the
matrices en bloc with enhanced arithmetic intensity and computational
efficiency via matrix-matrix operations instead of matrix-vector operations.
This procedure does not change the underlying Monte Carlo sampling or its
statistical efficiency. For calculations on large systems and algorithms such
as diffusion Monte Carlo where the acceptance ratio is high, order of magnitude
improvements in the update time can be obtained on both multi-core CPUs and

energy from one system and subsequently storing this energy in an appropriate
battery. Both of these steps, work extraction and charging, can be viewed as
cyclic Hamiltonian processes acting on individual quantum systems.
Interestingly, so-called passive states exist, whose energy cannot be lowered
by unitary operations, but it is safe to assume that the energy of any not
fully charged battery may be increased unitarily. However, unitaries raising
the average energy by the same amount may differ in qualities such as their
precision, fluctuations, and charging power. Moreover, some unitaries may be
extremely difficult to realize in practice. It is hence of crucial importance
to understand the qualities that can be expected from practically implementable
transformations. Here, we consider the limitations on charging batteries when
restricting to the feasibly realizable family of Gaussian unitaries. We derive
optimal protocols for general unitary operations as well as for the restriction
to easier implementable Gaussian unitaries. We find that practical Gaussian
battery charging, while performing significantly less well than is possible in

one cannot study it completely independently of the quantum formalism,
""post-quantum steering"" has been described, which is steering that cannot be

easily recover and generalise the celebrated Gisin-Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters

interaction among components. We show here that uphill diffusion can be a

consequence of some external work. To this aim we consider the 2D ferromagnetic
Ising model in contact with two reservoirs that fix, at the left and the right

provide numerical evidence that a class of non-equilibrium steady states exists

in our life: from movies we see, to prices we pay, or medicine we get. Yet
there is growing evidence that decision making by inappropriately trained
algorithms may unintentionally discriminate people. For example, in automated
matching of candidate CVs with job descriptions, algorithms may capture and
propagate ethnicity related biases. Several repairs for selected algorithms
have already been proposed, but the underlying mechanisms how such
discrimination happens from the computational perspective are not yet
scientifically understood. We need to develop theoretical understanding how
algorithms may become discriminatory, and establish fundamental machine
learning principles for prevention. We need to analyze machine learning process
as a whole to systematically explain the roots of discrimination occurrence,
which will allow to devise global machine learning optimization criteria for
guaranteed prevention, as opposed to pushing empirical constraints into
existing algorithms case-by-case. As a result, the state-of-the-art will
advance from heuristic repairing, to proactive and theoretically supported
prevention. This is needed not only because law requires to protect vulnerable
people. Penetration of big data initiatives will only increase, and computer
science needs to provide solid explanations and accountability to the public,

performing quantum measurements on their share of a (possibly unphysical)
quantum state, and its starting point is the characterisation of general
no-signalling assemblages via non-positive local hidden-state models. By
developing a connection to entanglement witnesses, this formalism allows for
new definitions of families of assemblages, in particular via (i)
non-decomposable positive maps and (ii) unextendible product bases. The former
proves to be useful for constructing post-quantum assemblages with the built-in
feature of yielding only quantum correlations in Bell experiments, while the
latter always gives certifiably post-quantum assemblages. Finally, our
framework is equipped with an inherent quantifier of post-quantum steering,
which we call the negativity of post-quantum steering. We postulate that
post-quantum steering should not increase under one-way quantum operations from
the steered parties to the steering parties, and we show that, in this sense,
the negativity of post-quantum steering is a convex post-quantum-steering
monotone.

about 10 % of their total mass budget. Such planets are present in the Solar
System (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed in short periods around
other stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations,
theoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue
that such low mass envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five
Earth masses. Instead, under nominal disc conditions, these planets would
acquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion within the lifetime of
the protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are not
in hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of
3-dimensional, global, radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady
state gas flow, which enters through the poles and exits in the disc midplane.
Gas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital timescales. In
regions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope
accretion onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow
enters the deep interior. Accreted solids sublimate deep in the convective
interior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped in the flow and do not
settle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to
runaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than
typical Super-Earths, beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc
opacities are below kappa=1 cm^2/g. These findings offer an explanation for the
typical low-mass envelopes around the cores of Super-Earths.

arrive sequentially and the goal is to recover the underlying mean function,
assumed to belong to an RKHS. The variance of the noise is not assumed to be
known. In this context, we tackle the problem of tuning the regularization
parameter adaptively at each time step, while maintaining tight confidence
bounds estimates on the value of the mean function at each point. To this end,
we first generalize existing results for finite-dimensional linear regression
with fixed regularization and known variance to the kernel setup with a
regularization parameter allowed to be a measurable function of past
observations. Then, using appropriate self-normalized inequalities we build
upper and lower bound estimates for the variance, leading to Bersntein-like
concentration bounds. The later is used in order to define the adaptive
regularization. The bounds resulting from our technique are valid uniformly
over all observation points and all time steps, and are compared against the
literature with numerical experiments. Finally, the potential of these tools is
illustrated by an application to kernelized bandits, where we revisit the
Kernel UCB and Kernel Thompson Sampling procedures, and show the benefits of
the novel adaptive kernel tuning strategy.

as the increments $X(k+1) - X(k)$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, of a fractional Brownian

  Closure","This article largely supersedes arxiv:1410.0925 (it describes version
  3 of the InfiniTAM framework)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Volumetric models have become a popular representation for 3D scenes in
recent years. One breakthrough leading to their popularity was KinectFusion,
which focuses on 3D reconstruction using RGB-D sensors. However, monocular SLAM
has since also been tackled with very similar approaches. Representing the
reconstruction volumetrically as a TSDF leads to most of the simplicity and
efficiency that can be achieved with GPU implementations of these systems.
However, this representation is memory-intensive and limits applicability to
small-scale reconstructions. Several avenues have been explored to overcome
this. With the aim of summarizing them and providing for a fast, flexible 3D
reconstruction pipeline, we propose a new, unifying framework called InfiniTAM.
The idea is that steps like camera tracking, scene representation and
integration of new data can easily be replaced and adapted to the user's needs.
  This report describes the technical implementation details of InfiniTAM v3,
the third version of our InfiniTAM system. We have added various new features,
as well as making numerous enhancements to the low-level code that
significantly improve our camera tracking performance. The new features that we
expect to be of most interest are (i) a robust camera tracking module; (ii) an
implementation of Glocker et al.'s keyframe-based random ferns camera
relocaliser; (iii) a novel approach to globally-consistent TSDF-based
reconstruction, based on dividing the scene into rigid submaps and optimising
the relative poses between them; and (iv) an implementation of Keller et al.'s
surfel-based reconstruction approach.

Average Precision (AP) and the recently proposed Fbw have been utilized to
evaluate the similarity between a non-binary saliency map (SM) and a

shown that the human visual system is highly sensitive to structures in scenes.
Here, we propose a novel, efficient, and easy to calculate measure known an
structural similarity measure (Structure-measure) to evaluate non-binary

planetary objects and these mantles can be surrounded above or below or both by
molten layers of similar composition. A flow toward the interface can proceed
through it by changing phase. This behaviour is modeled by a boundary condition
taking into account the competition between viscous stress in the solid, that
builds topography of the interface with a timescale $\tau_\eta$, and convective
transfer of the latent heat in the liquid from places of the boundary where
freezing occurs to places of melting, which acts to erase topography, with a
timescale $\tau_\phi$. The ratio $\Phi=\tau_\phi/\tau_\eta$ controls whether
the boundary condition is the classical non-penetrative one ($\Phi\rightarrow
\infty$) or allows for a finite flow through the boundary (small $\Phi$). We
study Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a plane layer subject to this boundary
condition at either or both its boundaries using linear and weakly non-linear
analyses. When both boundaries are phase change interfaces with equal values of
$\Phi$, a non-deforming translation mode is possible with a critical Rayleigh
number equal to $24\Phi$. At small values of $\Phi$, this mode competes with a
weakly deforming mode having a slightly lower critical Rayleigh number and a
very long wavelength, $\lambda_c\sim 8\sqrt{2}\pi/ 3\sqrt{\Phi}$. Both modes
lead to very efficient heat transfer, as expressed by the relationship between
the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers. When only one boundary is subject to a phase
change condition, the critical Rayleigh number is $\Ray_c=153$ and the critical
wavelength is $\lambda_c=5$. The Nusselt number increases about twice faster
with Rayleigh number than in the classical case with non-penetrative conditions

given by the Gaia DR1 uncertainties, where we identified three regimes in terms
of Gaia DR1 precision: for G = 17-20 stars we found that the formal DR1

future networks of gravitational wave detectors will possess great potential in

improvement of current detectors or establishment on new sites is knowledge of
the minimum number of detectors required to perform precision astronomy. We
attempt to answer this question by assessing ability of future detector
networks in detecting and localizing binary neutron stars mergers in the sky.
This is an important aspect as a good localization ability is crucial for many
of the scientific goals of gravitational wave astronomy, such as
electromagnetic follow-up, measuring the properties of compact binaries
throughout cosmic history, and cosmology. We find that although two detectors
at improved sensitivity are sufficient to get a substantial increase in the
number of observed signals, at least three detectors of comparable sensitivity
are required to localize majority of the signals, typically to within around 10
deg$^{2}$ --- adequate for follow-up with most wide field of view optical
telescopes.

reconstruction of multiphase materials, including porous ones. The approach
devised uses an optimization method, such as the simulated annealing (SA) and
the so-called entropic descriptors (EDs). For a binary pattern, they quantify
spatial inhomogeneity or statistical complexity at discrete length-scales. The
EDs extract dissimilar structural information to that given by two-point
correlation functions (CFs). Within the SA, we use an appropriate cost function
consisting of EDs or comprised of EDs and CFs. It was found that the stochastic
reconstruction is computationally efficient when we begin with a preliminary
synthetic configuration having in part desirable features.
  Another option is low-cost approximate reconstructing of the entire
multiphase medium beyond the SA technique. The information included in the
target ED-curve was utilized for this purpose. For a given volume fraction the
low-cost trial microstructures can be generated in two ways. In the first one,
applied to ceramics and carbonate samples, the interpenetrating spheres
generate a number of trial configurations. In the second one, with phase-EDs,
here used to the sandstone sample, the overlapping superspheres do it. Both
methods use a radius determined from the EDs-linked two-exponent power-law.
However, the supersphere deformation parameter allows controlling of the
spatial inhomogeneity of prototypical microstructures. At last, even for a
hypothetical ED-curve (under reasonable assumptions), the specific
microstructure can be found, if it is realizable for a given volume fraction.
In general, the EDs-based methods offer a compromise between computational
efficiency and the accuracy of reconstructions.

Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, in which a scalar field is coupled to

string-theory model and its predictions dramatically differ from Einstein's
theory in high-curvature regions - such as the interior of black holes and the
early universe - where it aims at resolving curvature singularities. In this
work we derive cosmological solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
for quadratic and for exponential coupling functions, and for any spatial
curvature. We discuss already known solutions and find new nonsingular,
inflationary, and bouncing solutions. We study the linear stability of these
solutions and the absence of ghosts, finding that all the aforementioned
solutions are unstable against tensor perturbations. We then introduce a
simple, quadratic potential for the scalar field. In some cases the presence of
a mass term cures the tensor instability. The proposed model is therefore a
viable and attractive candidate for inflation, and one in which the scalar
field is naturally provided by the gravitational sector.

arithmetic mean average roughness, $R_a$, approximates its areal equivalent
$S_a$. Simulated rough surfaces and samples from the ETOPO1 global relief model
were used. The mean of up to 20 $R_a$ profiles from the surface were compared
with surface $S_a$ for 100 repeats. Differences between $\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$
fell as the number of $R_a$ values averaged increased. For simulated surfaces
mean % difference between $\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$ was in the range 16.06% to
3.47% when only one $R_a$ profile was taken. By averaging 20 $R_a$ values mean
% difference fell to 6.60% to 0.81%. By not considering $R_a$ profiles parallel
to the main feature direction (identified visually), mean % difference was
further reduced. For ETOPO1 global relief surfaces mean % difference was in the

depicting multiple objects of diverse scales. Albeit the recent great progress

framework to tackle these challenges, which learns the direct mapping from a
color image to the corresponding depth map. First, we represent monocular depth
estimation as a multi-category dense labeling task by contrast to the
regression based formulation. In this way, we could build upon the recent
progress in dense labeling such as semantic segmentation. Second, we fuse
different side-outputs from our front-end dilated convolutional neural network
in a hierarchical way to exploit the multi-scale depth cues for depth
estimation, which is critical to achieve scale-aware depth estimation. Third,
we propose to utilize soft-weighted-sum inference instead of the hard-max
inference, transforming the discretized depth score to continuous depth value.
Thus, we reduce the influence of quantization error and improve the robustness
of our method. Extensive experiments on the NYU Depth V2 and KITTI datasets
show the superiority of our method compared with current state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments on the NYU V2 dataset reveal that our model

  negligible many non-trivial prime factors",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article we consider the completely multiplicative sequences $(a_n)_{n
\in \mathbf{N}}$ defined on a field $\mathbf{K}$ and satisfying $$\sum_{p| p
\leq n, a_p \neq 1, p \in \mathbf{P}}\frac{1}{p}<\infty,$$ where $\mathbf{P}$
is the set of prime numbers. We prove that if such sequences are automatic then
they cannot have infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that $a_{p}\neq 1$.
Using this fact, we prove that if a completely multiplicative sequence
$(a_n)_{n \in \mathbf{N}}$, vanishing or not, can be written in the form
$a_n=b_n\chi_n$ such that $(b_n)_{n \in \mathbf{N}}$ is a non ultimately
periodic, completely multiplicative automatic sequence satisfying the above
condition, and $(\chi_n)_{n \in \mathbf{N}}$ is a Dirichlet character or a
constant sequence, then there exists only one prime number $p$ such that $b_p

  submerged granular flows",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop and fully characterize a meshfree Lagrangian (particle) model for
continuum-based numerical modeling of dry and submerged granular flows. The
multiphase system of the granular material and the ambient fluid is treated as
a multi-density multi-viscosity system in which the viscous behaviour of the
granular phase is predicted using a regularized viscoplastic rheological model
with a pressure-dependent yield criterion. The numerical technique is based on
the Weakly-Compressible Moving Particle Semi-implicit (WC-MPS) method. The
required algorithms for approximation of the effective viscosity, effective
pressure, and shear stress divergence are introduced. The capability of the
model in dealing with the viscoplasticity is validated for the viscoplastic
Poiseuille flow between parallel plates. The model is then applied and fully
characterized (with respect to the various rheological and numerical
parameters) for dry and submerged granular collapses with different aspect
ratios. The numerical results are evaluated in comparison with the available
experimental measurement in literature as well as some complementary
experimental measurements, performed in this study. The results show the
capabilities of the presented model and its potential to deal with a broad
range of dry and submerged granular flows. It also revealed the impotent role
of the regularization, effective pressure, and shear stress divergence
calculation methods on the accuracy of the results.

of quantum technologies, including quantum computation, quantum simulation,
quantum metrology and quantum communications. In quantum networks and quantum
key distribution protocols, where photons are employed as flying qubits,
telecom wavelength operation is preferred due to the reduced fibre loss.
However, despite the tremendous efforts to develop various triggered SPE
platforms, a robust source of triggered SPEs operating at room temperature and
the telecom wavelength is still missing. Here we report a triggered, optically
stable, room temperature solid state SPE operating at telecom wavelengths. The
emitters exhibit high photon purity (~ 5% multiphoton events) and a record-high
brightness of ~ 1.5 MHz. The emission is attributed to localized defects in a
gallium nitride (GaN) crystal. The high performance SPEs embedded in a
technologically mature semiconductor are promising for on-chip quantum
simulators and practical quantum communication technologies.

equipment to create kilometer long fiber lasers in a communication link to

legitimate user in order to discover the generated key. We present a challenge
to that assumption with a hidden probe attack in which the eavesdropper hides a
weak signal in the unavoidable noise floor that appears in the laser during
amplification and probes with it the configuration of one or both communication
parties. We comment how this attack can compromise different proposals for
ultralong laser key distribution and propose possible countermeasures.

is particularly suited to elucidating underlying phenomena from

neuroscience, using mainly intracranial data and thus limiting its
applicability to invasive measurements involving electrode implants. Here we
intend to apply data assimilation to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
measurements to infer brain states and their characteristics. For this purpose,
we use Kalman filtering to combine synthetic EEG data with a coupled
neural-mass model together with Ary's model of the head, which projects
intracranial signals onto the scalp. Our results show that using several
extracranial electrodes allows to successfully estimate the state and
parameters of the neural masses and their interactions, whereas one single
electrode provides only a very partial and insufficient view of the system. The
superiority of using multiple extracranial electrodes over using only one, be
it intra- or extracranial, is shown over a wide variety of dynamical
behaviours. Our results show potential towards future clinical applications of
the method.

applications with scalable bandwidth requirement is the deployment of a dense
number of on-chip cores within a chip package. To this end, this paper
investigates the Wireless Network- on-Chip (WiNoC), which is enabled by
graphene-based nanoantennas (GNAs) in Terahertz frequency band. We first
develop a channel model between the GNAs taking into account the practical
issues of the propagation medium, such as transmission frequency, operating
temperature, ambient pressure, and distance between the GNAs. In the Terahertz
band, not only dielectric propagation loss but also molecular absorption
attenuation (MAA) caused by various molecules and their isotopologues within
the chip package constitutes the signal transmission loss. We further propose
an optimal power allocation to achieve the channel capacity. The proposed
channel model shows that the MAA significantly degrades the performance at
certain frequency ranges compared to the conventional channel model, even when
the GNAs are very closely located. More specifically, at transmission frequency
of 1 THz, the channel capacity of the proposed model is shown to be much lower
than that of the conventional model over the whole range of temperature and
ambient pressure of up to 26.8% and 25%, respectively.

flexibility to cope with wind power ramping. Several electricity markets have
established requirements for flexible ramping capacity (FRC) reserves. This
paper addresses two crucial issues that have rarely been discussed in the
literature: 1) how to characterize wind power ramping under different forecast
values and 2) how to achieve a reasonable trade-off between operational risks
and FRC costs. Regarding the first issue, this paper proposes a concept of
conditional distributions of wind power ramping, which is empirically verified
by using simulation and real-world data. For the second issue, this paper
develops an adjustable chance-constrained approach to optimally allocate FRC
reserves. Equivalent tractable forms of the original problem are devised to
improve computational efficiency. Tests carried out on a modified IEEE 118-bus
system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
