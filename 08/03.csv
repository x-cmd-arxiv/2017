Theory as applied to a fluid of parallel hard squares to study the dynamics of
heterogeneous growth of non-uniform phases with columnar and crystalline
symmetries. The hard squares are (i) confined between soft repulsive walls with
square symmetry, or (ii) exposed to external potentials that mimic the presence
of obstacles with circular, square, rectangular or triangular symmetries. For
the first case the final equilibrium profile of a well commensurated cavity
consists of a crystal phase with highly localized particles in concentric
square layers at the nodes of a slightly deformed square lattice. We
characterize the growth dynamics of the crystal phase by quantifying the
interlayer and intralayer fluxes and the non-monotonicity of the former, the
saturation time, and other dynamical quantities. The interlayer fluxes are much
more monotonic in time, and dominant for poorly commensurated cavities, while
the opposite is true for well commensurated cells: although smaller, the time
evolution of interlayer fluxes are much more complex, presenting strongly
damped oscillations which dramatically increase the saturation time. We also
study how the geometry of the obstacle affects the symmetry of the final
equilibrium non-uniform phase (columnar vs. crystal). For obstacles with
fourfold symmetry, (circular and square) the crystal is more stable, while the
columnar phase is stabilized for obstacles without this symmetry (rectangular
or triangular). We find that, in general, density waves of columnar symmetry
grow from the obstacle. However, additional particle localization along the
wavefronts gives rise to a crystalline structure which is conserved for
circular and square obstacles, but destroyed for the other two obstacles where
columnar symmetry is restored.

the chimera state in the homogeneous first layer of the multiplex networks can
be tuned by changing the link density or connection architecture of the same

second layer promotes chimera in a sparse first layer, where chimeras do not
occur in isolation. Furthermore, while a dense connection density is required
for the second layer if it is homogeneous, this is not true if the second layer
is inhomogeneous. We demonstrate that a sparse inhomogeneous second layer which
is common in real-world complex systems can promote chimera states in a sparse

model, the predictive multiple spatio-temporal scales recurrent neural network

cyclic movement patterns by exploiting multiscale spatio-temporal constraints
imposed on network dynamics by using differently sized receptive fields as well
as different time constant values for each layer. After learning, the network
becomes able to proactively imitate target movement patterns by inferring or
recognizing corresponding intentions by means of the regression of prediction
error. Results show that the network can develop a functional hierarchy by
developing a different type of dynamic structure at each layer. The paper
examines how model performance during pattern generation as well as predictive
imitation varies depending on the stage of learning. The number of limit cycle
attractors corresponding to target movement patterns increases as learning
proceeds. And, transient dynamics developing early in the learning process
successfully perform pattern generation and predictive imitation tasks. The
paper concludes that exploitation of transient dynamics facilitates successful
task performance during early learning periods.

existing land cover datasets were derived from a pixel-based single-date

classification technique. By incorporating and utilizing the complete
multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images

propose a new patch-based RNN (PB-RNN) system tailored for multi-temporal

characteristics in multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular, it uses
multi-temporal-spectral-spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by
clouds/shadow present in the multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida

proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the
classification accuracy over pixel-based RNN system, pixel-based single-imagery
NN system, pixel-based multi-images NN system, patch-based single-imagery NN

features, their misuse can still cause reliability degradation or even
catastrophic software failures. Prior studies on exception handling aim to
understand the practices of exception handling in its different components,
such as the origin of the exceptions and the handling code of the exceptions.
Yet, the observed findings were scattered and diverse. In this paper, to
complement prior research findings on exception handling, we study its features
by enriching the knowledge of handling code with a flow analysis of exceptions.
Our case study is conducted with over 10K exception handling blocks, and over
77K related exception flows from 16 open-source Java and C# (.NET) libraries
and applications. Our case study results show that each try block has up to 12
possible potentially recoverable yet propagated exceptions. More importantly,
22% of the distinct possible exceptions can be traced back to multiple methods
(average of 1.39 and max of 34). Such results highlight the additional
challenge of composing quality exception handling code. To make it worse, we
confirm that there is a lack of documentation of the possible exceptions and
their sources. However, such critical information can be identified by
exception flow analysis on well- documented API calls (e.g., JRE and .NET
documentation). Finally, we observe different strategies in exception handling
code between Java and C#. Our findings highlight the opportunities of
leveraging automated software analysis to assist in exception handling
practices and signify the need of more further in-depth studies on exception
handling practice.

signal dominates over the shot-noise of unresolved point sources at all scales
above ~1 arcmin and is produced mainly by the intracluster medium (ICM) of
unresolved clusters and groups of galaxies, as shown in our previous
publication.
  The shot-noise-subtracted power spectrum of CXB fluctuations has a power-law
shape with the slope of $\Gamma = 0.96 \pm 0.06$. Its energy spectrum is well
described by the redshifted emission spectrum of optically-thin plasma with the
best-fit temperature of $T \approx 1.3$ keV and the best-fit redshift of $z
\approx 0.40$. They are in good agreement with theoretical expectations based
on the X-ray luminosity function and scaling relations of clusters. From these
values we estimate the typical mass and luminosity of the objects responsible
for CXB fluctuations, $M_{500} \sim 10^{13.6}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}/h$ and
$L_{0.5-2.0\,{\rm keV}} \sim 10^{42.5}$ erg/s. On the other hand, the
flux-weighted mean temperature and redshift of resolved clusters are $T \approx
2.4$ keV and $z \approx 0.23$, confirming that fluctuations of unresolved CXB
are caused by cooler (i.e. less massive) and more distant clusters, as
expected. We show that the power spectrum shape is sensitive to the ICM
structure all the way to the outskirts, out to $\sim{\rm few}\times R_{500}$.
We also look for possible contribution of the warm-hot intergalactic medium

also related to the fractional certificate complexity $FC(f)$ as follows:
$FC(f) \leq EC(f) = O(FC(f)^{3/2})$. This also connects to an open question by
Aaronson whether $FC(f)$ is a quadratically tight bound for $R_0(f)$, as
$EC(f)$ is in fact a relaxation of $FC(f)$.

the query corruption bound ($\mathrm{corr}_\epsilon(f)$) which improves upon a

can be translated into tight complexity bounds in high-dimensional {settings}.
We propose a modified drift-and-minorization approach, which establishes
generalized drift conditions defined in subsets of the state space. The subsets
are called the ""large sets"", and are chosen to rule out some ""bad"" states which
have poor drift property when the dimension of the state space gets large.
Using the ""large sets"" together with a ""fitted family of drift functions"", a
quantitative bound can be obtained which can be translated into a tight
complexity bound. As a demonstration, we analyze several Gibbs samplers and
obtain complexity upper bounds for the mixing time. In particular, for one
example of Gibbs sampler which is related to the James--Stein estimator, we
show that the number of iterations required for the Gibbs sampler to converge
is constant under certain conditions on the observed data and the initial
state. It is our hope that this modified drift-and-minorization approach can be
employed in many other specific examples to obtain complexity bounds for
high-dimensional Markov chains.

analytic mapping $\psi:B_1\to Y$ of the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which is
extendible to the (say) four times larger concentric ball of $B_1$. A doubling
covering of a compact set $G$ in $Y$ is its covering with images of doubling
charts on $Y$. A doubling chain is a series of doubling charts with non-empty
subsequent intersections. Doubling coverings (and doubling chains) provide,
essentially, a conformally invariant version of Whitney's ball coverings of a
domain $W\subset {\mathbb R}^n$, introduced in [17] (compare [9]).
  We study doubling chains in the complement $Y=\mathbb{C}^n\setminus H$ of a
complex algebraic hypersurface $H$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and provide
information on their length and other properties. Our main result is that any
two points $v_1,v_2$ in a distance $\delta$ from $H$ can be joined via a
doubling chain in the complement $Y=\mathbb{C}^n\setminus H$ of length at most
$c_1\log (\frac{c_2}{\delta})$ with explicit constants $c_1,c_2$ depending only
on $n$ and $d$.
  As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the Kobayashi distance in $Y$,
and an upper bound for the constant in a doubling inequality for regular
algebraic functions on $Y$. We also provide the corresponding lower bounds for
the length of the doubling chains, through the doubling constant of specific
functions on $Y$.

revealed through Deeply virtual Compton scattering while a critically important
puzzle in the one-dimensional picture remains, namely, the origins of the EMC
effect. Incoherent nuclear DVCS, i.e. DVCS on a nucleon inside a nucleus, can
reveal the 3D partonic structure of the bound nucleon and shed a new light on
the EMC effect. However, the Fermi motion of the struck nucleon, off-shell
effects and final-state interactions (FSIs) complicate this parton level
interpretation. We propose here a measurement of incoherent DVCS with a tagging
of the recoiling spectator system (nucleus A-1) to systematically control
nuclear effects. Through spectator-tagged DVCS, a fully detected final state
presents a unique opportunity to systematically study these nuclear effects and
cleanly observe possible modification of the nucleon's quark distributions.
  We propose to measure the DVCS beam-spin asymmetries (BSAs) on $^4$He and
deuterium targets. The reaction $^4$He$(e,e^{\prime}\gamma\,p\,^3$H$)$ with a
fully detected final state has the rare ability to simultaneously quantify
FSIs, measure initial nucleon momentum, and provide a sensitive probe to other
nuclear effects at the parton level. The DVCS BSA on a (quasi-free) neutron
will be measured by tagging a spectator proton with a deuteron target.
Similarly, a bound neutron measurement detects a spectator $^3$He off a $^4$He
target. These two observables will allow for a self-contained measurement of
the neutron off-forward EMC Effect.

important measure of urban street network structure and transportation
efficiency. Circuity results from a circulation network's configuration,
planning, and underlying terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban
space for settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall
street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative circuity of
walkable versus drivable circulation networks. This study uses OpenStreetMap
data to explore relative network circuity. We download walkable and drivable
networks for 40 US cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to
simulate four million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network
structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more direct routes
than driving networks do in most cities: average driving circuity exceeds
average walking circuity in all but four of the cities that exhibit
statistically significant differences between network types. We discuss various
reasons for this phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity
also varies substantially between different types of places. These findings
underscore the value of using network-based distances and times rather than
straight-line when studying urban travel and access. They also suggest the
importance of differentiating between walkable and drivable circulation
networks when modeling and characterizing urban street networks: although
different modes' networks overlap in any given city, their relative structure
and performance vary in most cities.

success in image processing and computer vision especially in high level vision
applications such as recognition and understanding. However, it is rarely used
to solve low-level vision problems such as image compression studied in this
paper. Here, we move forward a step and propose a novel compression framework
based on CNNs. To achieve high-quality image compression at low bit rates, two
CNNs are seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end compression framework. The
first CNN, named compact convolutional neural network (ComCNN), learns an
optimal compact representation from an input image, which preserves the
structural information and is then encoded using an image codec (e.g., JPEG,
JPEG2000 or BPG). The second CNN, named reconstruction convolutional neural
network (RecCNN), is used to reconstruct the decoded image with high-quality in
the decoding end. To make two CNNs effectively collaborate, we develop a
unified end-to-end learning algorithm to simultaneously learn ComCNN and
RecCNN, which facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the decoded image
using RecCNN. Such a design also makes the proposed compression framework
compatible with existing image coding standards. Experimental results validate
that the proposed compression framework greatly outperforms several compression
frameworks that use existing image coding standards with state-of-the-art
deblocking or denoising post-processing methods.

Conventional solutions to the problem pose difficulties in scaling with the
number of sensors due to the joint multi-sensor filtering involved when
evaluating the parameter likelihood. In this article, we propose a separable
pseudo-likelihood which is a more accurate approximation compared to a
previously proposed alternative under typical operating conditions. In
addition, we consider using separable likelihoods in the presence of many
objects and ambiguity in associating measurements with objects that originated
them. To this end, we use a state space model with a hypothesis based
parameterisation, and, develop an empirical Bayesian perspective in order to
evaluate separable likelihoods on this model using local filtering. Bayesian
inference with this likelihood is carried out using belief propagation on the
associated pairwise Markov random field. We specify a particle algorithm for
latent parameter estimation in a linear Gaussian state space model and
demonstrate its efficacy for network self-calibration using measurements from
non-cooperative targets in comparison with alternatives.

of 52 high-resolution spectra have been gathered over a decade. We use their
analysis, in combination with the photometric data from All Sky Automated
Survey and Hipparcos catalogues, to conclude that HD 64315 is composed of at
least two spectroscopic binaries, one of which is an eclipsing binary. HD 64315
contains two binary systems, one of which is an eclipsing binary. The two
binaries are separated by 0.09 arcsec (or 500 AU) if the most likely distance
to the system, around 5 kpc, is considered. The presence of fainter companions
is not excluded by current observations. The non-eclipsing binary (HD 64315
AaAb) has a period of 2.70962901+/-0.00000021 d. Its components are hotter than
those of the eclipsing binary, and dominate the appearance of the system. The
eclipsing binary (HD 64315 BaBb) has a shorter period of 1.0189569+/-0.0000008
d. We derive masses of 14.6+-2.3 M$_\odot$ for both components of the BaBb
system. They are almost identical; both stars are overfilling their respective
Roche lobes, and share a common envelope in an overcontact configuration. The
non-eclipsing binary is a detached system composed of two stars with spectral
types around O6 V with minimum masses of 10.8 M$_\odot$ and 10.2 M$_\odot$, and
likely masses aprox. 30 M$_\odot$. HD 64315 provides a cautionary tale about
high-mass star isolation and multiplicity. Its total mass is likely above 90
M$_\odot$,but it seems to have formed without an accompanying cluster. It

placing them in an intermediate category between rocky planets and gas giants.
These atmospheres are too massive to have been primarily outgassed, yet they
never underwent runaway gas accretion. The ice giants never reached critical
core mass ($M_\text{crit}$) in a full gas disk, yet their cores are $\gtrsim
M_\text{crit}$, suggesting that their envelopes were mainly accreted at the end
of the disk lifetime. Pebble accretion calls into question traditional slow
atmospheric growth during this phase. We show that the full-sized ice giants
predominantly accreted gas from a disk depleted by at least a factor of $\sim
100$. Such a disk dissipates in $ \lesssim 10^5$ years. Why would both cores
stay sub-critical for the entire $\sim$ Myr disk lifetime, only to reach
$M_\text{crit}$ in the final $10^5$ years? This is fine tuned. Ice giants in
the outer disk have atmospheric mass fractions comparable to the disk
gas-to-solid ratio during the bulk of their gas accretion. This point in disk
evolution coincides with a dynamical upheaval: the gas loses its ability to
efficiently damp the cores' random velocities, allowing them to be
gravitationally excited by Jupiter and Saturn. We suggest that the ice giants'
cores began growing on closer-in orbits (staying sub-critical), and migrated
out during this dynamical instability. There, their orbits circularized after
accreting much of their mass in solids. Finally, they accreted their envelopes
from a depleted nebula, where the sparseness of feeding zone gas prevented
runaway.

dimensions for conserved currents in local field theories, a claim from certain
holographic models involving bulk dilaton couplings is that the gauge field
associated with the boundary current can acquire an anomalous dimension. We
resolve this conundrum by showing that all the bulk actions that produce
anomalous dimensions for the conserved current generate non-local actions at
the boundary. In particular, the Maxwell equations are fractional. To prove
this, we generalize to p-forms the Caffarelli/Silvestre (CS) extension theorem.
In the context of scalar fields, this theorem demonstrates that second-order
elliptic differential equations in the upper half-plane in ${\mathbb
R}_+^{n+1}$ reduce to one with the fractional Laplacian, $\Delta^\gamma$, when
one of the dimensions is eliminated. From the p-form generalization of the CS
extension theorem, we show that at the boundary of the relevant holographic
models, a fractional gauge theory emerges with equations of motion of the form,
$\Delta ^\gamma A^t= 0$ with $\gamma$ $\in R$ and $A^t$ the boundary components
of the gauge field. The corresponding field strength $F = d_\gamma A^t= d\Delta

(roughly Solar). At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift
SLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf
galaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important
to the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest
distance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study
Gaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical
color is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an
SLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than
Gaia16apd. Thanks to the high signal-to-noise ratios of our spectra, we
identify several new spectroscopic features that may help to probe the

departure from spherical symmetry. In addition, we put the tightest upper limit
yet on the radio luminosity of an SLSN-I with <5.4x10^26 erg/s/Hz (at 10 GHz),
which is almost a factor of 40 better than previous upper limits and one of the
few measured at an early stage in the evolution of an SLSN-I. This limit

Ultimately, at long time-scales, which diverge exponentially for weak or rapid

enables metastable dynamical phases, exemplified by a ""time quasi-crystal"" in
which spins exhibit persistent oscillations with a distinct quasi-periodic

would expect major merger quenched galaxies to pass through on their way from
the blue cloud to the red sequence: 1: major merger, 2: post merger, 3: blue
early type, 4: green early type and 5: red early type. Based on the similar
mass function shapes we conclude that major mergers are likely to form an
evolutionary sequence from star formation to quiescence via quenching. Relative
to all blue galaxies, the major merger fraction increases as a function of
stellar mass. Major merger quenching is inconsistent with the mass and
environment quenching model. At z~0 major merger quenched galaxies are unlikely
to constitute the majority of galaxies that transition the green valley.
Furthermore, between z~0-0.5 major merger quenched galaxies account for 1-5% of
all quenched galaxies at a given stellar mass. Major galaxy mergers are
therefore not a significant quenching pathway, neither at z~0 nor within the

statistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our
results can be compared with individual directly imaged (proto)planets as well
as statistical results from surveys. We calculated three synthetic planet
populations assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas
and planetesimals. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary
mass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during
formation. We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus
entropy ""tuning fork"" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities
for hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead
to a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.
However, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the
post-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of
magnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result
we predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep
increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of
low-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an
estimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas
accretion rate can be estimated. Due to the ""core-mass effect"" planets that
underwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies. Once
the number of directly imaged exoplanets with known ages and luminosities
increases, the observed distributions may be compared with our predictions.

$M_*$ and in denser galaxy environment, with 10 of the 11 most massive galaxies

allowing a pair of D2D users to communicate directly and share the same

higher spectral efficiency, improve the energy efficiency, and lower the

impurity-induced charge order in the attractive Hubbard model, a prototypical

We show that a single impurity induces a charge-ordered texture over a length
scale set by the energy cost of the competing phase. Our results are consistent
with a strong-coupling field theory proposed earlier in which superconducting
and charge order parameters form components of an $SO(3)$ vector field. To
discuss the effects of multiple impurities, we focus on two cases: correlated
and random distributions. In the correlated case, the CDW puddles around each
impurity overlap coherently leading to a `supersolid' phase with coexisting
pairing and charge order. In contrast, a random distribution of impurities does
not lead to coherent CDW formation. We argue that the energy lowering from
coherent ordering can have a feedback effect, driving correlations between
impurities. This can be understood as arising from an RKKY-like interaction,
mediated by impurity textures. We discuss implications for charge order in the
cuprates and doped CDW materials such as NbSe$_2$.

biological processes, including transfer of genetic information, cellular
transport, cell motility and muscles contraction. It is known that these
biological molecular motors usually perform their cellular tasks by acting
collectively, and there are interactions between individual motors that specify
the overall collective behavior. One of the fundamental issues related to the
collective dynamics of motor proteins is the question if they function at
stationary-state conditions. To investigate this problem, we analyze a
relaxation to the stationary state for the system of interacting molecular
motors. Our approach utilizes a recently developed theoretical framework, which
views the collective dynamics of motor proteins as a totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process of interacting particles, where interactions are taken into
account via a thermodynamically consistent approach. The dynamics of relaxation
to the stationary state is analyzed using a domain-wall method that relies on a
mean-field description, which takes into account some correlations. It is found
that the system quickly relaxes for repulsive interactions, while attractive
interactions always slow down reaching the stationary state. It is also
predicted that for some range of parameters the fastest relaxation might be
achieved for a weak repulsive interaction. Our theoretical predictions are
tested with Monte Carlo computer simulations. The implications of our findings
for biological systems are briefly discussed.

nucleus. Coherent exclusive DVCS off $^4$He will probe the transverse spatial
distribution of quarks in the nucleus as a function of the quarks' longitudinal
momentum fraction, $x$. In parallel, the average spatial transverse gluon
density of the $^4$He nucleus will be extracted within a GPD framework using
the measured longitudinal cross-section for coherent $\phi$ production in a
similar range of $x$. Additionally, threshold effects of $\phi$ production can
be explored by exploiting the ALERT detector's large acceptance for low $|t|$
events.

$^3$H and $^3$He) in addition to the scattered electron. The proposed
experiment will provide stringent tests leading to clear differentiation
between the many models describing the EMC effect, by accessing the bound
nucleon virtuality through its initial momentum at the point of interaction.
Indeed, conventional nuclear physics explanations of the EMC effect mainly
based on Fermi motion and binding effects yield very different predictions than
more exotic scenarios, where bound nucleons basically loose their identity when
embedded in the nuclear medium. By distinguishing events where the interacting
nucleon was slow, as described by a mean field scenario, or fast, very likely
belonging to a correlated pair, will clearly indicate which phenomenon is
relevant to explain the EMC effect. An important challenge for such
measurements using nuclear spectators is the control of the theoretical
framework and, in particular, final state interactions. This experiment will
directly provide the necessary data needed to test our understanding of
spectator tagging and final state interactions in $^2$H and $^4$He and their
impact on the semi-inclusive measurements of the EMC effect described above.

investigated a typical case, when defects fill a thin layer below the top film
surface with a constant concentration creating an additional gradient of
elastic fields. The defective surface of the film is not covered with an
electrode, but instead with an ultra-thin layer of ambient screening charges,
characterized by a surface screening length. This geometry is typical for the
scanning probe piezoelectric force microscopy. Obtained results revealed an
unexpectedly strong effect of the joint action of Vegard stresses and
flexoelectric effect (shortly flexo-chemical coupling) on the ferroelectric
transition temperature, distribution of the spontaneous polarization and
elastic fields, domain wall structure and period in thin PbTiO3 films
containing a layer of elastic defects. A nontrivial result is the
ferroelectricity persisting at film thicknesses below 4 nm, temperatures lower
than 350 K and relatively high surface screening length (~0.1 nm). The origin
of this phenomenon is the re-building of the domain structure in the film
(namely the cross-over from c-domain stripes to a-type closure domains) when
its thickness decreases below 4 nm, conditioned by the flexoelectric coupling
and facilitated by negative Vegard effect. For positive Vegard effect, thicker
films exhibit the appearance of pronounced maxima on the thickness dependence

the defect type and concentration. The revealed features may have important
implications for miniaturization of ferroelectric-based devices.

the Unique Games Conjecture, less a small error.
  Let $n\geq2$. Suppose a subset $\Omega$ of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ satisfies $-\Omega=\Omega^{c}$ and $\Omega+v=\Omega^{c}$ (up
to measure zero sets) for every standard basis vector $v\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For
any $x=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and for any $q\geq1$, let
$\|x\|_{q}^{q}=|x_{1}|^{q}+\cdots+|x_{n}|^{q}$ and let
$\gamma_{n}(x)=(2\pi)^{-n/2}e^{-\|x\|_{2}^{2}/2}$ . For any
$x\in\partial\Omega$, let $N(x)$ denote the exterior normal vector at $x$ such
that $\|N(x)\|_{2}=1$. Let $B=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\colon
\sin(\pi(x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}))\geq0\}$. Our main result shows that $B$ has the
smallest Gaussian surface area among all such subsets $\Omega$, less a small
error: $$ \int_{\partial\Omega}\gamma_{n}(x)dx\geq(1-6\cdot
10^{-9})\int_{\partial
B}\gamma_{n}(x)dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}\Big(1-\frac{\|N(x)\|_{1}}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)\gamma_{n}(x)dx.
$$ In particular, $$ \int_{\partial\Omega}\gamma_{n}(x)dx\geq(1-6\cdot
10^{-9})\int_{\partial B}\gamma_{n}(x)dx. $$ Standard arguments extend these
results to a corresponding weak inequality for noise stability. Removing the
factor $6\cdot 10^{-9}$ would prove the endpoint case of the Khot-Moshkovitz
conjecture. Lastly, we prove a Euclidean analogue of the Khot and Moshkovitz
conjecture.
  The full conjecture of Khot and Moshkovitz provides strong evidence for the
truth of the Unique Games Conjecture, a central conjecture in theoretical
computer science that is closely related to the P versus NP problem. So, our
results also provide evidence for the truth of the Unique Games Conjecture.
Nevertheless, this paper does not prove any case of the Unique Games

wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating using an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV)-enabled LTE-U network. In the studied model, the UAVs act as VR
control centers that collect tracking information from the VR users over the
wireless uplink and, then, send the constructed VR images to the VR users over
an LTE-U downlink. Therefore, resource allocation in such a UAV-enabled LTE-U
network must jointly consider the uplink and downlink links over both licensed
and unlicensed bands. In such a VR setting, the UAVs can dynamically adjust the
image quality and format of each VR image to change the data size of each VR
image, then meet the delay requirement. Therefore, resource allocation must
also take into account the image quality and format. This VR-centric resource
allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that enables a joint
allocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, as well as a dynamic
adaptation of VR image quality and format. To solve this game, a learning
algorithm based on the machine learning tools of echo state networks (ESNs)
with leaky integrator neurons is proposed. Unlike conventional ESN based
learning algorithms that are suitable for discrete-time systems, the proposed
algorithm can dynamically adjust the update speed of the ESN's state and,
hence, it can enable the UAVs to learn the continuous dynamics of their
associated VR users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
achieves up to 14% and 27.1% gains in terms of total VR QoE for all users

  Hybridized Carbon Layers: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study","25 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  $\alpha$-graphyne is a two-dimensional sheet of $sp$-$sp^2$ hybridized carbon
atoms in a honeycomb lattice. While the geometrical structure is similar to
that of graphene, the hybridized triple bonds give rise to electronic structure
that is different from that of graphene. Similar to graphene, $\alpha$-graphyne
can be stacked in bilayers with two stable configurations, but the different
stackings have very different electronic structures: one is predicted to have
gapless parabolic bands and the other a tunable band gap which is attractive
for applications. In order to realize applications, it is crucial to understand
which stacking is more stable. This is difficult to model, as the stability is
a result of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which are not well
captured by density functional theory (DFT). We have used quantum Monte Carlo
simulations that accurately include van der Waals interactions to calculate the
interlayer binding energy of bilayer graphyne and to determine its most stable
stacking mode. Our results show that interlayer bindings of $sp$- and
$sp^{2}$-bonded carbon networks are significantly underestimated in a Kohn-Sham
DFT approach, even with an exchange-correlation potential corrected to include,
in some approximation, van der Waals interactions. Finally, our quantum Monte
Carlo calculations reveal that the interlayer binding energy difference between
the two stacking modes is only 0.9(4) meV/atom. From this we conclude that the
two stable stacking modes of bilayer $\alpha$-graphyne are almost degenerate
with each other, and both will occur with about the same probability at room
temperature unless there is a synthesis path that prefers one stacking over the
other.

Fokker-Planck models that determine the probability distribution function (PDF)

the Fokker-Planck equation can rarely be solved analytically and direct
numerical approaches (e.g., continuum and particle-based Monte Carlo (MC)) can
be time consuming, especially in the computation of asymptotic-type observables
including the runaway probability, the slowing-down and runaway mean times, and
the energy limit probability. Here we present a novel backward MC approach to
these problems based on backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) that
describe the dynamics of the runaway probability by means of the Feynman-Kac
theory. The key ingredient of the backward MC algorithm is to place all the
particles in a runaway state and simulate them backward from the terminal time
to the initial time. As such, our approach can provide much faster convergence
than direct MC methods (by significantly reducing the number of particles
required to achieve a prescribed accuracy) while at the same time maintaining
the advantages of particle-based methods (compared to continuum approaches).
The proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable, can be parallelized as easy
as the direct MC method, and its extension to dimensions higher than two is
straightforward, thus paving the way for conducting large-scale RE simulation.

as a function of mass content of fine particles in the mixture, grain-size

critical content of fine particles, with a dependence on the grain-size ratio
and flume tilt. This transition is explained as two simultaneous avalanches in
different flowing regimes (a viscous-like one and an inertial one) competing
against each other and provoking a full segregation and a split-off of the
deposit into two well-defined, separated deposits. The formation of the distal
deposit, in turn, depends on a critical amount of coarse particles. This allows
the condensation of the pure coarse deposit around a small, initial seed
cluster, which grows rapidly by braking and capturing subsequent colliding
coarse particles. For different grain-size ratios and keeping a constant total
mass, the change in the amount of fines needed for the transition to occur is
found to be always less than 7%. For avalanches with a total mass of 4 kg we
find that, most of the time, the runout of a binary avalanche is larger than
the runout of monodisperse avalanches of corresponding constituent particles,
due to lubrication on the coarse-dominated side or to drag by inertial
particles on the fine-dominated side.

redshift space distortions to constrain deviations from general relativity and
probe the existence of massive neutrinos. However, the amount of information
that can be extracted is limited by the accuracy of theoretical models used to
analyze the data. Here, by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model run over
the MXXL N-body simulation, we assess the impact of galaxy formation on
satellite kinematics and the theoretical modelling of redshift-space
distortions. We show that different galaxy selection criteria lead to
noticeable differences in the radial distributions and velocity structure of
satellite galaxies. Specifically, whereas samples of stellar mass selected
galaxies feature satellites that roughly follow the dark matter, emission line
satellite galaxies are located preferentially in the outskirts of halos and
display net infall velocities. We demonstrate that capturing these differences
is crucial for modelling the multipoles of the correlation function in redshift
space, even on large scales. In particular, we show how modelling small scale
velocities with a single Gaussian distribution leads to a poor description of
the measure clustering. In contrast, we propose a parametrization that is
flexible enough to model the satellite kinematics, and that leads to and
accurate description of the correlation function down to sub-Mpc scales. We
anticipate that our model will be a necessary ingredient in improved
theoretical descriptions of redshift space distortions, which together could
result in significantly tighter cosmological constraints and a more optimal
exploitation of future large datasets.

surfaces (also known as leaves of holographic screens) may encode some notion
of entropy. To connect this to AdS/CFT, we study the case of marginally trapped
surfaces anchored to an AdS boundary. We establish that such boundary-anchored
leaves lie between the causal and extremal surfaces defined by the anchor and
that they have area bounded below by that of the minimal extremal surface. This
suggests that the area of any leaf represents a coarse-grained von Neumann
entropy for the associated region of the dual CFT. We further demonstrate that
the leading area-divergence of a boundary-anchored marginally trapped surface
agrees with that for the associated extremal surface, though subleading
divergences generally differ. Finally, we generalize an argument of Bousso and
Engelhardt to show that holographic screens with all leaves anchored to the
same boundary set have leaf-areas that increase monotonically along the screen,
and we describe a construction through which this monotonicity can take the
more standard form of requiring entropy to increase with boundary time. This
construction is related to what one might call future causal holographic
information, which in such cases also provides an upper bound on the area of
the associated leaves.

received much attention. A nontrivial and interesting question concerning this
subject is whether there is a sequential scheme for locally discriminating
between two bipartite unitary operations, because a sequential scheme usually
represents the most economic strategy for discrimination. An affirmative answer
to this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i)
the unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on $d\otimes d$,
i.e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were
assumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in
experiment. In this paper, we improve the result by removing the two
limitations. Specifically, we show that any two bipartite unitary operations
acting on $d_A\otimes d_B$ can be locally discriminated by a sequential scheme,
without using the inverses of the unitary operations. Therefore, this paper
enhances the applicability and feasibility of the sequential scheme for locally
discriminating unitary operations.

solutions from two different finite element models: one based on the 2D
Navier-Stokes equations, and the other based on a simplification thereof, known
as the lubrication approximation. The latter is significantly less
computationally expensive, hence it is desirable to know in which parameter
range this approximation is valid. As a benchmark problem, we consider the
classical dam-break problem. This paper establishes the validity window of the
lubrication approximation in terms of the Reynolds number, Froude number, and
film aspect ratio. To validate the solutions produced by the solver,
experimental data has been obtained for the levelling of silicone oil. The free
surface velocity measured experimentally is compared to that produced by the
two numerical models and found to have relatively good agreement. The
lubrication approximation is then compared with the Navier-Stokes model for a
range of Reynolds and Froude numbers, and for a range of film aspect ratios.
The results show that the lubrication approximation is remarkably robust and
particularly accurate for low Reynolds and Froude numbers, for which inertial
effects are negligible. Using fixed Reynolds and Froude numbers of 100 and 0.01
respectively, the lubrication approximation is accurate for aspect ratios up to
1%.

relies on a large number of labeled data. The state-of-the-art synthesizes such

generate detailed photo-realistic images of faces (with wrinkles). This paper
presents a novel face data generation method. Specifically, we render a large

inverse rendering. Furthermore, we construct a fine-detailed face image dataset
by transferring different scales of details from one image to another. We also
construct a large number of video-type adjacent frame pairs by simulating the
distribution of real video data. With these nicely constructed datasets, we
propose a coarse-to-fine learning framework consisting of three convolutional
networks. The networks are trained for real-time detailed 3D face
reconstruction from monocular video as well as from a single image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce high-quality

different topological models: Kitaev and Haldane chains. This model is
activated by introducing a bond alternation into the Kitaev chain [A. Yu
Kitaev, Phys.-Usp. {\bf 44} 131 (2001)]. Without the bond alternation, finite
pairing potential induces a topological state defined by zero-energy Majorana
edge mode, while finite bond alternation without the pairing potential makes a
different topological state similar to the Haldane state, which is defined by
local Berry phase in the bulk. The topologically-ordered state corresponds to
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger state, which is classified as the same symmetry class.
We thus find a phase transition between the two topological phases with a
reentrant phenomenon, and extend the phase diagram in the plane of the pairing
potential and the bond alternation by using three techniques: recursive
equation, fidelity, and Pfaffian. In addition, we find that the phase
transition is characterized by both the change of the position of Majorana
zero-energy modes from one edge to the other edge and the emergence of a string
order in the bulk, and that the reentrance is based on a sublattice U(1)

$B-$dependence of the relevant Lyapunov exponent's decay is changing from
linear to exponential one around the SNCT ($B \simeq 2$). Moreover, here we
show that even in the nonstationary regime, mean square displacement (MSD) of
the wavepacket is noticeably suppressed in the long-time limit (dynamical
localization). The $B-$dependence of the dynamical localization lengths
determined by the MSD exhibits a clear change in the functional behaviour

function of fermions at finite temperatures, we show that the generalized
Luttinger theorem inherently possesses topological aspects. The topological
interpretation of the generalized Luttinger theorem can be introduced because
i) the Luttinger volume is represented as the winding number of the
single-particle Green's function and thus ii) the deviation of the theorem,
expressed with a ratio between the interacting and noninteracting
single-particle Green's functions, is also represented as the winding number of
this ratio. The formulation based on the winding number naturally leads to two
types of the generalized Luttinger theorem. Exploring two examples of
single-band translationally invariant interacting electrons, i.e., simple metal
and Mott insulator, we show that the first type falls into the original
statement for Fermi liquids given by Luttinger, while the second type
corresponds to the extended one for non metallic cases with no Fermi surface
generalized by Dzyaloshinskii. This formulation also allows us to derive a
sufficient condition for the validity of the Luttinger theorem of the first
type by applying the Rouche's theorem in complex analysis as an inequality.
Moreover, we can rigorously prove in a non-perturbative manner, without
assuming any detail of a microscopic Hamiltonian, that the generalized
Luttinger theorem of both types is valid for generic interacting fermions as
long as the particle-hole symmetry is preserved. Finally, we show that the
winding number of the single-particle Green's function can also be associated
with the distribution function of quasiparticles, and therefore the number of
quasiparticles is equal to the Luttinger volume.

the aggregator's effect on system welfare. Regarding i), we show that
short-term outcomes can be Pareto-inefficient: all players could be better-off.
In practice, however, aggregators and storage units are likely to engage in

show that aggregators and storage units are likely to cooperate in the
long-term. A rigorous understanding of the aggregator-storage unit relationship

ii), we first show that a profit-seeking energy storage aggregator is always
beneficial to the system when compared to a system without storage, regardless
of size or market power the aggregator may have. However, due to market power,
a monopolist aggregator may act in a socially suboptimal manner. We propose a
pricing scheme designed to mitigate market power abuse by the aggregator. This
pricing scheme has several important characteristics: its formulation requires
no private information, it incentivizes a rational aggregator to behave in a

The second gap value decreased with increasing Bi2Se3 layer thickness, but the
ratio between the second gap and the bulk state gap remained about the same for

shock-capturing schemes when solving stiff detonation waves problems is
introduced in the present work. Due to smearing of discontinuous solution by
the excessive numerical dissipation, conventional shock-capturing schemes have
difficulties to obtain the correct location of detonation front without enough
grids resolution. To overcome the excessive numerical errors around
discontinuities by traditional discretized schemes used in non-reacting high
speed compressible flow, we introduce a new shock-capturing scheme in which
besides linear function constructed by MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered
Schemes for Conservation Law) scheme, a step like THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola
for INterface Capturing) function is also employed as another candidate in the
reconstruction process. The final reconstruction function is determined by
boundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm by which numerical dissipation
around discontinuities can be reduced significantly. The new resulted
shock-capturing scheme is named MUSCL-THINC-BVD. One- and two-dimensional
comparative numerical tests about stiff detonation waves problems are conducted
with the 5th order WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and
MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme respectively, which show MUSCL-THINC-BVD scheme can
capture the correct position of detonation waves with improved resolution while
WENO scheme, in spite of higher order, produces spurious waves. Compared with
other existing methods which involves extra treatments by accepting the smeared
out discontinuities profiles, the current method obtain the correct but also
sharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors
from shock-capturing schemes. Thus the proposed approach is an effective but
simple method to solve stiff detonation problems.

due to their low storage requirement and computing efficiency. However, they
suffer much from the non-negligible accuracy drop. This paper proposes the
stochastic quantization (SQ) algorithm for learning accurate low-bit DNNs. The
motivation is due to the following observation. Existing training algorithms
approximate the real-valued elements/filters with low-bit representation all
together in each iteration. The quantization errors may be small for some
elements/filters, while are remarkable for others, which lead to inappropriate
gradient direction during training, and thus bring notable accuracy drop.
Instead, SQ quantizes a portion of elements/filters to low-bit with a
stochastic probability inversely proportional to the quantization error, while
keeping the other portion unchanged with full-precision. The quantized and
full-precision portions are updated with corresponding gradients separately in
each iteration. The SQ ratio is gradually increased until the whole network is
quantized. This procedure can greatly compensate the quantization error and
thus yield better accuracy for low-bit DNNs. Experiments show that SQ can
consistently and significantly improve the accuracy for different low-bit DNNs
on various datasets and various network structures.

degree of roaming is increased, the ignition delays increased, consistent with
the hypothesis that roaming decreases the reactivity of the system. The percent
increase in the ignition delay is strongly temperature dependent, with the

completion. In real applications, however, this approach is confronted with two
challenging problems, namely (1) tensor rank determination; (2) handling real
tensor data which only approximately fulfils the low-rank requirement. To
address these two issues, we develop a data-adaptive tensor completion model
which explicitly represents both the low-rank and non-low-rank structures in a
latent tensor. Representing the non-low-rank structure separately from the
low-rank one allows priors which capture the important distinctions between the
two, thus enabling more accurate modelling, and ultimately, completion. Through
defining a new tensor rank, we develop a sparsity induced prior for the
low-rank structure, with which the tensor rank can be automatically determined.
The prior for the non-low-rank structure is established based on a mixture of
Gaussians which is shown to be flexible enough, and powerful enough, to inform
the completion process for a variety of real tensor data. With these two
priors, we develop a Bayesian minimum mean squared error estimate (MMSE)
framework for inference which provides the posterior mean of missing entries as
well as their uncertainty. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods in
various applications, the proposed model produces more accurate completion

When full load recovery is spotted, the dynamic programming algorithm stops,
thereby giving the least number of switching pairs necessary for system

unauthorized sharing of personal data. We consider a scenario in which an
individual shares his sequential data (such as genomic data or location
patterns) with several service providers (SPs). In such a scenario, if his data
is shared with other third parties without his consent, the individual wants to
determine the service provider that is responsible for this unauthorized
sharing. To provide this functionality, we propose a novel optimization-based
watermarking scheme for sharing of sequential data. Thus, in the case of an
unauthorized sharing of sensitive data, the proposed scheme can find the source
of the leakage by checking the watermark inside the leaked data. In particular,
the proposed schemes guarantees with a high probability that (i) the malicious
SP that receives the data cannot understand the watermarked data points, (ii)
when more than one malicious SPs aggregate their data, they still cannot
determine the watermarked data points, (iii) even if the unauthorized sharing
involves only a portion of the original data or modified data (to damage the
watermark), the corresponding malicious SP can be kept responsible for the
leakage, and (iv) the added watermark is compliant with the nature of the
corresponding data. That is, if there are inherent correlations in the data,
the added watermark still preserves such correlations. Watermarking typically
means changing certain parts of the data, and hence it may have negative
effects on data utility. The proposed scheme also minimizes such utility loss
while it provides the aforementioned security guarantees. Furthermore, we
conduct a case study of the proposed scheme on genomic data and show the
security and utility guarantees of the proposed scheme.

Both the non-dip and dip X-ray spectra are well represented by models in which

ferromagnetic critical point. The metamagnetism of CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$ corresponds

Lawvere theories, monads, PROPs and operads. The first central notion of this
thesis is a common generalisation of these, which we call a proto-theory. In
order to define models of a proto-theory in a category, we need a way of
relating the arities of the proto-theory with the objects of the category. This
leads to our second central notion, that of an interpretation of arities, or
aritation for short. We show that every aritation gives rise to a semantics
functor sending proto-theories to models. In fact this functor always has an
adjoint, giving a structure-semantics adjunction. Furthermore, we show that the
semantics of proto-theories generalises the classical semantics of many
existing notions of algebraic theory.
  Another aim of this thesis is to find a convenient category of monads in the
following sense. Every right adjoint gives rise to a monad on its codomain, and
more generally so does any functor that admits a codensity monad. However, not
all functors have codensity monads. This means that the semantics functor for
monads on a category, viewed as a functor into the category of all functors
into the base category, does not have a left adjoint. We seek a generalisation
of monads with a semantics functor that does have a left adjoint.
  This can be accomplished with proto-theories, but at a cost. The classical
semantics functor for monads is full and faithful; this is a kind of
completeness theorem, and is highly desirable in a notion of algebraic theory.
However, the semantics functor for general proto-theories is not full and
faithful. Thus we seek a generalisation of monads and their semantics for which
the semantics functor is both full and faithful and has a left adjoint. We show
that such a generalisation is given, for suitable base categories, by a certain
kind of topological proto-theory.

the known canonical decompositions, that is, the {\em Dulmage-Mendelsohn}, {\em
Kotzig-Lov\'asz}, and {\em Gallai-Edmonds} decompositions, are limited because
they are only applicable to particular classes of graphs, such as bipartite
graphs, or they are too sparse to provide sufficient information. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new canonical decomposition that is
applicable to all graphs and provides much finer information. We focus on the
notion of {\em factor-components} as the fundamental building blocks of a
graph; through the factor-components, our new canonical decomposition states
how a graph is organized and how it contains all the maximum matchings. The
main results that constitute our new theory are the following: (i) a canonical
partial order over the set of factor-components, which describes how a graph is
constructed from its factor-components; (ii) a generalization of the
Kotzig-Lov\'asz decomposition, which shows the inner structure of each
factor-component in the context of the entire graph; and (iii) a canonically
described interrelationship between (i) and (ii), which integrates these two
results into a unified theory of a canonical decomposition. These results are
obtained in a self-contained way, and our proof of the generalized

scintillator below the water tank to optimize the S/B discrimination, by
minimizing the size of the tanks and having a more compact array to sample the
air-shower footprints with better precision, and by using precise electronics
which will provide time-stamped waveforms to improve the angular and energy
resolution. ALTO is designed to have as low an energy threshold as possible so
as to act as a fast trigger alert to other observatories, primarily to the
Southern part of CTA, for transient Galactic and extra-galactic phenomena. The
wide FoV resulting from the detection technique allows the survey of a large

disks and jets associated with supermassive black holes show variability on a
wide range of timescales. On timescales comparable to or longer than the
gravitational timescale $t_G=GM/c^3$, variation may be dominated by orbital
dynamics of the inhomogeneous accretion flow. Turbulent evolution within the
accretion disk is expected on timescales comparable to the orbital period,
typically an order of magnitude larger than $t_G$. For Sgr A*, $t_G$ is much
shorter than the typical duration of a VLBI experiment, enabling us to study
this variability within a single observation. Closure phases, the sum of
interferometric visibility phases on a triangle of baselines, are particularly
useful for studying this variability. In addition to a changing source
structure, variations in observed closure phase can also be due to interstellar
scattering, thermal noise, and the changing geometry of projected baselines
over time due to Earth rotation. We present a metric that is able to
distinguish the latter two from intrinsic or scattering variability. This
metric is validated using synthetic observations of GRMHD simulations of Sgr
A*. When applied to existing multi-epoch EHT data of Sgr A*, this metric shows
that the data are most consistent with source models containing intrinsic
variability from source dynamics, interstellar scattering, or a combination of
those. The effects of black hole inclination, orientation, spin, and morphology
(disk or jet) on the expected closure phase variability are also discussed.

Cherenkov detectors, as in the HAWC observatory, but combined with scintillator
detectors, to detect air showers induced by VHE gamma rays in the atmosphere.
It is being designed to attain a lower energy threshold, better energy and
angular resolution, and improved sensitivity. The array will consist of about
1250 small-sized (3.6 m diameter) detector units distributed over a circular
area of about 160 m in diameter. Each detector unit will consist of a water
Cherenkov detector and a liquid scintillation detector underneath which will
preferentially identify muons, facilitating the background (cosmic ray)
rejection, thereby improving the sensitivity. The background rejection will be
further enhanced by the close-packed arrangement and the small size of the
detectors which will allow a fine sampling of air-shower footprints at the
ground. In this contribution, we present the Monte-Carlo simulation of the
experiment performed using CORSIKA and GEANT4 simulation packages. The expected
performance of the array in terms of reconstruction accuracies of the shower

based on flavor symmetry and phase space. Similarly, the decay width of
$\Lambda(1670) \rightarrow \Lambda(1116) \eta $ is larger than predicted by
flavor symmetry. In this work, we propose that the axial $U(1)_{A}$ anomaly is
responsible for an enhanced coupling of (some) excited baryons to the $\eta$
meson. We test this idea by including a new, chirally symmetric but $U(1)_{A}$
anomalous, term in an effective hadronic model decribing baryons and their
chiral partners in the mirror assignment. This term enhances the decay of the
chiral partners into baryons and an $\eta$ meson, such as $N(1535)\rightarrow
N\eta$. Moreover, a strong coupling of $N(1535)$ to $N \eta^\prime $ emerges
(this is important for studies of $\eta^\prime$ production processes). Our
approach shows that $N(1535)$ is predominantly the chiral partner of $N(939)$,
and $\Lambda(1670)$ the chiral partner of $\Lambda(1116)$. Finally, our
formalism can be used to couple the pseudoscalar glueball $\tilde{G}$ to
baryons. We expect a large cross section for the reaction $\bar{p}p \rightarrow

have been widely and successfully used to analyze data. However, these methods
have two main shortcomings. First, when a series is symbolized based on
permutation patterns, repetition as an unavoidable phenomenon in data is not
took in to account. Second, they consider only the order of amplitude values
and so, some information regarding the amplitude values themselves may be
ignored. To address these deficiencies, we have very recently introduced
dispersion patterns and subsequently, dispersion entropy (DispEn). In this
paper, we investigate the effect of different linear and non-linear mapping
approaches, used in the algorithm of DispEn, on the characterization of
signals. We also inspect the sensitivity of different parameters of DispEn to
noise. Moreover, we introduce frequency-based DispEn (FDispEn) as a measure to
deal with only the frequency of time series. The results suggest that DispEn
and FDispEn with the log-sigmoid mapping approach, unlike PerEn, can detect
outliers. Furthermore, the original and frequency-based forbidden dispersion
patterns are introduced to discriminate deterministic from stochastic time
series. The computation times show that DispEn and FDispEn are considerably
faster than PerEn. Finally, we find that DispEn and FDispEn outperform PerEn to
distinguish various dynamics of biomedical signals. Due to their advantages
over existing entropy methods, DispEn and FDispEn are expected to be widely
used for the characterization of a wide variety of real-world time series.

efficiently list decodable with small output list size from a fraction
$1-R-\epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the rate of the code, for any
desired positive constant $\epsilon$. The alphabet size depends only $\epsilon$
and is nearly-optimal.
  The first class of codes are obtained by folding algebraic-geometric codes
using automorphisms of the underlying function field. The list decoding
algorithm is based on a linear-algebraic approach, which pins down the
candidate messages to a subspace with a nice ""periodic"" structure. The list is
pruned by precoding into a special form of ""subspace-evasive"" sets, which are
constructed pseudorandomly. Instantiating this construction with the
Garcia-Stichtenoth function field tower yields codes list-decodable up to a
$1-R-\epsilon$ error fraction with list size bounded by $O(1/\epsilon)$,
matching the existential bound up to constant factors. The parameters we
achieve are thus quite close to the existential bounds in all three aspects:
error-correction radius, alphabet size, and list-size.
  The second class of codes are obtained by restricting evaluation points of an
algebraic-geometric code to rational points from a subfield. Once again, the
linear-algebraic approach to list decoding to pin down candidate messages to a
periodic subspace. We develop an alternate approach based on ""subspace designs""
to precode messages. Together with the subsequent explicit constructions of
subspace designs, this yields a deterministic construction of an algebraic code
family of rate $R$ with efficient list decoding from $1-R-\epsilon$ fraction of
errors over a constant-sized alphabet. The list size is bounded by a very
slowly growing function of the block length $N$; in particular, it is at most
$O(\log^{(r)} N)$ (the $r$'th iterated logarithm) for any fixed integer $r$.

a stratosphere - where temperature increases with altitude - these molecular
features will be observed in emission. It has been suggested that stratospheres
could form in highly irradiated exoplanets, but the extent to which this occurs
is unresolved both theoretically and observationally. A previous claim for the
presence of a stratosphere remains open to question, owing to the challenges
posed by the highly variable host star and the low spectral resolution of the
measurements. Here we report a near-infrared thermal spectrum for the ultrahot

potential adiabatically slowly, all advance of the system is in bursts, termed
avalanches. Avalanches have a finite extension in time, which is much smaller
than the waiting-time between them. Avalanches also have a finite extension
$\ell$ in space, i.e. only a part of the interface of size $\ell$ moves during
an avalanche. Here we study their spatial shape $\left< S(x)\right>_{\ell}$
given $\ell$, as well as its fluctuations encoded in the second cumulant
$\left< S^{2}(x)\right>_{\ell}^{{\rm c}}$. We establish scaling relations
governing the behavior close to the boundary. We then give analytic results for
the Brownian force model, in which the microscopic disorder for each degree of
freedom is a random walk. Finally, we confirm these results with numerical
simulations. To do this properly we elucidate the influence of discretization
effects, which also confirms the assumptions entering into the scaling ansatz.
This allows us to reach the scaling limit already for avalanches of moderate
size. We find excellent agreement for the universal shape, its fluctuations,
including all amplitudes.

circumplanetary disk. While previous models focused on the formation of
satellites starting from satellitesimals, the question of how satellitesimals
form from smaller dust particles has not been addressed so far. In this work,
we study the possibility that satellitesimals form in situ in a circumplanetary
disk. We calculate the radial distribution of the surface density and
representative size of icy dust particles that grow by colliding with each
other and drift toward the central planet in a steady circumplanetary disk with
a continuous supply of gas and dust from the parent protoplanetary disk. The
radial drift barrier is overcome if the ratio of the dust to gas accretion
rates onto the circumplanetary disk,
$\dot{M}_{\mathrm{d}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{g}}$, is high and the strength of
turbulence, $\alpha$, is not too low. The collision velocity is lower than the
critical velocity of fragmentation when $\alpha$ is low. Taken together, we
find that the conditions for satellitesimal formation via dust coagulation are
given by $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{d}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{g}}\ge1$ and
$10^{-4}\le\alpha<10^{-2}$. The former condition is generally difficult to
achieve, suggesting that the in-situ satellitesimal formation via particle
sticking is viable only under an extreme condition. We also show that neither
satellitesimal formation via the collisional growth of porous aggregates nor
via streaming instability is viable as long as
$\dot{M}_{\mathrm{d}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{g}}$ is low.

in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. At small values of K, as for the
Blume-Capel model, lines of first and second order phase transitions between a
ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase are present, separated by a tricritical
point whose location is different in the two ensembles. At higher values of K
the phase diagram changes substantially, with the appearance of a triple point
in the canonical ensemble which does not find any correspondence in the
microcanonical ensemble. Moreover, one of the first order lines that starts
from the triple point ends in a critical point, whose position in the phase
diagram is different in the two ensembles. This line separates two paramagnetic
phases characterized by a different value of the quadrupole moment. These
features were not previously studied for other models and substantially enrich
the landscape of ensemble inequivalence, identifying new aspects that had been
discussed in a classification of phase transitions based on singularity theory.
Finally, we discuss ergodicity breaking, which is highlighted by the presence
of gaps in the accessible values of magnetization at low energies: it also

Frontier Fields cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, observed with GeMS/GSAOI (near
diffraction-limited) and compared against VLT/HAWK-I (natural seeing) data.
Using galaxy number counts, we show that the substantially increased thermal
background and lower optical throughput of the MCAO unit are fully compensated
for by the wavefront correction, because the galaxy images can be measured in
smaller apertures with less sky noise. We also performed a direct comparison of
the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of sources detected in both data sets. For
objects with intrinsic angular sizes corresponding to half the HAWK-I image
seeing, the gain in S/N is 40 per cent. Even smaller objects experience a boost
in S/N by a up to a factor of 2.5 despite our suboptimal natural guide star
configuration. The depth of the near diffraction limited images is more
difficult to quantify than that of seeing limited images, due to a strong
dependence on the intrinsic source profiles. Our results emphasize the

power. These infinite families come from the incidence graphs of generalized
polygons. Some of the best known upper bounds on $c(k,g)$ for $g \in \{6, 8,
12\}$ have been obtained by constructing small regular induced subgraphs of
these cages. In this paper, we first use the Expander Mixing Lemma to give a
general lower bound on the size of an induced $k$-regular subgraph of a regular
bipartite graph in terms of the second largest eigenvalue of the host graph. We
use this bound to show that the known construction of $(k,6)$-graphs using Baer
subplanes of the Desarguesian projective plane is the best possible. For
generalized quadrangles and hexagons, our bounds are new. In particular, we
improve the known lower bound on the size of a $q$-regular induced subgraphs of
the classical generalized quadrangle $\mathsf{Q}(4,q)$ and show that the known
constructions are asymptotically sharp. For prime powers $q$, we also improve
the known upper bounds on $c(q,8)$ and $c(q,12)$ by giving new geometric
constructions of $q$-regular induced subgraphs in the symplectic generalized
quadrangle $\mathsf{W}(3,q)$ and the split Cayley hexagon $\mathsf{H}(q)$,
respectively. Our constructions show that \[c(q,8) \le 2(q^3 - q\sqrt{q} - q)\]
for $q$ an even power of a prime, and \[c(q, 12) \le 2(q^5 - 3q^3)\] for all
prime powers $q$. For $q \in \{3,4,5\}$ we also give a computer classification
of all $q$-regular induced subgraphs of the classical generalized quadrangles
of order $q$.

the dynamics induced by the change of the attractive interaction during a
finite ramp time which is varied in order to track the evolution of the
dynamical phase diagram from the sudden quench to the equilibrium limit. Two
different dynamical regimes are realized for quenches towards weak and strong
coupling interactions. At weak coupling the dynamics depends only on the energy
injected into the system, whereas a dynamics retaining memory of the initial
state takes place at strong coupling. We show that this is related to a sharp
transition between a weak and a strong coupling quench dynamical regime, which
defines the boundaries beyond which a dynamics independent from the initial
state is recovered. Comparing the dynamics in the superconducting and
non-superconducting phases we argue that this is due to the lack of an
adiabatic connection to the equilibrium ground state for non-equilibrium
superconducting states in the strong coupling quench regime.

cycle models. Consequently we aim to find optimal parameters for models which
describe the physical processes on the solar surface, which in turn act as
proxies for what occurs in the interior and provide source terms for coronal
models. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize surface flux transport models
using National Solar Observatory (NSO) magnetogram data for Solar Cycle 23.
This is applied to both a 1D model that inserts new magnetic flux in the form
of idealized bipolar magnetic regions, and also to a 2D model that assimilates
specific shapes of real active regions. The genetic algorithm searches for
parameter sets (meridional flow speed and profile, supergranular diffusivity,
initial magnetic field, and radial decay time) that produce the best fit
between observed and simulated butterfly diagrams, weighted by a
latitude-dependent error structure which reflects uncertainty in observations.
Due to the easily adaptable nature of the 2D model, the optimization process is
repeated for Cycles 21, 22, and 24 in order to analyse cycle-to-cycle variation
of the optimal solution. We find that the ranges and optimal solutions for the
various regimes are in reasonable agreement with results from the literature,
both theoretical and observational. The optimal meridional flow profiles for
each regime are almost entirely within observational bounds determined by
magnetic feature tracking, with the 2D model being able to accommodate the mean
observed profile more successfully. Differences between models appear to be
important in deciding values for the diffusive and decay terms. In like
fashion, differences in the behaviours of different solar cycles lead to
contrasts in parameters defining the meridional flow and initial field
strength.

Although pyramid methods are widely used to handle scale changes at inference

Optics (CTO) [1-5], it was recently shown in [5] that a complex source point
(CSP) can be mimicked by a parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) transformation media.
Such coordinate transformation has a mirror symmetry for the imaginary part,
and results in a balanced loss/gain metamaterial slab. A CSP produces a
Gaussian beam and, consequently, a point source placed at the center of such
metamaterial slab produces a Gaussian beam propagating away from the slab.
Here, we extend the CTO analysis to non-symmetric complex coordinate
transformations as put forth in [6] and verify that, by using simply a
(homogeneous) doubly anisotropic gain-media metamaterial slab, one can still
mimic a CSP and produce Gaussian beam. In addition, we show that a
Gaussian-like beams can be produced by point sources placed {\it outside} the
slab as well [6]. By making use of the extra degrees of freedom (real and
imaginary part of the coordinate transformation) provided by CTO, the near-zero
requirement on the real part of the resulting constitutive parameters can be
relaxed to facilitate potential realization of Gaussian-like beams. We
illustrate how beam properties such as peak amplitude and waist location can be
controlled by a proper choice of (complex-valued) CTO Jacobian elements. In
particular, the beam waist location may be moved bidirectionally by allowing
for negative entries in the Jacobian (equivalent to inducing negative
refraction effects). These results are then interpreted in light of the ensuing
CSP location.

where a human-in-the-loop contributes to reduce the complexity of NP-hard

microchan- nels. We investigate the transverse position of a train of bubbles,
its velocity and the associated pressure drop when flowing in a microchannel
depending on the internal forces due to viscosity, inertia and capillarity.
Despite the small scales of the system, inertia, referred to as inertial
migration force, play a crucial role in determining the transverse equilibrium
position of the bubbles. Beside inertia and viscosity, other effects may also
affect the transverse migration of bubbles such as the Marangoni surface
stresses and the surface deformability. We look at the influence of surfactants
in the limit of infinite Marangoni effect which yields rigid bubble interface.
The resulting migration force may balance external body forces if present such
as buoyancy, Dean or magnetic ones. This balance not only determines the
transverse position of the bubbles but, consequently, the surrounding flow
structure, which can be determinant for any mass/heat transfer process
involved. Finally, we look at the influence of the bubble deformation on the
equilibrium position and compare it to the inertial migration force at the
centred position, explaining the stable or unstable character of this position
accordingly. A systematic study of the influence of the parameters - such as
the bubble size, uniform body force, Reynolds and capillary numbers - has been
carried out using numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method,

instance, the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). While decades of
studying the structure of liquids have established a deep understanding of
passive systems, not much is known about correlations in active suspensions. In
this work we derive an approximate analytic theory for three-body correlations
and forces in systems of active Brownian disks starting from the many-body
Smoluchowski equation. We use our theory to predict the conditional forces that
act on a tagged particle and their dependence on the propulsion speed of
self-propelled disks. We identify preferred directions of these forces in
relation to the direction of propulsion and the positions of the surrounding
particles. We further relate our theory to the effective swimming speed of the
active disks, which is relevant for the physics of MIPS. To test and validate
our theory, we additionally run particle-resolved computer simulations, for
which we explicitly calculate the three-body forces. In this context, we
discuss the modeling of active Brownian swimmers with nearly hard interaction
potentials. We find very good agreement between our simulations and numerical
solutions of our theory, especially for the nonequilibrium pair-distribution
function. For our analytical results, we carefully discuss their range of
validity in the context of the different levels of approximation we applied.
This discussion allows us to study the individual contribution of particles to
three-body forces and to the emerging structure. Thus, our work sheds light on
the collective behavior, provides the basis for further studies of correlations
in active suspensions, sheds new light onto the collective behavior, and makes
a step towards an emerging liquid state theory.

If the potential wells are sufficiently deep, the system is modeled by coupled
discrete Gross--Pitaevskii equations with nonlocal self- and cross-interaction
terms representing dipole--dipole interactions. When the dipoles are not
polarized perpendicular or parallel to the lattice, the cross-interaction is
asymmetric, replacing the familiar symmetric two-component solitons with a new
species of cross-symmetric or -asymmetric ones. The orientation of the dipole
moments and the interwell hopping rate strongly affect the shapes of the
discrete two-component solitons as well as the characteristics of the
cross-symmetry breaking and the associated phase transition. The sub- and
super-critical types of cross-symmetry breaking can be controlled by either the

effect of the interplay between the contact nonlinearity and the dipole angle

  Physics",,"10.1007/s11207-017-1144-x",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A very slight rotation-induced latitudinal temperature variation (presumably
on the order of several Kelvin) on the solar surface is theoretically expected.
While recent high-precision solar brightness observations reported its
detection, confirmation by an alternative approach using the strengths of
spectral lines is desirable, for which reducing the noise due to random
fluctuation caused by atmospheric inhomogeneity is critical. Towards this
difficult task, we carried out a pilot study of spectroscopically investigating
the relative variation of temperature (T) at a number of points in the solar
circumference region near to the limb (where latitude dependence should show up
if any exists) based on the equivalent widths (W) of 28 selected lines in the
5367--5393A and 6075--6100A regions. Our special attention was paid to i)
clarifying which kind of lines should be employed and ii) how much precision
would be accomplished in practice. We found that lines with strong
T-sensitivity (|log W/log T|) should be used and that very weak lines should be
avoided because they inevitably suffer large relative fluctuations (Delta_W/W).
Our analysis revealed that a precision of Delta_T/T ~ 0.003 (corresponding to
~15K) can be achieved at best by a spectral line with comparatively large |log
W/log T|, though this can possibly be further improved if other more suitable
lines are used. Accordingly, if many such favorable lines could be measured
with sub-% precision of Delta_W/W and by averaging the resulting Delta_T/T from
each line, the random noise would eventually be reduced down to <~1K and
detection of very subtle amount of global T-gradient might be possible.

possible spectrum and it differs from a Planck function. We also present
numerical spectra from photospheres occurring during the transition into the
coasting phase of the flow. Using these spectral models, we reanalyse Fermi
observations of GRB100507 and GRB101219, which both have been reported to have
very narrow spectra. The bursts can be fitted by the spectral models: For
GRB101219 the spectrum is consistent with the photosphere occurring below or
close to the saturation radius, while for GRB100507 the photosphere position
relative to the saturation radius can be determined as a function of time. In
the latter case, we find that the photosphere initially occurs in the
acceleration phase and thereafter transitions into the coasting phase. We also
find that this transition occurs at the same time as the change in observed
cooling behaviour: the temperature is close to constant before the break and
decays after. We argue that such a transition can be explained by an increasing
mass outflow rate. Both analysed bursts thus give strong evidence that the jets

following the trajectories of a collection of interacting model particles. To
exploit diverse modern manycore hardware, efficient codes must use all
available parallelism. At the same time they need to be portable and easily
extendible by the domain specialist (physicist/chemist) without detailed
knowledge of this hardware. To address this challenge, we recently described a
new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for the development of performance portable
MD codes based on a ""Separation of Concerns"": a Python framework automatically
generates efficient parallel code for a range of target architectures.
  Electrostatic interactions between charged particles are important in many
physical systems and often dominate the runtime. Here we discuss the inclusion
of long-range interaction algorithms in our code generation framework. These
algorithms require global communications and careful consideration has to be
given to any impact on parallel scalability. We implemented an Ewald summation
algorithm for electrostatic forces, present scaling comparisons for different
system sizes and compare to the performance of existing codes. We also report
on further performance optimisations delivered with OpenMP shared memory
parallelism.

from galaxy center or the PAMELA/AMS02 signal, are often challenged by the
absence of corresponding signal from dwarf galaxies and/or from the absence of
an impact on CMB through delayed recombination. We propose a novel scenario
that can avoid these bounds based on the decay of dark matter, X, to a pair of
intermediate particles C and \bar{C} with a lifetime much greater than the age
of universe. The annihilation of these intermediate particles eventually leads
to a dark matter signal. The bounds from CMB can be easily avoided by the fact
that at the time of recombination, not enough C particles had been accumulated.
In order to keep C particles from leaving the galaxy, we assume the particles
have a small electric charge so in the galactic disk, the magnetic field keeps
the C particles in the vicinity of their production. However, they can escape
the dwarf galaxies and the dark matter halo where the magnetic field is weak,
leading to null signal from these regions. The small charge can have
interesting consequences including a signal in direct dark matter searches.

argument, the presence of new physics at very large energy scales (say around

In particular, the vacuum could be totally destabilized. This study was
performed in a flat spacetime background, and it is important to extend the
analysis to curved spacetime since these are Planckian-physics effects. It is
generally expected that under these extreme conditions gravity should totally
quench the formation of true vacuum bubbles, thus washing out the destabilizing
effect of new physics. In this work we extend the analysis to curved spacetime
and show that, although gravity pushes toward stabilization, the destabilizing
effect of new physics is still (by far) the dominating one. In order to get
model independent results, high energy new physics is parametrized in two
different independent ways: as higher order operators in the Higgs field, or
introducing new particles with very large masses. The destabilizing effect is
observed in both cases, hinting at a general mechanism that does not depend on
the parametrization details for new physics, thus maintaining the results
obtained from the analysis performed in flat spacetime.

they suggest that the average ensemble velocity vanishes. Some additional

exhibit no net propulsion while individual less symmetrical

orientation, rendering the shape $\widehat{C}\widehat{P}$-odd, yields
unidirectional motion typically associated with chiral structures, such as
helices. If instead of a structure with a permanent dipole we consider a
polarizable object, some of the arguments have to be modified. For instance, we
demonstrate a truly achiral ($\widehat{P}$- and $\widehat{C}\widehat{P}$-even)

electro-rotation. We thereby show that chirality is not essential for

corotating fast stream is characterized by a stream interface, a fast wind
region and a slower rarefaction region formed by the trailing expansion edge of
the stream. Moving {between these two regions}, from faster to slower wind, we
observe the following behavior: a) the power level of magnetic fluctuations
within the inertial range largely decreases, keeping the typical Kolmogorov
scaling; b) at proton scales, for about one decade right beyond the high
frequency break, the spectral index becomes flatter and flatter towards a value
around -2.7; c) at higher frequencies, before the electron scales, the spectral
index remains around -2.7 and, {based on suitable observations available for
$4$ corotating streams}, the power level does not change, irrespective of the

suggest the existence of a sort of magnetic field background spectrum. This

promising offspring solutions from a candidate offspring set. It is usually
based on the estimated or real objective values of the candidate offspring
solutions. In a sense, the preselection can be treated as a classification
procedure, which classifies the candidate offspring solutions into promising
ones and unpromising ones. Following this idea, we propose a classification
based preselection (CPS) strategy for evolutionary multiobjective optimization.
When applying classification based preselection, an evolutionary algorithm
maintains two external populations (training data set) that consist of some
selected good and bad solutions found so far; then it trains a classifier based
on the training data set in each generation. Finally it uses the classifier to
filter the unpromising candidate offspring solutions and choose a promising one
from the generated candidate offspring set for each parent solution. In such
cases, it is not necessary to estimate or evaluate the objective values of the
candidate offspring solutions. The classification based preselection is applied
to three state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and is
empirically studied on two sets of test instances. The experimental results
suggest that classification based preselection can successfully improve the
performance of these MOEAs.

due to the change in $\sigma_8$. Neutrinos imprint a characteristic signature
in the quadrupole of the matter (CDM+baryons+neutrinos) field on small scales,
that can be used to disentangle the effect of $\sigma_8$ and $M_\nu$. We show
that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on
all scales, to the one induced by $\sigma_8$. We find that the effects of
neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from $\sim0.3\%$ to $2\%$ on
scales $k\in[0.01, 0.5]~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for neutrinos with masses $M_\nu
\leqslant 0.15$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the
momentum of CDM+baryon and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with
massless and massive neutrinos considered. This point towards a velocity bias
between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important to account
for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum
surveys such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the
clustering of matter and CDM+baryons in redshift-space by up to a few percent
down to $k=0.5~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical
processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect
that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and
halos in redshift-space by less than $1\%$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in
the fully non-linear regime can be written as a transfer function with very
weak dependence on astrophysics.

  Model-driven Approach",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While it is well-known and acknowledged that the performance of graph
algorithms is heavily dependent on the input data, there has been surprisingly
little research to quantify and predict the impact the graph structure has on
performance. Parallel graph algorithms, running on many-core systems such as
GPUs, are no exception: most research has focused on how to efficiently
implement and tune different graph operations on a specific GPU. However, the
performance impact of the input graph has only been taken into account
indirectly as a result of the graphs used to benchmark the system.
  In this work, we present a case study investigating how to use the properties
of the input graph to improve the performance of the breadth-first search (BFS)
graph traversal. To do so, we first study the performance variation of 15
different BFS implementations across 248 graphs. Using this performance data,
we show that significant speed-up can be achieved by combining the best
implementation for each level of the traversal. To make use of this
data-dependent optimization, we must correctly predict the relative performance
of algorithms per graph level, and enable dynamic switching to the optimal
algorithm for each level at runtime.
  We use the collected performance data to train a binary decision tree, to
enable high-accuracy predictions and fast switching. We demonstrate empirically
that our decision tree is both fast enough to allow dynamic switching between
implementations, without noticeable overhead, and accurate enough in its
prediction to enable significant BFS speedup. We conclude that our model-driven
approach (1) enables BFS to outperform state of the art GPU algorithms, and (2)
can be adapted for other BFS variants, other algorithms, or more specific
datasets.

interaction and $U(2N)$ chiral symmetry. It is closely related to
three-dimensional QED and other models used to describe properties of graphene.
In addition it serves as a toy model to study chiral symmetry breaking. In the
limit of flavour number $N \to 1/2$ it is equivalent to the Gross-Neveu model,
which shows a parity-breaking discrete phase transition. The model was already
studied with different methods, including Dyson-Schwinger equations, functional
renormalisation group methods and lattice simulations. Most studies agree that
there is a phase transition from a symmetric phase to a spontaneously broken
phase for a small number of fermion flavours, but no symmetry breaking for
large $N$. But there is no consensus on the critical flavour number
$N^\text{cr}$ above which there is no phase transition anymore and on further
details of the critical behaviour. Values of $N$ found in the literature vary
between $2$ and $7$.
  All earlier lattice studies were performed with staggered fermions. Thus it
is questionable if in the continuum limit the lattice model recovers the
internal symmetries of the continuum model. We present new results from lattice
Monte Carlo simulations of the Thirring model with SLAC fermions which exactly
implement all internal symmetries of the continuum model even at finite lattice
spacing. If we reformulate the model in an irreducible representation of the
Clifford algebra, we find, in contradiction to earlier results, that the
behaviour for even and odd flavour numbers is very different: For even flavour
numbers, chiral and parity symmetry are always unbroken. For odd flavour
numbers parity symmetry is spontaneously broken below the critical flavour
number $N_\text{ir}^\text{cr}=9$ while chiral symmetry is still unbroken.

recently due to their wide applications in cryptography, coding theory,

permutation trinomials of the form $x^rh\left(x^{q-1}\right)$ over
$\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q=2^k$, $h(x)=1+x^s+x^t$ and $r, s, t, k>0$ are

AGW Criterion because they all transformed the problem of proving permutation
polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ into that of showing the corresponding
fractional polynomials permute a smaller set $\mu_{q+1}$, where
$\mu_{q+1}:=\{x\in\mathbb{F}_{q^2} : x^{q+1}=1\}$. Motivated by these results,
we characterize the permutation polynomials of the form
$x^rh\left(x^{q-1}\right)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that
$h(x)\in\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is arbitrary and $q$ is also an arbitrary prime power.

reduce the problem of proving permutation polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$
into that of showing permutations over a small subset $S$ of a proper subfield
$\mathbb{F}_{q}$, which is significantly different from previously known
methods. In particular, we demonstrate our method by constructing many new

widely studied, the effect of viscosity on swimming speed remains
controversial. The swimming mode of wild-type E.coli is often idealized as a
""run-and- tumble"" sequence in which periods of swimming at a constant speed are
randomly interrupted by a sudden change of direction at a very low speed. Using
a tracking microscope, we follow cells for extended periods of time in
Newtonian liquids of varying viscosity, and find that the swimming behavior of
a single cell can exhibit a variety of behaviors including run-and-tumble and
""slow-random-walk"" in which the cells move at relatively low speed. Although
the characteristic swimming speed varies between individuals and in different
polymer solutions, we find that the skewness of the speed distribution is
solely a function of viscosity and can be used, in concert with the measured
average swimming speed, to determine the effective running speed of each cell.
We hypothesize that differences in the swimming behavior observed in solutions
of different viscosity are due to changes in the flagellar bundling time, which
increases as the viscosity rises, due to the lower rotation rate of the
flagellar motor. A numerical simulation and the use of Resistive Force theory
provide support for this hypothesis.

structure at their respective critical temperature. Thus the phase transition
from fluid to COP as a function of temperature is second order for all $W$. We
find no evidence of a spin glass phase between a fluid and the COP. Further, we
have used a finite-size scaling analysis to calculate the critical exponents.
The critical exponents at zero disorder are different from the one found at
finite disorders, which indicates that the disorder is a relevant parameter
here. The critical exponent for correlation length of $\nu$ increases and
$T_{c}$ decreases with increasing disorder. Similar behaviour for $\nu$ was
seen in the work of Overlin et al for three dimensional Coulomb Glass model

absence of collusion, verification of correctness can be done easily by
crosschecking the results from the two clouds. We provide a formal analysis of

Ge, Pt, and Sn, using neutron spectroscopy. All members of this family are
magnetic insulators based on 4$f^{11}$ Er$^{3+}$ and non-magnetic $B^{4+}$. At
sufficiently low temperatures, long-range antiferromagnetic order is observed
in each of these Er$_2B_2$O$_7$ pyrochlores. Our inelastic neutron scattering
measurements probe the transitions from the ground state doublet to excited
crystal electric field states belonging to the $J=15/2$ Hund's rules manifold.
This allows us to quantitatively determine the energy eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of these $(2J+1)=16$ states across the Er$_2B_2$O$_7$ series.
The different ionic sizes associated with different non-magnetic $B^{4+}$
cations correspond to positive or negative chemical pressure, depending on the
relative contraction or expansion of the crystal lattice, which gives rise to
slightly different local environments at the Er$^{3+}$ site. Our results show
that the $g$-tensor components, which characterize the anisotropy of the ground
state doublet eigenfunctions, are XY-like for all four members of the
Er$_2B_2$O$_7$ series. However, the XY anisotropy is much stronger for
Er$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ and Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ ($\frac{g_{\perp}}{g_z} > 25$), than
for Er$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ and Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ ($\frac{g_{\perp}}{g_z} < 4$). The
variation in the nature of the XY-anisotropy in these systems correlates
strongly with their ground states, as Er$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ and Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$

notion of association schemes can be relaxed slightly by using suitably
deformed families of stochastic matrices by skipping the integrality
conditions. This leads to larger class of examples which are again associated
to discrete hypergroups.
  In this paper we propose a topological generalization of the notion of
association schemes by using a locally compact basis space $X$ and a family of
Markov-kernels on $X$ indexed by a further locally compact space $D$ where the
supports of the associated probability measures satisfy some partition
property. These objects, called continuous association schemes, will be related
to hypergroup structures on $D$. We study some basic results for this new
notion and present several classes of examples. It turns out that for a given
commutative hypergroup the existence of an associated continuous association
scheme implies that the hypergroup has many features of a double coset
hypergroup. We in particular show that commutative hypergroups, which are
associated with commutative continuous association schemes, carry dual positive
product formulas for the characters. On the other hand, we prove some rigidity
results in particular in the compact case which say that for given spaces $X,D$
there are only a few continuous association schemes.

the problem is treated as a classification task where an object model is

prone to include background information in the model appearance or to lack the
ability to estimate the scale change, which degrades the performance of the

Segmentation and Scale (PAWSS) tracking framework that tackles both the scale

is used to suppress background information and multi-scale samples are
extracted to enrich the training pool, which allows the tracker to handle both
incremental and abrupt scale variations between frames. Experimentally, we
evaluate our approach on the online tracking benchmark (OTB) dataset and Visual

outperforms recent state-of-the-art trackers, and it especially improves the

ranks among the top trackers while operating at real-time frame rates.

gap of 0.68 eV is obtained. Fe$_{2}$VAl is predicted to be semimetallic with

$\alpha$-fairness can only utilize a single scalar to achieve different user
fairness levels. Two different channel state information at the transmitter

statistical CSIT, fixed target data rates are predefined, and the power
allocation problem is solved for sum throughput maximization with
$\alpha$-fairness, through characterizing several properties of the optimal
power allocation solution. For perfect CSIT, the optimal power allocation is
determined to maximize the instantaneous sum rate with $\alpha$-fairness, where
user rates are adapted according to the instantaneous channel state information
(CSI). In particular, a simple alternate optimization (AO) algorithm is
proposed, which is demonstrated to yield the optimal solution. Numerical
results reveal that, at the same fairness level, NOMA significantly outperforms
the conventional orthogonal multiple access (MA) for both the scenarios with
statistical and perfect CSIT.

the buildup of their bulges. An important aspect of the merging process is the
in-spiral of the supermassive black-holes (SMBHs) to the centre of the merger
remnant and the eventual formation of a SMBH binary. If both the SMBHs are
accreting they will form a dual or binary active galactic nucleus (DAGN). The
final merger remnant is usually very bright and shows enhanced star formation.
In this paper we summarize the current sample of DAGN from previous studies and
describe methods that can be used to identify strong DAGN candidates from
optical and spectroscopic surveys. These methods depend on the Doppler
separation of the double peaked AGN emission lines, the nuclear velocity
dispersion of the galaxies and their optical/UV colours. We describe two high
resolution, radio observations of DAGN candidates that have been selected based
on their double peaked optical emission lines (DPAGN). We also examine whether
DAGN host galaxies have higher star formation rates (SFRs) compared to merging
galaxies that do not appear to have DAGN. We find that the SFR is not higher
for DAGN host galaxies. This suggests that the SFRs in DAGN host galaxies is
due to the merging process itself and not related to the presence of two AGN in
the system.

cross-section ($\sigma_{tot}$) with the energy still constitutes an open
problem for QCD. Phenomenological analyses usually relies on analytic
parameterizations provided by the Regge-Gribov formalism and fits to the
experimental data. In this framework, the singularities of the scattering
amplitude in the complex angular momentum plane determine the asymptotic
behavior of $\sigma_{tot}$ in terms of the energy. Usual applications connect
simple and triple pole singularities with asymptotic power and
logarithmic-squared functions of the energy, respectively. More restrict
applications have considered as a leading component for $\sigma_{tot}$ an
empirical function consisting of a logarithmic raised to a real exponent, which
is treated as a free fit parameter. With this function, data reductions lead to
good descriptions of the experimental data and real (not integer) values of the
exponent. In this paper, making use of two independent formalisms (fractional
calculus and Mellin transform), we first show that the singularity associated
with this empirical function is a branch point and then we explore the
mathematical consequences of the result and possible physical interpretations.
After reviewing the determination of the singularities from asymptotic forms of
interest through the Mellin transform, we demonstrate that the same analytic
results can be obtained by means of the Caputo fractional derivative, leading,
therefore, to fractional calculus interpretations. Besides correlating Mellin
transform, non-local fractional derivatives and exploring the generalization
from integer to real exponents and derivative orders, this fractional calculus
result may provide insights for physical interpretations on the asymptotic rise

without assuming any special parametric form of the DGM. Instead, we rely only
on (strict) stationarity and geometrically decaying \b{eta}-mixing coefficients
to establish error bounds for the lasso for subweibull random vectors. The
class of subweibull random variables that we introduce includes subgaussian and
subexponential random variables but also includes random variables with tails
heavier than an exponential. We also show that, for Gaussian processes, the
\b{eta}-mixing condition can be relaxed to summability of the {\alpha}-mixing
coefficients. Our work provides an alternative proof of the consistency of the
lasso for sparse Gaussian VAR models. But the applicability of our results
extends to non-Gaussian and non-linear times series models as the examples we
provide demonstrate.

identify and understand the evolutionary history of these sequences and the
functional relations among them. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is the main
obstacle to proper design and develop homology and evolutionary modeling
applications since these kinds of applications require an effective MSA
technique with high accuracy. This work proposes a novel Position-based
Multiple Sequence Alignment (PoMSA) technique -- which depends on generating a
position matrix for a given set of biological sequences. This position matrix
can be used to reconstruct the given set of sequences in more aligned format.
On the contrary of existing techniques, PoMSA uses position matrix instead of
distance matrix to correctly adding gaps in sequences which improve the
efficiency of the alignment operation. We have evaluated the proposed technique
with different datasets benchmarks such as BAliBASE, OXBench, and SMART. The
experiments show that PoMSA technique satisfies higher alignment score compared
to existing state-of-art algorithms: Clustal-Omega, MAFTT, and MUSCLE.

Equations of electron
dynamics are nearly exact and apply from nuclear particles to stars. These
Maxwell equations include a special term the displacement current (of vacuum).
Displacement current allows electrical signals to propagate through space.
Displacement current guarantees that current is exactly conserved from inside
atoms to between stars, as long as current is defined as Maxwell did, as the
entire source of the curl of the magnetic field. We show how the Bohm
formulation of quantum mechanics allows easy definition of current. We show how
conservation of current can be derived without mention of the polarization or
dielectric properties of matter. Matter does not behave the way physicists of
the 1800's thought it does with a single dielectric constant, a real positive
number independent of everything. Charge moves in enormously complicated ways
that cannot be described in that way, when studied on time scales important
today for electronic technology and molecular biology. Life occurs in ionic
solutions in which charge moves in response to forces not mentioned or
described in the Maxwell equations, like convection and diffusion. Classical
derivations of conservation of current involve classical treatments of
dielectrics and polarization in nearly every textbook. Because real dielectrics
do not behave in a classical way, classical derivations of conservation of
current are often distrusted or even ignored. We show that current is conserved
exactly in any material no matter how complex the dielectric, polarization or
conduction currents are. We believe models, simulations, and computations
should conserve current on all scales, as accurately as possible, because
physics conserves current that way. We believe models will be much more
successful if they conserve current at every level of resolution, the way
physics does.

relativistic quantum and classical systems, and demonstrate that multistability
is ubiquitous. A representative setting is coupled systems of a topological
insulator and an insulating ferromagnet, where the former possesses an
insulating bulk with topologically protected, dissipationless, and conducting
surface electronic states governed by the relativistic quantum Dirac
Hamiltonian and latter is described by the nonlinear classical evolution of its
magnetization vector. The interactions between the two are essentially the spin
transfer torque from the topological insulator to the ferromagnet and the local
proximity induced exchange coupling in the opposite direction. The hybrid
system exhibits a rich variety of nonlinear dynamical phenomena besides
multistability such as bifurcations, chaos, and phase synchronization. The
degree of multistability can be controlled by an external voltage. In the case
of two coexisting states, the system is effectively binary, opening a door to
exploitation for developing spintronic memory devices. Because of the
dissipationless and spin-momentum locking nature of the surface currents of the
topological insulator, little power is needed for generating a significant
current, making the system appealing for potential applications in next
generation of low power memory devices.

models as coarse-grained description. With the local energy chosen as the
coarse-grained variables, we apply the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to derive a
reduced model, in the form of a generalized Langevin equation. A Markovian
embedding technique is then introduced to eliminate the history dependence. In
sharp contrast to conventional energy transport models, this derivation yields
{\it stochastic} dynamics models for the spatially averaged energy. We discuss
the approximation of the random force using both additive and multiplicative
noises, to ensure the correct statistics of the solution.

elasticity is used to describe the dynamical behavior of a band-gap
metamaterial with tetragonal symmetry. Unlike other continuum models (Cauchy,
Cosserat, second gradient, classical Mindlin-Eringen micromorphic etc.), the
relaxed micromorphic model is endowed to capture the main microscopic and
macroscopic characteristics of the targeted metamaterial, namely, stiffness,
anisotropy, dispersion and band-gaps. The simple structure of our material
model, which simultaneously lives on a micro-, a meso- and a macroscopic scale,
requires only the identification of a limited number of frequency-independent
and thus truly constitutive parameters, valid for both static and
wave-propagation analyses in the plane. The static macro- and micro- parameters
are identified by numerical homogenization in static tests on the unit-cell
level in [30]. The remaining inertia parameters for dynamical analyses are
calibrated on the dispersion curves of the same metamaterial as obtained by a
classical Bloch-Floquet analysis for two wave directions. We demonstrate via
polar plots that the obtained material parameters describe very well the
response of the structural material for all wave directions in the plane, thus
covering the complete panorama of anisotropy of the targeted metamaterial.

filter (MPF) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) losses. By
suppressing the out-of-band signal with two broadened symmetric SBS losses,
pass bandwidth can be tuned from 500 MHz to 10 GHz. Considering the limited
interaction in the center frequency range, a flat-top response with 0.3 dB
ripple is easily achieved. Unlike a SBS gain based filter, due to the
transparency of the pass band in our proposed filter, hardly no noise is
detected in a noise measurement against an obvious maximum 5 dB noise pedestal
for a SBS gain based one. Considering the wide independent bandwidth and center
frequency tunability, flat-top response, and low-noise characteristic, our
proposed filter can be perfectly used as a supplement of most commericalized
tunable single bandpass filters, whose minimum bandwidth is limited by 10 GHz.
