mere action classification by far in both complexity and value. The challenge
is thus to describe an activity on the basis of its most fundamental
constituents, the individual postures and their distinctive transitions.
Supervised learning of such a fine-grained representation based on elementary
poses is very tedious and does not scale. Therefore, we propose a completely
unsupervised deep learning procedure based solely on video sequences, which
starts from scratch without requiring pre-trained networks, predefined body
models, or keypoints. A combinatorial sequence matching algorithm proposes
relations between frames from subsets of the training data, while a CNN is
reconciling the transitivity conflicts of the different subsets to learn a
single concerted pose embedding despite changes in appearance across sequences.
Without any manual annotation, the model learns a structured representation of
postures and their temporal development. The model not only enables retrieval
of similar postures but also temporal super-resolution. Additionally, based on
a recurrent formulation, next frames can be synthesized.

  heterogeneity in random effects pairwise and network meta-analyses",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Pairwise and network meta-analyses using fixed effect and random
effects models are commonly applied to synthesise evidence from randomised
controlled trials. The models differ in their assumptions and the
interpretation of the results. The model choice depends on the objective of the
analysis and knowledge of the included studies. Fixed effect models are often
used because there are too few studies with which to estimate the between-study
standard deviation from the data alone. Objectives: The aim is to propose a
framework for eliciting an informative prior distribution for the between-study
standard deviation in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis model to
genuinely represent heterogeneity when data are sparse. Methods: We developed
an elicitation method using external information such as empirical evidence and
experts' beliefs on the 'range' of treatment effects in order to infer the
prior distribution for the between-study standard deviation. We also developed
the method to be implemented in R. Results: The three-stage elicitation
approach allows uncertainty to be represented by a genuine prior distribution
to avoid making misleading inferences. It is flexible to what judgments an
expert can provide, and is applicable to all types of outcome measure for which
a treatment effect can be constructed on an additive scale. Conclusions: The
choice between using a fixed effect or random effects meta-analysis model
depends on the inferences required and not on the number of available studies.
Our elicitation framework captures external evidence about heterogeneity and
overcomes the often implausible assumption that studies are estimating the same
treatment effect, thereby improving the quality of inferences in decision
making.

order, wherein the growth of magnetic correlations with decreasing temperature
$T$ is anomalously slow. These entropic effects cause the spectral weight
associated with the Van Hove singularity (VHS) to shift rapidly and nearly
linearly toward half filling at higher $T$, consistent with a picture of the
VHS driving the pseudogap transition at a temperature $\sim T^*$. As a
byproduct, we develop an order-parameter classification scheme that predicts
supertransitions between families of order parameters. As one example, we find
that by tuning the hopping parameters, it is possible to drive the cuprates

in solvation dynamics we carry out several computer experiments. We perform
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on three protein-water systems namely,
Lysozyme, Myoglobin and sweet protein Monellin. In these experiments we mutate
the charges of the neighbouring amino acid side chains of certain natural
probes (Tryptophan) and also freeze the side chain motions. In order to
distinguish between different contributions, we decompose the total solvation
energy response in terms of various components present in the system. This
allows us to capture the interplay among different self and cross-energy
correlation terms. Freezing the protein motions removes the slowest component
that results from side chain fluctuations, but a part of slowness remains. This
leads to the conclusion that the slow component in the ~20-80 ps range arises
from slow water molecules present in the hydration layer. While the more than
100 ps component may arise from various sources namely, adjacent charges in
amino acid side chains, the water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to them
and a dynamically coupled motion between side chain and water. The charges, in
addition, enforce a structural ordering of nearby water molecules and helps to
form local long-lived hydrogen bonded network. Further separation of the
spatial and temporal responses in solvation dynamics reveals different roles of
hydration and bulk water. We find that the hydration layer water molecules are
largely responsible for the slow component whereas the initial ultrafast decay
arise predominantly (~80%) due to the bulk. This agrees with earlier
theoretical observations. We also attempt to rationalise our results with the
help of a molecular hydrodynamic theory that was developed using classical time
dependent density functional theory in a semi quantitative manner.

temporal point-splitting. In strong coupling, we recover the usual result for
the perfectly conducting spherical shell but in addition, there is an
integrated curvature-squared divergent contribution. For finite coupling, there
are additional divergent contributions; in particular, there is a familiar

advance the statistical analyses that will be used to analyze the data.
Typically these analyses will involve adjusting for small imbalances in
baseline covariates. However, this poses a dilemma, since adjusting for too
many covariates can hurt precision more than it helps, and it is often unclear
which covariates are predictive of outcome prior to conducting the experiment.
For example, both post-stratification and OLS regression adjustments can
actually increase variance (relative to a simple difference in means) if too
many covariates are used. OLS is also biased under the Neyman-Rubin model. In
this paper, we introduce the LOOP (""Leave-One-Out Potential outcomes"")
estimator of the average treatment effect. We leave out each observation and
then impute that observation's treatment and control potential outcomes using a
prediction algorithm, such as a random forest. This estimator is unbiased under
the Neyman-Rubin model, generally performs at least as well as the unadjusted
estimator, and the experimental randomization largely justifies the statistical
assumptions made. Importantly, the LOOP estimator also enables us to take
advantage of automatic variable selection when using random forests.

better distance profiles for q-ary signal sets. Finally, we show improvements

invasive surgeries (MIS) lies in its computational performance and accuracy in
dealing with challenging MIS scenes. Even with the latest hardware and software
technologies, achieving both real-time and accurate augmented information
overlay in MIS is still a formidable task. In this paper, we present a novel
real-time AR framework for MIS that achieves interactive geometric aware
augmented reality in endoscopic surgery with stereo views. Our framework tracks
the movement of the endoscopic camera and simultaneously reconstructs a dense
geometric mesh of the MIS scene. The movement of the camera is predicted by
minimising the re-projection error to achieve a fast tracking performance,
while the 3D mesh is incrementally built by a dense zero mean normalised cross
correlation stereo matching method to improve the accuracy of the surface
reconstruction. Our proposed system does not require any prior template or
pre-operative scan and can infer the geometric information intra-operatively in
real-time. With the geometric information available, our proposed AR framework
is able to interactively add annotations, localisation of tumours and vessels,
and measurement labelling with greater precision and accuracy compared with the

show how well the lensing signal can be reconstructed using the
three-dimensional quadratic lensing estimator in Fourier space assuming
different survey strategies. The numerical code introduced in this work is
capable of dealing with issues that can not be treated analytically such as the
discreteness of visibility measurements and the inclusion of a realistic model
for the antennae distribution. This paves the way for future numerical studies
implementing more realistic reionization models, foreground subtraction
schemes, and testing the performance of lensing estimators that take into
account the non-Gaussian distribution of HI after reionization. If multiple
frequency channels covering $z \sim 7-11.6$ are combined, Phase 1 of SKA-Low

total resolution of $\sim 1.6$ arcmin. The SKA-Low Phase 2 should be capable of

attributes, or metadata, to link to each other. It is a property often found in
social networks manifesting as a higher tendency of links occurring between
people with the same age, race, or political belief. Quantifying the level of
assortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with
different attributes) can shed light on the factors involved in the formation
of links and contagion processes in complex networks. It is common practice to
measure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient,
or modularity in the case of discrete-valued metadata. This global value is the
average level of assortativity across the network and may not be a
representative statistic when mixing patterns are heterogeneous. For example, a
social network spanning the globe may exhibit local differences in mixing
patterns as a consequence of differences in cultural norms. Here, we introduce
an approach to localise this global measure so that we can describe the
assortativity, across multiple scales, at the node level. Consequently we are
able to capture and qualitatively evaluate the distribution of mixing patterns
in the network. We find that for many real-world networks the distribution of
assortativity is skewed, overdispersed and multimodal. Our method provides a
clearer lens through which we can more closely examine mixing patterns in
networks.

learn object detectors from scratch. State-of-the-art object objectors rely
heavily on the off-the-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classification
datasets like ImageNet, which incurs learning bias due to the difference on
both the loss functions and the category distributions between classification
and detection tasks. Model fine-tuning for the detection task could alleviate
this bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides, transferring
pre-trained models from classification to detection between discrepant domains
is even more difficult (e.g. RGB to depth images). A better solution to tackle
these two critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, which
motivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly failed
due to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in object
detection. In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for training
object detectors from scratch. One of the key findings is that deep
supervision, enabled by dense layer-wise connections, plays a critical role in
learning a good detector. Combining with several other principles, we develop
DSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD) framework. Experiments on PASCAL
VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve better
results than the state-of-the-art solutions with much more compact models. For
instance, DSOD outperforms SSD on all three benchmarks with real-time detection
speed, while requires only 1/2 parameters to SSD and 1/10 parameters to Faster

analyses of interaction networks. However, these analyses may be sensitive to
sampling biases in both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and
interactions (the links between nodes). These issues may affect the accuracy of
empirically constructed ecological networks. We explore the properties of
sampled ecological networks by simulating large-scale ecological networks with
predetermined topologies, and sampling them with different mathematical
procedures. Several types of modular networks were generated, intended to
represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of
ecological interactions. We sampled these networks with different sampling
designs that may be encountered in field experiments. The observed networks
generated by each sampling process were analyzed with respect to number and
size of components. We show that the sampling effort needed to estimate
underlying network properties depends both on the sampling design and on
network topology. Networks with random or scale-free modules require more
complete sampling compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite.
Overall, the structure of nested modules was the easiest to detect, regardless
of sampling design. Sampling according to species degree was consistently found
to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure. Conversely,
sampling according to module results in an accurate view of certain modules,
but fails to provide a global picture of the underlying network. We recommend
that these findings are incorporated into the design of projects aiming to
characterize large networks of species interactions in the field, to reduce
sampling biases. The software scripts developed to construct and sample
networks are provided for further explorations of network structure and
comparisons to real interaction data.

momentum-dependent information on the strength of electron-phonon and
phonon-phonon coupling (EPC and PPC, respectively) across the entire Brillouin
zone (BZ) has proved difficult to obtain. Here we demonstrate that ultrafast
electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) directly provides such information. By
exploiting symmetry-based selection rules and time-resolution, scattering from
different phonon branches can be distinguished even without energy resolution.
Using graphite as a model system, we show that UEDS patterns map the relative
EPC and PPC strength through their profound sensitivity to photoinduced changes
in phonon populations. We measure strong EPC to the $K$-point transverse
optical phonon of $A_1'$ symmetry ($K-A_1'$) and along the entire longitudinal
optical branch between $\Gamma-K$, not only to the $\Gamma-E_{2g}$ phonon as
previously emphasized. We also determine that the subsequent phonon relaxation
pathway involves three stages; decay via several identifiable channels to
transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons (1-2 ps),
intraband thermalization of the non-equilibrium TA/LA phonon populations (30-40
ps) and interband relaxation of the LA/TA modes (115 ps). Combining UEDS with
ultrafast angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy will yield a complete
picture of the dynamics within and between electron and phonon subsystems,
helping to unravel complex phases in which the intertwined nature of these
systems have a strong influence on emergent properties.

Further, we propose the Observing Information Throughput ($OIT$) as a metric

although a SYZ telescope yields a superb imaging quality over a large field of
view, a two-mirror (RC) telescope design holds a higher overall throughput, a
better diffraction-limited imaging quality in the central field of view
(FOV$<5'$) which is better for the performance of extreme Adaptive Optics (AO),
and a generally better scientific performance with a higher $OIT$ value.

atmospheric magnetic field has been detected. To gain insights into the
interplay between atmospheres, winds, and magnetic fields of massive stars, we
acquired UV and X-ray data of HD 54879 using the Hubble Space Telescope and the
XMM-Newton satellite. In addition, 35 optical amateur spectra were secured to
study the variability of HD 54879. A multiwavelength (X-ray to optical)
spectral analysis is performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model
atmosphere code and the xspec software.
  Results: The photospheric parameters are typical for an O9.7 V star. The
microturbulent, macroturbulent, and projected rotational velocities are lower
than previously suggested (<4 km/s). An initial mass of 16$\,M_\odot$ and an
age of 5 Myr are inferred from evolutionary tracks. We derive a mean X-ray
emitting temperature of $\log T_{\rm X} = 6.7\,$[K] and an X-ray luminosity of
$\log L_\text{X} = 32\,$[erg/s]. Short- and long-scale variability is seen in
the H-alpha line, but only a very long period of $P \approx 5\,$yr could be
estimated. Assessing the circumstellar density of HD 54879 using UV spectra, we
can roughly estimate the mass-loss rate HD 54879 would have in the absence of a
magnetic field as $\log \dot{M}_{B=0}\approx -9.0\,[{M_\odot}/{\rm yr}]$. The
magnetic field traps the stellar wind up to the Alfv\'en radius >
$12\,R_\odot$, implying that its true mass-loss rate is $\log \dot{M}<
-10.2\,[{M_\odot}/{\rm yr}]$. Hence, density enhancements around magnetic stars
can be exploited to estimate mass-loss rates of non-magnetic stars of similar
spectral types, essential for resolving the weak wind problem.
  Conclusions: Our study confirms that strongly magnetized stars lose little or
no mass, and supplies important constraints on the weak-wind problem of massive
main sequence stars.

a period of renewed and rapid development. The dominant scenario for bulge
formation is that of the Milky Way as a nearly pure disk galaxy, with the inner
disk having formed a bar and buckled. This can potentially explain virtually
all bulge stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, comprising 95% of the stellar population.
The evidence is the incredible success in N-body models of this type in making
meaningful predictions, such as the rotation curve and velocity dispersion
measured from radial velocities, and the spatial morphologies of the
peanut/X-shape and the long bar. The classical bulge scenario remains viable
for stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and potentially a minority of the other stars. A
classical bulge is expected from Lambda-CDM cosmological simulations, can
accentuate the properties of an existing bar in a hybrid system, and is most
consistent with the bulge abundance trends such as [Mg/Fe], which are elevated
relative to both the thin and thick disks. Finally, the clumpy-galaxy scenario
is considered, as it is the correct description of most Milky Way precursors
given observations of high-redshift galaxies. Simulations predict that these
star-forming clumps will sometimes migrate to the centres of galaxies where
they may form a bulge, and galaxies often include a bulge clump as well. They
will possibly form a bar with properties consistent with those of the Milky
Way, such as the exponential profile and metallicity gradient. Given the
relative successes of these scenarios, the Milky Way bulge is plausibly of
composite origin, with a classical bulge and/or inner halo numerically dominant
for stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, a buckling thick disk for stars with -1.0 <~
[Fe/H] <~ -0.50 perhaps descended from the clumpy galaxy phase, and a buckling
thin disk for stars with [Fe/H] >~ -0.50.

academic and social integration has been long thought to be important for
students' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the
relative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open
issue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall
in the ""middle of the pack,"" the out-of-class network is the most significant
predictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with
Akaike's information criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades,
and other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and bottom), final
grade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence---these students
are likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they
persist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class
closeness---a measure of one's immersion in the network---helps predict
persistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it
suggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient
in-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or
become committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through
attrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students'
persistence in STEM majors.

exchange of subsystems to negligible quantum correlations and are well
understood and established in the context of distinguishable particles. In this
work, we derive a de Finetti theorem for finite sized Majorana fermionic
systems. It is shown, much reflecting the spirit of other quantum de Finetti
theorems, that a state which is invariant under certain permutations of modes
loses most of its anti-symmetric character and is locally well described by a
mode separable state. We discuss the structure of the resulting mode separable
states and establish in specific instances a quantitative link to the quality
of Hartree-Fock approximation of quantum systems. We hint at a link to
generalized Pauli principles for one-body reduced density operators. Finally,
building upon the obtained de Finetti theorem, we generalize and extend the

pedestrians to efficiently reach their own goals and respect conventions such

needs to predict the human trajectories and plan its own trajectory
correspondingly in the same shared space. In this work, we present a navigation
planner that is able to plan such cooperative trajectories, simultaneously
enforcing the robot's kinematic constraints and avoiding other non-human
dynamic obstacles. Using robust social constraints of projected time to a
possible future collision, compatibility of human-robot motion direction, and
proxemics, our planner is able to replicate human-like navigation behavior not
only in open spaces but also in confined areas. Besides adapting the robot
trajectory, the planner is also able to proactively propose co-navigation
solutions by jointly computing human and robot trajectories within the same
optimization framework. We demonstrate richness and performance of the
cooperative planner with simulated and real world experiments on multiple
interactive navigation scenarios.

Spatially-resolved tunneling spectra on iron porphyrins on Au(111) reveal that
the inelastic spin excitation extends beyond the iron site. The inelastic
features also change shape and symmetry along the molecule. Combining DFT
simulations with a phenomenological scattering model, we show that the
extension and lineshape variations of the inelastic signal are due to
excitation pathways assisted by different frontier orbitals, each of them with
a different degree of hybridization with the surface. By selecting the
intramolecular site for electron injection, the relative weight of iron and
pyrrole orbitals in the tunneling process is modified. In this way, the spin
excitation mechanism, reflected by its spectral lineshape, changes depending on
the degree of localization and energy alignment of the chosen molecular
orbital.

future Neutrino Factory. The main thrust of these studies was to reduce the
overall cost while maintaining performance by exploring the interplay between
the complexity of the cooling systems and the acceptance of the accelerator
complex. To ensure adequate survival for the short-lived muons, acceleration
must occur at high average gradient. The need for large transverse and
longitudinal acceptances drives the design of the acceleration system to an
initially low RF frequency, e.g., 325 MHz, which is then increased to 650 MHz
as the transverse size shrinks with increasing energy. High-gradient normal
conducting RF cavities at these frequencies require extremely high peak-power
RF sources. Hence superconducting RF (SRF) cavities are chosen. We consider two
cost effective schemes for accelerating muon beams for a stageable Neutrino
Factory: exploration of the so-called 'dual-use' linac concept, where the same
linac structure is used for acceleration of both H minus and muons and,
alternatively, an SRF-efficient design based on a multi-pass (4.5) 'dogbone'
RLA, extendable to multi-pass FFAG-like arcs.

analyze the orbital properties of the super-Earth planets. We hypothesize that
these planets formed early and consider the problem of matching planet
formation theory to the current observations. Two scenarios, disk migration and
in-situ formation, have been proposed to explain their origin. In the migration
scenario planets migrate inward due to planet-disk interaction, whereas in the
in-situ scenario planets assemble locally. Therefore, planets formed by
migration are expected to end up in resonances, whereas those formed in-situ
are expected to stay in short period ratios and in non-resonant orbits. Both
predictions are at odds with observations. Aims. We investigate whether a
preferred formation scenario can be identified through a comparison between the
magnetospheric rebound model and the Kepler data. Methods. We conduct N-body
simulations of two-planet systems during the disk dispersal phase, and make a
statistical comparison between the simulations and the Kepler observations.
Results. Comparing the two scenarios, we find that magnetospheric rebound tends
to erase the difference in the orbital configuration that was initially
presented. After disk dispersal, not all planets are in resonance in the
migration scenario, whereas planets do not remain in compact configurations in
the in-situ scenario. In both scenarios, the orbits of planets increase with
the cavity expansion, and their period ratios have a wider distribution.
Conclusions. From a statistical perspective, the magnetospheric rebound model
reproduces several observed properties of Kepler planets, such as the
significant number of planets are not in resonances and planet pairs can end up
at large period ratios. The disparity in orbital configuration between the two
formation scenarios is substantially reduced after disk dispersal.

some models of baryogenesis. While the gravitational effects of baryon
fluctuations are compensated by those of DM, leaving no observable impacts on
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at first order, they modulate the sound
horizon at recombination, thereby correlating CMB anisotropies at different
multipoles. As a result, CIPs can be reconstructed using quadratic estimators
similarly to CMB detection of gravitational lensing. Because of these
similarities, however, the CIP estimators are biased with lensing contributions
that must be subtracted. These lensing contributions for CMB polarization
measurement of CIPs are found to roughly triple the noise power of the total
CIP estimator on large scales. In addition, the cross power with temperature
and $E$-mode polarization are contaminated by lensing-ISW (integrated
Sachs-Wolfe) correlations and reionization-lensing correlations respectively.
For a cosmic-variance-limited (CVL) temperature and polarization experiment
measuring out to multipoles $l_{\max} = 2500$, the lensing noise raises the
detection threshold by a factor of 1.5, leaving a $2.7\sigma$ detection

1/2. Second, our protocol's computational cost is commensurate with the cost of
an attacker. In particular, the total computational cost of correct devices is
a linear function of the attacker's computational cost plus the number of
correct devices that have joined the system. Consequently, if the network is
attacked, we ensure security with cost that grows linearly with the attacker's
cost; and, in the absence of attack, our computational cost remains small. We
prove similar guarantees for bandwidth cost.
  Our results hold in a dynamic, decentralized system where participants join
and depart over time, and where the total computational power of the attacker
is up to a constant fraction of the total computational power of correct
devices. We demonstrate how to leverage our results to address important
security problems in distributed computing including: Sybil attacks, Byzantine
consensus, and Committee election.

that near-electrode effects of thermal and ionization non-equilibrium play
important role in operation of a short arc, because the non-equilibrium regions
are up to several millimeters long and are comparable with the arc length. The
near-anode region is typically longer than the near-cathode region and its
length depends more strongly on the current density. The model was extensively
verified and validated against previous simulation results and experimental
data. Volt-Ampere characteristic (VAC) of the near-anode region depends on the
anode cooling mechanism. The anode voltage is negative. In case of strong anode
cooling (water-cooled anode) when anode is cold, temperature and plasma density
gradients increase with current density resulting in decrease of the anode
voltage (absolute value increases). Falling VAC of the near-anode region
suggests the arc constriction near the anode. Without anode cooling, the anode
temperature increases significantly with current density, leading to drastic
increase in the thermionic emission current from the anode. Correspondingly,
the anode voltage increases to suppress the emission - and the opposite trend
in the VAC is observed. The results of simulations were found to be independent
of sheath model used: collisional (fluid) or collisionless model gave the same
plasma profiles for both near-anode and near-cathode regions.

an evolved star in a globular cluster. Comparing the star with post-horizontal
branch evolutionary tracks, we conclude that it most likely evolved from the
blue horizontal branch, departing the AGB before third dredge-up. It should
thus exhibit the abundance pattern (O-poor and Na-rich) characteristic of the
second-generation (SG) stars in M4. We derive the star's photospheric
abundances of He, C, N, O, Si, S, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni. CNO abundances are
roughly 0.25 dex greater than those of the cluster's SG stars, while the Si and
S abundances agree match the cluster values. Abundances of the iron-peak

revealing the star's origin and evolution, this pattern reflects the combined
effects of diffusive and mechanical processes in the stellar atmosphere.

generates features in 5.5 TB of image data taken by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory of the solar photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and
corona during the time period between May 2010 and May 2014, [2] combines these
features with other features based on flaring history and a physical

to predict whether a solar active region will flare within a time period of $T$
hours, where $T$ = 2 and 24. We find that when optimizing for the True Skill
Score (TSS), photospheric vector magnetic field data combined with flaring
history yields the best performance, and when optimizing for the area under the
precision-recall curve, all the data are helpful. Our model performance yields
a TSS of $0.84 \pm 0.03$ and $0.81 \pm 0.03$ in the $T$ = 2 and 24 hour cases,
respectively, and a value of $0.13 \pm 0.07$ and $0.43 \pm 0.08$ for the area

than, other attempts to predict solar flares. Given the similar values of
algorithm performance across various types of models reported in the

for every nonamenable countable discrete group $\Gamma$, the relations of
conjugacy, orbit equivalence, and von Neumann equivalence of free ergodic (or
weak mixing) measure preserving actions of $\Gamma$ on the standard atomless
probability space are not Borel, thus answering questions of Kechris. This is
an optimal and definitive result, which establishes a neat dichotomy with the
amenable case, since any two free ergodic actions of an amenable group on the
standard atomless probability space are orbit equivalent by classical results
of Dye and Ornstein--Weiss. The statement about conjugacy solves the
nonamenable case of Halmos' conjugacy problem in Ergodic Theory, originally
posed by Halmos in 1956 for ergodic transformations.
  In order to obtain these results, we study ergodic (or weak mixing)
class-bijective extensions of a given ergodic countable probability measure
preserving equivalence relation $R$. When $R$ is nonamenable, we show that the
relations of isomorphism and von Neumann equivalence of extensions of $R$ are
not Borel. When $R$ is amenable, all the extensions of $R$ are again amenable,
and hence isomorphic by classical results of Dye and Connes--Feldman--Weiss.
This approach allows us to extend the results about group actions mentioned
above to the case of nonamenable locally compact unimodular groups, via the
study of their cross-section equivalence relations.

Soc",,,,"math.CO math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leclerc and Zelevinsky, motivated by the study of quasi-commuting quantum
flag minors, introduced the notions of strongly separated and weakly separated
collections. These notions are closely related to the theory of cluster
algebras, to the combinatorics of the double Bruhat cells, and to the totally
positive Grassmannian.
  A key feature, called the purity phenomenon, is that every maximal by
inclusion strongly (resp., weakly) separated collection of subsets in $[n]$ has
the same cardinality.
  In this paper, we extend these notions and define $\mathcal{M}$-separated
collections for any oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}$.
  We show that maximal by size $\mathcal{M}$-separated collections are in
bijection with fine zonotopal tilings (if $\mathcal{M}$ is a realizable
oriented matroid), or with one-element liftings of $\mathcal{M}$ in general
position (for an arbitrary oriented matroid).
  We introduce the class of pure oriented matroids for which the purity
phenomenon holds: an oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}$ is pure if
$\mathcal{M}$-separated collections form a pure simplicial complex, i.e., any
maximal by inclusion $\mathcal{M}$-separated collection is also maximal by
size.
  We pay closer attention to several special classes of oriented matroids:
oriented matroids of rank $3$, graphical oriented matroids, and uniform
oriented matroids. We classify pure oriented matroids in these cases. An
oriented matroid of rank $3$ is pure if and only if it is a positroid (up to
reorienting and relabeling its ground set). A graphical oriented matroid is
pure if and only if its underlying graph is an outerplanar graph, that is, a
subgraph of a triangulation of an $n$-gon.
  We give a simple conjectural characterization of pure oriented matroids by
forbidden minors and prove it for the above classes of matroids (rank $3$,
graphical, uniform).

is also reflected in the amplitude of the circular polarization signals. In
addition, we analyse the properties of the Stokes profiles at the edges of the
flux tube discovering the presence of linear polarization signals for the Ca II

intensity. Finally, we compute the response functions to perturbations in the
longitudinal field and we estimate the field strength using the weak field
approximation. Our results indicate that the height of formation of the
spectral lines changes during the magnetic pumping process which makes the
interpretation of the inferred magnetic field strength and its evolution more
difficult. These results complement those from previous works demonstrating the

classical problems in computer aided geometric design, which regains much
attention in isogeometric analysis in recent years and is called domain
parameterization. However, for most of the state-of-the-art parameterization
methods, the rank of the spline parameterization is usually large, which
results in higher computational cost in solving numerical PDEs. In this paper,
we propose a low-rank representation for the spline parameterization of planar
domains using low-rank tensor approximation technique, and apply
quasi-conformal map as the framework of the spline parameterization. Under
given correspondence of boundary curves, a quasi-conformal map with low rank
and low distortion between a unit square and the computational domain can be
modeled as a non-linear optimization problem. We propose an efficient algorithm
to compute the quasi-conformal map by solving two convex optimization problems
alternatively. Experimental results show that our approach can produce a
bijective and low-rank parametric spline representation of planar domains,
which results in better performance than previous approaches in solving
numerical PDEs.

deformable bubbles dispersed in Taylor-Couette flow (a wall-bounded shear
system) with rotating inner cylinder and outer cylinder at rest. We study the
effect of deformability of the bubbles on the overall drag induced by the
carrier fluid in the two-phase system. We find that an increase in
deformability of the bubbles results in enhanced drag reduction due to a more
pronounced accumulation of the deformed bubbles near the driving inner wall.
This preferential accumulation is induced by an increase in the resistance on
the motion of the bubbles in the wall-normal direction. The increased
resistance is linked to the strong deformation of the bubbles near the wall
which makes them prolate (stretched along one axes) and orient along the
stream-wise direction. A larger concentration of the bubbles near the driving
wall implies that they are more effective in weakening the plume ejections
which results in stronger drag reduction effects. These simulations which are
practically impossible with fully resolved techniques are made possible by
coupling a sub-grid deformation model with two-way coupled Euler-Lagrangian
tracking of sub-Kolmogorov bubbles dispersed in a turbulent flow field which is
solved through direct numerical simulations. The bubbles are considered to be
ellipsoidal in shape and their deformation is governed by an evolution equation
which depends on the local flow conditions and their surface tension.

pilot scheduling and pilot power control algorithm based on the criterion of
minimizing the sum mean-square-error (MSE) of channel estimation of D2D links.
We show that, with an appropriate PR ratio and a well designed pilot scheduling
scheme, each D2D transmitter could transmit its pilot with maximum power. In
addition, we also maximize the sum rate of all D2D links while guaranteeing the
quality of service (QoS) of CUs, and develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a
suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the effect of pilot
contamination can be greatly decreased by the proposed pilot scheduling

while topological methods work with connectivity of cells, which is generally
described as a graph. This paper introduces a Hilbert space-filling curve
method. A space-filling curve is a continuous curve and defines a map between a
one-dimensional space and a multi-dimensional space. A Hilbert space-filling
curve is one special space-filling curve discovered by Hilbert and has many
useful characteristics, such as good locality, which means that two objects
that are close to each other in a multi-dimensional space are also close to
each other in a one dimensional space. This property can model communications
in grid-based parallel applications. The idea of the Hilbert space-filling
curve method is to map a computational domain into a one-dimensional space,
partition the one-dimensional space to certain intervals, and assign all cells
in a same interval to a MPI. To implement a load balancing method, a mapping
kernel is required to convert high-dimensional coordinates to a scalar value
and an efficient one-dimensional partitioning module that divides a
one-dimensional space and makes sure that all intervals have a similar
workload.
  The Hilbert space-filling curve method is compared with ParMETIS, a famous
graph partitioning package. The results show that our Hilbert space-filling
curve method has good partition quality. It has been applied to grids with
billions of cells, and linear scalability has been obtained on IBM Blue Gene/Q.

paleo-longitude. To obtain this important location parameter many other
indirect methods have been developed based on different assumptions. Here we
present a scanning method to derive the paleo-longitude from the usual
paleo-magnetic measurements. This method takes into account the contributions
to the Earth's magnetic potential from additional dipoles with their axes in
the equatorial plane, which were omitted by the traditional paleo-magnetism. In
this method, firstly we assume that $\theta_p$ and $\lambda_p$ are accurate (or
determined well enough), and define a cost function; And secondly we minimize
this function by systematically searching through all longitudes and latitudes
in their domain; Finally when a local minima of this cost function reaches, the
corresponding longitude is the paleo-longitude that we look for. Simultaneously
the paleo-latitude is obtained. Synthetic experiments show that this method
works very well when there are no errors in the geomagntic measurements
(Components of magnetic field: $B_x, B_y, B_z$, or declination $D$ and
inclination $I$). If there exist errors in geomagntic measurements, we
recommend adding a Tikhonov regularization factor to the cost function for
deriving reasonable paleo-longitude, and provide two examples. Error analysis
shows that the main error sources for paleo-longitude are $B_y$ and/or $I$ in
our method. In addition, such a cost function and its like could be used as a
theoretical framework that can directly invert the paleo-longitude,
paleo-latitude, and even the location of the paleo-geomagnetic poles
simultaneously from the paleo-geomagnetic measurements through any appropriate
inversion method.

However, Shortley in 1931 and Landau and Lifshitz in 1958 claimed that no bound
state solutions exist for the weak coupling case when $0 < 2ma/\hbar^2 <= (l +

fitting of the exterior solution to an interior spherical well. Instead, to
each weak coupling, a, we find a unique interior well strength $V_{in} =

of degeneracy (EPD) referred to as the degenerate band edge (DBE). EPDs have
been found in Parity-Time-symmetric photonic structures that require loss
and/or gain, here we show that the DBE is a different kind of EPD since it
occurs in periodic structures that are lossless and gainless. Because of this
property, a small level of gain is sufficient to induce single-frequency lasing
based on a synchronous operation of four degenerate Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves.
This lasing scheme constitutes a new paradigm in the light-matter interaction
mechanism that leads also to the unprecedented scaling law of the laser
threshold with the inverse of the fifth power of the laser-cavity length. The
DBE laser has the lowest lasing threshold in comparison to a regular band edge
laser and to a conventional laser in cavities with the same loaded quality (Q)
factor and length. In particular, even without mirror reflectors the DBE laser
exhibits a lasing threshold which is an order of magnitude lower than that of a
uniform cavity laser of the same length and with very high mirror reflectivity.
Importantly, this novel DBE lasing regime enforces mode selectivity and
coherent single-frequency operation even for pumping rates well-beyond the
lasing threshold, in contrast to the multifrequency nature of conventional
uniform cavity lasers.

One key advantage of the AVRG strategy is its amenability to decentralized
implementations. In this work, we show how AVRG can be extended to the network
case where multiple learning agents are assumed to be connected by a graph
topology. In this scenario, each agent observes data that is spatially
distributed and all agents are only allowed to communicate with direct
neighbors. Moreover, the amount of data observed by the individual agents may
differ drastically. For such situations, the balanced gradient computation
property of AVRG becomes a real advantage in reducing idle time caused by
unbalanced local data storage requirements, which is characteristic of other
reduced-variance gradient algorithms. The resulting diffusion-AVRG algorithm is
shown to have linear convergence to the exact solution, and is much more memory
efficient than other alternative algorithms. In addition, we propose a
mini-batch strategy to balance the communication and computation efficiency for
diffusion-AVRG. When a proper batch size is employed, it is observed in
simulations that diffusion-AVRG is more computationally efficient than exact
diffusion or EXTRA while maintaining almost the same communication efficiency.

the Springer fiber of $\chi$. This basis is independent of $p$. For a basis

show that the canonical basis is compatible with the two-sided cell filtration

way of trading on-demand and reserved Cloud services, the market-driven
regulations of employing spot service could be too complicated for Cloud
consumers to comprehensively understand. In particular, it would be both
difficult and tedious for potential consumers to determine suitable bids from
time to time. To reduce the complexity in applying spot resources, we propose
to use a feedback control to help make bidding decisions. Based on an
arccotangent-function-type system model, our novel bidding mechanism imitates
fuzzy and intuitive human activities to refine and issue new bids according to
previous errors. The validation is conducted by using Amazon's historical spot
price trace to perform a set of simulations and comparisons. The result shows
that the feedback control-based mechanism obtains a better trade-off between
bidding rationality and success rate than the other five comparable strategies.
Although this mechanism is only for black-box bidding (price prediction) at
this current stage, it can be conveniently and gradually upgraded to take into
account external constraints in the future.

active fluids with flow-dependent spectral forcing have been shown to possess
numerical solutions that can sustain significant energy transfer to larger
scales by realising chiral Beltrami-type chaotic flows. To rationalise these
findings, we study here the triad truncations of polynomial and Gaussian GNS
models focusing on modes lying in the energy injection range. Identifying a
previously unknown cubic invariant, we show that the asymptotic triad dynamics
reduces to that of a forced rigid body coupled to a particle moving in a
magnetic field. This analogy allows us to classify triadic interactions by
their asymptotic stability: unstable triads correspond to rigid-body forcing
along the largest and smallest principal axes, whereas stable triads arise from
forcing along the middle axis. Analysis of the polynomial GNS model reveals
that unstable triads induce exponential growth of energy and helicity, whereas
stable triads develop a limit cycle of bounded energy and helicity. This
suggests that the unstable triads dominate the initial relaxation stage of the
full hydrodynamic equations, whereas the stable triads determine the
statistically stationary state. To test this hypothesis, we introduce and
investigate the Gaussian active turbulence model, which develops a
Kolmogorov-type $-5/3$ energy spectrum at large wavelengths. Similar to the
polynomial case, the steady-state chaotic flows spontaneously accumulate
non-zero mean helicity while exhibiting Beltrami statistics and upward energy
transport. Our results suggest that self-sustained Beltrami-type flows and an
inverse energy cascade may be generic features of 3D active turbulence models

On the other hand, by using quantum resources, we can reduce this scaling of

dephasing, it has not been clear whether we can achieve sensitivities with a
scaling of 1/T for a measurement time longer than the coherence time. Here, we
propose a scheme that estimates the amplitude of globally applied fields with
the uncertainty of 1/T for an arbitrary time scale under the effect of
dephasing. We use one-way quantum computing based teleportation between qubits
to prevent any increase in the correlation between the quantum state and its

parallel, for delay-limited transmission, the sum of delay-limited throughput
(DLT) is maximized subject to a maximum allowable user outage constraint under
full CSIT, and the analysis for the sum of DLT is also performed under partial
CSIT. Furthermore, an optimal orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme is also
studied as a benchmark to prove the superiority of NOMA over OMA under full
CSIT. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified by simulations via
different trade-offs for the average sum-rate (sum-DLT) versus the minimum
(maximum) average user rate (outage) requirement.

a new type of sliced space-filling design called sliced rotated sphere packing

They are constructed by rescaling, rotating, translating and extracting the
points from a sliced lattice. We provide two fast algorithms to generate such
designs. Furthermore, we propose a strategy to use sliced rotated sphere

plethora of new applications. Although they have enough resolution and accuracy

the markers are applied to the object in order to reconstruct it. Experiments
have been performed using synthetic and real data. The synthetic data allows a
qualitative and quantitative evaluation by means of visual inspection and

This assumption better reflects the practical situation where the relay node
also forwards signaling traffic, or data originated by other sources. Under
these conditions, we identify the optimal power allocation strategy at the
source and relay, which in some cases coincides with the half duplex

competing providers and services. Accordingly, evaluation of commercial Cloud
services is necessary. However, the existing evaluation studies are relatively
chaotic. There exists tremendous confusion and gap between practices and theory
about Cloud services evaluation. Aim: To facilitate relieving the
aforementioned chaos, this work aims to synthesize the existing evaluation
implementations to outline the state-of-the-practice and also identify research
opportunities in Cloud services evaluation. Method: Based on a conceptual
evaluation model comprising six steps, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
method was employed to collect relevant evidence to investigate the Cloud
services evaluation step by step. Results: This SLR identified 82 relevant
evaluation studies. The overall data collected from these studies essentially
represent the current practical landscape of implementing Cloud services
evaluation, and in turn can be reused to facilitate future evaluation work.
Conclusions: Evaluation of commercial Cloud services has become a world-wide
research topic. Some of the findings of this SLR identify several research gaps
in the area of Cloud services evaluation (e.g., the Elasticity and Security
evaluation of commercial Cloud services could be a long-term challenge), while
some other findings suggest the trend of applying commercial Cloud services
(e.g., compared with PaaS, IaaS seems more suitable for customers and is
particularly important in industry). This SLR study itself also confirms some
previous experiences and reveals new Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE)
lessons.

of many algorithms in machine learning, scientific computing, and beyond. When
the problem dimension is large, computational and/or memory constraints make it
desirable, or even necessary, to perform the task in a distributed fashion. In
this paper, we consider a common scenario in which a taskmaster intends to
solve a large-scale system of linear equations by distributing subsets of the
equations among a number of computing machines/cores. We propose an accelerated
distributed consensus algorithm, in which at each iteration every machine
updates its solution by adding a scaled version of the projection of an error
signal onto the nullspace of its system of equations, and where the taskmaster
conducts an averaging over the solutions with momentum. The convergence
behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in detail and analytically shown
to compare favorably with the convergence rate of alternative distributed
methods, namely distributed gradient descent, distributed versions of
Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent and heavy-ball method, the block
Cimmino method, and ADMM. On randomly chosen linear systems, as well as on
real-world data sets, the proposed method offers significant speed-up relative
to all the aforementioned methods. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel
variation of the distributed heavy-ball method, which employs a particular
distributed preconditioning, and which achieves the same theoretical
convergence rate as the proposed consensus-based method.

corresponding courses. Unfortunately, the literature shows that not many

  framework",,,"10.1063/1.4998948",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fully halogenated or hydrogenated B12X12 (X = H, F, Cl, Br and I)
clusters are confirmed to be icosahedral. On the other hand, the bare B12
cluster is shown to have a planar structure. A previous study showed that a
transformation from an icosahedron to a plane happens when 5 to 7 iodine atoms
are substituted. Later, the transition was confirmed to be seven iodine
substitutions based on an infrared spectroscopy study. In this study, we
investigated the effects of different halogen atoms on the opening of the B12
icosahedral cage by means of density functional theory calculations. We found
that the halogen elements do not have significant effects on the geometries of
the clusters. The computed IR spectra show similar representative peaks for all
halogen substituted clusters. Interestingly, we found a blue-shift in the IR
spectra with the increase in the mass of the halogen atoms. Further, we
compared the Gibbs free energies at different temperatures for different
halogen atoms. The results show that the Gibbs free energy differences between
open and close structures of B12X7 become larger when heavier halogen atoms are
present. This interesting finding was subsequently investigated by energy
decomposition analysis.

language understanding and logic skills, but also depends on common sense. In
this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing warrants systematically.
We operationalize it in a scalable crowdsourcing process, resulting in a freely

On this basis, we present a new challenging task, the argument reasoning

to choose the correct implicit warrant from two options. Both warrants are
plausible and lexically close, but lead to contradicting claims. A solution to

systems arise from chemical reaction networks with mass action kinetics and
satisfy the complex balanced condition. By applying the so-called entropy
method, we show that if the system does not have boundary equilibria, then any
renormalised solution converges exponentially to the complex balanced
equilibrium with a rate, which can be computed explicitly up to a finite
dimensional inequality. This inequality is proven via a contradiction argument
and thus not explicitly. An explicit method of proof, however, is provided for
a specific application modelling a reversible enzyme reaction by exploiting the
specific structure of the conservation laws.
  Our approach is also useful to study the trend to equilibrium for systems
possessing boundary equilibria. More precisely, to show the convergence to
equilibrium for systems with boundary equilibria, we establish a sufficient
condition in terms of a modified finite dimensional inequality along
trajectories of the system. By assuming this condition, which roughly means
that the system produces too much entropy to stay close to a boundary
equilibrium for infinite time, the entropy method shows exponential convergence
to equilibrium for renormalised solutions to complex balanced systems with
boundary equilibria.

unidentified molecules ubiquitously present in the interstellar medium (ISM).
After decades of study, two strong and possibly three weak near-infrared DIBs
have recently been attributed to the C60+ fullerene based on observational and
laboratory measurements. There is great promise for the identification of the
over 400 other known DIBs, as this result could provide chemical hints towards
other possible carriers.
  In an effort to systematically study the properties of the DIB carriers, we
have initiated a new large-scale observational survey: the ESO Diffuse
Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES). The main objective is to
build on and extend existing DIB surveys to make a major step forward in
characterising the physical and chemical conditions for a statistically
significant sample of interstellar lines-of-sight, with the goal to
reverse-engineer key molecular properties of the DIB carriers.
  EDIBLES is a filler Large Programme using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle
Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Paranal, Chile. It is designed to
provide an observationally unbiased view of the presence and behaviour of the
DIBs towards early-spectral-type stars whose lines-of-sight probe the
diffuse-to-translucent ISM. Such a complete dataset will provide a deep census
of the atomic and molecular content, physical conditions, chemical abundances
and elemental depletion levels for each sightline. Achieving these goals
requires a homogeneous set of high-quality data in terms of resolution (R ~
70000 -- 100000), sensitivity (S/N up to 1000 per resolution element), and
spectral coverage (305--1042 nm), as well as a large sample size (100+
sightlines). In this first paper the goals, objectives and methodology of the
EDIBLES programme are described and an initial assessment of the data is
provided.

striking abilities of a biological system. Signal propagation through the group

Information transfer has been experimentally observed in the turning mechanism
of birds flocks. In this context it is well-known also the existence of density
waves: birds under predation, attempting to escape, give rise to self-organized
density waves that propagates linearly on the flock. Most aspects of this
phenomenon are still not fully captured by theoretical models. In this work we
present a new model for the propagation of the speed (the modulus of the
velocity) fluctuations inside a flock, which is the simplest way to reproduce
the observed density waves. We have studied the full solution of the model in d
= 1 and we found that there is a line in the parameter space along which the
system relaxes in the fastest way with no oscillation after a signal has
passed. This is the critical damping condition. By analyzing the parameters
plane we show that critical damping represents an attractor for a steepest
descent dynamics of the return time of the system. Finally we propose a method
to test the validity of the model through through future experiments.

and magnetic fields of arbitrary time dependence is developed in the framework
of the Liouville equation. The Wigner distribution function (WDF) is determined
from the single particle density matrix in the ballistic regime, i.e.,
collision effects are excluded. The single particle transport equation is
established with the electric field described in the vector potential gauge,
and the magnetic field is treated in the symmetric gauge.
  The general approach is to employ the accelerated Bloch state representation
(ABR) as a basis so that the dependence upon the electric field, including
multiband Zener tunneling, is treated exactly. In the formulation of the WDF,
we transform to a new set of variables so that the final WDF is gauge invariant
and is expressed explicitly in terms of the position, kinetic momentum, and
time.
  The methodology for developing the WDF is illustrated by deriving the exact
WDF equation for free electrons in homogeneous electric and magnetic fields.
The methodology is then extended to the case of electrons described by an
effective Hamiltonian corresponding to an arbitrary energy band function. In
treating the problem of Bloch electrons in a periodic potential, the
methodology for deriving the WDF reveals a multiband character due to the
inherent nature of the Bloch states. In examining the single-band WDF, it is
found that the collisionless WDF equation matches the equivalent Boltzmann
transport equation to first order in the magnetic field. These results are
necessarily extended to second order in the magnetic field by employing a
unitary transformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian using the ABR to
second order. The work includes a discussion of the multiband WDF transport
analysis and the identification of the combined Zener-magnetic field induced
tunneling.

strategies either require structural knowledge of the system or presume that

constant. Due to unmodelled dynamics and modelling imperfection, true
structural knowledge of the system is not always available. Further, for the
class of systems under consideration, prior assumption regarding the
uncertainties (or its time derivative) being upper bounded by a constant, puts
a restriction on states beforehand. Conventional ARC laws invite
overestimation-underestimation problem of switching gain. Towards this front,
Adaptive Switching-gain based Robust Control (ASRC) is proposed which
alleviates the overestimation-underestimation problem of switching gain.
Moreover, ASRC avoids any presumption of constant upper bound on the overall
uncertainties and can negotiate uncertainties regardless of being linear or
nonlinear in parameters. Experimental results of ASRC using a wheeled mobile

identifying groups of units that share similar functionality will aid
understanding of the underlying structures of the system. To find such a
grouping, it is useful to evaluate to what extent the units of the system are
separable. Separability or inseparability can be evaluated by quantifying how
much information would be lost if the system were partitioned into subsystems,
and the interactions between the subsystems were hypothetically removed. A
system of two independent subsystems are completely separable without any loss
of information while a system of strongly interacted subsystems cannot be
separated without a large loss of information. Among all the possible
partitions of a system, the partition that minimizes the loss of information,
called the Minimum Information Partition (MIP), can be considered as the
optimal partition for characterizing the underlying structures of the system.
Although the MIP would reveal novel characteristics of the neural system, an
exhaustive search for the MIP is numerically intractable due to the
combinatorial explosion of possible partitions. Here, we propose a
computationally efficient search to precisely identify the MIP among all
possible partitions by exploiting the submodularity of the measure of
information loss. Mutual information is one such submodular information loss
functions, and is a natural choice for measuring the degree of statistical
dependence between paired sets of random variables. By using mutual information
as a loss function, we show that the search for MIP can be performed in a
practical order of computational time for a reasonably large system. We also
demonstrate that MIP search allows for the detection of underlying global
structures in a network of nonlinear oscillators.

performance of many devices in which rutile is used. The diffusion behavior is
known to be highly sample-dependent, but the reasons for this are less well
understood. Here, rutile is studied by using first-principles calculations, in
order to unravel the microscopic origins of the diverse diffusion behaviors for
different doping elements. Anomalous diffusion behavior in the open channel
along [001] direction is found: larger atoms include Sc and Zr have lower
energy barrier for diffusion via interstitial mechanism, apparently
contradicting their known slow diffusion rate. To resolve this, we present an
alternate model for the overall diffusion rate of the large-size dopants in
rutile, showing that parallel to the [001] channel, it is limited by the
formation of the interstitial states, whereas in the direction perpendicular to
[001], it proceeds via a kick-out mechanism. By contrast, Co and Ni, prefer to
stay in the interstitial site of rutile, and have conventional diffusion with a
very small migration barrier in the [001] channel. This leads to highly
anisotropic and fast diffusion. The diffusion mechanisms found in the present
study can explain the diffusion data measured by experiments, and these
findings provide novel understanding for the classic diffusion topic.

1E0102.2-7219 as a calibration standard in the 0.5-1.0 keV band. A new method
to measure the high-energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula and pulsar with NuSTAR
without using its optics may yield a new absolute flux standard in the 3-7 keV
band. A new ACIS contamination model - released with CALDB version 4.7.3 -
leads to a significant improvement in modeling the spectral, spatial, and
temporal properties of the contaminant. The first calibration results of the
scientific payload on board Hitomi confirm the excellent performance of the
instruments before the spacecraft operation problems leading to its loss.
Finally, the meeting discussed extensively a novel statistic approach to
formally identify in which direction the effective areas of different
instruments would need to be changed to bring them into concordance. This

conventional hand-crafted features, we propose a new set of SpatioTemporal Deep
(STD) features that utilize local and global contexts over frames. We also
propose new SpatioTemporal Conditional Random Field (STCRF) to compute saliency

describes the relationships among neighboring regions both in a frame and over
frames. STCRF leads to temporally consistent saliency maps over frames,
contributing to the accurate detection of salient objects' boundaries and noise
reduction during detection. Our proposed method first segments an input video
into multiple scales and then computes a saliency map at each scale level using
STD features with STCRF. The final saliency map is computed by fusing saliency
maps at different scale levels. Our experiments, using publicly available
benchmark datasets, confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also applied our saliency computation to the video

lot of interest. Learning such dictionaries involve two step process: block
formation and dictionary update. Both these steps are important in producing an
effective dictionary. The existing works mostly assume that the block structure
is known a priori while learning the dictionary. For finding the unknown block
structure given a dictionary commonly sparse agglomerative clustering (SAC) is
used. It groups atoms based on their consistency in sparse coding with respect
to the unstructured dictionary. This paper explores two innovations towards
improving the reconstruction as well as the classification ability achieved
with the block-structured dictionary. First, we propose a novel block
structuring approach that makes use of the correlation among dictionary atoms.
Unlike the SAC approach, which groups diverse atoms, in the proposed approach
the blocks are formed by grouping the top most correlated atoms in the
dictionary. The proposed block clustering approach is noted to yield
significant reductions in redundancy as well as provides a direct control on
the block size when compared with the existing SAC-based block structuring.
Later, motivated by works using supervised \emph{a priori} known block
structure, we also explore the incorporation of class information in the
proposed block formation approach to further enhance the classification ability
of the block dictionary. For assessment of the reconstruction ability with
proposed innovations is done on synthetic data while the classification ability

binding energies of molecules to the surface, have been derived experimentally
only for a handful of species, leaving hundreds of species with highly
uncertain estimates. We present in this paper a systematic study of the effect
of uncertainties in the binding energies on an astrochemical two-phase model of
a dark molecular cloud, using the rate equations approach. A list of
recommended binding energy values based on a literature search of published
data is presented. Thousands of simulations of dark cloud models were run, and
in each simulation a value for the binding energy of hundreds of species was
randomly chosen from a normal distribution. Our results show that the binding
energy of H$_{2}$ is critical for the surface chemistry. For high binding
energy, H$_{2}$ freezes out on the grain forming an H$_{2}$ ice. This is not
physically realistic and we suggest a change in the rate equations. The
abundance ranges found are in reasonable agreement with astronomical ice
observations. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the binding energy
of HCO, HNO, CH$_{2}$, and C correlate most strongly with the abundance of
dominant ice species. Finally, the formation route of complex organic molecules
was found to be sensitive to the branching ratios of H$_{2}$CO hydrogenation.

The problem is, however, that interval calculations operate on guaranteed
intervals, that is on pairs of numbers determining minimal and maximal values

are expressed rather as a pair of two other numbers: the average value and its
standard deviation. Here we propose the combination of interval calculus with
basic notions from probability and statistics. This approach makes possible to
obtain the results in familiar form as reliable values of searched parameters,
their standard deviations, and their correlations as well. There are no
assumptions concerning the probability density distributions of experimental

background charge fluctuation in nanostructures, however, its compatibility

plasma periods. Furthermore, it is shown that such time dependence can also be
artificially recreated by significantly disturbing the delicate balance between
the radiation and the density fields required for the exact non-propagating
solution obtained by Esirkepov et al. [1]. The ensuing time evolution is an
interesting interplay between kinetic and field energies of the system. The
electrostatic plasma oscillations are coupled with oscillations in the
electromagnetic field. The inhomogeneity of the background and the relativistic
nature, however, invariably produce large amplitude density perturbations
leading to its wave breaking. In the fluid simulations, the signature of wave
breaking can be discerned by a drop in the total energy which evidently gets
lost to the grid. The PIC simulations are observed to closely follow the fluid
simulations till the point of wave breaking. However, the total energy in the
case of PIC simulations is seen to remain conserved all throughout the
simulations. At the wave breaking the particles are observed to acquire thermal
kinetic energy in the case of PIC. Interestingly, even after wave breaking,
compact coherent structures with trapped radiation inside high-density peaks,
continue to exist both in PIC and fluid simulations. Though the time evolution
does not exactly match in the two simulations as it does prior to the process

watchman route problem is finding a path $ S $ of the minimum length in $ P $

compute a shortest watchman route inside a simple polygon of $ n $ vertices
such that all the points interior to the polygon and on its boundary are
visible to at least one point on the route. If route and polygon be orthogonal,
it is called orthogonal watchman route problem. One of the targets of this

action elicits differential brain responses that can be decoded from single
trials of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and whether brain activity
during human-robot interaction is modulated by the robot's visual similarity to
a human. To address these topics, we designed two experiments. In experiment I,
participants watched a robot arm pour liquid into a cup. The robot performed
the action either erroneously or correctly, i.e. it either spilled some liquid
or not. In experiment II, participants observed two different types of robots,
humanoid and non-humanoid, grabbing a ball. The robots either managed to grab
the ball or not. We recorded high-resolution EEG during the observation tasks
in both experiments to train a Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)

play key roles in performance. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to
outperform traditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensional
representations and high computational complexity may seriously limit their
applicability in practice. For multi-modal feature fusion, here we develop a
Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently and
effectively combine multi-modal features, which results in superior performance
for VQA compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. For fine-grained image

end-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image and
question attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attention
learning in a new network architecture provides a unified model for VQA. Our

satisfiability because they look for models that are definable in a given class
A of constraints, called A-definable models. We introduce a transformation
technique, called Predicate Pairing (PP), which is able, in many interesting
cases, to transform a set of clauses into an equisatisfiable set whose
satisfiability can be proved by finding an A-definable model, and hence can be
effectively verified by CHC solvers. We prove that, under very general
conditions on A, the unfold/fold transformation rules preserve the existence of
an A-definable model, i.e., if the original clauses have an A-definable model,
then the transformed clauses have an A-definable model. The converse does not
hold in general, and we provide suitable conditions under which the transformed
clauses have an A-definable model iff the original ones have an A-definable
model. Then, we present the PP strategy which guides the application of the
transformation rules with the objective of deriving a set of clauses whose
satisfiability can be proved by looking for A-definable models. PP introduces a
new predicate defined by the conjunction of two predicates together with some
constraints. We show through some examples that an A-definable model may exist
for the new predicate even if it does not exist for its defining atomic
conjuncts. We also present some case studies showing that PP plays a crucial
role in the verification of relational properties of programs (e.g., program
equivalence and non-interference). Finally, we perform an experimental

astrophysical objects, from individual stars to entire galaxies, even in the
intergalactic medium, but their specific generation has long been debated. Due
to the development of more realistic models of galaxy formation, viable
scenarios are emerging to explain cosmic magnetism, thanks to both deeper
observations and more efficient and accurate computer simulations. We present
here a new cosmological high-resolution zoom-in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulation, using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, of a dwarf
galaxy with an initially weak and uniform magnetic seed field that is amplified
by a small-scale dynamo driven by supernova-induced turbulence. As first
structures form from the gravitational collapse of small density fluctuations,
the frozen-in magnetic field separates from the cosmic expansion and grows
through compression. In a second step, star formation sets in and establishes a
strong galactic fountain, self-regulated by supernova explosions. Inside the
galaxy, the interstellar medium becomes highly turbulent, dominated by strong
supersonic shocks, as demonstrated by the spectral analysis of the gas kinetic
energy. In this turbulent environment, the magnetic field is quickly amplified
via a small-scale dynamo process and is finally carried out into the
circumgalactic medium by a galactic wind. This realistic cosmological
simulation explains how initially weak magnetic seed fields can be amplified
quickly in early, feedback-dominated galaxies, and predicts, as a consequence
of the small scale dynamo process, that high-redshift magnetic fields are
likely to be dominated by their small scale components.

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at

  Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long
mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short
reads of $\ge$100bp in length, $\ge$1kb genomic reads at error rate $\sim$15%,
full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads, and assembly contigs or closely
related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does
split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and
deletions (INDELs) and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments.
It is 3-4 times faster than mainstream short-read mappers at comparable
accuracy and $\ge$30 times faster at higher accuracy for both genomic and mRNA
reads, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

to the southern radio lobe, and there is extended X-ray emission in the

the model of inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background

Motivated by the fact thermal gradients may occur in biomolecular analytic
devices, and recent stability results, we examine the problem of
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of the transversely-isotropic fluid of Ericksen. A
transversely-isotropic fluid treats these suspensions as a continuum with an
evolving preferred direction, through a modified stress tensor incorporating
four viscosity-like parameters. We consider the linear stability of a
stationary, passive, transversely-isotropic fluid contained between two
parallel boundaries, with the lower boundary at a higher temperature than the
upper. To determine the marginal stability curves the Chebyshev collocation
method is applied, and we consider a range of initially uniform preferred
directions, from horizontal to vertical, and three orders of magnitude in the
viscosity-like anisotropic parameters. Determining the critical wave and
Rayleigh numbers we find that transversely-isotropic effects delay the onset of
instability; this effect is felt most strongly through the incorporation of the
anisotropic shear viscosity, although the anisotropic extensional viscosity
also contributes. Our analysis confirms the importance of anisotropic rheology
in the setting of convection.

Thus, MERGE in linguistics entails information renormalization in physics,
according to different time scales. We make this point mathematically formal in

tensor implementing a coarse-graining, akin to a probabilistic context-free

stochastic tensor networks (TN) built from diagonal tensors and which are

describe the evolution of haploid populations where each individual is
characterised by a phenotype and a genotype. The phenotype of an individual
determines its natural birth- and death rates as well as the competition
kernel, $c(x,y)$ which describes the induced death rate that an individual of
type $x$ experiences due to the presence of an individual or type $y$. When a
new individual is born, with a small probability a mutation occurs, i.e. the
offspring has different genotype as the parent. The novel aspect of the models
we study is that an individual with a given genotype may express a certain set
of different phenotypes, and during its lifetime it may switch between
different phenotypes, with rates that are much larger then the mutation rates
and that, moreover, may depend on the state of the entire population. The
evolution of the population is described by a continuous-time, measure-valued
Markov process. In our last paper [4], such a model was proposed to describe
tumor evolution under immunotherapy. In the present paper we consider a large

scaling limits as the population size tends to infinity and the mutation rate
tends to zero. Under suitable assumptions, we prove convergence to a Markov

the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point
functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source
galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation
function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the
galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source
galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use
independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and
validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias,
the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we
describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during
this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM
cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for
$\Lambda$CDM) or 7 (for $w$CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino
mass density and including the 457 $\times$ 457 element analytic covariance
matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point
functions, and from their combination obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.783^{+0.021}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_m =
0.264^{+0.032}_{-0.019}$ for $\Lambda$CDM for $w$CDM, we find $S_8 =

$w=-0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ at 68% CL. The precision of these DES Y1 results
rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing
a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms.

and their uncertainties for the galaxies used as weak lensing sources in the
Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 cosmological analyses. The Bayesian Photometric
Redshift (BPZ) code is used to assign galaxies to four redshift bins between
z=0.2 and 1.3, and to produce initial estimates of the lensing-weighted
redshift distributions $n^i_{PZ}(z)$ for bin i. Accurate determination of
cosmological parameters depends critically on knowledge of $n^i$ but is
insensitive to bin assignments or redshift errors for individual galaxies. The
cosmological analyses allow for shifts $n^i(z)=n^i_{PZ}(z-\Delta z^i)$ to
correct the mean redshift of $n^i(z)$ for biases in $n^i_{\rm PZ}$. The $\Delta
z^i$ are constrained by comparison of independently estimated 30-band
photometric redshifts of galaxies in the COSMOS field to BPZ estimates made
from the DES griz fluxes, for a sample matched in fluxes, pre-seeing size, and
lensing weight to the DES weak-lensing sources. In companion papers, the
$\Delta z^i$ are further constrained by the angular clustering of the source
galaxies around red galaxies with secure photometric redshifts at 0.15<z<0.9.
This paper details the BPZ and COSMOS procedures, and demonstrates that the
cosmological inference is insensitive to details of the $n^i(z)$ beyond the
choice of $\Delta z^i$. The clustering and COSMOS validation methods produce
consistent estimates of $\Delta z^i$, with combined uncertainties of
$\sigma_{\Delta z^i}=$0.015, 0.013, 0.011, and 0.022 in the four bins. We
marginalize over these in all analyses to follow, which does not diminish the
constraining power significantly. Repeating the photo-z procedure using the
Directional Neighborhood Fitting (DNF) algorithm instead of BPZ, or using the
$n^i(z)$ directly estimated from COSMOS, yields no discernible difference in
cosmological inferences.

to explore the impact of galaxy neighbours on shape measurement and shear
cosmology. The hoopoe image simulations include realistic blending, galaxy
positions, and spatial variations in depth and PSF properties. Using the
im3shape maximum-likelihood shape measurement code, we identify four mechanisms
by which neighbours can have a non-negligible influence on shear estimation.
These effects, if ignored, would contribute a net multiplicative bias of $m
\sim 0.03 - 0.09$ in the DES Y1 im3shape catalogue, though the precise impact
will be dependent on both the measurement code and the selection cuts applied.
This can be reduced to percentage level or less by removing objects with close
neighbours, at a cost to the effective number density of galaxies
$n_\mathrm{eff}$ of 30%. We use the cosmological inference pipeline of DES Y1
to explore the cosmological implications of neighbour bias and show that
omitting blending from the calibration simulation for DES Y1 would bias the
inferred clustering amplitude $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega _\mathrm{m}
/0.3)^{0.5}$ by $2 \sigma$ towards low values. Finally, we use the hoopoe
simulations to test the effect of neighbour-induced spatial correlations in the
multiplicative bias. We find the impact on the recovered $S_8$ of ignoring such
correlations to be subdominant to statistical error at the current level of
precision.

combined with weak lensing samples in order to produce precise cosmological
constraints from the joint analysis of large-scale structure and lensing
correlations. Two-point correlation functions are measured for a sample of $6.6
\times 10^{5}$ luminous red galaxies selected using the \textsc{redMaGiC}
algorithm over an area of $1321$ square degrees, in the redshift range $0.15 <
z < 0.9$, split into five tomographic redshift bins. The sample has a mean
redshift uncertainty of $\sigma_{z}/(1+z) = 0.017$. We quantify and correct
spurious correlations induced by spatially variable survey properties, testing
their impact on the clustering measurements and covariance. We demonstrate the
sample's robustness by testing for stellar contamination, for potential biases
that could arise from the systematic correction, and for the consistency
between the two-point auto- and cross-correlation functions. We show that the
corrections we apply have a significant impact on the resultant measurement of
cosmological parameters, but that the results are robust against arbitrary
choices in the correction method. We find the linear galaxy bias in each
redshift bin in a fiducial cosmology to be $b(z$=$0.24)=1.40 \pm 0.08$,
$b(z$=$0.38)=1.61 \pm 0.05$, $b(z$=$0.53)=1.60 \pm 0.04$ for galaxies with
luminosities $L/L_*>$$0.5$, $b(z$=$0.68)=1.93 \pm 0.05$ for $L/L_*>$$1$ and
$b(z$=$0.83)=1.99 \pm 0.07$ for $L/L_*$$>1.5$, broadly consistent with
expectations for the redshift and luminosity dependence of the bias of red
galaxies. We show these measurements to be consistent with the linear bias
obtained from tangential shear measurements.

bias the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, including those from shear estimation,
photometric redshifts, and observational properties. Covariances are obtained
from jackknife subsamples of the data and validated with a suite of log-normal
simulations. We use the shear-ratio geometric test to obtain independent
constraints on the mean of the source redshift distributions, providing
validation of those obtained from other photo-$z$ studies with the same data.
We find consistency between the galaxy bias estimates obtained from our

showing the galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient $r$ to be consistent
with one, measured over the scales used for the cosmological analysis. The
results in this work present one of the three two-point correlation functions,
along with galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, used in the DES cosmological
analysis of Y1 data, and hence the methodology and the systematics tests
presented here provide a critical input for that study as well as for future
cosmological analyses in DES and other photometric galaxy surveys.

between high-energy gamma-ray and very-high energy neutrino fluxes, we
calculated the expected neutrino event number in a year for IceCube and the
presently under construction Km3NeT. To give a value of the significance of a
detection we considered also the background for the single sources. To this aim
we derived the through-going muon rate, generated by muon neutrino including
the effect of Earth absorption, the density of the Earth and the cross section
$\nu N$. Applying this calculation both to HBL sources and the atmospherical
neutrino background, we can calculate the expected significance of the
detection by IceCube, showing that our scenario is compatible with a no
detection of HBL.

(MSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), are
all based on the absolute error of images. Pearson's inner-product correlation
coefficient (PCC) is also usually used to measure the similarity between
images. Structural similarity (SSIM) index is another important measurement
which has been shown to be more effective in the human vision system (HVS).
Although there are many essential differences among these image assessments,
some important associations among them as cost functions in linear
decomposition are discussed in this paper. Firstly, the selected bases from a
basis set for a target vector are the same in the linear decomposition schemes
with different cost functions MSE, SSIM, and PCC. Moreover, for a target
vector, the ratio of the corresponding affine parameters in the MSE-based
linear decomposition scheme and the SSIM-based scheme is a constant, which is
just the value of PCC between the target vector and its estimated vector.

principal curvatures of A correspond to the eigenvalues of $ Q_{A} $. We prove
that the approximate differential of order 2, introduced in a previous work of

local projections, which is based on concepts of Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
(Breunig et al., 2000) and RobPCA (Hubert et al., 2005). By using aspects of
both methods, our algorithm is robust towards noise variables and is capable of
performing outlier detection in multi-group situations. We are further not
reliant on a specific underlying data distribution.
  For each observation of a dataset, we identify a local group of dense nearby
observations, which we call a core, based on a modification of the k-nearest
neighbours algorithm. By projecting the dataset onto the space spanned by those
observations, two aspects are revealed. First, we can analyze the distance from
an observation to the center of the core within the projection space in order
to provide a measure of quality of description of the observation by the
projection. Second, we consider the distance of the observation to the
projection space in order to assess the suitability of the core for describing
the outlyingness of the observation. These novel interpretations lead to a
univariate measure of outlyingness based on aggregations over all local
projections, which outperforms LOF and RobPCA as well as other popular methods
like PCOut (Filzmoser et al., 2008) and subspace-based outlier detection
(Kriegel et al., 2009) in our simulation setups. Experiments in the context of
real-word applications employing datasets of various dimensionality demonstrate
the advantages of local projections.

material was associated with an X1.8-class flare from AR11283, occurring at
22:30 UT on 2011 September 7. Subsequently, a semi-continuous stream of this
material returned to the solar surface with a velocity v > 150 km/s, impacting
a region remote from the original active region between 00:20 - 00:40 UT on
2011 September 8. Using SDO/AIA, the differential emission measure of the
plasma was estimated throughout this brightening event. We found that the
radiated energy of the impacted plasma was L_rad ~10^27 ergs, while the thermal
energy peaked at ~10^28 ergs. From this we were able to determine the mass
content of the debris to be in the range 2x10^14 < m < 2x10^15 g. Given typical
promimence masses, the likely debris mass is towards the lower end of this

temperature is studied using molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond
times. Based on the analysis of both structure and energy of the system, it is
found that fullerene formation occurs in two stages. Firstly, fast
transformation of the initial amorphous structure into a hollow sp$^2$ shell
with a few chains attached occurs with a considerable decrease of the potential
energy and the number of atoms belonging to chains and to the amorphous domain.
Then, insertion of remaining carbon chains into the sp$^2$ network takes place
at the same time with the fullerene shell formation. Two types of defects
remaining after the formation of the fullerene shell are revealed: 7-membered
rings and single one-coordinated atoms. One of the fullerene structures
obtained contains no defects at all, which demonstrates that defect-free carbon
cages can be occasionally formed from amorphous precursors directly without
defect healing. No structural changes are observed after the fullerene
formation, suggesting that defect healing is a slow process in comparison with
the fullerene shell formation. The schemes of the revealed reactions of chain
atoms insertion into the fullerene shell just before its completion are
presented. The results of the performed simulations are summarized within the
paradigm of fullerene formation due to selforganization of the carbon system.

computation of the clearing vector. However, in practice central bankers and
regulators must often estimate this matrix because complete information on
bilateral liabilities is rarely available. As a result, the clearing vector may
suffer from estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. We quantify the
clearing vector's sensitivity to such estimation errors and show that its
directional derivatives are, like the clearing vector itself, solutions of
fixed point equations. We describe estimation errors utilizing a basis for the
space of matrices representing permissible perturbations and derive analytical
solutions to the maximal deviations of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector. This
allows us to compute upper bounds for the worst case perturbations of the
clearing vector in our simple setting. Moreover, we quantify the probability of
observing clearing vector deviations of a certain magnitude, for uniformly or
normally distributed errors in the relative liability matrix.
  Applying our methodology to a dataset of European banks, we find that
perturbations to the relative liabilities can result in economically sizeable
differences that could lead to an underestimation of the risk of contagion. Our
results are a first step towards allowing regulators to quantify errors in

various scales, for example the motile behaviour of bacteria or the transport
of mRNA, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of key
transport mechanisms. Often these imaging studies require us to compare
biological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively
characterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative
description of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to
relate these mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to
estimate the parameters of the models. In this work, we study the impact of
collecting data at different temporal resolutions on parameter inference for
biological transport models by performing exact inference for simple velocity
jump process models in a Bayesian framework. This issue is prominent in a host
of studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on
the frequency with which images can be collected, and the discrete nature of
observations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we
avoid such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a
hidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the
reorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple
velocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to
temporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise.
We use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers
aiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity
jump process. In particular, we consider how experimental constraints resulting
in a trade-off between temporal sampling resolution and observation noise may
affect parameter estimates.

However, with the increase of complexity of the given problem, the size of FE

improve the efficiency of X-FEM, an efficient computational method termed
decomposed updating reanalysis (DUR) method is suggested. For most of X-FEM
simulation procedures, the change of each iterative step is small and it will
only lead a local change of stiffness matrix. Therefore, the DUR method is
proposed to predict the modified response by only calculating the changed part
of equilibrium equations. Compared with other fast computational methods, the
distinctive characteristic of the proposed method is to update the modified
stiffness matrix with a local updating strategy, which only the changed part of
stiffness matrix needs to be updated. To verify the performance of the DUR

object with penetrating X-rays. However, traditional reconstruction methods
such as FDK require dense angular sampling in the data acquisition phase
leading to long measurement times, especially in X-ray micro-tomography to
obtain high resolution scans. Acquiring less data using greater angular steps
is an obvious way for speeding up the process and avoiding the need to save
huge data sets available memory. However, computing 3D reconstruction from such
a sparsely sampled dataset is very sensitive to measurement noise and modelling
errors. An automatic regularization method is proposed for robust
reconstruction, based on enforcing sparsity in the three-dimensional shearlet
transform domain. The inputs of the algorithm are the projection data and {\it
a priori} known expected degree of sparsity, denoted $0<{\mathcal C}_{pr}\leq
1$. The number ${\mathcal C}_{pr}$ can be calibrated from a few dense-angle
reconstructions and fixed. Human subchondral bone samples were tested and
morphometric parameters of the bone reconstructions were then analyzed using
standard metrics. The proposed method is shown to outperform the baseline
algorithm (FDK) in the case of sparsely collected data. The number of X-ray
projections can be reduced up to 10\% of the total amount while retaining the
quality of the reconstruction images and of the morphometric paramaters.

  arXiv:1708.00657",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Assigning homogeneous boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the
thermoviscous wave equations (TWE) derived by transforming the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) to the frequency domain yields a so-called
Helmholtz solver, whose output is a discrete set of complex eigenfunction and
eigenvalue pairs. The proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) --
reverses such procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or
more unknown impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain via spatial
integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned
conditions on other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order
spatial discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with
staggered grid arrangement. The momentum equation only is extended to the
center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located
and treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the
assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs,
corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB. The
iHS procedure is carried out independently for each frequency in order to
return the complete broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any
desired frequency range. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott's
theory for both inviscid and viscous, rectangular and circular ducts. The
impedance of a geometrically complex toy cavity is then reconstructed and
verified against companion full compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes
simulations resolving the cavity geometry and one-dimensional impedance test
tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC).
The iHS methodology is also shown to capture thermoacoustic effects, with
reconstructed impedance values quantitatively in agreement with thermoacoustic
growth rates.

for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view

similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph

a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a
latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an
optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the
representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to
indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature
representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize
the cluster structures. Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the
followings: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal
representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible
cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the
problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered
representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The
learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy
the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can
be readily achieved. The experiments over multi-view datasets validate its

instead they will satisfy a natural Carleson condition that has appeared first
in the scalar case. A significant example of a system to which our result may
be applied is the Lam\'e system for isotropic inhomogeneous materials. We show
that our result applies to isotropic materials with Poisson ratio $\nu<0.396$.
Dealing with genuine systems gives rise to substantial new challenges, absent
in the scalar case. Among other things, there is no maximum principle for
general elliptic systems, and the De Giorgi - Nash - Moser theory may also not

correspondence between right-$\mathcal{A}$-linear maps and the regular
representation of real matrices in detail. The requirement that the Jacobian
matrix of a function fall in the regular representation of $\mathcal{A}$ gives
$n^2-n$ generalized $\mathcal{A}$-CR equations. In contrast, some authors use a
deleted-difference quotient to describe differentiability over an algebra. We
compare these concepts of differentiability over an algebra and prove they are
equivalent in the semisimple commutative case. We also show how difference
quotients are ill-equipt to study calculus over a nilpotent algebra. The
Wirtinger calculus is shown to generalize. We find the $\mathcal{A}$-CReqns are
equivalent to the condition that the partial derivatives in all $n-1$ conjugate
variables vanish. Our construction modifies that given by Alvarez-Parrilla,
Fr\'ias-Armenta, L\'opez-Gonz\'alez and Yee-Romero in a 2012 paper. We also
discuss how this conjugate technology gives us a method to convert real PDEs
into differential equations over $\mathcal{A}$. Following Wagner, we show how
Generalized Laplace equations are naturally seen from the multiplication table
of an algebra. Taylor's Theorem and a Tableau for $\mathcal{A}$-differentiable
function are derived. We prove many of the usual theorems of integral calculus

Theorems of Calculus part I and II. Certainly we do not claim originality in

the existing literature.

submultiplicativity of the norm on $\mathcal{A}$. In contrast, the theorems
concerning divergence of power series over $\mathcal{A}$ are modified notably
from the standard theory. We study how the ratio, root and geometric series

calculational novelty of zero-divisors. Despite these difficulties, we find
natural generalizations of the usual theorems of real analysis for uniformly

However, as a true elastic wave cloak would generally require nonphysical

asymmetric stress), the utility of such an elastic wave cloak has thus far been

development of a symmetrized elastic cloak, sacrificing some of the performance
of the perfect cloak for the sake of restoring the minor symmetry. We test the
performance of the symmetrized elastic cloak for shielding a tunnel against
seismic waves, showing that it can be used to reduce the average displacement
within the tunnel by an order of magnitude (and reduce energy by two orders of
magnitude) for waves above a critical frequency of the cloak. This critical
frequency, which corresponds to the generation of surface waves at the
cloak-interior interface, can be used to develop a simple heuristic model of

independent nations in 1960--2015, performing in 275 genres. Some of the groups
became legends and survived for decades, while others vanished and are known
now only to select music history scholars. We built a network of the groups
based on sharing at least one performer. We discovered that major network
measures serve as reasonably accurate predictors of the groups' success. The
proposed network-based success exploration and prediction methods are
transferable to other areas of arts and humanities that have medium- or
long-term team-based collaborations.

decided edges and through time. The agents arriving on an edge are first lined
up in a \emph{first-in-first-out} queue and may wait: an edge is associated
with a capacity, which defines how many agents-per-time-step can pop from the
queue's head and enter the edge, to transit for a fixed delay. We show that the
best-response optimization problem is not approximable, and that deciding the
existence of a Nash equilibrium is complete for the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy. Then, we drop the rationality assumption, introduce a
behavioral concept based on GPS navigation, and study its worst-case efficiency
ratio to coordination.
