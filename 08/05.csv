  Geiger, Carsten Rother","Augmented Reality Meets Computer Vision : Efficient Data Generation for
  Urban Driving Scenes",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of deep learning in computer vision is based on availability of
large annotated datasets. To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually
rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Creating realistic 3D
content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In
this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic
data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models.
Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for
this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the
target category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap,
and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating
complex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to
augment real images with virtual objects. This allows us to create realistic
composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance and a large
number of complex object arrangements. In contrast to modeling complete 3D
environments, our augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions
in combination with 3D shapes of the target object. Through extensive
experimentation, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented
data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation
models. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our approach on training
standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of
cars in outdoor driving scenes. We test the models trained on our augmented
data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate
ground truth, and on Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that
models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on
synthetic data or models trained on limited amount of annotated real data.

ability of crossover to recombine individuals into higher quality solutions is

faster than their mutation-only counterparts. We devise a Markov Chain
framework that allows to rigorously prove an upper bound on the runtime of
standard steady state genetic algorithms to hillclimb the OneMax function. The
bound establishes that the steady-state genetic algorithms are 25% faster than
all standard bit mutation-only evolutionary algorithms with static mutation
rate up to lower order terms for moderate population sizes. The analysis also
suggests that larger populations may be faster than populations of size 2. We
present a lower bound for a greedy (2+1) GA that matches the upper bound for
populations larger than 2, rigorously proving that 2 individuals cannot
outperform larger population sizes under greedy selection and greedy crossover
up to lower order terms. In complementary experiments the best population size
is greater than 2 and the greedy genetic algorithms are faster than standard

by softening of the vibrational force constant by electrostatic and van der

through a nonergodic dynamical transition when the relaxation time of the
force-force correlation function enters, with increasing temperature, the
instrumental observation window. Two crossover temperatures are identified. The
lower crossover, presently connected to the glass transition, is related to the
dynamical unfreezing of rotations of water molecules within nanodomains

temperature, usually assigned to the dynamical transition, marks the onset of
water translations. All crossovers are ergodicity breaking transitions

represent an intriguing period of stellar evolution, i.e. when the convective
envelope interacts with the fast-rotating core. During these mixing episodes
freshly synthesized lithium can come up to the stellar surface along with high
angular momentum material. This high angular momentum may alter the surface
rotation pattern.
  Aims: The single rapidly rotating K-giant V1192 Ori is revisited to determine
its surface differential rotation, lithium abundance, and basic stellar
properties such as a precise rotation period. The aim is to independently
verify the antisolar differential rotation of the star and possibly find a
connection to the surface lithium abundance.
  Methods: We applied time-series Doppler imaging to a new multi-epoch data
set. Altogether we reconstructed 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data
collected with the STELLA robotic telescope between 2007--2016. We used our
inversion code iMap to reconstruct all stellar surface maps. We extracted the
differential rotation from these images by tracing systematic spot migration as
a function of stellar latitude from consecutive image cross-correlations.
  Results: The position of V1192 Ori in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
suggests that the star is in the helium core-burning phase just leaving the RGB
bump. We measure $A({\rm Li})_{\rm NLTE}=1.27$, i.e. a value close to the
anticipated transition value of 1.5 from Li-normal to Li-rich giants. Doppler
images reveal extended dark areas arranged quasi-evenly along an equatorial
belt. No cool polar spot is found during the investigated epoch. Spot
displacements clearly suggest antisolar surface differential rotation with
$\alpha=-0.11\pm0.02$ shear coefficient.
  Conclusions: The surface Li enrichment and the peculiar surface rotation
pattern may indicate a common origin.

Deep learning is an effective method to extract image features. To take
advantage of the deep-learning method in detecting urban land-use patterns, we
applied a transfer-learning-based remote-sensing image approach to extract and
classify features. Using the Google Tensorflow framework, a powerful
convolution neural network (CNN) library was created. First, the transferred
model was previously trained on ImageNet, one of the largest object-image data
sets, to fully develop the model's ability to generate feature vectors of
standard remote-sensing land-cover data sets (UC Merced and WHU-SIRI). Then, a
random-forest-based classifier was constructed and trained on these generated
vectors to classify the actual urban land-use pattern on the scale of traffic
analysis zones (TAZs). To avoid the multi-scale effect of remote-sensing
imagery, a large random patch (LRP) method was used. The proposed method could
efficiently obtain acceptable accuracy (OA = 0.794, Kappa = 0.737) for the
study area. In addition, the results show that the proposed method can
effectively overcome the multi-scale effect that occurs in urban land-use
classification at the irregular land-parcel level. The proposed method can help
planners monitor dynamic urban land use and evaluate the impact of
urban-planning schemes.

  Vanishing Over Families of L-functions","77 pages, including code, 6 figures",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Riemann Zeta-Function is the most studied L-function; it's zeroes give
information about the prime numbers. We can associate L-functions to a wide
array of objects, and in general, the zeroes of these L-functions give
information about those objects. For arbitrary L-functions, the order of
vanishing at the central point is of particular important. For example, the
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture states that the order of vanishing at the
central point of an elliptic curve L-function is the rank of the Mordell-Weil
group of that elliptic curve.
  The Katz-Sarnak Density Conjecture states that this order vanishing and other
behavior are well-modeled by random matrices drawn from the classical compact
groups. In particular, the conjecture states that an average order vanishing
over a family of L-functions can be bounded using only a given weight function
and a chosen test function, phi. The conjecture is known for many families when
the test functions are suitably restricted.
  It is natural to ask which test function is best for each family and for each
set of natural restrictions on phi. Our main result is a reduction of an
otherwise infinite dimensional optimization to a finite-dimensional
optimization problem for all families and all sets of restrictions. We
explicitly solve many of these optimization problems and compute the improved
bound we obtain on average rank. While we do not verify the density conjecture
for these new, looser restrictions, with this project, we are able to precisely
quantify the benefits of such efforts with respect to average rank. Finally, we
are able to show that this bound strictly improves as we increase support.

penetrate into the region dominated by the stellar wind, where they are ionized
by photo-ionization and charge exchange, and then mixed with the stellar wind
flow. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, we show that an induced
magnetic field forms in front of the planetary obstacle, which appears to be
much stronger compared to those produced by the solar wind interaction with
Venus and Mars. Depending on the stellar wind parameters, because of the
induced magnetic field, the planetary obstacle can move up to ~0.5-1 planetary
radii closer to the planet. Finally, we discuss how estimations of the

for the charge separation phenomenon predicted by the chiral magnetic effect

are extracted as functions of the pseudorapidity difference, the transverse

suggest that the charge-dependent three-particle correlators with respect to

arising from charge-dependent two-particle azimuthal correlations coupled with
an anisotropic flow. The CME is expected to lead to a $v_2$-independent

in $\approx18\%$ of the filament, and presumably due to remaining projection
effects. We also find wide-spread evidence for intermediate-line emission of a
broad-neutral precursor, with median $W_\rm{IL}=(180\pm14)$ km/s ($95\%$

fundamental question: is the problem of inferring a probabilistic model from a

surprisingly positive and general results. First, for a broad class of
probability distributions characterised by computability restrictions, we
specify a learning algorithm that will almost surely identify a probability
distribution in the limit given a finite i.i.d. sample of sufficient but
unknown length. This is similarly shown to hold for sequences generated by a
broad class of Markov chains, subject to computability assumptions. The
technical tool is the strong law of large numbers. Second, for a large class of
dependent sequences, we specify an algorithm which identifies in the limit a
computable measure for which the sequence is typical, in the sense of
Martin-Lof (there may be more than one such measure). The technical tool is the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We analyse the associated predictions in both
cases. We also briefly consider special cases, including language learning, and
wider theoretical implications for psychology.

explicitly in terms of basic turbulence parameters in a simple form, derived
from pure fluid physics, and that potential exists for applications of this

but have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface
features. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and
wavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:
To observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly
resolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing
and rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to
synthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,
successive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy
between various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments
temporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of
any main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very
precise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified
through simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal
stars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some
0.5%, requiring S/N ratios of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral
reconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is
achievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar
parameters. CONCLUSIONS: For bright host stars of large transiting planets,
spatially resolved spectroscopy is currently practical. More observable targets
are likely to be found in the near future by ongoing photometric searches.

atmospheric erosion by high-energy stellar photons. We investigate an
alternative mechanism: the luminosity of the cooling rocky core, which can
completely erode light envelopes while preserving heavy ones, produces a

self-consistently for envelope accretion, cooling and mass loss, and
demonstrate that core-powered mass loss naturally reproduces the observed

photoevaporation, which is powered by the high-energy tail of the stellar

The properties of these discs may be different from those of late-phase (T
Tauri) discs due to continuing infall from the envelope and protostellar
variability resulting from irregular gas accretion. We use a set of
hydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in
collapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host
protostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without
radiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic
feedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface
density and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas
from the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of
spiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative
feedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is
episodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity
(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar
system mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by
up to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the
gas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the
protostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of
the protostar alone. The enhanced radial pressure gradient expected in young
discs may lead to an increased rate of dust depletion due to gas drag, and
therefore to a reduced dust-to-gas ratio.

magnitudes of SLSNe-I in rest-frame $g$ band span $-22\lesssim M_g

unless strong asymmetries are at play. The rise timescales are longer for SLSNe
than for normal SNe Ib/c, by roughly 10 days, for events with similar decay
times. Thus, SLSNe-I can be considered as a separate population based on
photometric properties. After peak, SLSNe-I decay with a wide range of slopes,
with no obvious gap between rapidly declining and slowly declining events. The
latter events show more irregularities (bumps) in the light curves at all
times. At late times, the SLSN-I light curves slow down and cluster around the
$^{56}$Co radioactive decay rate. Powering the late-time light curves with
radioactive decay would require between 1 and 10${\rm M}_\odot$ of Ni masses.
Alternatively, a simple magnetar model can reasonably fit the majority of
SLSNe-I light curves, with four exceptions, and can mimic the radioactive decay
of $^{56}$Co, up to $\sim400$ days from explosion. The resulting spin values do
not correlate with the host-galaxy metallicities. Finally, the analysis of our
sample cannot strengthen the case for using SLSNe-I for cosmology.

about 70 solar masses, with lower limits of tens of solar masses, confirming
that Kes 73 is in an advanced evolutionary stage. Our spectral analysis shows
no evidence for enhanced abundances as would be expected from a massive
progenitor. Our derived total energy is $1.9 \times 10^{51}$ erg, giving a very
conservative lower limit to the magnetar's initial period of about 3 ms, unless
its energy was lost by non-electromagnetic means. We see no evidence of a
wind-blown bubble as would be produced by a massive progenitor, or any evidence
that the progenitor of Kes 73/1E 1841-045 was anything but a normal red
supergiant producing a Type IIP supernova, though a short-lived
stripped-envelope progenitor cannot be absolutely excluded. Kes 73's magnetar
thus joins SGR 1900+14 as magnetars resulting from relatively low-mass
progenitors.

neutron stars born in the clusters. We then estimate the number of Millisecond
Pulsars (MSPs) that are released in the Nuclear Star Cluster, during its

population of MSPs distributed over a radius of about 20 pc, with a peak near 3
pc. No clustering is found on the sub-parsec scale. We simulate the
detectability of this population with future radio telescopes like the MeerKAT
radio telescope and SKA1, and find that about of order ten MSPs can be observed
over this large volume, with a paucity of MSPs within the central parsec. This
helps discriminating this scenario from the in-situ formation model for the
Nuclear Star Cluster that would predict an over abundance of MSPs closer to the
black hole. We then discuss the potential contribution of our MSP population to
the gamma-ray excess at the Galactic Centre.

interaction. Creating believable movements for CAs is challenging, since the
movements have to be meaningful and natural, reflecting the coupling between
gestures and speech. Studies in the past have mainly relied on rule-based or
data-driven approaches. Rule-based methods focus on creating meaningful
behaviors conveying the underlying message, but the gestures cannot be easily
synchronized with speech. Data-driven approaches, especially speech-driven
models, can capture the relationship between speech and gestures. However, they
create behaviors disregarding the meaning of the message. This study proposes
to bridge the gap between these two approaches overcoming their limitations.
The approach builds a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), where a discrete variable
is added to constrain the behaviors on the underlying constraint. The study
implements and evaluates the approach with two constraints: discourse functions
and prototypical behaviors. By constraining on the discourse functions (e.g.,
questions), the model learns the characteristic behaviors associated with a
given discourse class learning the rules from the data. By constraining on
prototypical behaviors (e.g., head nods), the approach can be embedded in a
rule-based system as a behavior realizer creating trajectories that are timely
synchronized with speech. The study proposes a DBN structure and a training
approach that (1) models the cause-effect relationship between the constraint
and the gestures, (2) initializes the state configuration models increasing the
range of the generated behaviors, and (3) captures the differences in the
behaviors across constraints by enforcing sparse transitions between shared and
exclusive states per constraint. Objective and subjective evaluations
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over an unconstrained model.

detectors ignore these artifacts during training and generate data that gives
competitive performance on real data. Our method outperforms existing synthesis

features, such as version control, branching, and conflict detection. Despite
the presence of these features, support to parallel software development is

might be introduced by developers when concurrently working on multiple
parallel branches. In fact, SCM systems can detect textual conflicts, which are
generated by the concurrent modification of the same program locations, but
they are unable to detect higher-order conflicts, which are generated by the
concurrent modification of different program locations that generate program
misbehaviors once merged. Higher-order conflicts are painful to detect and
expensive to fix because they might be originated by the interference of
apparently unrelated changes. In this paper we present Behavioral Driven
Conflict Identification (BDCI), a novel approach to conflict detection. BDCI
moves the analysis of conflicts from the source code level to the level of
program behavior by generating and comparing behavioral models. The analysis
based on behavioral models can reveal interfering changes as soon as they are

conflict. To evaluate the effectiveness and the cost of the proposed approach,
we developed BDCIf , a specific instance of BDCI dedicated to the detection of

evidence collected by analyzing multiple versions of Git and Redis suggests
that BDCIf can effectively detect higher-order conflicts and report how changes

determined by how well material defect structures can immobilize vortex lines.
In order to gain deeper insights into the fundamental pinning mechanisms, we
have explored the case of vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical
inclusions using large-scale simulations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
equations. We find that for a small density of particles having diameters of
two coherence lengths, the vortex lattice preserves its structure and the
critical current $j_c$ decays with the magnetic field following a power-law
$B^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 0.66$, which is consistent with predictions
of strong-pinning theory. For a higher density of particles and/or larger
inclusions, the lattice becomes progressively more disordered and the exponent
smoothly decreases down to $\alpha \approx 0.3$. At high magnetic fields, all
inclusions capture a vortex and the critical current decays faster than
$B^{-1}$ as would be expected by theory. In the case of larger inclusions with
a diameter of four coherence length, the magnetic-field dependence of the
critical current is strongly affected by the ability of inclusions to capture
multiple vortex lines. We found that at small densities, the fraction of
inclusions trapping two vortex lines rapidly grows within narrow field range
leading to a peak in $j_c(B)$-dependence within this range. With increasing
inclusion density, this peak transforms into a plateau, which then smooths out.
Using the insights gained from simulations, we determine the limits of
applicability of strong-pinning theory and provide different routes to describe
vortex pinning beyond those bounds.

per-request advice model of online algorithms. He showed that given
$O(1/\epsilon)$ advice bits for each input item allows approximating the dual
bin packing problem online to within a factor of $1+\epsilon$. Renault asked
about the advice complexity of dual bin packing in the tape-advice model of
online algorithms. We make progress on this question. Let $s$ be the maximum
bit size of an input item weight. We present a conceptually simple online
algorithm that with total advice $O\left(\frac{s + \log n}{\epsilon^2}\right)$
approximates the dual bin packing to within a $1+\epsilon$ factor. To this end,
we describe and analyze a simple offline PTAS for the dual bin packing problem.
Although a PTAS for a more general problem was known prior to our work
(Kellerer 1999, Chekuri and Khanna 2006), our PTAS is arguably simpler to state
and analyze. As a result, we could easily adapt our PTAS to obtain the
advice-complexity result.
  We also consider whether the dependence on $s$ is necessary in our algorithm.
We show that if $s$ is unrestricted then for small enough $\epsilon > 0$
obtaining a $1+\epsilon$ approximation to the dual bin packing requires
$\Omega_\epsilon(n)$ bits of advice. To establish this lower bound we analyze
an online reduction that preserves the advice complexity and approximation
ratio from the binary separation problem due to Boyar et al. (2016). We define
two natural advice complexity classes that capture the distinction similar to
the Turing machine world distinction between pseudo polynomial time algorithms
and polynomial time algorithms. Our results on the dual bin packing problem
imply the separation of the two classes in the advice complexity world.

occasionally involves twinning. In particular, twinning is important in
hexagonal close packed materials where the easy slip systems are insufficient
to accommodate arbitrary deformations. While deformation by slip mechanisms is
reasonably well understood, less remains known about deformation by twinning.
Indeed, the identification of relevant twinning modes remains an art. In this
paper, we develop an universal framework combining fundamental kinematic
definition of twins with large scale atomistic calculations to predict twinning
modes of crystalline materials. We apply this framework to magnesium where
there are two accepted twin modes -- tension and compression, but a number of
anomalous observations. Surprisingly, our framework shows that there are a very
large number of twinning modes that are important in the deformation process of
magnesium consistent with the anomalous observations. Thus, in contrast to the
traditional view where plastic deformation is kinematically partitioned between
a few modes, our result argues that the physics of deformation in HCP materials
is governed by an energetic and kinetic competition between numerous
possibilities. Consequently, our findings suggest that the commonly used models
of deformation physics need to be revisited in order to take into account a
broader and richer variety of twin modes, and potentially points to new avenues
of improving the mechanical properties.

ubiquitous. A fundamental question for these systems is whether the cache space
should be pooled together or divided to serve multiple flows of data item
requests in order to minimize the miss probabilities. In this paper, we show
that there is no straight yes or no answer to this question, depending on
complex combinations of critical factors, including, e.g., request rates,
overlapped data items across different request flows, data item popularities
and their sizes. Specifically, we characterize the asymptotic miss
probabilities for multiple competing request flows under resource pooling and
separation for LRU caching when the cache size is large.
  Analytically, we show that it is asymptotically optimal to jointly serve
multiple flows if their data item sizes and popularity distributions are
similar and their arrival rates do not differ significantly; the
self-organizing property of LRU caching automatically optimizes the resource
allocation among them asymptotically. Otherwise, separating these flows could
be better, e.g., when data sizes vary significantly. We also quantify critical
points beyond which resource pooling is better than separation for each of the
flows when the overlapped data items exceed certain levels. Technically, we
generalize existing results on the asymptotic miss probability of LRU caching
for a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions and extend them to multiple
competing flows with varying data item sizes, which also validates the Che
approximation under certain conditions. These results provide new insights on
improving the performance of caching systems.

applications in sociology, history, and linguistics, topic models are known to
suffer from severe conceptual and practical problems, e.g. a lack of
justification for the Bayesian priors, discrepancies with statistical
properties of real texts, and the inability to properly choose the number of
topics. Here we obtain a fresh view on the problem of identifying topical
structures by relating it to the problem of finding communities in complex
networks. This is achieved by representing text corpora as bipartite networks
of documents and words. By adapting existing community-detection methods --
using a stochastic block model (SBM) with non-parametric priors -- we obtain a
more versatile and principled framework for topic modeling (e.g., it
automatically detects the number of topics and hierarchically clusters both the
words and documents). The analysis of artificial and real corpora demonstrates
that our SBM approach leads to better topic models than LDA in terms of
statistical model selection. More importantly, our work shows how to formally
relate methods from community detection and topic modeling, opening the
possibility of cross-fertilization between these two fields.

package of its host class. Thanks to extension methods, developers can adapt to
their needs classes they do not own: adding methods to core classes is a
typical use case. This is particularly useful for adapting software and
therefore to increase reusability.
  Inquiry. In most dynamically-typed languages, extension methods are globally
visible. Because any developer can define extension methods for any class,
naming conflicts occur: if two developers define an extension method with the
same signature in the same class, only one extension method is visible and
overwrites the other. Similarly, if two developers each define an extension
method with the same name in a class hierarchy, one overrides the other. To
avoid such ""accidental overrides"", some dynamically-typed languages limit the
visibility of an extension method to a particular scope. However, their
semantics have not been fully described and compared. In addition, these
solutions typically rely on a dedicated and slow method lookup algorithm to
resolve conflicts at runtime.
  Approach. In this article, we present a formalization of the underlying
models of Ruby refinements, Groovy categories, Classboxes, and Method Shelters
that are scoping extension method solutions in dynamically-typed languages.
  Knowledge. Our formal framework allows us to objectively compare and analyze
the shortcomings of the studied solutions and other different approaches such
as MultiJava. In addition, language designers can use our formal framework to
determine which mechanism has less risk of ""accidental overrides"".
  Grounding. Our comparison and analysis of existing solutions is grounded
because it is based on denotational semantics formalizations.
  Importance. Extension methods are widely used in programming languages that
support them, especially dynamically-typed languages such as Pharo, Ruby or
Python. However, without a carefully designed mechanism, this feature can cause
insidious hidden bugs or can be voluntarily used to gain access to protected
operations, violate encapsulation or break fundamental invariants.

linguistic information found in source code, such as identifier names and
comments. Semantic clustering is one such technique for modularization of the
system that relies on the informal semantics of the program, encoded in the
vocabulary used in the source code. Treating the source code as a collection of
tokens loses the semantic information embedded within the identifiers. We try
to overcome this problem by introducing context models for source code
identifiers to obtain a semantic kernel, which can be used for both deriving
the topics that run through the system as well as their clustering. In the
first model, we abstract an identifier to its type representation and build on
this notion of context to construct contextual vector representation of the
source code. The second notion of context is defined based on the flow of data
between identifiers to represent a module as a dependency graph where the nodes
correspond to identifiers and the edges represent the data dependencies between
pairs of identifiers. We have applied our approach to 10 medium-sized open
source Java projects, and show that by introducing contexts for identifiers,
the quality of the modularization of the software systems is improved. Both of
the context models give results that are superior to the plain vector
representation of documents. In some cases, the authoritativeness of
decompositions is improved by 67%. Furthermore, a more detailed evaluation of
our approach on JEdit, an open source editor, demonstrates that inferred topics
through performing topic analysis on the contextual representations are more
meaningful compared to the plain representation of the documents. The proposed
approach in introducing a context model for source code identifiers paves the
way for building tools that support developers in program comprehension tasks
such as application and domain concept location, software modularization and
topic analysis.

satisfactory practice (the energy-loss functions formalism), we show that, for

taken into account for the reliable interpretation of the experiment. To this
end, we come up with a unified theory which, on the same footing, treats both

a phenomenon of a strong coupling between the $\pi+\sigma$ plasmon excitation

magnetic field: the spin-up and spin-down components move away from the Fermi
level and finally form a spin polarized band insulator. By calculating the
magnetization and spin susceptibility, we clarify that an applied magnetic
field drives a transition from a paramagnetic metallic phase to a band
insulting phase. In the weak interaction regime, the nature of the transition
is continuous and captured by the Stoner's description, while in the strong
interaction regime the transition is very likely to be metamagnetic, evidenced
by the hysteresis curve. Furthermore, we determine the phase boundary by
tracking the kink in the magnetic susceptibility, and the step-like change of
the entanglement entropy and the entanglement gap closing. Interestingly, the

programs: for that, we recast them as `abstract' HMM's, computations in the
Giry monad $\mathbb{D}$, and we equip them with a partial order of increasing
security. However to encode the monadic type with hiding over some state
$\mathcal{X}$ we use $\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{D}^2\mathcal{X}$ rather
than the conventional $\mathcal{X}{\to}\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}$ that suffices for
Markov models whose state is not hidden. We illustrate the
$\mathbb{D}\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{D}^2\mathcal{X}$ construction with a small
Haskell prototype.
  We then present uncertainty measures as a generalisation of the extant
diversity of probabilistic entropies, with characteristic analytic properties
for them, and show how the new entropies interact with the order of increasing
security. Furthermore, we give a `backwards' uncertainty-transformer semantics
for HMM's that is dual to the `forwards' abstract HMM's - it is an analogue of
the duality between forwards, relational semantics and backwards,
predicate-transformer semantics for imperative programs with demonic choice.
  Finally, we argue that, from this new denotational-semantic viewpoint, one

for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels
to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be
estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this
paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input
frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D
kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method
develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames
and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our
method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at
once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural
network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is

crystals to biological molecules to solids such as exotic magnets, cuprates and
iron-based high-$T_c$ superconductors. Nematic fluctuations are thought to be
closely linked to the formation of Cooper-pairs in iron-based superconductors.
It is unclear whether the anisotropy inherent in this nematicity arises from
electronic spin or orbital degrees of freedom. We have studied the iron-based
Mott insulators La$_{2}$O$_{2}$Fe$_{2}$O$M$$_{2}$ $M$ = (S, Se) which are
structurally similar to the iron pnictide superconductors. They are also in
close electronic phase diagram proximity to the iron pnictides. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed a critical slowing down of nematic
fluctuations as observed by the spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$). This is
complemented by the observation of a change of electrical field gradient over a
similar temperature range using M\""ossbauer spectroscopy. The neutron pair
distribution function technique applied to the nuclear structure reveals the
presence of local nematic $C_2$ fluctuations over a wide temperature range
while neutron diffraction indicates that global $C_{4}$ symmetry is preserved.
Theoretical modeling of a geometrically frustrated spin-$1$ Heisenberg model
with biquadratic and single-ion anisotropic terms provides the interpretation
of magnetic fluctuations in terms of hidden quadrupolar spin fluctuations.
Nematicity is closely linked to geometrically frustrated magnetism, which
emerges from orbital selectivity. The results highlight orbital order and spin
fluctuations in the emergence of nematicity in Fe-based oxychalcogenides. The
detection of nematic fluctuation within these Mott insulator expands the group
of iron-based materials that show short-range symmetry-breaking.

function into the cost function used in the optimization that originates the
algorithms to improve their performance by exploiting sparsity. However, the
strength of the penalty function is controlled by a scalar that is often a
fixed parameter. In contrast to prior work, we develop a framework to derive

and are widely used in real world applications. However, it was discovered that
machine learning models, including the best performing DNNs, suffer from a
fundamental problem: they can unexpectedly and confidently misclassify examples
formed by slightly perturbing otherwise correctly recognized inputs. Various
approaches have been developed for efficiently generating these so-called
adversarial examples, but those mostly rely on ascending the gradient of loss.
In this paper, we introduce the novel logits optimized targeting system (LOTS)
to directly manipulate deep features captured at the penultimate layer. Using
LOTS, we analyze and compare the adversarial robustness of DNNs using the
traditional Softmax layer with Openmax, which was designed to provide open set
recognition by defining classes derived from deep representations, and is
claimed to be more robust to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate that
Openmax provides less vulnerable systems than Softmax to traditional attacks,
however, we show that it can be equally susceptible to more sophisticated
adversarial generation techniques that directly work on deep representations.

clusters of galaxies can be detected by FAST at intermediate redshifts. Here we
propose to use FAST to study the evolution of the global HI content of clusters
and groups over cosmic time by measuring their integrated HI emissions. We use
the Virgo cluster as an example to estimate the detection limit of FAST, and
have estimated the integration time to detect a Virgo type cluster at different
redshifts (from z=0.1 to z=1.5). We have also employed a semi-analytic model
(SAM) to simulate the evolution of HI contents in galaxy clusters. Our
simulations suggest that the HI mass of a Virgo-like cluster could be 2-3 times
higher and the physical size could be more than 50\% smaller when redshift
increases from z=0.3 to z=1. Thus the integration time could be reduced
significantly and gas rich clusters at intermediate redshifts can be detected
by FAST in less than 2 hour of integration time. For the local universe, we
have also used SAM simulations to create mock catalogs of clusters to predict
the outcomes from FAST all sky surveys. Comparing with the optically selected
catalogs derived by cross matching the galaxy catalogs from the SDSS survey and
the ALFALFA survey, we find that the HI mass distribution of the mock catalog
with 20 second of integration time agrees well with that of observations.
However, the mock catalog with 120 second integration time predicts much more
groups and clusters that contains a population of low mass HI galaxies not
detected by the ALFALFA survey. Future deep HI blind sky survey with FAST would
be able to test such prediction and set constraints to the numerical simulation
models. Observational strategy and sample selections for the future FAST
observations of galaxy clusters at high redshifts are also discussed.

Such large offsets in low mass clusters can be a useful tool to select

supernova remnants and radio galaxies have angular sizes from a few to several
$10$s of arcminutes. In radio interferometric imaging of such sources, the
largest angular size of the source that can be imaged is limited by the
shortest projected baseline towards the source. It is essential to determine
the limitations of the recovery of the extended features on various angular
scales in order to interpret the radio image. We simulated observations of a
model extended source of Gaussian shape with the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) using Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). The
recovery in flux density and in morphology of the model source was quantified
in a variety of observing cases with changing source properties and the
uv-coverage. If $\theta_{lar}$ is the largest angular scale sampled in an
observation with the GMRT, then $>80\%$ recovery of a source of size
$0.3\times\theta_{lar}$ is possible. The upgraded GMRT (U-GMRT) providing 200
MHz instantaneous bandwidth between 300 - 500 MHz will allow a factor of two
better recovery of a source of size $\theta_{lar}$ as compared to the GMRT at
300 MHz with 33 MHz bandwidth. We provide quantitative estimates for the
improvement in extended source recovery in observations at low elevations and
long durations. The presented simulations can be carried out for future radio
telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for optimisation of
observing strategies to image extended radio sources.

switching high pulsed currents in the septum magnet power supply is described.
In this approach, an attempt is made to select the SCR from its I2t rating
given in data sheet. For this, a factor which we have called I2t derating
factor is defined as the ratio of I2t rating of SCR to the I2t value of current
pulse to be switched. Thus, the SCR to be used in power supply is selected from
its I2t derating factor. Three different experiments were performed using SCR
of different manufacturers, to estimate the value of I2t derating factors. In
these experiments, the SCR was subjected to maximum thermal stress till SCR
started showing degradation. The forward blocking voltage and the leakage
current are the parameters used for characterizing the SCR before and after the
stress. The results of these experiments are presented and discussed. This
approach will be of great help when pulse rating of SCR, like, transient
thermal impedance is not available. Finally, a method is presented which can
contribute to design low-cost and high-reliability septum magnet power supply.

Our algorithms are inspired by the modified truncated singular value
decomposition (MTSVD) method, which suits only for small to medium scale
problems, and randomized SVD (RSVD) algorithms that generate good low rank
approximations to $A$. We use rank-$k$ truncated randomized SVD (TRSVD)
approximations to $A$ by truncating the rank-$(k+q)$ RSVD approximations to
$A$, where $q$ is an oversampling parameter. The resulting algorithms are
called modified TRSVD (MTRSVD) methods. At every step, we use the LSQR
algorithm to solve the resulting inner least squares problem, which is proved
to become better conditioned as $k$ increases so that LSQR converges faster. We
present sharp bounds for the approximation accuracy of the RSVDs and TRSVDs for
severely, moderately and mildly ill-posed problems, and substantially improve a
known basic bound for TRSVD approximations. We prove how to choose the stopping
tolerance for LSQR in order to guarantee that the computed and exact best
regularized solutions have the same accuracy. Numerical experiments illustrate
that the best regularized solutions by MTRSVD are as accurate as the ones by
the truncated generalized singular value decomposition (TGSVD) algorithm, and
at least as accurate as those by some existing truncated randomized generalized
singular value decomposition (TRGSVD) algorithms.

challenging because the target objects are often surrounded by a large number

object proposal mining. However, the collected positive regions are either low
in precision or lack of diversity, and the strategy of collecting negative
regions is not carefully designed, neither. Moreover, training is often slow
because region selection and object detector training are processed separately.
In this context, the primary contribution of this work is to improve weakly
supervised detection with an optimized region selection strategy. The proposed
method collects purified positive training regions by progressively removing
easy background clutters, and selects discriminative negative regions by mining
class-specific hard samples. This region selection procedure is further
integrated into a CNN-based weakly supervised detection (WSD) framework, and
can be performed in each stochastic gradient descent mini-batch during
training. Therefore, the entire model can be trained end-to-end efficiently.
Extensive evaluation results on PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2010 and VOC 2012 datasets

multiplex networks that facilitate interaction and information-sharing among

channel, but then communication channel alteration (CCA) occurs. This means
that we must refine our understanding of the dynamics of social contagions. We
propose a non-Markovian behavior spreading model in multiplex networks that
takes into account the CCA mechanism, and we develop a generalized edge-based
compartmental method to describe the spreading dynamics. Through extensive
numerical simulations and theoretical analyses we find that the time delays
induced by CCA slow the behavior spreading but do not affect the final adoption
size. We also find that the CCA suppresses behavior spreading. On two coupled
random regular networks, the adoption size exhibits hybrid growth, i.e., it
grows first continuously and then discontinuously with the information
transmission probability. CCA in ER-SF multiplex networks in which two
subnetworks are Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) introduces a
crossover from continuous to hybrid growth in adoption size versus information

for understanding the physical processes these experiments are attempting to
investigate. In this paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can be used
to determine a range of relevant magnetic field statistics, including the
magnetic-energy spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the properties of an
analytic relation between a stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux
distribution created upon imaging that field. We conclude that features of the
beam's final image-flux distribution often display a universal character
determined by a single, field-scale dependent parameter - the contrast
parameter - which quantifies the relative size of the correlation length of the
stochastic field, proton displacements due to magnetic deflections, and the
image magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we establish the existence
of four contrast regimes - linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive -
under which proton-flux images relate to their parent fields in a qualitatively
distinct manner. As a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear or
nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated magnetic field experienced by
the beam can be extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy spectrum under a
further statistical assumption of isotropy. This is no longer the case in the
caustic or diffusive regimes. We also discuss complications to the
contrast-regime characterisation arising for inhomogeneous, multi-scale
stochastic fields, as well as limitations currently placed by experimental
capabilities on extracting magnetic field statistics. The results presented in
this paper provide a comprehensive description of proton images of stochastic
magnetic fields, with applications for improved analysis of given proton-flux
images.

Jeffreys divergence, Jensen-Bregman logdet divergence, etc.; however, their
behaviors may be application dependent, raising the need of manual selection to
achieve the best possible performance. Further and as a result of their
overwhelming complexity for large-scale problems, computing pairwise

use of the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we propose a discriminative
metric learning framework, Information Divergence and Dictionary Learning
(IDDL), that not only learns application specific measures on SPD matrices
automatically, but also embeds them as vectors using a learned dictionary. To
learn the similarity measures (which could potentially be distinct for every

which is known to unify the measures listed above. We propose a novel IDDL

Riemannian optimization. We showcase extensive experiments on eight computer

few elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,
limiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.
(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable
precision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here
we verify this claim in practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14
elements from LAMOST spectra with a precision of $\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for objects
with ${\rm S/N}_{\rm LAMOST}$ > 30 (per pixel). We employ a spectral modeling
method in which a data-driven model is combined with priors that the model
gradient spectra should resemble ab initio spectral models. This approach
assures that the data-driven abundance determinations draw on physically
sensible features in the spectrum in their predictions and do not just exploit
astrophysical correlations among abundances. Our analysis is constrained to the
number of elemental abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the
source of the training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a
subset of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels
and then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a sample
with more than 20 elemental abundances that is an order of magnitude larger
than current high-resolution surveys, substantially increasing the sample size

from 4 to 20 and Galois Field varying from GF(64) up to GF(1024). For all given
sets of coefficients, no codeword of Hamming weight two exists. A reduced
complexity algorithm to compute the binary Hamming weight 3 of a parity check

exhaustive search and evaluation, a local greedy search is performed. Explicit

Me and T ions on the structural and magnetic properties of the hexaferrites
were investigated. XRD patterns, magnetic parameters, and M\""ossbauer spectra
of the Co2Y were consistent with a single phase Y-type hexaferrite. However,
the CoCr-Y sample was found to be dominated by the Y-type hexaferrite, and
M-type and BaCrO4 minority phases were observed in the XRD pattern of the
sample. The small increase in saturation magnetization from about 34 emu/g up
to 37.5 emu/g was therefore attributed to the development of the M-type phase.
On the other hand, XRD pattern of the Cr2Y sample indicated the dominance of
the M-type phase in this sample. The high coercivity (1445 Oe) of this sample
is evidence of the transformation of the material from a typically soft
magnetic material (Y-type) to a hard magnet (M-type). The Ga-substitution for
Fe in Co2Y did not affect the saturation magnetization significantly, but the
coercivity was reduced. However, the sample Ba2CoMgFe11GaO22 exhibited a
significant reduction of the saturation magnetization down to a value 26.6
emu/g, which could be due to the attenuation of the super-exchange interactions
induced by the Mg2+ substitution.

object classification, this paper proposes a method that first summarizes the
knowledge hidden inside the CNN into a dictionary of latent activation

assembling latent patterns related to the target part via human interactions.
We use very few (e.g., three) annotations of a semantic object part to retrieve
certain latent patterns from conv-layers to represent the target part. We then
visualize these latent patterns and ask users to further remove incorrect
patterns, in order to refine part representation. With the guidance of human

dimensionless groups are not unique, and (ii) the analysis does not measure

estimating unique and relevant dimensionless groups assuming the experimenter
can control the system's independent variables and evaluate the corresponding
dependent variable; e.g., computer experiments provide such a setting. The
first algorithm is based on a response surface constructed from a set of
experiments. The second algorithm uses many experiments to estimate finite
differences over a range of the independent variables. Both algorithms are
semi-empirical because they use experimental data to complement the dimensional
analysis. We derive the algorithms by combining classical semi-empirical
modeling with active subspaces, which---given a probability density on the
independent variables---yield unique and relevant dimensionless groups. The
connection between active subspaces and dimensional analysis also reveals that
all empirical models are ridge functions, which are functions that are constant
along low-dimensional subspaces in its domain. We demonstrate the proposed
algorithms on the well-studied example of viscous pipe flow---both turbulent
and laminar cases. The results include a new set of two dimensionless groups
for turbulent pipe flow that are ordered by relevance to the system; the
precise notion of relevance is closely tied to the derivative based global

that storage cost is getting cheaper day by day, so people as well as almost

of the real data is multi-dimensional, non-uniform, and big in size, such that
it requires a unique pre-processing before analyzing it. In order to make data
useful for any kind of analysis, pre-processing is a very important step. This
paper presents a unique and novel pre-processing method for multi-dimensional
and non-uniform data with the aim of making it uniform and reduced in size
without losing much of its value. We have chosen biometric signature data to
demonstrate the proposed method as it qualifies for the attributes of being
multi-dimensional, non-uniform and big in size. Biometric signature data does
not only captures the structural characteristics of a signature but also its
behavioral characteristics that are captured using a dynamic signature capture
device. These features like pen pressure, pen tilt angle, time taken to sign a
document when collected in real-time turn out to be of varying dimensions. This
feature data set along with the structural data needs to be pre-processed in
order to use it to train a machine learning based model for signature
verification purposes. We demonstrate the success of the proposed method over
other methods using experimental results for biometric signature data but the

that the effects of solar activity on failure rate in the main Czech power grid
cannot be excluded even for central-european country. This is a preliminary
study.

  Question Answering",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the challenges in information retrieval is providing accurate answers
to a user's question often expressed as uncertainty words. Most answers are
based on a Syntactic approach rather than a Semantic analysis of the query. In
this paper, our objective is to present a hybrid approach for a Semantic
question answering retrieval system using Ontology Similarity and Fuzzy logic.
We use a Fuzzy Co-clustering algorithm to retrieve the collection of documents
based on Ontology Similarity. The Fuzzy Scale uses Fuzzy type-1 for documents
and Fuzzy type-2 for words to prioritize answers. The objective of this work is
to provide retrieval system with more accurate answers than non-fuzzy Semantic
Ontology approach.
