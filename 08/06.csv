questions of interactions, shaping and transformations of vortex states with
fractional topological charges in physics, in particular, in hydrodynamic and
quantum mechanic. Starting from the representation of the fractional-order
vortex states as a superposition of infinite number of integer-order vortices
with distinctive energy distributions (the vortex spectra) we showed that the
smooth wave front of the fractional vortex beam can either decay into an
asymmetric array of integer-order vortices or, vice versa, the array of optical
vortices can be gathered together forming a smooth wave front with a
helicoid-shaped phase distribution under propagation in free space. We revealed
that a simple superposition of a finite number of the fractional-order vortex
beams enables us to shape symmetric singular beams with the integer-order
vortices of the desired topological charges.

of on-line stochastic optimization problems through a simple, yet effective
mechanism. One simply casts the problem as a gambler that repeatedly pulls one
out of N slot machine arms, eliciting random rewards. Learning of reward
probabilities is then combined with reward maximization, by carefully balancing
reward exploration against reward exploitation. In this paper, we address a
particularly intriguing variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, referred to
as the {\it Stochastic Point Location (SPL) Problem}. The gambler is here only
told whether the optimal arm (point) lies to the ""left"" or to the ""right"" of
the arm pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability $1-\pi$.
This formulation thus captures optimization in continuous action spaces with
both {\it informative} and {\it deceptive} feedback. To tackle this class of
problems, we formulate a compact and scalable Bayesian representation of the
solution space that simultaneously captures both the location of the optimal
arm as well as the probability of receiving correct feedback. We further
introduce the accompanying Thompson Sampling guided Stochastic Point Location
(TS-SPL) scheme for balancing exploration against exploitation. By learning
$\pi$, TS-SPL also supports {\it deceptive} environments that are lying about
the direction of the optimal arm. This, in turn, allows us to solve the
fundamental Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) Problem. Empirical results
demonstrate that our scheme deals with both deceptive and informative
environments, significantly outperforming competing algorithms both for SRF and
SPL.

minimal framework for the study of the effective dynamics of much more complex
systems. However, how they emerge from microscopic individual-based models is
still poorly understood, partly due to complications near vertex singularities.
In this work, motivated by the study of the dynamics and the genealogies of
expanding populations in spatially structured environments, we obtain a new
class of SPDE on graphs of Wright-Fisher type which have nontrivial boundary
conditions on the vertex set. We show that these SPDE arise as scaling limits
of suitably defined biased voter models (BVM), which extends the scaling limits
of Durrett and Fan [Ann. Appl. Probab. 26 (2016) 456-490]. We further obtain a
convergent simulation scheme for each of these SPDE in terms of a system of
It\^o SDEs, which is useful when the size of the BVM is too large for
stochastic simulations. These give the first rigorous connection between SPDE
on graphs and more discrete models, specifically, interacting particle systems
and interacting SDEs. Uniform heat kernel estimates for symmetric random walks
approximating diffusions on graphs are the keys to our proofs.

with the task of identifying problem level objects along with the relationships
between them from software requirements. The software requirements are usually
written in some natural language, and the analysis modeling is normally
performed by experienced human analysts. The huge gap between the software
requirements which are unstructured texts and analysis models which are usually
structured UML diagrams, along with human slip-ups inevitably makes the
transformation process error prone. The automation of this process can help in
reducing the errors in the transformation. In this paper we propose a tool
supported approach for automated transformation of use case specifications
documented in English language into analysis class diagrams. The approach works
in four steps. It first takes the textual specification of a use case as input,
and then using a natural language parser generates type dependencies and parts
of speech tags for each sentence in the specification. Then, it identifies the
sentence structure of each sentence using a set of comprehensive sentence
structure rules. Next, it applies a set of transformation rules on the type
dependencies and parts of speech tags of the sentences to discover the problem
level objects and the relationships between them. Finally, it generates and
visualizes the analysis class diagram. We conducted a controlled experiment to
compare the correctness, completeness and redundancy of the analysis class
diagrams generated by our approach with those generated by the existing
automated approaches. The results showed that the analysis class diagrams
generated by our approach were more correct, more complete, and less redundant
than those generated by the other approaches.

Allocating and reclaiming descriptors introduces significant space and time

weak descriptor ADT which has weaker semantics, but can be implemented
significantly more efficiently. We show how a large class of lock-free

technique by transforming several algorithms, including the leading
k-compare-and-swap (k-CAS) algorithm. The original k-CAS algorithm allocates at
least k+1 new descriptors per k-CAS. In contrast, our implementation allocates
two descriptors per process, and each process simply reuses its two

improvements over implementations that reclaim descriptors, and reductions of

existing methods for i.i.d. problems with sophisticated statistical tests so as
to dynamically adapt to a change in distribution.
  We analyze various standard notions of regret suited to non-stationary
environments for these algorithms, including interval regret, switching regret,
and dynamic regret. When competing with the best policy at each time, one of
our algorithms achieves regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{ST})$ if there are $T$ rounds
with $S$ stationary periods, or more generally
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ where $\Delta$ is some non-stationarity

inefficient baseline that is a variant of the classic Exp4 algorithm. The
dynamic regret result is also the first one for efficient and fully adversarial

of previous experimental demonstrations of its essential components: magnetic
levitation of mm-scale and cm-scale drops of liquid He, evaporative cooling of
He droplets in vacuum, and coupling to high-quality optical whispering gallery
modes in a wide range of liquids. We find that the combination of these

level-set functions derived by Wac{\l}awczyk [J.Comp.Phys., 299, (2015)] and
the condition for the phase equilibrium provided by the stationary solution to
the modified Allen-Cahn equation [Acta Metall., 27, (1979)]. As a consequence,
the statistical model of the non-flat interface in the state of phase
equilibrium is postulated. This new physical model of the non-flat interface is
introduced based on the statistical picture of the sharp interface disturbed by
the field of stochastic forces, it yields the relation between the sharp and
diffusive interface models. Furthermore, the new techniques required for the
accurate solution of the model equations are proposed. First it is shown, the
constrained interpolation improves re-initialization of the level-set functions
as it avoids oscillatory numerical errors typical for the second-order accurate
interpolation schemes. Next, the new semi-analytical, second order accurate
Lagrangian scheme is put forward to integrate the advection equation in time
avoiding interface curvature oscillations introduced by the second-order
accurate flux limiters. These techniques provide means to obtain complete,
second-order convergence during advection and re-initialization of the
interface in the state of phase equilibrium.

strange attractor contained in the real and imaginary axes which is forward

over approximately 4000 yrs. Initially, four quasi-stable fragments are formed,
of which two are eventually disrupted by tidal torques in the disc. From the

some fragments it is plausible for grains to sediment to the core before
releasing their volatiles into the planetary envelope, leading to changes in,

fixed receptive field presents a challenge to generalize the features of

predetermined receptive fields are too small at a short distance, and vice
versa. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network which is able to
adapt the receptive field not only for each layer but also for each neuron at

depth-adaptive multiscale (DaM) convolution layer consisting of the adaptive

neuron is to adjust the receptive field at each spatial location using the
corresponding depth information. The in-layer multiscale neuron is to apply the
different size of the receptive field at each feature space to learn features
at multiple scales. The proposed DaM convolution is applied to two fully
convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
neural networks on the publicly available RGB-D dataset for semantic

measured the polarization properties of this pulsar we have applied the matrix
template matching approach in which the times of arrival are measured using
full polarimetric information. We achieved a weighted root-mean-square timing
residuals (rms) of the timing residuals of 1.23 $\rm \mu s$, 15.5$\%$
improvement compared to the total intensity timing analysis. After studying the
scintillation properties of this pulsar we put constraints on the inclination
angle of the system. Based on these measurements and on $\chi^2$ mapping we put
a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit on the companion mass (0.44 M$_\odot$). Since this
mass limit cannot reveal the nature of the companion we further investigate the
possibility of the companion to be a He WD. Applying the orbital period-mass
relation for such WDs, we conclude that the mass of a He WD companion would be
about 0.26$\pm$0.01 M$_\odot$ which, combined with the measured mass function
and orbital inclination limits, would lead to a light pulsar mass $\leqslant$
1.0 M$_\odot$. This result seems unlikely based on current neutron star
formation models and we therefore conclude that PSR J1933$-$6211 most likely

samples require a correction before they can be fit by chemical evolution
models. We derive simple correction factors for over- and under-represented
populations for the limiting cases of single-age populations with a broad range
of metallicities and of continuous star formation at constant metallicity; an
important general conclusion is that intermediate-age populations (~1-4Gyr) are
over-represented in RGB samples. We apply our models to the case of the Large
Magellanic Cloud bar and show that the observed metallicity distribution
underestimates the true number of metal-poor stars by more than 25%; as a
result, the inferred importance of gas flows in chemical evolution models could
potentially be overestimated. The age- and metallicity-dependences of RGB
lifetimes require careful modelling if they are not to lead to spurious
conclusions about the chemical enrichment history of galaxies.

the physics of organismal propulsion in different fluid environments. Here we
extend this work to a study of flexible foils in a frictional environment. When
the foil is oscillated by heaving at one end but not allowed to locomote
freely, the dynamics change from periodic to non-periodic and chaotic as the
heaving amplitude is increased or the bending rigidity is decreased. For
friction coefficients lying in a certain range, the transition passes through a
sequence of $N$-periodic and asymmetric states before reaching chaotic
dynamics. Resonant peaks are damped and shifted by friction and large heaving
amplitudes, leading to bistable states.
  When the foil is allowed to locomote freely, the horizontal motion smoothes
the resonant behaviors. For moderate frictional coefficients, steady but slow
locomotion is obtained. For large transverse friction and small tangential
friction corresponding to wheeled snake robots, faster locomotion is obtained.
Traveling wave motions arise spontaneously, and and move with horizontal speed
that scales as transverse friction to the 1/4 power and input power that scales
as transverse friction to the 5/12 power. These scalings are consistent with a
boundary layer form of the solutions near the foil's leading edge.

low-frequency (< 500 Hz) oscillation modes in the NS, transferring energy
between the orbit and the NS. This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the
gravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS
interior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal
excitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure
inertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in
an approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational
effects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We
develop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies
and tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase
shift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary
inspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We
derive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on
various properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =
1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the
gravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01
radian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a
radian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant
phase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and
rotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)
modified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected
by stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a
small but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,
in fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited.

we describe novel neural network architectures for suggesting complementary

existing techniques, our networks are trained on unlabeled data obtained from
public online repositories, and do not rely on consistent part segmentations or

networks, where the first indexes parts by mapping them to a low-dimensional
feature space, and the second maps partial assemblies to appropriate
complements. The combinatorial nature of part arrangements poses another
challenge, since the retrieval network is not a function: several complements
can be appropriate for the same input. Thus, instead of predicting a single
output, we train our network to predict a probability distribution over the
space of part embeddings. This allows our method to deal with ambiguities and
naturally enables a UI that seamlessly integrates user preferences into the
design process. We demonstrate that our method can be used to design complex

the dark universe. Both cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy (DE) phenomena
are described by a single component, the mimetic field. In linear theory, we
show that this component effectively behaves like a perfect fluid with zero
sound speed and clusters on all scales. For the simpler mimetic cubic Horndeski
model, if the background expansion history is chosen to be identical to a
perfect fluid DE (PFDE) then the mimetic model predicts the same power spectrum
of the Newtonian potential as the PFDE model with zero sound speed. In
particular, if the background is chosen to be the same as that of LCDM, then
also in this case the power spectrum of the Newtonian potential in the mimetic
model becomes indistinguishable from the power spectrum in LCDM on linear
scales. A different conclusion may be found in the case of non-adiabatic
perturbations. We also discuss the distinguishability, using power spectrum
measurements from LCDM N-body simulations as a proxy for future observations,
between these mimetic models and other popular models of DE. For instance, we
find that if the background has an equation of state equal to -0.95 then we
will be able to distinguish the mimetic model from the PFDE model with unity
sound speed. On the other hand, it will be hard to do this distinction with
respect to the LCDM model.

mutual dynamics of the system. The primary body is currently rotating at a spin
period close to the spin barrier of asteroids, and materials ejected from the
secondary due to the DART impact are likely to reach the primary. These

results show that under constant volume, shape deformation induces strong
perturbation in the mutual motion. We find that the deformation process always
causes the orbital period of the system to become shorter. If surface layers

propose a device that can generate even larger changes in resistance in a

are applied to cancel the heavy charge doping in the YIG-induced half-metallic

particularly rich in zigzag edged graphene nano-ribbons(ZGNR) due to the
contest of bias driven n-n FM order and the inter-edge antiferromagnetic order
inherent to ZGNRs, leading to systematic closing of gap for one of the spins,

are an important security primitive. However, even the best behavioral
detectors suffer from high false positives and negatives. In this paper, we
address the challenge of aggregating weak per-device behavioral detectors in
noisy communities (i.e., ones that produce alerts at unpredictable rates) into
an accurate and robust global anomaly detector (GD).
  Our system - Shape GD - combines two insights: Structural: actions such as
visiting a website (waterhole attack) or membership in a shared email thread
(phishing attack) by nodes correlate well with malware spread, and create
dynamic neighborhoods of nodes that were exposed to the same attack vector; and
Statistical: feature vectors corresponding to true and false positives of local
detectors have markedly different conditional distributions. We use
neighborhoods to amplify the transient low-dimensional structure that is latent
in high-dimensional feature vectors - but neighborhoods vary unpredictably, and
we use shape to extract robust neighborhood-level features that identify
infected neighborhoods.
  Unlike prior works that aggregate local detectors' alert bitstreams or
cluster the feature vectors, Shape GD analyzes the feature vectors that led to
local alerts (alert-FVs) to separate true and false positives. Shape GD first
filters these alert-FVs into neighborhoods and efficiently maps a
neighborhood's alert-FVs' statistical shapes into a scalar score. Shape GD then
acts as a neighborhood level anomaly detector - training on benign program
traces to learn the ShapeScore of false positive neighborhoods, and classifying
neighborhoods with anomalous ShapeScores as malicious.
  Shape GD detects malware early (~100 infected nodes in a ~100K node system
for waterhole and ~10 of 1000 for phishing) and robustly (with ~100% global TP
and ~1% global FP rates).

accompanied by the pulsations of hard X-ray (HXR) emission. These flares were
studied by Kuznetsov et al. (2016) (Paper~I), and chosen here because of the
availability of the vector magnetograms for their parent active regions (ARs)
obtained with the SDO/HMI data. In Paper~I, based on the observations only, it
was suggested that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) might play an important role in
the process of generation of the HXR pulsations. The goal of the present paper
is to test this hypothesis by using the extrapolation of magnetic field with
the non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) method. Having done this, we found that
before each flare indeed there was an MFR elongated along and above a magnetic
polarity inversion line (MPIL) on the photosphere. In two flare regions the
sources of the HXR pulsations were located at the footpoints of different
magnetic field lines wrapping around the central axis, and constituting an MFR
by themselves. In five other flares the parent field lines of the HXR
pulsations were not a part of an MFR, but surrounded it in the form of an
arcade of magnetic loops. These results show that, at least in the analyzed
cases, the ""single flare loop"" models do not satisfy the observations and
magnetic field modeling, while are consistent with the concept that the HXR
pulsations are a consequence of successive episodes of energy release and
electron acceleration in different magnetic flux tubes (loops) of a complex AR.
An MFR could generate HXR pulsations by triggering episodes of magnetic
reconnection in different loops in the course of its non-uniform evolution
along an MPIL. However, since three events studied here were confined flares,
actual eruptions may not be required to trigger sequential particle
acceleration episodes in the magnetic systems containing an MFR.

pseudo-random universal quantum circuits in particular, has been proposed as a
prominent milestone for near-term quantum supremacy. The same paper notes that
chaotic distributions are very sensitive to noise, and under quite general
noise models converge to the uniform distribution over bit-strings
exponentially in the number of gates. On the one hand, for increasing number of
gates, it suffices to choose bit-strings at random to approximate the noisy
distribution with fixed statistical distance. On the other hand, cross-entropy
benchmarking can be used to gauge the fidelity of an experiment, and the
distance to the uniform distribution. We estimate that state-of-the-art
classical supercomputers would fail to simulate high-fidelity chaotic quantum
circuits with approximately fifty qubits and depth forty. A recent interesting
paper proposed a different approximation algorithm to a noisy distribution,
extending previous results on the Fourier analysis of commuting quantum
circuits. Using the statistical properties of the Porter-Thomas distribution,
we show that this new approximation algorithm does not improve random guessing,
in polynomial time. Therefore, it confirms previous results and does not
represent an additional challenge to the suggested failure stated above.

surprisingly, how and why they form are very much open questions. Well-defined
facets are commonly observed1-4 along fracture surfaces which are created by
slow tensile cracks. As facets appear in amorphous materials5-7, their
formation does not reflect microscopic order. Fracture mechanics, however,
predict that slow crack fronts should be straight, creating mirror-like
surfaces8-13. In contrast, facet-forming fronts propagate simultaneously within
different planes separated by steps. It is therefore unclear why steps are
stable, what determines their path and how they couple to crack front dynamics.
Here we show, by integrating real-time imaging of propagating crack fronts with
surface measurements, that steps are topological defects of crack fronts; crack
front separation into discontinuous overlapping segments provides the condition
for step stability. Steps drift at a constant angle to the local front
propagation direction and the increased local dissipation due to step formation
couples to the long-range deformation of the surrounding crack fronts. Slow
crack front dynamics are enslaved to changes in step heights and positions.
These observations show how 3D topology couples to 2D fracture dynamics to

and the interlayer synchronization of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on
multiplexes. For the two-layer multiplexes with initially high degree of
synchronization in each layer, the difference between the average phases in
each layer is analyzed from two different perspectives: the spectral analysis
and the non-linear Kuramoto model. Both viewpoints confirm that the prior
timescales are inversely proportional to the interlayer coupling strength.
Thus, increasing the interlayer coupling always shortens the transient regimes
of both the global order parameter and the interlayer synchronization.
Surprisingly, the analytical results show that the convergence of the global
order parameter is faster than the interlayer synchronization, and the latter
is generally faster than the global synchronization of the multiplex. The
formalism also outlines the effects of frequencies on the difference between
the average phases of each layer, and identifies the conditions for an
oscillatory behavior. Computer simulations are in fairly good agreement with
the analytical findings and reveal that the timescale of the global order
parameter is at least half times smaller than timescale of the multiplex.

we use explicit models that are often only crude approximations of reality. For
example, in the pose-estimation tasks mentioned above, it is common to use
motion models that assume constant velocity or constant acceleration, and we
believe that these simplified representations are severely inhibitive. In this
work, we propose to instead learn rich, dynamic representations of the motion

activities such as viral marketing and campaign advertising. The independent
cascade model for the influence spread assumes a one-time chance for each
activated node to influence its neighbors. This reasonable assumption cannot be
bypassed, since otherwise the influence probabilities of the nodes, modeled by
the edge weights, would be altered. On the other hand, the manually activated
seed set nodes can be reselected without violating the model parameters or
assumptions. The reselection of a seed set node, simply means paying extra
budget to a previously paid node in order for it to retry its influential
skills on its uninfluenced neighbors. This view divides the influence
maximization process into two cases: the simple case where the reselection of
the nodes is not considered and the reselection case. In this study we will
analyze the behavior of real world networks on the difference between these two
influence maximization cases. First we will show that the difference between
the simple and the reselection cases constitutes a wide spectrum of networks
ranging from the reselection-independent ones, where the reselection case has
no noticeable advantage to the simple case, to the reselection-friendly ones,
where the influence spread in the reselection case is twice the one in the
simple case. Then we will correlate this dynamic to other influence
maximization dynamics of the network. Finally, a significant entanglement
between this dynamic and the network structure is shown and verified by the
experiments. In other words, a series of conditions on the network structure is
specified whose fulfilment is a sign for a reselection-friendly network. As a
result of this entanglement, reselection-friendly networks can be spotted
without performing the time consuming influence maximization algorithms.

an important problem. A number of proposed methods demonstrate their practical
usefulness, but many of them rely on strong modeling assumptions and provide
poor performance in certain cases for reasons still not well understood. This
paper proposes a systematic method for locating the source of a forced
oscillation by considering a generator's response to fluctuations of its
terminal voltages and currents. It is shown that a generator can be represented
as an effective admittance matrix with respect to low-frequency oscillations,
and an explicit form for this matrix, for various generator models, is derived.
Furthermore, it is shown that a source generator, in addition to its effective
admittance, is characterized by the presence of an effective current source
thus giving a natural qualitative distinction between source and nonsource
generators. Detailed descriptions are given of a source detection procedure
based on this developed representation, and the method's effectiveness is
confirmed by simulations on the recommended testbeds (eg. WECC 179-bus system).
This method is free of strong modeling assumptions and is also shown to be
robust in the presence of measurement noise and generator parameter

  Hyperspectral Unmixing","To appear in IEEE Transaction on Geoscience and Remote Sensing",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data acquired from multi-channel sensors is a highly valuable asset to
interpret the environment for a variety of remote sensing applications.
However, low spatial resolution is a critical limitation for previous sensors
and the constituent materials of a scene can be mixed in different fractions
due to their spatial interactions. Spectral unmixing is a technique that allows
us to obtain the material spectral signatures and their fractions from
hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a novel endmember extraction and
hyperspectral unmixing scheme, so called \textit{EndNet}, that is based on a
two-staged autoencoder network. This well-known structure is completely
enhanced and restructured by introducing additional layers and a projection
metric (i.e., spectral angle distance (SAD) instead of inner product) to
achieve an optimum solution. Moreover, we present a novel loss function that is
composed of a Kullback-Leibler divergence term with SAD similarity and
additional penalty terms to improve the sparsity of the estimates. These
modifications enable us to set the common properties of endmembers such as
non-linearity and sparsity for autoencoder networks. Lastly, due to the
stochastic-gradient based approach, the method is scalable for large-scale data
and it can be accelerated on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). To demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on
several well-known datasets. The results confirm that the proposed method
considerably improves the performance compared to the state-of-the-art
techniques in literature.

planets orbiting evolved intermediate-mass stars. The planet is in a nearly
circular orbit with a period of P=353 days at about 1 AU distance from the host
star. The star is metal rich and located at the early phase of ascent along the
red giant branch. The photometric observations of the star at Ankara University

achieved. Then we study the variant where vertices are not blocking, and show
that then grid-obstacle representations exist for bipartite graphs. The latter
has applications in so-called staircase guarding of orthogonal polygons; using

referred to as the remnant phase, is poorly understood and very few sources in
this phase are known. In this work we present an extensive search for remnant
radio galaxies in the Lockman Hole, a well-studied extragalactic field. We
create mock catalogues of low-power radio galaxies based on Monte Carlo
simulations to derive first-order predictions of the fraction of remnants in
radio flux limited samples for comparison with our Lockman-Hole sample. We have
combined LOFAR observations at 150 MHz with public surveys at higher
frequencies to perform a complete selection and have used, for the first time,
a combination of spectral criteria (e.g. the classical ultra-steep spectral
index and high spectral curvature) as well as morphological criteria (e.g. low
radio core prominence and relaxed shapes). Mock catalogues of radio galaxies
are created based on existing spectral and dynamical evolution models combined
with observed source properties. We have identified 23 candidate remnant radio
galaxies which cover a variety of morphologies and spectral characteristics. We
suggest that these different properties are related to different stages of the
remnant evolution. We find that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a
fraction of our remnant sample suggesting a very rapid luminosity evolution of
the radio plasma. Results from mock catalogues demonstrate the importance of
dynamical evolution in the remnant phase of low-power radio galaxies to obtain
fractions of remnant sources consistent with our observations. Moreover, these
results confirm that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a subset of
the entire population ($\sim$50%) when frequencies higher than 1400 MHz are not
included in the selection process, and that they are biased towards old ages.
