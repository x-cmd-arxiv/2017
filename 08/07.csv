evolving, there is a general consensus in the psychology, science and

interactive decision-making problems will be accompanied by the exploitation of
their empathy, sympathy, compassion, antipathy, spitefulness, selfishness,
altruism, and self-abnegating states in the payoffs. In this article, we study
one-shot bimatrix games from a psychological game theory viewpoint. A new
empathetic payoff model is calculated to fit empirical observations and both
pure and mixed equilibria are investigated. For a realized empathy structure,
the bimatrix game is categorized among four generic class of games. Number of
interesting results are derived. A notable level of involvement can be observed
in the empathetic one-shot game compared the non-empathetic one and this holds
even for games with dominated strategies. Partial altruism can help in breaking
symmetry, in reducing payoff-inequality and in selecting social welfare and
more efficient outcomes. By contrast, partial spite and self-abnegating may
worsen payoff equity. Empathetic evolutionary game dynamics are introduced to
capture the resulting empathetic evolutionarily stable strategies under wide
range of revision protocols including Brown-von Neumann-Nash, Smith, imitation,
replicator, and hybrid dynamics. Finally, mutual support and Berge solution are
investigated and their connection with empathetic preferences are established.
We show that pure altruism is logically inconsistent, only by balancing it with
some partial selfishness does it create a consistent psychology.

parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar
masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield
realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for $z \sim 0-8$ as well. We demonstrate
that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at
all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is
a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems.
Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR $\sim 1-10 \, {\rm M_{\odot} \,

galaxies (SFR $\sim 10-100 \,{\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$) contribute
significantly only briefly around the peak era ($z \sim 2$) and then are
quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR
$\sim 10-100 \,{\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the
cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we
demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively

polaron pair recombination (PPR) and the triplet exciton-polaron quenching
(TPQ) models. Both models have been invoked to interpret the photoluminescence
detected magnetic resonance (PLDMR) in $\pi$-conjugated materials. We show that
resonance lineshapes calculated within the two models differ dramatically in
several regards. First, in the PPR model, the lineshape exhibits unusual
behavior upon increasing the microwave power: it evolves from fully positive at
weak power to fully negative at strong power. In contrast, in the TPQ model,
the PLDMR is completely positive, showing a monotonic saturation. Second, the
two models predict different dependencies of the resonance signal on the
photoexcitation power, $P_L$. At low $P_L$, the resonance amplitude $\Delta
I/I$ is $\propto P_L$ in the PPR model, while it is $\propto P_L^2$ crossing
over to $P_L^3$ in the TPQ model. On the physical level, the differences stem
from different underlying spin dynamics. Most prominently, a negative resonance
within the PPR model has its origin in the microwave-induced spin-Dicke effect,
leading to the resonant quenching of photoluminescence. The spin-Dicke effect
results from the spin-selective recombination, resulting in a highly correlated
precession of the on-resonance pair-partners under the strong microwave power.
This effect is not relevant to TPQ, where the majority of triplets are
off-resonance due to the strong zero-field splitting. The analytical evaluation
of lineshapes for the two models is enabled by expressing these shapes via the
eigenvalues of a complex Hamiltonian. This bypasses the necessity of solving
the much larger complex system of stochastic Liouville equations. Our findings
pave the way towards a reliable discrimination between the two mechanisms via
cw PLDMR.

Identity Proofs (UIP) holds. We also introduce the notion of an H-category, a
variant of category with equality on objects, which makes it easy to compare to
the notion of univalent category proposed for Univalent Type Theory by Ahrens,

in near future. However, to fulfill this complicated task, there is a need for
a mechanism, which enforces the autonomous vehicles to obey the road and social
rules that have been practiced by well-behaved drivers. This task can be
achieved by introducing social norms compliance mechanism in the autonomous
vehicles. This research paper is proposing an artificial society of autonomous
vehicles as an analogy of human social society. Each AV has been assigned a
social personality having different social influence. Social norms have been
introduced which help the AVs in making the decisions, influenced by emotions,
regarding road collision avoidance. Furthermore, social norms compliance
mechanism, by artificial social AVs, has been proposed using prospect based
emotion i.e. fear, which is conceived from OCC model. Fuzzy logic has been
employed to compute the emotions quantitatively. Then, using SimConnect
approach, fuzzy values of fear has been provided to the Netlogo simulation
environment to simulate artificial society of AVs. Extensive testing has been
performed using the behavior space tool to find out the performance of the
proposed approach in terms of the number of collisions. For comparison, the
random-walk model based artificial society of AVs has been proposed as well. A
comparative study with a random walk, prove that proposed approach provides a
better option to tailor the autopilots of future AVS, Which will be more
socially acceptable and trustworthy by their riders in terms of safe road
travel.

  Current IDRstab implementations suffer from slowdowns in the rate of

  We propose a novel implementation of IDRstab that is based on a successively

implementation can strike a benefit from it in that it terminates with the

avoidance solutions have been proposed. However, the problem with these
proposed solutions is that they are highly dependent on precise mathematical
models. Whereas, the real road driving is influenced by non-linear factors such
as road surface situations, driver reaction time, pedestrian flow and vehicle
dynamics, hence obtaining the accurate mathematical model of the vehicle
control system is challenging. This problem with precise control based rear end
collision avoidance schemes has been addressed using fuzzy logic, but the
excessive number of fuzzy rules straightforwardly prejudice their efficiency.
Furthermore, these fuzzy logic based controllers have been proposed without
using proper agent based modeling that helps in mimicking the functions of an
artificial human driver executing these fuzzy rules. Keeping in view these
limitations, we have proposed an Enhanced Emotion Enabled Cognitive Agent
(EEEC_Agent) based controller that helps the Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to
perform rear end collision avoidance with less number of rules, designed after
fear emotion, and high efficiency. To introduce a fear emotion generation

The fear generation mechanism of EEEC_Agent has been verified using NetLogo

invariant in the sense that if a diagram of the knot under study admits such a

p-colorability. It is also associated to systems of linear homogeneous
equations over the residues mod p, by regarding the arcs of the diagram as
variables and assigning the equation ""twice the over-arc minus the sum of the
under-arcs equals zero"" to each crossing. The knot invariant is here the
existence or non-existence of non-trivial solutions of these systems of
equations, when working over the integers modulo p (a non-trivial solution is
such that not all variables take up the same value). Another knot invariant is
the minimum number of distinct colors (values) these non-trivial solutions
require, should they exist. This corresponds to finding a basis, supported by a
diagram, in which these solutions take up the least number of distinct values.
The actual minimum is hard to calculate, in general. For the first few primes,
less than 17, it depends only on the prime, p, and not on the specific knots

an open problem. In this article, we begin the exploration of other

Until recently, most explanations of the spin Seebeck effect use the
interfacial temperature difference as the conversion mechanism between heat and
spin fluxes. However, recent theoretical and experimental works claim that a
magnon spin current is generated in the bulk of a magnetic insulator even in
the absence of an interface. This is the so-called intrinsic spin Seebeck
effect. Here, by utilizing a non-local spin Seebeck geometry, we provide
additional evidence that the total magnon spin current in the ferrimagnetic
insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) actually contains two distinct terms: one
proportional to the gradient in the magnon chemical potential (pure magnon spin
diffusion), and a second proportional to the gradient in magnon temperature
($\nabla T_m$). We observe two characteristic decay lengths for magnon spin
currents in YIG with distinct temperature dependences: a temperature
independent decay length of ~ 10 ${\mu}$m consistent with earlier measurements
of pure ($\nabla T_m = 0$) magnon spin diffusion, and a longer decay length
ranging from about 20 ${\mu}$m around 250 K and exceeding 80 ${\mu}$m at 10 K.
The coupled spin-heat transport processes are modeled using a finite element
method revealing that the longer range magnon spin current is attributable to
the intrinsic spin Seebeck effect ($\nabla T_m \neq 0$), whose length scale
increases at lower temperatures in agreement with our experimental data.

when the equilibrium configuration of the tube is helical. A particular case of
such tubes, commonly encountered in applications, is represented by quarter- or
semi-circular tubular joints used at pipe's turning points. The stability
theory for pipes with non-straight equilibrium configurations, especially for
collapsible tubes, allowing dynamical change of the cross-section, has been
elusive as it is difficult to accurately develop the dynamic description via
traditional methods. We develop a methodology for studying the
three-dimensional dynamics of collapsible tubes based on the geometric
variational approach. We show that the linear stability theory based on this
approach allows for a complete treatment for arbitrary three-dimensional
helical configurations of collapsible tubes by reduction to an equation with
constant coefficients. We discuss new results on stability loss of straight
tubes caused by the cross-sectional area change. Finally, we develop a
numerical algorithm for computation of the linear stability using our theory
and present the results of numerical studies for both straight and helical
tubes.

received growing interest as a general approach to large-scale problems.
Typically, the essential ingredient of these methods is some form of randomized
dimension reduction, which accelerates computations, but also creates random
approximation error. In this way, the dimension reduction step encodes a
tradeoff between cost and accuracy. However, the exact numerical relationship
between cost and accuracy is typically unknown, and consequently, it may be
difficult for the user to precisely know (1) how accurate a given solution is,
or (2) how much computation is needed to achieve a given level of accuracy. In
the current paper, we study randomized matrix multiplication (sketching) as a
prototype setting for addressing these general problems. As a solution, we
develop a bootstrap method for \emph{directly estimating} the accuracy as a
function of the reduced dimension (as opposed to deriving worst-case bounds on
the accuracy in terms of the reduced dimension). From a computational
standpoint, the proposed method does not substantially increase the cost of
standard sketching methods, and this is made possible by an ""extrapolation""
technique. In addition, we provide both theoretical and empirical results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) proposed a hierarchical Bayesian

Monte Carlo (MCMC), which was reported prohibitively slow. The poor speed of
MCMC dramatically limited the production feasibility of the Bayesian framework
if large scale (e.g. global scale) of aerosol retrieval is desired.
  In this paper, we present an alternative optimization method to mitigate the
speed problem. In particular we adopt Maximize a Posteriori (MAP) approach, and
apply a gradient-free ""hill-climbing"" algorithm: the coordinate-wise
stochastic-search. Our method has shown to be much (about 100 times) faster
than MCMC, easier to converge, and insensitive to hyper parameters. To further
scale our approach, we parallelized our method using Apache Spark, which
achieves linear speed-up w.r.t number of CPU cores up to 16. Due to these
efforts, we are able to retrieve AOD at much finer resolution (1.1km) with a
tiny fraction of time consumption compared with existing methods.
  During our research, we find that in low AOD levels, the Bayesian network
tends to produce overestimated retrievals. We also find that high absorbing
aerosol types are retrieved at the same time. This is likely caused by the
Dirichlet prior for aerosol types, as it is shown to encourage selecting
absorbing types in practice. After changing Dirichlet to uniform, the AOD
retrievals show excellent agreement with ground measurement in all levels.

group-theoretical characterization of nuclear wavefunctions, with an emphasis
of using Lanczos-type methods to efficiently dissect arbitrary wavefunctions
into group irreps. Although the resulting decompositions are often fragmented
over many irreps, one nonetheless finds powerful patterns. First, group
decompositions along rotational bands show coherent commonalities, supporting
the picture of a shared ""intrinsic shape;"" this is also called
\textit{quasi-dynamical symmetry}. Second, group decompositions for wave
functions using both phenomenological and \textit{ab initio} forces are often
very similar, despite vastly different origins and dimensionalities. Both of
these results suggest a group theoretical decomposition can provide a robust

theory, in the sense that our aim is to reconstruct histograms using so-called

atoms; such atoms are themselves synthetic histograms in the probability
simplex. Our method simultaneously estimates such atoms, and, for each
datapoint, the vector of weights that can optimally reconstruct it as an
optimal transport barycenter of such atoms. Our method is computationally
tractable thanks to the addition of an entropic regularization to the usual
optimal transportation problem, leading to an approximation scheme that is
efficient, parallel and simple to differentiate. Both atoms and weights are
learned using a gradient-based descent method. Gradients are obtained by
automatic differentiation of the generalized Sinkhorn iterations that yield
barycenters with entropic smoothing. Because of its formulation relying on
Wasserstein barycenters instead of the usual matrix product between dictionary
and codes, our method allows for nonlinear relationships between atoms and the
reconstruction of input data. We illustrate its application in several
different image processing settings.

challenging as it needs to examine a large set of regions pairs, which is

CEI mechanism makes a dominant contribution to the NSDI as the XUV photon
energy is smaller than the ionization threshold of the He$^+$ ion, and the
momentum spectrum shows complex interference patterns and symmetrical
structures. By channel analysis, we find that, as the energy carried by the
recollision electron is not enough to excite the bound electron, the bound
electron will absorb XUV photons during their collision, as a result, both
forward and backward collisions make a comparable contributions to the NSDI

not absorb any XUV photon and it is excited only by sharing the energy carried

on the NSDI processes. Moreover, we find that the interference patterns of the

applications. Numerous methods have been proposed in recent years, which either
focus on crafting cost terms for more robust matching, or on analyzing the
geometry of scene structures embedded in the epipolar-plane images. Significant
improvements have been made in terms of overall depth estimation error;
however, current state-of-the-art methods still show limitations in handling
intricate occluding structures and complex scenes with multiple occlusions. To
address these challenging issues, we propose a very effective depth estimation
framework which focuses on regularizing the initial label confidence map and
edge strength weights. Specifically, we first detect partially occluded
boundary regions (POBR) via superpixel based regularization. Series of
shrinkage/reinforcement operations are then applied on the label confidence map
and edge strength weights over the POBR. We show that after weight
manipulations, even a low-complexity weighted least squares model can produce
much better depth estimation than state-of-the-art methods in terms of average
disparity error rate, occlusion boundary precision-recall rate, and the
preservation of intricate visual features.

potential in this model, inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising
ferromagnet, has a hierarchical structure and is locally an approximation of
the Coulomb potential. Hyperuniformity is proved at both macroscopic and
microscopic scales, with upper and lower bounds for the order of fluctuations
that match up to logarithmic factors. The fluctuations have cube-root behavior,
in agreement with a well-known prediction for the 3D Coulomb gas. For

On the one hand,
its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people

the wide spread of ""fake news"", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false
information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely
negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on
social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting
tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique
characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from
traditional news media ineffective or not applicable. First, fake news is
intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which
makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore,
we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on
social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary
information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with
fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy.
Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging
and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the
problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake
news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and
social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation
metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas,
open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social

electron systems with strong spin-orbit coupling exhibit a variety of time
reversal symmetry breaking phases with unconventional spin alignment. We first
prove that a Stoner-type criterion can be formulated for the spin polarization
response to an electric field, which predicts that the spin polarization
susceptibility diverges at a certain value of the electron-electron interaction
strength. The divergence indicates the possibility of unconventional
ferromagnetic phases even in the absence of any applied electric or magnetic
field. This leads us, in the second part of this work, to study interacting
Rashba spin-orbit coupled semiconductors in equilibrium in the Hartree-Fock
approximation as a generic minimal model. Using classical Monte-Carlo
simulations we construct the complete phase diagram of the system as a function
of density and spin-orbit coupling strength. It includes both an out-of-plane
spin polarized phase and in-plane spin-polarized phases with shifted Fermi
surfaces and rich spin textures, reminiscent of the Pomeranchuk instability, as
well as two different Fermi-liquid phases having one and two Fermi surfaces,
respectively, which are separated by a Lifshitz transition. We discuss

model is misspecified, under regularity conditions, the accept/reject ABC
approach concentrates posterior mass on an appropriately defined pseudo-true

not yield credible sets with valid frequentist coverage and has non-standard
asymptotic behavior. In addition, we examine the theoretical behavior of the
popular local regression adjustment to ABC under model misspecification and
demonstrate that this approach concentrates posterior mass on a completely

phrases from a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system into
the encoder-decoder architecture of NMT. At each decoding step, the phrase
memory is first re-written by the SMT model, which dynamically generates
relevant target phrases with contextual information provided by the NMT model.
Then the proposed model reads the phrase memory to make probability estimations
for all phrases in the phrase memory. If phrase generation is carried on, the
NMT decoder selects an appropriate phrase from the memory to perform phrase
translation and updates its decoding state by consuming the words in the
selected phrase. Otherwise, the NMT decoder generates a word from the
vocabulary as the general NMT decoder does. Experiment results on the Chinese

improvements over the baseline on various test sets.

Numerous challenges exist in establishing human resource management strategies
aligned with strategic operations planning and growth strategies. We generalize
the problem of managing talent from a supply-demand standpoint through a
resource acquisition lens, to an industrial business case where an organization
recruits for multiple roles given a limited pool of potential candidates
acquired through a limited number of recruiting channels. In this context, we
develop an innovative analytical model in a stochastic environment to assist
managers with talent planning in their organizations. We apply supply chain
concepts to the problem, whereby individuals with specific competencies are
treated as unique products. We first develop a multi-period mixed integer
nonlinear programming model and then exploit chance-constrained programming to
a linearized instance of the model to handle stochastic parameters, which
follow any arbitrary distribution functions. Next, we use an empirical study to
validate the model with a large global manufacturing company, and demonstrate
how the proposed model can effectively manage talents in a practical context. A
stochastic analysis on the implemented case study reveals that a reasonable
improvement is derived from incorporating randomness into the problem.

imaging, atmospheric science, astronomy, and many other areas. This problem
intends to recover the optical properties, denoted as absorption and scattering
coefficient of the media, through the source-measurement pairs. A typical
computational approach is to form the inverse problem as a PDE-constraint
optimization, with the minimizer being the to-be-recovered coefficients. The
method is tested to be efficient in practice, but lacks analytical
justification: there is no guarantee of the existence or uniqueness of the
minimizer, and the error is hard to quantify. In this paper, we provide a
different algorithm by levering the ideas from singular decomposition analysis.
Our approach is to decompose the measurements into three components, two out of
which encode the information of the two coefficients respectively. We then
split the optimization problem into two subproblems and use those two
components to recover the absorption and scattering coefficients separately. In
this regard, we prove the well-posedness of the new optimization, and the error
could be quantified with better precision. In the end, we incorporate the
diffusive scaling and show that the error is harder to control in the diffusive

Variance imaging with EMU and SKA-MID will detect pulsars with large duty
cycles and is therefore a potential tool for finding MSPs and pulsars in
relativistic binary systems. Compared with current pulsar surveys at high
Galactic latitudes in the southern hemisphere, variance imaging with EMU and

multiple resolutions, which simultaneously incorporate coarse semantics and
fine details. Then it adaptively learns to combine these feature maps at each

predicted results are efficiently fused to generate the final saliency map. In
addition, to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic enhancement,
edge-aware feature maps in low-level layers and the predicted results of low

star known to experience accretion outbursts. Since its discovery in 2013, it
has experienced two outbursts, the second of which started in November 2014 and
lasted until February 2017. We use high- and low-resolution spectroscopy and
time-resolved photometry from the ASAS-SN survey, the LCOGT and the Beacon
Observatory to study the lightcurve and the dynamical and physical properties
of the accretion flow. The 2014-2017 outburst lasted for nearly 800 days. A
4.15d period in the lightcurve likely corresponds to rotational modulation of a
star with hot spot(s). The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable
inverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the
continuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)
suggest temperatures of $\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.
Photometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an
intermediate behavior between EXors and FUors. The accretion rate
(\.{M}=1-3$\times$10$^{-7}$M$_\odot$/yr), about 2 orders of magnitude higher
than the accretion rate in quiescence, is not significantly different from the
accretion rate observed in 2013. The absorption features in the spectra suggest
that the system is viewed at a high angle and drives a powerful,
non-axisymmetric wind, maybe related to magnetic reconnection. The properties
of ASASSN-13db suggest that temperatures lower than those for solar-type stars
are needed for modeling accretion in very low-mass systems. Finally, the
rotational modulation during the outburst reveals that accretion-related
structures settled after the begining of the outburst and can be relatively
stable and long-lived. Our work also demonstrates the power of time-resolved
photometry and spectroscopy to explore the properties of variable and
outbursting stars. (Abridged).

numerous sources and used by many critical data-driven applications. Due to the
varying reliability of sources, it is common to see conflicts among the
multi-source data, making it difficult to determine which data sources to
trust. Recently, truth discovery has emerged as a means of addressing this
challenging issue by determining data veracity jointly with estimating the
reliability of data sources. A fundamental issue with current truth discovery
methods is that they generally assume only one true value for each object,
while in reality, objects may have multiple true values. In this paper, we
propose a graph-based approach, called SmartMTD, to unravel the truth discovery
problem beyond the single-truth assumption, or the multi-truth discovery
problem. SmartMTD models and quantifies two types of source relations to
estimate source reliability precisely and to detect malicious agreement among
sources for effective multi-truth discovery. In particular, two graphs are
constructed based on the modeled source relations. They are further used to
derive the two aspects of source reliability (i.e., positive precision and
negative precision) via random walk computation. Empirical studies on two large
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

any value of the parameter $m$ for the interferers excepting the limiting value

means for resolving the conflicts in multi-source data. Although many truth
discovery methods have been proposed based on different considerations and
intuitions, investigations show that no single method consistently outperforms
the others. To select the right truth discovery method for a specific
application scenario, it becomes essential to evaluate and compare the
performance of different methods. A drawback of current research efforts is
that they commonly assume the availability of certain ground truth for the
evaluation of methods. However, the ground truth may be very limited or even
out-of-reach in practice, rendering the evaluation biased by the small ground
truth or even unfeasible. In this paper, we present CompTruthHyp, a general
approach for comparing the performance of truth discovery methods without using

observations in a dataset based on the output of different methods. The
probability is then ranked to reflect the performance of these methods. We

tolerance and power consumption are two of the prime challenges anticipated by
the High Performance Computing (HPC) community. Checkpoint/Restart (CR) has
been and still is the most widely used technique to deal with hard failures.
Application-level CR is the most effective CR technique in terms of overhead
efficiency but it takes a lot of implementation effort. This work presents the
implementation of our C++ based library CRAFT (Checkpoint-Restart and Automatic
Fault Tolerance), which serves two purposes. First, it provides an extendable
library that significantly eases the implementation of application-level
checkpointing. The most basic and frequently used checkpoint data types are
already part of CRAFT and can be directly used out of the box. The library can
be easily extended to add more data types. As means of overhead reduction, the
library offers a build-in asynchronous checkpointing mechanism and also
supports the Scalable Checkpoint/Restart (SCR) library for node level
checkpointing. Second, CRAFT provides an easier interface for User-Level
Failure Mitigation (ULFM) based dynamic process recovery, which significantly
reduces the complexity and effort of failure detection and communication
recovery mechanism. By utilizing both functionalities together, applications
can write application-level checkpoints and recover dynamically from process
failures with very limited programming effort. This work presents the design
and use of our library in detail. The associated overheads are thoroughly
analyzed using several benchmarks.

The proposed methods can also be applied to other deep convolutional networks.
Compared with existing saliency detection methods, the proposed UCF model is
able to incorporate uncertainties for more accurate object boundary inference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed saliency model performs
favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. The uncertain feature learning

not local, rotations in the $d$-dimensional space. There can be configurations
with a smooth or flat metric, but with the tetrad that changes abruptly at
small distances, a kind of ""antiferromagnetic"" structure.
  Previously, we discussed a first order representation for the Faddeev
gravity, which uses the orthogonal connection in the $d$-dimensional space as
an independent variable. Using the discrete form of this formulation, we
considered the spectrum of (elementary) area. This spectrum turns out to be
physically reasonable just on a classical background with large connection like
rotations by $\pi$, that is, with such an ""antiferromagnetic"" structure.
  In the discrete first order Faddeev gravity, we consider such a structure
with periodic cells and large connection and strongly changing tetrad field

numerical methods for problems involving networks formed by, essentially,
one-dimensional (1D) domains joined by junctions. Examples include hyperbolic
equations in networks of gas tubes, water channels and vessel networks for

numerical methods for such applications is the treatment of junctions, i.e.
points at which two or more 1D domains converge and where the flow exhibits
multidimensional behaviour. This paper focuses on the design of methods for
networks of water channels. Our methods adopt the finite volume approach to
make full use of the two-dimensional shallow water equations on the true
physical domain, locally at junctions, while solving the usual one-dimensional
shallow water equations away from the junctions. In addition to mass
conservation, our methods enforce conservation of momentum at junctions; the
latter seems to be the missing element in methods currently available. Apart
from simplicity and robustness, the salient feature of the proposed methods is
their ability to successfully deal with transcritical and supercritical flows
at junctions, a property not enjoyed by existing published methodologies.
Systematic assessment of the proposed methods for a variety of flow
configurations is carried out. The methods are directly applicable to other

  fractionation in dense cloud cores?","Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/aa95b7",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deuterium fractionation, i.e. the enhancement of deuterated species with
respect to the non-deuterated ones, is considered to be a reliable chemical
clock of star-forming regions. This process is strongly affected by the
ortho-to-para (o-p) H$_2$ ratio. In this letter we explore the effect of the
o-p H$_2$ conversion on grains on the deuteration timescale in fully depleted
dense cores, including the most relevant uncertainties that affect this complex
process. We show that (i) the o-p H$_2$ conversion on grains is not strongly
influenced by the uncertainties on the conversion time and the sticking
coefficient and (ii) that the process is controlled by the temperature and the
residence time of ortho-H$_2$ on the surface, i.e. by the binding energy. We
find that for binding energies in between 330-550 K, depending on the
temperature, the o-p H$_2$ conversion on grains can shorten the deuterium
fractionation timescale by orders of magnitude, opening a new route to explain
the large observed deuteration fraction $D_\mathrm{frac}$ in dense molecular
cloud cores. Our results suggest that the star formation timescale, when
estimated through the timescale to reach the observed deuteration fractions,
might be shorter than previously proposed. However, more accurate measurements
of the binding energy are needed to better assess the overall role of this
process.

re-training the model from scratch each time a new task needs to be learned.
There have been multiple attempts to develop schemes that mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, but these methods have not been directly compared, the tests used
to evaluate them vary considerably, and these methods have only been evaluated
on small-scale problems (e.g., MNIST). In this paper, we introduce new metrics
and benchmarks for directly comparing five different mechanisms designed to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: regularization,
ensembling, rehearsal, dual-memory, and sparse-coding. Our experiments on
real-world images and sounds show that the mechanism(s) that are critical for
optimal performance vary based on the incremental training paradigm and type of
data being used, but they all demonstrate that the catastrophic forgetting
problem has yet to be solved.

global optimization algorithms. We are able to show, for example, that an
optimal extreme point solution to a moment problem with $m$ moments and
log-concave shape constraints is piecewise geometric with at most $m$ pieces.

role in shaping our ideas about how the heat balance is achieved in the ocean.
Its has been and is still widely used in many applications ranging from the
estimation of transfer coefficients to the parameterisation of ocean heat
uptake in Simple Climate Models (SCMs). Its conceptual value as a realistic
theoretical model of the ocean heat balance has become increasingly unclear
over the years however, because: 1) the different ways in which upwelling has
been linked to high-latitude deep water formation and downgradient diffusion
linked to vertical/diapycnal mixing have remained imprecise and somewhat ad-hoc
so far; 2) other effects such as isopycnal mixing, density-compensated
temperature anomalies, meso-scale eddy-induced advection and the depth-varying
ocean area have all be demonstrated to affect actual ocean heat uptake as well,
but their incorporation into existing VUDM frameworks has been problematic. In
this paper, a new process-based vertical advection/diffusion theoretical model
of ocean heat uptake is constructed that resolve all above difficulties. This
new model is obtained by coarse-graining the full three-dimensional
advection/diffusion for potential temperature carried by ocean climate models,
by using the same isopycnal analysis as in the theory of ocean water masses.
The resulting model describes the temporal evolution of the
isopycnally-averaged thickness-weighted potential temperature in terms of an
effective velocity that depends uniquely on the surface heating conditionally
integrated in density classes, an effective diapycnal diffusivity controlled by
isoneutral and dianeutral mixing, and an additional term linked to the
meridional transport of density-compensated temperature anomalies by the
diabatic residual overturning circulation.

external force that is applied to its Center of Mass (CoM). The Ratio of
Transmission of Motion (RoToM) is proposed as a novel indicator of what part of
the applied force generates motion, and what part is dissipated by the passive
forces due to mechanical constraints. It depends on the configuration of the
robot and on the direction of the force, and is always between 0 and 1.
Extending this concept, a transmissibility ellipsoid is used to describe the
behavior of the robot given a certain configuration, and varying the direction
of the applied force. Another physical measure that is related to the
transmissibility ellipsoid is the transmissibility index: it provides an
indication on how similarly the system behaves when subject to forces coming
from different directions. The presented analysis aims to provide a deeper
insight on the centroidal dynamics of a robot, and on its dependence on the
configuration. It can be beneficial for developing whole-body controllers of
redundant robots for e.g., reducing the effort in terms of joint torques to
compensate for gravity, and more in general for designing interaction control
architectures.

at the source. We test our model using the information provided by HESE
shower-like events and by the lack of double pulses and resonant events. We
find that a two power-law spectrum is compatible with all observations. The
model agrees with the standard picture of pion decay as a source of neutrinos,
and indicates a slight preference for a pgamma mechanism of production. We
discuss the tension between the HESE and the throughgoing muons datasets around
few tens TeV, focussing on the angular distributions of the spectra. The
expected number of smoking-gun signatures of nu-tau induced events (referred to
as double pulses) is quantified: in the baseline model we predict 0.65 double
pulse events in 5.7 years. Uncertainties in the predictions are quantified.

applications. In medical image analysis, reliable segmentations of airways,
vessels, neurons and other tree structures can enable important clinical
applications. We present a framework for tracking tree structures comprising of
elongated branches using probabilistic state-space models and Bayesian
smoothing. Unlike most existing methods that proceed with sequential tracking
of branches, we present an exploratory method, that is less sensitive to local
anomalies in the data due to acquisition noise and/or interfering structures.
The evolution of individual branches is modelled using a process model and the
observed data is incorporated into the update step of the Bayesian smoother
using a measurement model that is based on a multi-scale blob detector.
Bayesian smoothing is performed using the RTS (Rauch-Tung-Striebel) smoother,
which provides Gaussian density estimates of branch states at each tracking
step. We select likely branch seed points automatically based on the response
of the blob detection and track from all such seed points using the RTS
smoother. We use covariance of the marginal posterior density estimated for
each branch to discriminate false positive and true positive branches. The
method is evaluated on 3D chest CT scans to track airways. We show that the
presented method results in additional branches compared to a baseline method
based on region growing on probability images.

matter whether the simulation method matches the data collection method?
Moreover, do the results differ for testing versus estimation? Here we answer
these questions in a simple setting by exploring the distribution of a sample

resampling. For testing a sharp null hypothesis, reallocating is superior in
small samples, but reallocating and resampling are asymptotically equivalent.
For estimation, resampling is generally superior, unless the effect is truly

study is to analyze the influence of the fluid resistivity and turbulence level
on the collimation by helicoidal motions of a remnant magnetic field. We use a
simplified cartesian geometry to represent the flow dynamics in the vicinity of
one cavity of a multi-blades impeller inspired by those used in the
Von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) experiment. We perform numerical simulations with
kinetic Reynolds numbers up to 1000 for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 30 and
0.1. Our study shows that perfect ferromagnetic walls favour enhanced
collimation of flow and magnetic fields even if the turbulence degree of the
model increases. The location of the helicoidal coherent vortex in between the
blades changes with the impinging velocity. It becomes closer to the upstream
blade and impeller base if the flow incident angle is analogous to the TM73
impeller configuration rotating in the unscooping direction. This result is
also obtained at higher kinetic Reynolds numbers when the helicoidal vortex
undergoes a precessing motion, leading to a reinforced effect in the vortex
evolution and in the magnetic field collimation when using again perfect
ferromagnetic boundary conditions. We estimate the efficiency of a hypothetical
dynamo loop occurring in the vicinity of the impeller and discuss the relevance

a large helical coupling between different toroidal modes and the
destabilization of helical Alfven Eigenmodes (HAE) with frequencies similar to
the AE activity measured in TJ-II, between 50 - 400 kHz. The analysis has also
revealed the destabilization of GAE (Global Alfven Eigenmodes), TAE (Toroidal

periphery cannot be fully stabilized, although for a configuration with iota =

synthetic direction beyond a critical interaction strength, resulting in a
quantum string or a membrane, with an emergent condensate that lives on this

that can occur in ultra-dense environments such as neutron stars. The scalar
field develops a non-trivial configuration once the stars exceeds a compactness
threshold. We recently pointed out that, if the scalar exhibits some additional
coupling to matter, it could give rise to significantly different microphysics
in these environments. In this work we study, at the non-perturbative level, a
toy model in which the photon is given a large mass when spontaneous
scalarization occurs. Our results demonstrate clearly the effectiveness of
spontaneous scalarization as a Higgs-like mechanism in neutron stars.

Experiment (SOLME) \cite{Rider:2016xaq} (kindly provided by the authors of
\cite{Rider:2016xaq}) searching for sub-mm spatially oscillating new force
signals. We find a statistically significant oscillating signal for a force
residual of the form $F(z)=\alpha \; cos(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\; z +c)$ where
$z$ is the distance between the macroscopic interacting masses (levitated
microsphere and cantilever). The best fit parameter values are $\alpha=(1.1 \pm
0.4)\times 10^{-17}N$, $\lambda=(35.2\pm 0.6)\mu m$. Monte Carlo simulation of
the SOLME data under the assumption of zero force residuals has indicated that
the statistical significance of this signal is at about $2\sigma$ level.
Private communication with members of the SOLME group has indicated that this
previously unnoticed signal is most probably due to a systematic effect
(diffraction of non-Gaussian tails of the laser beam). Thus it can only be
useful as an upper bound of the amplitude of new spatially oscillating forces
on sub-mm scales. Assuming gravitational origin emerging from a fundamental
modification of the Newtonian potential of the form
$V_{eff}(r)=-G\frac{M}{r}(1+\alpha_O \cos(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\;

obtain a bound $\alpha_O < 10^7$ for $\lambda \simeq 35 \mu m$. Thus, we get no
useful constraints on the modified gravity parameter $\alpha_O$. However, the
constraints on the general phenomenological parameter $\alpha$ can be useful in
constraining other fifth force models related to dark energy (chameleon

increased power to detect true differential edges while providing adequate

can be performed in two steps. First, the infinitesimal generator is
discretized, then the invariant subspace is approxi-mated and used for the
subspace projection. In our approach, the discretization will be based on a
Voronoi tessellation of the conformational space. We will show that the
discretized infinitesimal generator can simply be approximated by the geometric

Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model, the extended Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (eSHF) model,
the Gogny-Hartree-Fock (GHF) model, and the momentum-dependent interaction

$0.70\pm0.60$ MeV for the GHF model, and $0.74\pm0.63$ MeV for the MDI model.
Moreover, our results indicate that the density dependence of

Furthermore, we find that the $E_{\text{sym},4}(\rho_0)$ has strong positive
(negative) correlation with isoscalar (isovector) nucleon effective mass
$m_{s,0}^*$ ($m_{v,0}^*$) at $\rho_0$. In particular, for the SHF and eSHF

the analytical expression is given. In the mean-field models, the magnitude of
$ E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is generally less than $2$ MeV, and its density
dependence depends on models, especially at higher densities. $
E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is strongly correlated with $m_{s,0}^*$ and

neutron scattering community has at their disposal target the instrument
optimization until the sample position, with little focus on detectors. The ESS
Detector Group has extended the capabilities of existing detector simulation
tools to bridge this gap. An extensive software framework has been developed,
enabling efficient and collaborative developments of required simulations and
analyses -- based on the use of the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit, but with
extended physics capabilities where relevant (like for Bragg diffraction of
thermal neutrons in crystals). Furthermore, the MCPL (Monte Carlo Particle
Lists) particle data exchange file format, currently supported for the primary
Monte Carlo tools of the community (McStas, Geant4 and MCNP), facilitates the
integration of detector simulations with existing simulations of instruments
using these software packages. These means offer a powerful set of tools to
tailor the detector and instrument design to the instrument application.

performance capture of a human with general clothing from monocular video. Our
approach reconstructs articulated human skeleton motion as well as medium-scale
non-rigid surface deformations in general scenes. Human performance capture is
a challenging problem due to the large range of articulation, potentially fast
motion, and considerable non-rigid deformations, even from multi-view data.
Reconstruction from monocular video alone is drastically more challenging,
since strong occlusions and the inherent depth ambiguity lead to a highly
ill-posed reconstruction problem. We tackle these challenges by a novel
approach that employs sparse 2D and 3D human pose detections from a
convolutional neural network using a batch-based pose estimation strategy.
Joint recovery of per-batch motion allows to resolve the ambiguities of the
monocular reconstruction problem based on a low dimensional trajectory
subspace. In addition, we propose refinement of the surface geometry based on
fully automatically extracted silhouettes to enable medium-scale non-rigid
alignment. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance capture results that
enable exciting applications such as video editing and free viewpoint video,
previously infeasible from monocular video. Our qualitative and quantitative
evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms previous
monocular methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and scene complexity that
can be handled.

for the temporal domain. The Generalized Weighted Residual Method (GWRM) is a
fully spectral method in that it spectrally decomposes all specified domains,
including the temporal domain, with multivariate Chebyshev polynomials. The
Common Boundary-Condition method (CBC) is a spatial subdomain scheme that
solves the physical equations independently from the global connection of
subdomains. It is here evaluated against two finite difference methods. For the
linearised Burger equation the CBC-GWRM is $\sim30\%$ faster and $\sim50\%$
more memory efficient than the semi implicit Crank-Nicolson method at a maximum
error $\sim10^{-5}$. For a forced wave equation the CBC-GWRM manages to average
efficiently over the small time-scale in the entire temporal domain. The
CBC-GWRM is also applied to the linearised ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations for a screw pinch equilibrium. The growth rate of the most unstable
mode was efficiently computed with an error $<0.1\%$.

long DNA string is read in a sliding window fashion, and a profile vector is

tolerance, it is unclear which permutations are feasible, and how to produce a
DNA string whose profile vector induces a given permutation. In this paper, by
observing some necessary conditions, an upper bound for the number of feasible

heavy passenger demand during rush hours. Such operations can be delayed by two
types of congestion: train congestion and passenger congestion, both of which
interact with each other. This delay is problematic for many transit systems,
since it can be amplified due to the interaction. However, there are no
tractable models describing them; and it makes difficult to analyze management
strategies of congested transit systems in general and tractable ways. To fill
this gap, this article proposes simple yet physical and dynamic model of urban
rail transit. First, a fundamental diagram of transit system (i.e., theoretical
relation among train-flow, train-density, and passenger-flow) is analytically
derived considering the aforementioned physical interaction. Then, a
macroscopic model of transit system for dynamic transit assignment is developed
based on the fundamental diagram. Finally, accuracy of the macroscopic model is
investigated by comparing to microscopic simulation. The proposed models would
be useful for mathematical analysis on management strategies of urban rail
transit systems, in a similar way that the macroscopic fundamental diagram of

local deviation of orientation fields (OF) of fingerprints from conformal
fields, and we propose a method to robustly measure them, based on
tetraquadrilaterals to approximate a conformal modulus locally with one due to
a M\""obius transformation. Conformal fields arise by the approximation of
fingerprint OFs given by zero pole models, which are determined by the singular
points and a rotation. This approximation is very coarse, e.g. for fingerprints
with no singular points (arch type), the zero-pole model's OF has parallel
lines. Quadratic differential (QD) models, which are obtained from zero-pole
models by adding suitable singularities outside the observation window,
approximate real fingerprints much better. For example, for arch type
fingerprints, parallel lines along the distal joint change slowly into circular
lines around the nail furrow. Still, QD models are not fully realistic because,
for example along the central axis of arch type fingerprints, ridge line
curvatures usually first increase and then decrease again. It is impossible to
model this with QDs, which, due to complex analyticity, also produce conformal
fields only. In fact, as one of many applications of the new descriptor, we
show, using histograms of curvature and conformality index (log of the absolute
value of the M\""obius modulus), that local deviation from conformality in
fingerprints occurs systematically at high curvature which is not reflected by
state of the art fingerprint models as are used, for instance, in the well
known synthetic fingerprint generation tool SFinGe and these differences
robustely discriminate real prints from SFinGe's synthetic prints.

dynamics is far more complex since two metal-electrolyte interfaces are present

Potential analysis of coupled gravity-capillary interfacial waves in a
three-layer battery model of cylindrical shape. Analytical expressions for the
amplitude ratio and the wave frequencies are derived and it is shown that the
wave coupling can be completely described by two independent dimensionless
parameters. We provide a decoupling criterion clarifying that wave coupling
will be present in most future liquid metal batteries. In the second part, the

a cavity grows downstream of the fiber and the accumulation of grains upstream
of the fiber leads to the development of a jammed cluster of grains. We discuss
our experimental results in the framework of a simple model of bending-induced

a dense CRF model. We use a mean field approximation to solve it and thus
segment the object of interest. Performance evaluated on different datasets

limitations due to its dependence on the autocovariances $\gamma(h)$. For
example, $f(\omega)$ can not distinguish white i.i.d. noise from GARCH-type
models (whose terms are dependent, but uncorrelated), which implies that
$f(\omega)$ can be an inadequate tool when $\{Y_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ contains

  Asymmetries between the upper and lower tails of a time series can be
investigated by means of the local Gaussian autocorrelations introduced in

be used to construct the local Gaussian spectral density presented in this
paper. A key feature of the new local spectral density is that it coincides
with $f(\omega)$ for Gaussian time series, which implies that it can be used to
detect non-Gaussian traits in the time series under investigation. In
particular, if $f(\omega)$ is flat, then peaks and troughs of the new local
spectral density can indicate nonlinear traits, which potentially might
discover local periodic phenomena that remain undetected in an ordinary
spectral analysis.

In this paper, we report on three user studies which give insights into how to
design systems that allow people, acting as the regulatory authority, to
effectively interact with HARE. As in the study of political systems in which
governments regulate human societies, our studies analyze how interactions
between HARE and regulators are impacted by regulatory power and individual

and hint at how these seemingly desirable mechanisms can be designed so that
they become part of successful HARE.

conventional algorithms use the noisy phase for signal reconstruction

the self-supervised sampling of both tasks from natural videos can result in
ambiguous and incorrect training labels, our method employs a curriculum

gradually increases the difficulty. To further refine the training process we
mine repetitive poses in individual videos which provide reliable labels while
removing inconsistencies. Our pose embeddings capture visual characteristics of
human pose that can boost existing supervised representations in human pose

convexity is the property requiring that the value of the function at the

the endpoints of the line segment. Midpoint convexity is a well-known
characterization of ordinary convexity under very mild assumptions. For a
function defined on the integer lattice, we consider the analogous notion of
discrete midpoint convexity, a discrete version of midpoint convexity where the
value of the function at the (possibly noninteger) midpoint is replaced by the
average of the function values at the integer round-up and round-down of the
midpoint. It is known that discrete midpoint convexity on all line segments
with integer endpoints characterizes L$^{\natural}$-convexity, and that it
characterizes submodularity if we restrict the endpoints of the line segments
to be at $\ell_\infty$-distance one. By considering discrete midpoint convexity
for all pairs at $\ell_\infty$-distance equal to two or not smaller than two,
we identify new classes of discrete convex functions, called local and global
discrete midpoint convex functions, which are strictly between the classes of
L$^{\natural}$-convex and integrally convex functions, and are shown to be
stable under scaling and addition. Furthermore, a proximity theorem, with the
same small proximity bound as that for L$^{\natural}$-convex functions, is
established for discrete midpoint convex functions. Relevant examples of
classes of local and global discrete midpoint convex functions are provided.

when a force is applied at some point on the rod in a direction perpendicular
to its length. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod gets
a linear motion perpendicular to its length. However, if the same force is
applied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near one end of the rod,
thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rod
about its centre of mass, in addition to the motion of the centre of mass
itself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but imparting
nevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit at one end of the
rod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed and
superimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speed
about the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say by
strapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin faster
and faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearly
with time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external
(inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of the
rod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixed
direction. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of the
centre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reaching
a final constant value with time. The mean motion of the centre of mass will be
in a straight line, with superposed initial oscillations that soon die down.

  dependence of free fall","14 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Referring to the behavior of accelerating objects in special relativity, and
applying the principle of equivalence, one expects that the coordinate
acceleration of point masses under gravity will be velocity dependent. Then,
using the Schwarzschild solution, we analyze the similar case of masses moving
on timelike geodesics, which reproduces a little known result by Hilbert from
1917, describing this dependence. We find that the relativistic correction term
for the acceleration based on general relativity differs by a factor of two
from the simpler acceleration arguments in flat space. As we might expect from
the general theory, the velocity dependence can be removed by a suitable
coordinate transformation, such as the Painlev{\'e}-Gullstrand coordinate
system. The validity of this approach is supported by previous authors who have
demonstrated vacuum solutions to general relativity producing true flat space
metrics for uniform gravitational fields. We suggest explicit experiments could
be undertaken to test the property of velocity dependence.

interesting papers published in the last 15-20 years. At the submitted papers
are studied both the cluster system of the physical body and its impact on the
object in general, and adequate mathematical tools for description of critical
phenomena too. Of special interest are the data, first, the point of phase
transition of certain of percolation system is not really a point, but it is a
critical interval, and second, in vicinity of percolation threshold observed
many different infinite clusters instead of one infinite cluster that appears
in traditional consideration.
