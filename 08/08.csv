the risk of its underlying securities. However, investing in option is still
risky. Such risk becomes much severer for speculators who utilize option as a
means of leverage to increase their potential returns. In order to mitigate
risk on their positions, the rudimentary concept of financial option insurance
is introduced into practice. Two starkly-dissimilar concepts of insurance and
financial option are integrated into the formation of financial option
insurance. The proposed financial product insures investors option premiums
when misfortune befalls on them. As a trade-off, they are likely to sacrifice a
limited portion of their potential profits. The loopholes of prevailing
financial market are addressed and the void is filled by introducing a stable
three-entity framework. Moreover, a specifically designed mathematical model is
proposed. It consists of two portions: the business strategy of matching and a
verification-and-modification process. The proposed model enables the option
investors with calls and puts of different moneyness to be protected by the
issued option insurance. Meanwhile, it minimizes the exposure of option
insurers position to any potential losses.

Here, we investigate the behavior of elastic microfilaments, protruding from a
surface and driven at their base by a configuration-dependent torque. We
consider full hydrodynamic interactions among and within filaments and no slip
at the surface. Isolated filaments exhibit periodic deformations, with
increasing waviness and frequency as the magnitude of the driving torque
increases. Two nearby but independently-driven filaments synchronize their
beating in-phase or anti-phase. This synchrony arises autonomously via the
interplay between hydrodynamic coupling and filament elasticity. Importantly,
in-phase and anti-phase synchronization modes are bistable and co-exist for a
range of driving torques and separation distances. These findings are
consistent with experimental observations of in-phase and anti-phase
synchronization in the biflagellate \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} and
could have important implications on understanding the biophysical mechanisms
underlying transitions between multiple synchronization modes.

ultimately will stop further increase in life lengths? This question is
important for understanding aging, and for society, and has led to intense
controversies. Demographic data for humans has been interpreted as showing
existence of a limit, or even as an indication of a decreasing limit, but also
as evidence that a limit does not exist. This paper studies what can be
inferred from data about human mortality at extreme age. We show that in
western countries and Japan and after age 110 the probability of dying is about
47% per year. Hence there is no finite upper limit to the human lifespan.
Still, given the present stage of biotechnology, it is unlikely that during the
next 25 years anyone will live longer than 128 years in these countries. Data,
remarkably, shows no difference in mortality after age 110 between sexes,
between ages, or between different lifestyles or genetic backgrounds. These
results, and the analysis methods developed in this paper, can help testing
biological theories of ageing and aid confirmation of success of efforts to
find a cure for ageing.

Plasmon excitation has been widely viewed as an efficient mechanism for
generating non-thermal hot carriers. Despite numerous experiments, conclusive
evidence elucidating and quantifying the full dynamics of hot carrier
generation, transport, and injection has not been reported. Here, we combine
experimental measurements with coupled first-principles electronic structure
theory and Boltzmann transport calculations to provide unprecedented insight
into the internal quantum efficiency, and hence internal physics, of hot
carriers in photoexcited gold (Au)-gallium nitride (GaN) nanostructures. Our
results indicate that photoexcited electrons generated in 20 nm-thick Au
nanostructures impinge ballistically on the Au-GaN interface. This discovery
suggests that the energy of hot carriers could be harnessed from metal
nanostructures without substantial losses via thermalization. Measurements and
calculations also reveal the important role of metal band structure in hot
carrier generation at energies above the interband threshold of the plasmonic
nanoantenna. Taken together, our results advance the understanding of excited

the performance of still image-based face recognition and video-based face
recognition, due to the vast difference in visual quality between the domains
and the difficulty of curating diverse large-scale video datasets. This paper
addresses both of those challenges, through an image to video feature-level
domain adaptation approach, to learn discriminative video frame
representations. The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to
reduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative
knowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition
network that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by
(i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through
feature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data
augmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain
adversarial discriminator. We further improve performance through a
discriminator-guided feature fusion that boosts high-quality frames while
eliminating those degraded by video domain-specific factors. Experiments on the
YouTube Faces and IJB-A datasets demonstrate that each module contributes to
our feature-level domain adaptation framework and substantially improves video
face recognition performance to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. We
demonstrate qualitatively that the network learns to suppress diverse artifacts

Fundamentally different from the conventional Markov transition formulation,
the state process is modeled by a continuous trajectory function of time (FoT)
and the STF problem is formulated as an online data fitting problem with the
goal of finding the trajectory FoT that best fits the observations in a sliding
time-window. Then, the state of the target, whether the past (namely,
smoothing), the current (filtering) or the near-future (forecasting), can be
inferred from the FoT. Our framework releases stringent statistical modeling of
the target motion in real time, and is applicable to a broad range of real
world targets of significance such as passenger aircraft and ships which move
on scheduled, (segmented) smooth paths but little statistical knowledge is
given about their real time movement and even about the sensors. In addition,
the proposed STF framework inherits the advantages of data fitting for
accommodating arbitrary sensor revisit time, target maneuvering and missed
detection. The proposed method is compared with state of the art estimators in

examine fifteen epochs of CAPSCam observations of TRAPPIST-1, spanning the five
years from 2011 to 2016, and obtain a revised trigonometric distance of $12.56
\pm 0.12$ pc. The astrometric data analysis pipeline shows no evidence for a
long-period astrometric wobble of TRAPPIST-1. After proper motion and parallax
are removed, residuals at the level of $\pm 1.3$ millarcsec (mas) remain. The
amplitude of these residuals constrains the masses of any long-period gas giant
planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system: no planet more massive than $\sim 4.6
M_{Jup}$ orbits with a 1 yr period, and no planet more massive than $\sim 1.6
M_{Jup}$ orbits with a 5 yr period. Further refinement of the CAPSCam data
analysis pipeline, combined with continued CAPSCam observations, should either
detect any long-period planets, or put an even tighter constraint on these mass
upper limits.

considered to be an appropriate alternative to the current host-centric
IP-based Internet infrastructure. Leveraging in-network caching, name-based
routing, and receiver-driven sessions, NDN can greatly enhance the way Internet
resources are being used. A critical issue in NDN is the procedure of cache
allocation and management. Our main contribution in this research is the
analysis of memory requirements to allocate suitable Content-Store size to NDN
routers, with respect to combined impacts of long-term centrality-based metric
and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of short-term parameters such as
users behaviors and outgoing traffic. To determine correlations in such large
data sets, data mining methods can prove valuable to researchers. In this
paper, we apply a data-fusion approach, namely Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), to discover relations from short- and long-term parameters of the
router. The output of PCA, exploited to mine out raw data sets, is used to
allocate a proper cache size to the router. Evaluation results show an increase
in the hit ratio of Content-Stores in sources, and NDN routers. Moreover, for
the proposed cache size allocation scheme, the number of unsatisfied and
pending Interests in NDN routers is smaller than the Degree-Centrality cache
size scheme.

cycle the temporal coverage of the records is 100 %. The interrelationships of
the timing characteristics of spotless days and their comparison with sunspot
cycle parameters are explored, in some cases finding very strong correlations.
Such is the case for the relationship between the minimum time between spotless
days either side of a given solar maximum and the maximum time between spotless
days either side in the previous solar minimum, with r = -0.91 and a p-value <
0.001. However, the predictions for SC 24 or 23 made by other authors in
previous works using the spotless days as a predictor of solar activity are not
good since it has not been fulfilled. Although there seems to be a pattern of
strong correlation for some relationships between the parameters studied,
prediction of future solar cycles from these parameters defined as functions of
the spotless days should be made with caution because sometimes the estimated
values are far from the observed ones. Finally, SC 23 seems to show a mode
change, a break respect to the behavior of their previous solar cycles and more
similar to SC 10-15.

with mirror symmetry were displayed in 2D on a computer screen to sighted
observers for visual scaling. For tactile (haptic) scaling, the physical
counterparts of these curves were placed in the two hands of sighted observers,
who were blindfolded during the sensing experiment, and of congenitally blind
observers, who never had any visual experience. All results clearly show that
curvature, whether haptically or visually sensed, is statistically linked to
the same curve properties. Sensation is expressed psychophysically as a power
function of any symmetrical curve's aspect ratio, a scale invariant geometric
property of physical objects. The results of the author's work support
biologically motivated models of sensory integration for curvature processing.

  Body Controller","15 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a robust dynamic walking controller consisting of a dynamic
locomotion planner, a reinforcement learning process for robustness, and a
novel whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC). Previous approaches specify
either the position or the timing of steps, however, the proposed locomotion
planner simultaneously computes both of these parameters as locomotion outputs.
Our locomotion strategy relies on devising a reinforcement learning (RL)
approach for robust walking. The learned policy generates multi step walking
patterns, and the process is quick enough to be suitable for real-time
controls. For learning, we devise an RL strategy that uses a phase space
planner (PSP) and a linear inverted pendulum model to make the problem
tractable and very fast. Then, the learned policy is used to provide goal-based
commands to the WBLC, which calculates the torque commands to be executed in
full-humanoid robots. The WBLC combines multiple prioritized tasks and
calculates the associated reaction forces based on practical inequality
constraints. The novel formulation includes efficient calculation of the time
derivatives of various Jacobians. This provides high-fidelity dynamic control
of fast motions. More specifically, we compute the time derivative of the
Jacobian for various tasks and the Jacobian of the centroidal momentum task by
utilizing Lie group operators and operational space dynamics respectively. The
integration of RL-PSP and the WBLC provides highly robust, versatile, and
practical locomotion including steering while walking and handling push
disturbances of up to 520 N during an interval of 0.1 sec. Theoretical and
numerical results are tested through a 3D physics-based simulation of the

using the formalism of large deviation statistics with spherical collapse
dynamics. This is achieved by relying on accurate analytical predictions for
the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and the two-point
clustering of spherically-averaged cosmic densities (sphere bias). Sphere bias
extends the idea of halo bias to intermediate density environments and voids as
underdense regions. In the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity, sphere bias
displays a strong scale dependence relevant for both high and low density
regions, which is predicted analytically. The statistics of densities in
spheres are built to model primordial non-Gaussianity via an initial skewness
with a scale-dependence that depends on the bispectrum of the underlying model.
The analytical formulas with the measured nonlinear dark matter variance as
input are successfully tested against numerical simulations. For local
non-Gaussianity with a range from $f_{\rm NL}=-100$ to $+100$ they are found to
agree within 2\% or better for densities $\rho\in[0.5,3]$ in spheres of radius
15 Mpc$/h$ down to $z=0.35$. The validity of the large deviation statistics
formalism is thereby established for all observationally relevant local-type
departures from perfectly Gaussian initial conditions. The corresponding
estimators for the amplitude of the nonlinear variance $\sigma_8$ and
primordial skewness $f_{\rm NL}$ are validated using a fiducial joint maximum
likelihood experiment. The influence of observational effects and the prospects
for a future detection of primordial non-Gaussianity from joint one- and
two-point densities-in-spheres statistics are discussed.

equations that the solution at each discretisation point depends on the
solutions at all other discretisation points. Therefore, it is impossible to
compute the solution only at one point, without calculating the solution at all
other points. The standard numerical methods like a conjugate gradient or Gauss
elimination compute the whole solution and/or the complete inverse operator. We
suggest a method which can compute the solution of the given partial
differential equation 1) at a point; 2) at few points; 3) on an interface; or a

required storage cost and computational resources will be lower as in the

innovation in filtering or the likelihood distribution, which measures the data
misfit (mismatch). Further, we can speed up the solution of the regression,

cubic computational cost to almost linear $\mathcal{O}(k^2n \log^2 n)$, where
$k\ll n$ and $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom.
  Up to the hierarchical matrix approximation error, the computed solution is

persistent memory through an adaptive learning process. The recursive unit
learns multi-level representations of the current state under different
receptive fields. The representations and the outputs from the previous memory
blocks are concatenated and sent to the gate unit, which adaptively controls
how much of the previous states should be reserved, and decides how much of the
current state should be stored. We apply MemNet to three image restoration
tasks, i.e., image denosing, super-resolution and JPEG deblocking.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the necessity of the MemNet and its
unanimous superiority on all three tasks over the state of the arts. Code is

on the number of circuits of size within 3/2 of the shortest circuit in a
regular matroid. This is the technical core of the paper and relies on a
variant of Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular matroids. It generalizes
an influential result by Karger on the number of minimum cuts in a graph to
regular matroids.

characterize the intrinsic dynamics between these two states. The
Mott-insulator is created in a quantum degenerate gas of 87-Rubidium atoms,
trapped in a three-dimensional optical lattice. The gas is located inside and
globally coupled to an optical cavity. This causes interactions of global
range, mediated by photons dispersively scattered between a transverse lattice
and the cavity. The scattering comes with an atomic density modulation, which
is measured by the photon flux leaking from the cavity. We initialize the
system in a Mott-insulating state and then rapidly increase the global coupling
strength. We observe that the system falls into either of two distinct final
states. One is characterized by a low photon flux, signaling a Mott insulator,
and the other is characterized by a high photon flux, which we associate with a
density wave. Ramping the global coupling slowly, we observe a hysteresis loop
between the two states - a further signature of metastability. A comparison
with a theoretical model confirms that the metastability originates in the
competition between short- and global-range interactions. From the increasing
photon flux monitored during the switching process, we find that several
thousand atoms tunnel to a neighboring site on the time scale of the single
particle dynamics. We argue that a density modulation, initially forming in the
compressible surface of the trapped gas, triggers an avalanche tunneling
process in the Mott-insulating region.

higher AGN fraction compared to the global cluster population, especially for

massive objects. We detected a smooth variation in the $F_{AGN}$ with local
stellar mass density for cluster objects, reaching a plateau in the field
environment. As a function of clustercentric distance we verify that $F_{AGN}$
is roughly constant for R $> $ R$_{200}$, but show a steep decline inwards. We
have also verified the dependence of the AGN population on cluster velocity
dispersion, finding a constant behavior for low mass systems ($\sigma_P
\lesssim 650-700$ km s$^{-1}$). However, there is a strong decline in $F_{AGN}$
for higher mass clusters ($>$ 700 km s$^{-1}$). When comparing the $F_{AGN}$ in
clusters with or without substructure we only find different results for
objects at large radii (R $> $ R$_{200}$), in the sense that clusters with
substructure present some excess in the AGN fraction. Finally, we have found
that the phase-space distribution of AGN cluster members is significantly
different than other populations. Due to the environmental dependence of
$F_{AGN}$ and their phase-space distribution we interpret AGN to be the result
of galaxy interactions, favored in environments where the relative velocities
are low, typical of the field, low mass groups or cluster outskirts.

stabilizer codes of arbitrary distance which satisfy a set of conditions and
uses fewer qubits than other schemes such as Shor, Steane and Knill error
correction. We give examples of infinite code families which satisfy these

a comparable stellar mass to those hosting a radio AGN but are unequivocally
powered by star formation. Hybrids, though selected as an intermediate
population in our classification scheme, were found in almost all analyses to
be a unique type of radio galaxies rather than a mixture of AGN and SFGs. They
are dominated by a high-excitation radio galaxy (HERG) population. We discuss
environmental effects and scenarios for each sub-class. AGN tend to be
preferentially located in locally dense environments and in the cores of

shown to escape the notorious fixed-point annihilation mechanism that renders

The theory exhibits an upper critical space-time dimension of four, enabling us

using the IRAM 30m and APEX telescopes. Radiative-transfer modeling of the
observed molecular features was performed to yield isotopic ratios for various
elements. Results: The spectra of CK Vul reveal a very rich molecular
environment of low excitation ($T_{\rm ex} \lesssim$12 K). Atomic carbon and
twenty seven different molecules, including two ions, were identified. They
range from simple diatomic to complex polyatomic species of up to 7 atoms
large. The chemical composition of the molecular gas is indicative of carbon
and nitrogen-driven chemistry but oxides are also present. Additionally, the
abundance of F may be enhanced. The spectra are rich in isotopologues that are
very rare in most known sources. All stable isotopes of C, N, O, Si, and S are
observed and their isotopic ratios are derived. Conclusions: The composition of
the remnant's molecular gas is most peculiar and gives rise to a very unique
millimeter and submillimeter spectrum. The observation of ions and complex
molecules suggests the presence of a photoionizing source but its nature (a
central star or shocks) remains unknown. The elemental and isotopic composition
of the gas cannot be easily reconciled with standard nucleosynthesis but
processing in hot CNO cycles and partial He burning can explain most of the
chemical peculiarities. The isotopic ratios of CK Vul are remarkably close to
those of presolar nova grains but the link of Nova 1670 to objects responsible

($b_+ > 1$) and let $K^2$ be the square of its canonical class. Building on
work of Khodorovskiy and Rana, we prove that if X develops a Wahl singularity
of length $\ell$ in a Q-Gorenstein degeneration, then $\ell \leq 4K^2 + 7$.
This improves on the current best-known upper bound due to Lee ($\ell \leq
400(K^2)^4$). Our bound follows from a stronger theorem constraining symplectic
embeddings of certain rational homology balls in surfaces of general type. In
particular, we show that if the rational homology ball $B_{p,1}$ embeds
symplectically in a quintic surface, then $p \leq 12$, partially answering the
symplectic version of a question of Kronheimer.

study, first, the fundamental concepts in Toric Algebraic Geometry. The
principal contribution of this work is the application of Hilbert basis (as one
realization of Theorem 3.9) for the resolution of singularities with toric
varieties, and a background in Lattice Polytope. In the second part we apply
this theorem to problems in statistical learning, principally in a recent area
as is the Singular Learning Theory. We define the singular machines and the
problem of Singular Learning through the computing of learning curves on these
statistical machines. We review and compile results on the work of S. Watanabe
in Singular Learning Theory, ref.; [17], [20], [21], also revising the
important result in [26], about almost the machines are singular, we formalize
this theory withtoric resolution morphism in a theorem proved here (Theorem

knowledge base completion, specifically, to learn which classes an entity is a
member of. We propose FIGMENT to tackle this problem. FIGMENT is embedding-
based and combines (i) a global model that scores based on aggregated
contextual information of an entity and (ii) a context model that first scores
the individual occurrences of an entity and then aggregates the scores. Each of
the two proposed models has some specific properties. For the global model,
learning high quality entity representations is crucial because it is the only
source used for the predictions. Therefore, we introduce representations using
name and contexts of entities on the three levels of entity, word, and
character. We show each has complementary information and a multi-level
representation is the best. For the context model, we need to use distant
supervision since the context-level labels are not available for entities.
Distant supervised labels are noisy and this harms the performance of models.
Therefore, we introduce and apply new algorithms for noise mitigation using
multi-instance learning. We show the effectiveness of our models in a large
entity typing dataset, built from Freebase.

technique. Great progress has been made parallelizing the expensive training
phase of an individual network, leading to highly specialized pieces of
hardware, many based on GPU-type architectures, and more concurrent algorithms
such as synthetic gradients. However, the training phase continues to be a
bottleneck, where the training data must be processed serially over thousands
of individual training runs. This work considers a multigrid reduction in time
(MGRIT) algorithm that is able to parallelize over the thousands of training
runs and converge to the exact same solution as traditional training would
provide. MGRIT was originally developed to provide parallelism for time
evolution problems that serially step through a finite number of time-steps.
This work recasts the training of a neural network similarly, treating neural
network training as an evolution equation that evolves the network weights from
one step to the next. Thus, this work concerns distributed computing approaches
for neural networks, but is distinct from other approaches which seek to
parallelize only over individual training runs. The work concludes with
supporting numerical results for two model problems.

the surface densities of gas and star formation, with the surface density of
stellar mass added as an extra parameter. We empirically investigate for the
first time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs)
follow the ESL. Here we consider the `global' law where surface densities are
averaged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at
the lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because
they are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Our sample
is drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the
largest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities
are determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates
are calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust
extinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using Spitzer
3.6 $\mu$m fluxes. All surface densities are calculated over stellar discs
defined by the 3.6 $\mu$m images. We find dIrrs indeed follow the extended
Schmidt law. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01
dex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the
original relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much
more deviant when compared to the `canonical' Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our
results help strengthen the universality of the extended Schmidt law,
especially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star
formation in which feedback from previous generations of stars set the pressure
in the ISM, are promising candidates for explaining the ESL. We also confirm
that ESL is an independent relation and not a form of a relation between star
formation efficiency and metallicity.

functional repertoire of a gene to the connectivity $k$ (i.e., the number of
interaction links) of the corresponding protein in the PPI network. On a set of
42 bacterial genomes of different sizes, and with reasonably separated
evolutionary trajectories, we investigate three issues: i) whether the
distribution of connectivities changes between PPI subnetworks of essential and
nonessential genes; ii) how gene conservation, measured both by the
evolutionary retention index (ERI) and by evolutionary pressures, is related to
the the connectivity of the corresponding protein; iii) how PPI connectivities
are modulated by evolutionary and functional relationships, as represented by
the Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs). We show that conservation,
essentiality and functional specialisation of genes constrain the connectivity
of the corresponding proteins in bacterial PPI networks. In particular, we
isolate a core of highly connected proteins (with connectivities $k\ge40$),
which is ubiquitous among the species considered here -- though mostly visible
in the degree distributions of bacteria with small genomes (less than 1000
genes). The genes that belong to this highly connected core are conserved,
essential and, in most cases, belong to the COG cluster J, related to ribosomal

resolution [C II] 158 micron and [N II] 205 micron fine structure line
observations taken with the upGREAT and GREAT instruments on SOFIA, along with
auxiliary HI and 13CO observations. The observations were in and out of the
Galactic plane along 18 lines of sight between longitude 30deg and 32deg. We
detect strong [N II] emission throughout the Scutum tangency. At VLSR = 110 to
125 km/s, where there is little, if any, 13CO, we could disentangle the [N II]
and [C II] emission that arises from the WIM at the inner edge. We find an
average electron density, <n(e)> about 0.9 cm{-3} in the plane, and about 0.4
cm{-3} above the plane. For VLSR < 110 km/s there is [N II] emission tracing
highly ionized gas throughout the arm's molecular layer. This ionized gas has a
high density, n(e) ~ 30 cm{-3}, and a few percent filling factor. Thus, [N II]
and [C II] at the Scutum arm tangency reveal a highly ionized gas with <n(e)>
about 10 to 20 times those of the interarm WIM, which is best explained by a
model in which the interarm WIM is compressed as it falls into the potential
well of the arm. The widespread distribution of [N II] in the molecular layers
shows that high density ionized gas is distributed throughout the Scutum arm.
The n(e) derived from [N II] for these molecular cloud regions are about 30
cm{-3}, and probably arise in the ionized boundary layers of clouds. This [N
II] emission from the ionized boundary layers is probably the result of the
shock compression of the WIM as it impacts the arm's neutral gas, but some
could arise from extended HII regions.

problem from mathematical physics. This yields a variety of theoretical tools
for efficiently computing boundary-aligned quad meshes, with provable
guarantees on the resulting mesh, such as the number of mesh defects and bounds
on the defect locations. The procedure for generating the quad mesh is to (i)
find a complex-valued ""representation"" field that minimizes the Ginzburg-Landau

into a boundary-aligned, smooth cross field, (iii) use separatrices of the

Ginzburg-Landau theory, we prove that this procedure can be used to produce a
cross field whose separatrices partition the domain into four sided regions. To
minimize the Ginzburg-Landau energy for the representation field, we use an

we demonstrate the method on a variety of test domains.

the problem of estimating the maximum cardinality of equiangular lines in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ --- a family of lines through
the origin such that the angle between any pair of them is the same. Denote by
$N_\alpha(n)$ the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with
angle $\arccos\alpha$. We establish the asymptotic formula $N_\alpha(n) =
c_\alpha n + O_\alpha(1)$ for every $\alpha \ge \frac{1}{1+2\lambda^*}$. In
particular, $N_{1/3}(n) = 2n+O(1)$ and $N_{1/5}(n), N_{1/(1+2\sqrt{2})}(n) =
\frac{3}{2}n+O(1)$. Besides we show that $N_\alpha(n) \le 1.49n + O_\alpha(1)$
for every $\alpha \neq \tfrac{1}{3}, \tfrac{1}{5}, \tfrac{1}{1+2\sqrt{2}}$,
which improves a recent result of Balla, Dr\""axler, Keevash and Sudakov.

default data structures. Yet selecting good defaults is hard. A mutable data
structure's workload is not known in advance, and it may shift over its
lifetime - e.g., between read-heavy and write-heavy, or from heavy contention
by multiple threads to single-threaded or low-frequency use. One idea is to
switch implementations adaptively, but it is nontrivial to switch the
implementation of a concurrent data structure at runtime. Performing the
transition requires a concurrent snapshot of data structure contents, which
normally demands special engineering in the data structure's design. However,
in this paper we identify and formalize an relevant property of lock-free
algorithms. Namely, lock-freedom is sufficient to guarantee that freezing
memory locations in an arbitrary order will result in a valid snapshot. Several
functional languages have data structures that freeze and thaw, transitioning
between mutable and immutable, such as Haskell vectors and Clojure transients,
but these enable only single-threaded writers. We generalize this approach to
augment an arbitrary lock-free data structure with the ability to gradually
freeze and optionally transition to a new representation. This augmentation
doesn't require changing the algorithm or code for the data structure, only
replacing its datatype for mutable references with a freezable variant. In this
paper, we present an algorithm for lifting plain to adaptive data and prove
that the resulting hybrid data structure is itself lock-free, linearizable, and
simulates the original. We also perform an empirical case study in the context
of heating up and cooling down concurrent maps.

exact ML solution is computationally intractable, we construct a
simulation-based lower bound on the error probability of ML detection.
Leveraging this lower bound, we perform extensive numerical experiments
demonstrating that SIW is, in most cases of interest, very close to optimal
with moderate phase noise. More importantly and perhaps surprisingly, such
near-ML performance can be achieved by applying only twice the nearest neighbor
detection algorithm. In this sense, our results reveal a striking fact: near-ML
detection of phase noise corrupted MIMO channels can be done as efficiently as
for conventional MIMO channels without phase noise.

to spanning. Matrix extreme points are the strongest type of extreme point
known to span matrix convex sets; however, they are not necessarily the

effective algebraic approach to investigate controllability of bilinear

governing the system dynamics to permutation multiplications on a symmetric
group, so that controllability and controllable submanifolds can be
characterized by permutation cycles. The method is further applicable to
characterize controllability of systems defined on undirected graphs, such as
multi-agent systems with controlled couplings between agents and Markov chains
with tunable transition rates between states, which in turn reveals a graph
representation of controllability through the graph connectivity.

El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate system. This model takes the form
of a delay differential equation and has been shown in previous work to be
capable of producing complicated dynamics, which is organised by resonances
between the external forcing and dynamics induced by feedback. For certain
parameter values, we observe in simulations the sudden disappearance of
(two-frequency dynamics on) tori. This can be explained by the folding of
invariant tori and their associated resonance tongues. It is known that two
smooth tori cannot simply meet and merge; they must actually break up in
complicated bifurcation scenarios that are organised within so-called resonance
bubbles first studied by Chenciner.
  We identify and analyse such a Chenciner bubble in order to understand the
dynamics at folds of tori. We conduct a bifurcation analysis of the Chenciner
bubble by means of continuation software and dedicated simulations, whereby
some bifurcations involve tori and are detected in appropriate two-dimensional
projections associated with Poincar\'e sections. We find close agreement
between the observed bifurcation structure in the Chenciner bubble and a
previously suggested theoretical picture. As far as we are aware, this is the
first time the bifurcation structure associated with a Chenciner bubble has
been analysed in a delay differential equation and, in fact, for a flow rather

the limit function is not necessarily constant. Our discussion goes beyond the
case of the stochastic control problem with infinite time horizon and discusses
also $V_\lambda$ given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of second order
which is not necessarily associated with a stochastic control problem. On the

film with a low residual resistivity of $\rho_0$ = 59 $\mu \Omega$ cm, we found
a zero-field dip in the magnetoresistance (MR) below 10 K, manifesting the weak
antilocalization (WAL) effect due to strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We have
analyzed the MR data by including the D'yakonov-Perel' spin-relaxation
mechanism in the WAL theory. We explain that the delocalized spin-down electron
subband states play a crucial role for facilitating marked SOC in clean LSMO.
Moreover, we find that the SOC strength and gate voltage tunability is similar
to that in the 2DEG at LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, indicating the presence
of an internal electric field near the LSMO/SrTiO$_3$ interface. In a control
measurement on a 5-nm thick high resistivity ($\rho_0$ = 280 $\mu \Omega$ cm)

flux function, for which we prove existence and uniqueness results. We also
approximate it by a smoothed, superlinearized version parameterized by

The proposed approach uses linear latent projections to estimate the joint

physics. The field is rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been

solar wind models. Two primary observational constraints on the models are (1)
the open field regions in the model should approximately correspond to coronal
holes observed in emission, and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in
the model should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In
this study, we calculate both MHD and PFSS solutions using fourteen different
magnetic maps produced from five different types of observatory magnetograms,
for the time period surrounding July, 2010. We have found that for all of the
model/map combinations, models that have coronal hole areas close to
observations underestimate the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely,
for models to match the interplanetary flux, the modeled open field regions are
larger than coronal holes observed in EUV emission. In an alternative approach,
we estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by
combining automatically detected coronal holes for Carrington rotation 2098
with observatory synoptic magnetic maps. This approach also underestimates the
interplanetary magnetic flux. Our results imply that either typical observatory
maps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux, or a significant portion of the
open magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark in EUV and
X-ray emission.

exchange information over wireless communication networks to ensure safe and
efficient operation. It is, however, challenging to ensure system safety and
efficiency as the wireless channels in VNS are often subject to state-dependent
deep fades where the data rate suffers a severe drop and changes as a function
of vehicle states. Such couplings between vehicle states and channel states in
VNS thereby invalidate the use of separation principle to design event-based
control strategies. By adopting a state-dependent fading channel model that was
proposed to capture the interaction between vehicle and channel states, this
paper presents a novel self-triggered scheme under which the VNS ensures
efficient use of communication bandwidth while preserving stochastic stability.
The novelty of the proposed scheme lies in its use of the state-dependent
fading channel model in the event design that enables an adaptive and effective
adjustment on transmission frequency in response to dynamic variations on
channel and vehicle states. Under the proposed self-triggered scheme, this
paper presents a novel source coding scheme that tracks vehicle's states with
performance guarantee in the presence of state-dependent fading channels. The
efficacy and advantages of the proposed scheme over other event-based
strategies are verified through both simulation and experimental results of a
leader-follower example.

proposed negative refraction can be realized with only two identical media. In
addition, asymmetric excitation with bidirectional total transmission is
observed in our PICM system. Therefore, a new way to realize negative
refraction is presented, with more properties than those in PT symmetric
systems.

example, they have been used in a range of domains ranging from modeling of
tumor growth, immune systems, molecules to models of social networks, crowds
and computer and mobile self-organizing networks. One reason for their success
is their intuitiveness and similarity to human cognition. However, with this
power of abstraction, in spite of being easily applicable to such a wide number
of domains, it is hard to validate agent-based models. In addition, building
valid and credible simulations is not just a challenging task but also a
crucial exercise to ensure that what we are modeling is, at some level of
abstraction, a model of our conceptual system; the system that we have in mind.
In this paper, we address this important area of validation of agent based
models by presenting a novel technique which has broad applicability and can be
applied to all kinds of agent-based models. We present a framework, where a
virtual overlay multi-agent system can be used to validate simulation models.
In addition, since agent-based models have been typically growing, in parallel,
in multiple domains, to cater for all of these, we present a new single
validation technique applicable to all agent based models. Our technique, which
allows for the validation of agent based simulations uses VOMAS: a Virtual
Overlay Multi-agent System. This overlay multi-agent system can comprise
various types of agents, which form an overlay on top of the agent based
simulation model that needs to be validated. Other than being able to watch and
log, each of these agents contains clearly defined constraints, which, if
violated, can be logged in real time. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show
its broad applicability in a wide variety of simulation models ranging from
social sciences to computer networks in spatial and non-spatial conceptual

largely unknown. Here we explore a large-scale dataset including $432$ million
information cascades with explicit records of spreading traces, spreading
behaviors, information content as well as user profiles. We find that the
structural complexity of information cascades is far beyond the previous
conjectures. We first propose a ten-dimensional metric to quantify the
structural characteristics of information cascades, reflecting cascade size,
silhouette, direction and activity aspects. We find that bimodal law governs
majority of the metrics, information flows in cascades have four directions,
and the self-loop number and average activity of cascades follows power law. We
then analyze the high-order structural patterns of information cascades.
Finally, we evaluate to what extent the structural features of information

some notable implications of structural patterns in information cascades. Our
discoveries also provide a foundation for the microscopic mechanisms for

significant impact on the calibration parameters of visual-inertial sensor
systems. Thus long-term operation of these systems cannot fully rely on factory
calibration. Since the observability of certain parameters is highly dependent
on the motion of the device, using short data segments at device initialization
may yield poor results. When such systems are additionally subject to energy
constraints, it is also infeasible to use full-batch approaches on a big
dataset and careful selection of the data is of high importance. In this paper,
we present a novel approach for resource efficient self-calibration of
visual-inertial sensor systems. This is achieved by casting the calibration as
a segment-based optimization problem that can be run on a small subset of
informative segments. Consequently, the computational burden is limited as only
a predefined number of segments is used. We also propose an efficient
information-theoretic selection to identify such informative motion segments.
In evaluations on a challenging dataset, we show our approach to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art in terms of computational burden while maintaining
a comparable accuracy.

which traces the protoplanetary disk. The disk is clearly resolved and shows a
Keplerian motion, from which the protostellar mass of HL Tau is estimated to be
1.8+/-0.3 M$_\odot$, assuming the inclination angle of the disk to be 47 deg
from the plane of the sky. The 13CO emission shows two arc structures with
sizes of 1000-2000 au and masses of 3E-3 M$_\odot$ connected to the central
disk. One is blueshifted and stretches from the northeast to the northwest, and
the other is redshifted and stretches from the southwest to the southeast. We
find that simple kinematical models of infalling and (counter-)rotating
flattened envelopes cannot fully explain the observed velocity patterns in the
arc structures. The gas kinematics of the arc structures can be better
explained with three-dimensional infalling or outflowing motions. Nevertheless,
the observed velocity in the northwestern part of the blueshifted arc structure
is ~60-70% higher than the expected free-fall velocity. We discuss two possible
origins of the arc structures: (1) infalling flows externally compressed by an
expanding shell driven by XZ Tau and (2) outflowing gas clumps caused by

given, as conformal infinity, a conformal manifold with boundary. The space on
which such an Einstein metric exists thus has a finite boundary in addition to
the usual infinite boundary and a corner where the two meet. On the finite
boundary a constant mean curvature umbilic condition is imposed. First, recent
work of Nozaki, Takayanagi, and Ugajin is generalized and extended showing that
such metrics cannot have smooth compactifications for generic corners embedded
in the infinite boundary. A model linear problem is then studied: a formal
expansion at the corner is derived for eigenfunctions of the scalar Laplacian
subject to certain boundary conditions. In doing so, scalar ODEs are studied
that are of relevance for a broader class of boundary value problems and also
for the Einstein problem. Next, unique formal existence at the corner, up to
order at least equal to the boundary dimension, of Einstein metrics in a
cornered asymptotically hyperbolic normal form which are polyhomogeneous in
polar coordinates is demonstrated for arbitrary smooth conformal infinity.
Finally it is shown that, in the special case that the finite boundary is taken
to be totally geodesic, there is an obstruction to existence beyond this order,
which defines a conformal hypersurface invariant.

vertical velocity and temperature is observed in the turbulent regime at almost
all the length scales. Frequency spectra of all the velocities and temperature
show a $-5/3$ law for a wide band of frequencies. The variances of horizontal
velocities at different points in the flow yield a single power-law.
Probability density functions of velocities and temperature are close to
Gaussian only at higher Rayleigh numbers. The mean and variance of temperature
clearly show boundary layers, surface layers and a near-homogeneous bulk
region. The boundary layer thickness decreases and bulk-homogeneity is enhanced
on increasing the Rayleigh numbers. The wave number spectra of the turbulent
kinetic energy exhibit Kolmogorov like ($E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$) and
Bolginao-Obukhov like ($E(k)\sim k^{-11/5}$) behaviour respectively in the
central and near-wall regions of the container. An approximate balance between
the production due to buoyancy and the dissipation is found in the turbulent
kinetic energy budget. Taylor's approximate equation of the production due to
turbulent stretching and the dissipation of turbulent enstrophy is modified by
the inclusion of buoyancy production in the enstrophy budget. The present
results support the previously proposed $2/7$ power-law dependence of the
average Nusselt number on the Rayleigh number by yielding an exponent of 0.272,

representation. The contribution of our paper is increased task discernment
when trajectories are similar but tools are different and require the robot to
adjust its pose for proper handling. Interaction ProMPs are used with an
augmented vector that integrates muscle activity. Augmented time-normalized
trajectories are used in training to learn correlation parameters and robot
motions are predicted by finding the best weight combination and temporal
scaling for a task. Collaborative single task scenarios with similar motions
but different objects were used and compared. For one experiment only joint
angles were recorded, for the other EMG signals were additionally integrated.
Task recognition was computed for both tasks. Observation state vectors with

tasks, while the baseline method failed every time. Integrating EMG signals
into collaborative tasks significantly increases the ability of the system to
recognize nuances in the tasks that are otherwise imperceptible, up to 74.6% in

assumptions of general relativity and some other gravity theories. In the
theory of parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN), the difference between the PPN
parameters $\gamma$ of different particles or the same type of particle with
different energies, $\Delta \gamma$, represents the violation of WEP. Current
constraints on $\Delta \gamma$ are derived from the observed time delay between
correlated particles of astronomical sources. However, the observed time delay
is contaminated by other effects, such as the time delays due to different
particle emission times, the potential Lorentz invariance violation and
none-zero photon rest mass. Therefore, current constraints are only upper
limits. Here we propose a new method to test WEP based on the fact that the
gravitational time delay is direction-dependent while others are not. This is
the first method which can naturally correct other time delay effects. Using
the time delay measurements of BASTE gamma-ray burst (GRB) sample and the
gravitational potential of local super galaxy cluster Laniakea, we find that
the constraint on $\Delta \gamma$ of different energy photons can be as low as
$10^{-14}$. In the future, if more gravitational wave events and fast radio
bursts with much more precise time delay measurements are observed, this method
can give a reliable and tight constraint on WEP.

show that the set of bidirectional gerrymanders form a convex polytope sitting
inside the unit cube, which we refer to as the bidirectional ballot polytope.
We prove that every $(2n-1)$-dimensional unit cube can be partitioned into
$2n-1$ isometric copies of the $(2n-1)$-dimensional bidirectional ballot
polytope. Furthermore, we show that the vertices of this polytope are all also
vertices of the cube, and that the vertices are in bijection with BBS's. An

  First we determine upper risk bounds for projection estimators on finite

the obtained rates of convergence turn out to be optimal.
  The main part of the paper is devoted to the construction of adaptive
projection estimators of $\lambda$ via model selection. We proceed in two
steps: first, we assume that an upper bound for $\Vert \lambda \Vert_\infty$ is
known. Under this assumption, we construct an adaptive estimator whose
dimension parameter is defined as the minimizer of a penalized contrast

optimal rate up to an additional logarithmic factor both in the independent and
the weakly dependent setup. Appropriate concentration inequalities for Poisson

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) aims to match facial images acquired
from different sensing modalities with mission-critical applications in
forensics, security and commercial sectors. However, HFR is a much more
challenging problem than traditional face recognition because of large
intra-class variations of heterogeneous face images and limited training
samples of cross-modality face image pairs. This paper proposes a novel
approach namely Wasserstein CNN (convolutional neural networks, or WCNN for
short) to learn invariant features between near-infrared and visual face images
(i.e. NIR-VIS face recognition). The low-level layers of WCNN are trained with
widely available face images in visual spectrum. The high-level layer is
divided into three parts, i.e., NIR layer, VIS layer and NIR-VIS shared layer.
The first two layers aims to learn modality-specific features and NIR-VIS
shared layer is designed to learn modality-invariant feature subspace.
Wasserstein distance is introduced into NIR-VIS shared layer to measure the
dissimilarity between heterogeneous feature distributions. So W-CNN learning
aims to achieve the minimization of Wasserstein distance between NIR
distribution and VIS distribution for invariant deep feature representation of
heterogeneous face images. To avoid the over-fitting problem on small-scale
heterogeneous face data, a correlation prior is introduced on the
fully-connected layers of WCNN network to reduce parameter space. This prior is
implemented by a low-rank constraint in an end-to-end network. The joint
formulation leads to an alternating minimization for deep feature
representation at training stage and an efficient computation for heterogeneous
data at testing stage. Extensive experiments on three challenging NIR-VIS face
recognition databases demonstrate the significant superiority of Wasserstein
CNN over state-of-the-art methods.

paper we target this phenomenon and introduce the first dataset created from
closed captions of YouTube product review videos as well as a new attention-RNN
model for aspect extraction and joint aspect extraction and sentiment
classification. Our model provides state-of-the-art performance on aspect
extraction without requiring the usage of hand-crafted features on the SemEval
ABSA corpus, while it outperforms the baseline on the joint task. In our
dataset, the attention-RNN model outperforms the baseline for both tasks, but
we observe important performance drops for all models in comparison to SemEval.
These results, as well as further experiments on domain adaptation for aspect
extraction, suggest that differences between speech and written text, which
have been discussed extensively in the literature, also extend to the domain of
product reviews, where they are relevant for fine-grained opinion mining.

self-driving. Most of the current solutions employ generic image parsing models
that treat all scales and locations in the images equally and do not consider
the geometry property of car-captured urban scene images. Thus, they suffer
from heterogeneous object scales caused by perspective projection of cameras on
actual scenes and inevitably encounter parsing failures on distant objects as
well as other boundary and recognition errors. In this work, we propose a new
FoveaNet model to fully exploit the perspective geometry of scene images and
address the common failures of generic parsing models. FoveaNet estimates the
perspective geometry of a scene image through a convolutional network which
integrates supportive evidence from contextual objects within the image. Based
on the perspective geometry information, FoveaNet ""undoes"" the camera
perspective projection analyzing regions in the space of the actual scene, and
thus provides much more reliable parsing results. Furthermore, to effectively
address the recognition errors, FoveaNet introduces a new dense CRFs model that
takes the perspective geometry as a prior potential. We evaluate FoveaNet on
two urban scene parsing datasets, Cityspaces and CamVid, which demonstrates
that FoveaNet can outperform all the well-established baselines and provide new
state-of-the-art performance.

for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed
connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at
multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected
in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic
linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which
represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for
inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the
covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about
the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely
coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via
$L^1$-minimization. In general, this method is suited to infer effective
connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method
is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network
size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters
affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on
the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics,
we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity
from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider
measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors.
Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable
estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on a fMRI dataset. The
resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as
well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. Also, we
found that a large fraction of identified connections were inhibitory.

Factor models are used to build portfolios to track indexes, together with

the number of securities in the portfolio. Restricting the number of securities
in the portfolio allows us to obtain a concentrated portfolio, reduce the risk

presented in this work, the 0-1 model is constructed by means of a piecewise
linear approximation. We also present a new quadratic combinatorial problem,
called a minimum edge-weighted clique problem, to obtain an equality weighted
cardinality constrained portfolio. A piecewise linear approximation for this
problem is presented in the context of a multi factor model. For a single
factor model, we present a fast heuristic, based on some theoretical results to
obtain an equality weighted cardinality constraint portfolio. The consideration

likely to reunite, and whether siblings function as regional attractors to each
other. Results show an intense regional migration of people to the capital
area. The migration propensity of individuals is high in early childhood and
peaks in early adulthood. About two thirds of Finnish children live in the same
region as their parents throughout their adult lives. Females show higher
propensity to migrate than males, since daughters move away from their parents
earlier and with a higher rate than sons do. The propensity for two full
sibling brothers to be in the same region is higher than that for other types
of sibling dyads. We conclude that family members serve as important

early evolutionary phase and then evolves to a negative pressure fluid in the
later phase. The equation of state is found to be stabilized with value $\omega

diagnostic shows that the present model is distinct from the standard

pointing out two key relations: the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev relation and the
Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov relation. The integrability is also exploited, through
the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, to compute the fluctuations of
the particles current, unrevealing connections with the theory of symmetric
polynomials (the Koornwinder polynomials in particular). Finally the last part
of the thesis deals with the hydrodynamic limit of the models, i.e when the
lattice spacing tends to zero and the number of particles tends to infinity.
The exact results obtained for a finite size system allow us to check the
validity of the predictions of the macroscopic fluctuations theory (concerning
the fluctuations of the current and the density profile in the stationary
state) and to extend the theory to systems with several species of particles.

ring R=K[[x1,...,xs]] that are finitely determined up to contact equivalence by
proving that this is the case if and only if I is an isolated complete
intersection singularity, provided dim(R/I) > 0 and K is an infinite field (of
arbitrary characteristic). Here two ideals I and J are contact equivalent if
the local K-algebras R/I and R/J are isomorphic. If I is minimally generated by
a1,...,am, we call I finitely contact determined if it is contact equivalent to
any ideal J that can be generated by b1,...,bm with ai - bi in <x1,...,xs>^k
for some integer k. We give also computable and semicontinuous determinacy
bounds.
  The above result is proved by considering left-right equivalence on the ring
M of m x n matrices A with entries in R and we show that the Fitting ideals of
a finitely determined matrix in M have maximal height, a result of independent
interest. The case of ideals is treated by considering 1-column matrices.
Fitting ideals together with a special construction are used to prove the
characterization of finite determinacy for ideals in R. Some results of this
paper are known in characteristic 0, but they need new (and more sophisticated)
arguments in positive characteristic partly because the tangent space to the
orbit of the left-right group cannot be described in the classical way. In
addition we point out several other oddities, including the concept of
specialization for power series, where the classical approach (due to Krull)
does not work anymore. We include some open problems and a conjecture.

evaluate their efficiency based on pairwise fashion. In our investigation, we
noticed that considering a pair of samples at a time and selecting the features

effectiveness of the proposed method with low sample size, which outperforms

the mass function by fitting the observed cluster X-ray luminosity distribution
from the REFLEX galaxy cluster survey to models of cosmological structure
formation. We marginalise over uncertainties in the cosmological parameters as
well as those of the relevant galaxy cluster scaling relations. The mass
function is determined with an uncertainty less than 10% in the mass range 3 x
10^12 to 5 x 10^14 M$_\odot$. For the cumulative mass function we find a slope
at the low mass end consistent with a value of -1, while the mass rich end
cut-off is milder than a Schechter function with an exponential term exp($-
M^\delta$) with $\delta$ smaller than 1. Changing the Hubble parameter in the
range $H_0 = 67 - 73 km s^-1 Mpc^{-1}$ or allowing the total neutrino mass to
have a value between 0 - 0.4 eV causes variations less than the uncertainties.
We estimate the fraction of mass locked up in galaxy clusters: about 4.4% of
the matter in the Universe is bound in clusters (inside $r_200$) with a mass
larger than 10^14 M$_\odot$ and 14% to clusters and groups with a mass larger
than 10^13 M$_\odot$ at the present Universe. We also discuss the evolution of

coupled to spin-polarized and superconducting reservoirs when voltage and
temperature biases are applied across the nanostructure. Due to the
particle-hole symmetry introduced by the superconducting (S) lead, the subgap
spin current vanishes identically. Nevertheless, the Andreev charge current
depends on the degree of polarization in the ferromagnetic (F) contact since
the shift of electrostatic internal potential of the conductor depends on spin
orientation of the charge carrier. This spin-dependent potential shift
characterizes nonlinear responses in our device. We show how the subgap current
versus the bias voltage or temperature difference depends on the lead
polarization in two cases, namely (i) S-dominant case, when the
dot-superconductor tunneling rate ($\Gamma_R$) is much higher than the
ferromagnet-dot tunnel coupling ($\Gamma_L$), and (ii) F-dominant case, when
$\Gamma_L\gg \Gamma_R$. For the ferromagnetic dominant case the spin-dependent
potential shows a nonmonotonic behavior as the dot level is detuned. Thus the
subgap current can also exhibit interesting behaviors such as current
rectification and the maximization of thermocurrents with smaller thermal
biases when the lead polarization and the quantum dot level are adjusted.

delineating the objects (object detection and semantic segmentation). This is
achieved by developing a novel Weakly Supervised Markov Random Field Stacked
Indian Buffet Process (WS-MRF-SIBP) that models objects and attributes as
latent factors and explicitly captures their correlations within and across
superpixels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
weakly supervised model significantly outperforms weakly supervised
alternatives and is often comparable with existing strongly supervised models
on a variety of tasks including semantic segmentation, automatic image
annotation and retrieval based on object-attribute associations.

optimal transport plans between point sets. It is particularly well-suited for
point sets that are in high-dimensions, but are close to being intrinsically
low-dimensional. The approach is based on an adaptive multiscale decomposition
of the point sets. The multiscale decomposition yields a sequence of optimal
transport problems, that are solved in a top-to-bottom fashion from the
coarsest to the finest scale. We provide numerical evidence that this
multiscale approach scales approximately linearly, in time and memory, in the
number of nodes, instead of quadratically or worse for a direct solution.
Empirically, the multiscale approach results in less than one percent relative
error in the objective function. Furthermore, the multiscale plans constructed
are of interest by themselves as they may be used to introduce novel features
and notions of distances between point sets. An analysis of sets of brain MRI
based on optimal transport distances illustrates the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a real world data set. The application demonstrates that
multiscale optimal transport distances have the potential to improve on
state-of-the-art metrics currently used in computational anatomy.

deficiency of the existing methods, that most of the decoders propagate
deterministic hidden states. Such complex uncertainty cannot be modeled
efficiently by the deterministic models. In this paper, we propose a generative

models the uncertainty observed in the data using latent stochastic variables.
Therefore, MS-RNN can improve the performance of video captioning, and generate
multiple sentences to describe a video considering different random factors.
Specifically, a multi-modal LSTM (M-LSTM) is first proposed to interact with
both visual and textual features to capture a high-level representation. Then,
a backward stochastic LSTM (S-LSTM) is proposed to support uncertainty
propagation by introducing latent variables. Experimental results on the

used to map template simu- lations to the specifications of a given radio
event. Our current approach slices the radio signal based on atmospheric depth
of origin and weights these slices based on a shower parameter such as electron
number or an effective dipole moment. One significant gain over the existing
Monte Carlo codes lies in the fact this makes the depth of the shower maximum a
direct input to the simulation where currently one has to pre-select showers
based on their random number seed. Such a model has great potential for heavily
simulation-based analysis methods, for example the LOFAR air shower
reconstruction. These techniques are severely limited by the available
computation time but have the lowest errors in real measurement applications.

temperature dependencies of these characteristics are mainly caused by thermal
vibration excitations of water dimers. In connection with this we determine
normal coordinates for the dimer vibrations. We investigate fluctuations of the
dipole moments of dimers in details and consider their contributions to the
dielectric permittivity of the water vapor. We also took into account the
contribution of the interparticle interactions on the heat capacity. Analyzing
the behavior of the effective polarizability and heat capacity we defined the
temperature dependence of the dimer concentration on the coexistence
vapor-liquid curve. The noticeable dimerization in the saturated water vapor
takes place only for temperatures T/Tc > 0.8 (Tc is the critical temperature).
It is important to note that the successful reproduction of the effective
polarizability and heat capacity can serve good test for the correct

have been proposed as a remedy to the problem of limited parking space because
they are able to satisfy the existing transportation demand with fewer shared

large-scale vehicle sharing on traffic patterns is not well understood. In this
work, we perform a simulation-based analysis of consequences of a hypothetical
deployment of a large-scale station-based mobility-on-demand system in Prague

the formation of congestion. We find that such a mobility-on-demand system

increase levels of congestion due to extra trips without passengers. In fact,
38% kilometers traveled in such an MoD system would be driven empty.

usually originate due to subpulse drifting. The nulling periodicities were more

time-fractional and time-non-fractional evolution equations as well as on
Chernoff approximations for the latter ones. Moreover, this method leads to
Feynman formulae for solutions of time-fractional evolution equations. To

solves PSC optimally (without sampling) for a special case. For large-scale

in public resources, in the real world only a small percentage of the
population have access to government assistance when there is an outbreak, and
most must rely on resources from family or friends. We study the dynamics of
disease spreading in social-contact multiplex networks when the recovery of
infected nodes depends on resources from healthy neighbors in the social layer.
We investigate how degree heterogeneity affects the spreading dynamics. Using
theoretical analysis and simulations we find that degree heterogeneity promotes
disease spreading. The phase transition of the infected density is hybrid and
increases smoothly from zero to a finite small value at the first invasion
threshold and then suddenly jumps at the second invasion threshold. We also
find a hysteresis loop in the transition of the infected density. We further
investigate how an overlap in the edges between two layers affects the
spreading dynamics. We find that when the amount of overlap is smaller than a
critical value the phase transition is hybrid and there is a hysteresis loop,
otherwise the phase transition is continuous and the hysteresis loop vanishes.
In addition, the edge overlap allows an epidemic outbreak when the transmission
rate is below the first invasion threshold, but suppresses any explosive
transition when the transmission rate is above the first invasion threshold.

used to train generative adversarial networks (GANs), have often been described
as being approximations of their nonparametric counterparts, such as the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, which can be derived under the so-called optimal
discriminator assumption. In this position paper, we argue that despite being
""non-optimal"", parametric divergences have distinct properties from their
nonparametric counterparts which can make them more suitable for learning
high-dimensional distributions. A key property is that parametric divergences
are only sensitive to certain aspects/moments of the distribution, which depend
on the architecture of the discriminator and the loss it was trained with. In
contrast, nonparametric divergences such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence are
sensitive to moments ignored by the discriminator, but they do not necessarily
correlate with sample quality (Theis et al., 2016). Similarly, we show that
mutual information can lead to unintuitive interpretations, and explore more
intuitive alternatives based on parametric divergences. We conclude that
parametric divergences are a flexible framework for defining statistical
quantities relevant to a specific modeling task.

code versions. This mechanism is used in mainstream runtime systems to support
adaptive and speculative optimizations by running code tailored to provide the
best expected performance for the actual workload. Current approaches either
restrict the program points where OSR can be fired or require complex
optimization-specific operations to realign the program's state during a
transition. The engineering effort to implement OSR and the lack of
abstractions make it rarely accessible to the research community, leaving
fundamental question regarding its flexibility largely unexplored.
  In this article we make a first step towards a provably sound abstract
framework for OSR. We show that compiler optimizations can be made OSR-aware in
isolation, and then safely composed. We identify a class of transformations,
which we call live-variable equivalent (LVE), that captures a natural property
of fundamental compiler optimizations, and devise an algorithm to automatically
generate the OSR machinery required for an LVE transition at arbitrary program
locations.
  We present an implementation of our ideas in LLVM and evaluate it against
prominent benchmarks, showing that bidirectional OSR transitions are possible
almost everywhere in the code in the presence of common, unhindered global
optimizations. We then discuss the end-to-end utility of our techniques in
source-level debugging of optimized code, showing how our algorithms can
provide novel building blocks for debuggers for both executables and managed
runtimes.

Unlike the original Camassa-Holm equation, the two Hamiltonians of the mCH
equation do not reduce to conserved integrals (constants of motion) for
$2$-peakon weak solutions. This perplexing situation is addressed here by
finding an explicit conserved integral for $N$-peakon weak solutions for all

Hamiltonian structure with the use of a natural Poisson bracket that arises
from reduction of one of the Hamiltonian structures of the mCH equation. But
when $N$ is odd, the Hamiltonian equations of motion arising from the conserved
integral using this Poisson bracket are found to differ from the dynamical
equations for the mCH $N$-peakon weak solutions. Moreover, the lack of
conservation of the two Hamiltonians of the mCH equation when they are reduced
to $2$-peakon weak solutions is shown to extend to $N$-peakon weak solutions

(NEGF) approach with density functional theory (DFT) we investigate branched
compounds containing ferrocene moieties in both branches which due to their
metal centers are designed to allow for asymmetry induced by local charging. In
these compounds the ferrocene moieties are connected to pyridyl anchor groups
either directly or via acetylenic spacers in a meta-connection where we also
compare our results with those obtained for the respective single-branched
molecules with both meta- and para-connections between the metal center and the
anchors. We find a destructive quantum interference (DQI) feature in the
transmission function slightly below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) which dominates the conductance even for the uncharged branched compound
with spacer groups inserted. In an analysis based on mapping the structural
characteristics of the range of molecules in our article onto tight-binding
models, we identify the structural source of the DQI minimum as the
through-space coupling between the pyridyl anchor groups. We also find that
local charging on one of the branches only changes the conductance by about one
order of magnitude which we explain in terms of the spatial distributions of
the relevant molecular orbitals for the branched compounds.

computing the energy-momentum tensors of the associated Einstein equations, to
include the backreaction, and setting them to zero, we solve the resulting

traditional textual-visual binary encoding methods only consider holistic image
representations and fail to model descriptive sentences. This renders existing
methods inappropriate to handle the rich semantics of informative cross-modal
data for quality textual-visual search tasks. To address the problem of hashing
cross-modal data with semantic-rich cues, in this paper, a novel integrated
deep architecture is developed to effectively encode the detailed semantics of
informative images and long descriptive sentences, named as Textual-Visual Deep
Binaries (TVDB). In particular, region-based convolutional networks with long
short-term memory units are introduced to fully explore image regional details
while semantic cues of sentences are modeled by a text convolutional network.
Additionally, we propose a stochastic batch-wise training routine, where
high-quality binary codes and deep encoding functions are efficiently optimized
in an alternating manner. Experiments are conducted on three multimedia
datasets, i.e. Microsoft COCO, IAPR TC-12, and INRIA Web Queries, where the
proposed TVDB model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binary coding
methods in the task of cross-modal retrieval.

base relations. We also discuss how the structure of the conditional

expected sensitivity recovers useful notions of probabilistic function
sensitivity, including stability of machine learning algorithms and convergence
of Markov chains.
  Furthermore, expected sensitivity satisfies clean compositional properties
and is amenable to formal verification. We develop a relational program logic

features two key ideas. First, relational pre-conditions and post-conditions
are expressed using distances, a real-valued generalization of typical
boolean-valued (relational) assertions. Second, judgments are interpreted in
terms of expectation coupling, a novel, quantitative generalization of
probabilistic couplings which supports compositional reasoning.

logics. Our main example formalizes uniform stability of the stochastic
gradient method. Furthermore, we prove rapid mixing for a probabilistic model

One type is that the agents are of the same high-order dynamics, and the
interconnection topologies of the information flow in different orders are
supposed to be different. It is proved that a heterogeneous-topology network is
controllable if and only if the first-order information topology is
leader-follower connected, and there exists a Laplacian matrix, which is a

the controllability between the agents and the whole network is also studied by
introducing the concept of eigenvector-uncontrollable. Different illustrative

explain the small but non-zero $\nu_{\ell}$ mass, using vector boson fusion
(VBF) processes at the 13 TeV LHC. In the context of the minimal Type-I seesaw
mechanism (mTISM), the VBF $\ell N_{\ell}$ production cross-section surpasses
that of the Drell-Yan process at approximately $m_{N_{\ell}} = 1.4$ TeV. We
consider $\mu N_{\mu}$ and $\tau N_{\tau}$ production through VBF processes
(e.g. $qq'\to \tau N_{\tau}qq'$), with subsequent $N_{\mu}$ and $N_{\tau}$
decays to $\mu jj$ and $\tau jj$, as benchmark cases to show the effectiveness
of the VBF topology for $N_{\ell}$ seaches at the 13 TeV LHC. The requirement
of a dilepton pair combined with four jets, two of which are identified as VBF
jets with large separation in pseudorapidity and a TeV scale dijet mass, is
effective at reducing the SM background. This criteria may provide expected
exclusion bounds, at 95\% confidence level, of $m_{N_{\ell}} < 1.7$ ($2.4$)
TeV, assuming $100$ (1000) fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data from the LHC and mixing
$|V_{\ell N_{\ell}}|^{2} = 1$. The use of the VBF topology to search for
$m_{N_{\ell}}$ increases the discovery reach at the LHC, with expected
significances greater than 5$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) for $N_{\ell}$ masses up to
1.7 (2.05) TeV using 1000 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data from the LHC.

  Retrieval","12 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",,,,"cs.MM cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-modal retrieval has drawn wide interest for retrieval across different
modalities of data. However, existing methods based on DNN face the challenge
of insufficient cross-modal training data, which limits the training
effectiveness and easily leads to overfitting. Transfer learning is for
relieving the problem of insufficient training data, but it mainly focuses on
knowledge transfer only from large-scale datasets as single-modal source domain
to single-modal target domain. Such large-scale single-modal datasets also
contain rich modal-independent semantic knowledge that can be shared across
different modalities. Besides, large-scale cross-modal datasets are very
labor-consuming to collect and label, so it is significant to fully exploit the
knowledge in single-modal datasets for boosting cross-modal retrieval. This
paper proposes modal-adversarial hybrid transfer network (MHTN), which to the
best of our knowledge is the first work to realize knowledge transfer from
single-modal source domain to cross-modal target domain, and learn cross-modal
common representation. It is an end-to-end architecture with two subnetworks:
(1) Modal-sharing knowledge transfer subnetwork is proposed to jointly transfer
knowledge from a large-scale single-modal dataset in source domain to all
modalities in target domain with a star network structure, which distills
modal-independent supplementary knowledge for promoting cross-modal common
representation learning. (2) Modal-adversarial semantic learning subnetwork is
proposed to construct an adversarial training mechanism between common
representation generator and modality discriminator, making the common
representation discriminative for semantics but indiscriminative for modalities
to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency during transfer process.
Comprehensive experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show its effectiveness and
generality.

reduction and characterization, where the generalized Hilbert-Huang represents
a way to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF) along
with a trend, and obtain instantaneous frequency data. Moreover, the HHT for an
FID signal's feature analysis is applied for the first time. First, acquiring
the actual untuned FID signal by a developed prototype of proton magnetometer,
and then the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is performed to decompose the
noise and original FID. Finally, the HHT is applied to the obtained IMFs to
extract the Hilbert energy spectrum, to indicate the energy distribution of the
signal on the frequency axis. By theory analysis and the testing of an actual
FID signal, the results show that, compared with general noise reduction
methods such as auto correlation and singular value decomposition (SVD),
combined with the proposed method can further suppress the interfered signals
effectively, and can obtain different components of FID signal, which can use
to identify the magnetic anomaly, the existence of groundwater etc. This is a
very important property since it can be exploited to separate the FID signal
from noise and to estimate exponential sequence parameters of FID signal.

allowing speculative execution by creating temporary files to avoid
interference between worker threads executing the same task and then renaming
these files. Rename is not a native object store operation; not only is it not
atomic, but it is implemented using a costly copy operation and a delete.
Instead our connector leverages the inherent atomicity of object creation, and
by avoiding the rename paradigm it greatly decreases the number of operations
on the object store as well as enabling a much simpler approach to dealing with
the eventually consistent semantics typical of object stores. We have
implemented Stocator and shared it in open source. Performance testing shows
that it is as much as 18 times faster for write intensive workloads and
performs as much as 30 times fewer operations on the object store than the
legacy Hadoop connectors, reducing costs both for the client and the object
storage service provider.

the power-law kappa-distributions and without magnetic field. The electrons and
ions have different kappa-parameters. We obtain the expressions of both
diffusion and mobility coefficients of electrons and ions respectively in the
plasma. We find that these new transport coefficient formulae depend strongly
on the kappa-parameters in the power-law distributed plasma. When we take kappa
to be infinite, these formulae reduce to the classical forms in the weakly
ionized plasma with a Maxwellian distribution.
