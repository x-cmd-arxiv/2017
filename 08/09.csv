examples of non-ferromagnetic states that exhibit a large anomalous Hall
effect. One is the chiral spin liquid compound Pr$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, which
exhibits a spontaneous Hall effect in a spin liquid state due to spin ice
correlation. The other is the chiral antiferromagnets Mn$_{3}$Sn and Mn$_{3}$Ge
that exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect at room temperature. The latter
shows a sign change of the anomalous Hall effect by a small change in the
magnetic field by a few 100 G, which should be useful for various applications.
We will discuss that the magnetic Weyl metal states are the origin for such a
large anomalous Hall effect observed in both the spin liquid and
antiferromagnet that possess almost no magnetization.

The produced protons are characterized by high-energies (with a broad
spectrum), are emitted in a very directional manner, and the process is
associated to relaxed laser (no need for high-contrast) and target (no need for
ultra-thin or expensive targets) constraints. As such, this process appears
quite effective compared to the standard and commonly used Target Normal Sheath
Acceleration technique (TNSA), or more exploratory mechanisms like Radiation
Pressure Acceleration (RPA). The data are underpinned by 3D numerical
simulations which suggest that in these conditions Low Density Collisionless
Shock Acceleration (LDCSA) is at play, which combines an initial Collisionless
Shock Acceleration (CSA) to a boost procured by a TNSA-like sheath field in the
downward density ramp of the target, which leads to an overall broad spectrum.
Experiments performed at 10^20 W/cm^2 laser intensity show that LDCSA can
accelerate, from ~1% critical density, mm-scale targets, up to 5x10^9
protons/MeV/sr/J with energies up to 45(+/- 5) MeV in a collimated (~6$^\circ$

published results for a portion of our sample. The distribution of [Fe/H] in
our sample is consistent with that typical of the Solar neighborhood.
Additionally, we find the ages of most of our sample are $< 500 Myrs$, but note
that we cannot determine robust ages from significantly older stars via
chromospheric activity age indicators. The future meta-analysis of the

with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem. The main
intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in
the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at
covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the mode collapse and delivering
state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation is able to establish among a
classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with
GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same
distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether
samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies
which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that
internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them
will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a
probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture GAN (MGAN). We develop
theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators' distributions and the
empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators'
distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapse. By
utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost
to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale
datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural
image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior
performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over
latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at
different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects

obstacle to be removed. A large fraction of the research effort in designing
superconducting circuits has focused on noise reduction, with great success, as
coherence times have increased by four orders of magnitude in the past two
decades. However, noise and dissipation can never be fully eliminated, and
further, a rapidly growing body of theoretical and experimental work has shown
that carefully tuned noise, in the form of engineered dissipation, can be a
profoundly useful tool in designing and operating quantum circuits. In this
article, I review important applications of engineered dissipation, including
state generation, state stabilization, and autonomous quantum error correction,
where engineered dissipation can mitigate the effect of intrinsic noise,
reducing logical error rates in quantum information processing. Further, I
provide a pedagogical review of the basic noise processes in superconducting
qubits (photon loss and phase noise), and argue that any dissipative mechanism
which can correct photon loss errors is very likely to automatically suppress
dephasing. I also discuss applications for quantum simulation, and possible
future research directions.

  with the respiratory syncytial virus",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: While RSV circulation results in high burden of hospitalization,
particularly among infants, young children and the elderly, little is known
about the role of different age groups in propagating annual RSV epidemics in
the community.
  Methods: During a communicable disease outbreak, some subpopulations may play
a disproportionate role during the outbreak's ascent due to increased
susceptibility and/or contact rates. Such subpopulations can be identified by
considering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all
cases in the population occurring before (Bp) and after the epidemic peak (Ap)
to calculate the subpopulation's relative risk, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for
several age groups using data on RSV hospitalizations in the US between
2001-2012 from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).
  Results: Children aged 3-4y and 5-6y each had the highest RR estimate for
5/11 seasons in the data, with RSV hospitalization rates in infants being
generally higher during seasons when children aged 5-6y had the highest RR
estimates. Children aged 2y had the highest RR estimate during one season. RR
estimates in infants and individuals aged 11y and older were mostly lower than
in children aged 1-10y.
  Conclusions: The RR estimates suggest that preschool and young school-age
children have the leading relative roles during RSV epidemics. We hope that
those results will aid in the design of RSV vaccination policies.

pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted

reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal
stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates
with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we
demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions - roughly 20 times on

that their associated coalgebras are an instance of the general construction of

directed restriction species that subsume Schmitt's restriction species and
also induce decomposition spaces. Whereas ordinary restriction species are
presheaves on the category of finite sets and injections, directed restriction
species are presheaves on the category of finite posets and convex maps. We
also introduce the notion of monoidal (directed) restriction species, which
induce monoidal decomposition spaces and hence bialgebras, most often Hopf
algebras. Examples of this notion include rooted forests, directed graphs,
posets, double posets, and many related structures. A prominent instance of a
resulting incidence bialgebra is the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of
rooted trees. Both ordinary and directed restriction species are shown to be
examples of a construction of decomposition spaces from certain cocartesian
fibrations over the category of finite ordinals that are also cartesian over
convex maps. The proofs rely on some beautiful simplicial combinatorics, where
the notion of convexity plays a key role. The methods developed are of
independent interest as techniques for constructing decomposition spaces.

and accurate way? Random walk with restart (RWR) is a popular measure for this
purpose and has been exploited in numerous data mining applications including
ranking, anomaly detection, link prediction, and community detection. However,
previous methods for computing exact RWR require prohibitive storage sizes and
computational costs, and alternative methods which avoid such costs by
computing approximate RWR have limited accuracy. In this paper, we propose TPA,
a fast, scalable, and highly accurate method for computing approximate RWR on
large graphs. TPA exploits two important properties in RWR: 1) nodes close to a
seed node are likely to be revisited in following steps due to block-wise
structure of many real-world graphs, and 2) RWR scores of nodes which reside
far from the seed node are proportional to their PageRank scores. Based on
these two properties, TPA divides approximate RWR problem into two subproblems
called neighbor approximation and stranger approximation. In the neighbor
approximation, TPA estimates RWR scores of nodes close to the seed based on
scores of few early steps from the seed. In the stranger approximation, TPA
estimates RWR scores for nodes far from the seed using their PageRank. The
stranger and neighbor approximations are conducted in the preprocessing phase
and the online phase, respectively. Through extensive experiments, we show that
TPA requires up to 3.5x less time with up to 40x less memory space than other
state-of-the-art methods for the preprocessing phase. In the online phase, TPA
computes approximate RWR up to 30x faster than existing methods while
maintaining high accuracy.

resolved images of Sgr A*, the source associated with the Galactic Center black
hole. Because Sgr A* varies on timescales short compared to an EHT observing
campaign, it is interesting to ask whether variability contains information
about the structure and dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper, we
introduce ""time-domain filtering"", a technique to filter time fluctuating
images with specific temporal frequency ranges, and demonstrate the power and
usage of the technique by applying it to mock millimeter wavelength images of
Sgr A*. The mock image data is generated from General Relativistic
Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation and general relativistic ray-tracing
method. We show that the variability on each line of sight is tightly
correlated with a typical radius of emission. This is because disk emissivity
fluctuates on a timescale of order the local orbital period. Time-domain
filtered images therefore reflect the model dependent emission radius
distribution, which is not accessible in time-averaged images. We show that, in
principle, filtered data have the power to distinguish between models with
different black hole spins, different disk viewing angles, and different disk
orientations in the sky.

that superfluid condensate affects the part of the Berry phase not accounted

distributions in machine learning, coding theory, and statistical physics.
Several computational problems, such as computing marginals and partition
functions, arise naturally when working with factor graphs. Belief propagation
is a widely deployed iterative method for solving these problems. However,
despite its significant empirical success, not much is known about the
correctness and efficiency of belief propagation.
  Bethe approximation is an optimization-based framework for approximating
partition functions. While it is known that the stationary points of the Bethe
approximation coincide with the fixed points of belief propagation, in general,
the relation between the Bethe approximation and the partition function is not
well understood. It has been observed that for a few classes of factor graphs,
the Bethe approximation always gives a lower bound to the partition function,
which distinguishes them from the general case, where neither a lower bound,
nor an upper bound holds universally. This has been rigorously proved for
permanents and for attractive graphical models.
  Here we consider bipartite normal factor graphs and show that if the local
constraints satisfy a certain analytic property, the Bethe approximation is a
lower bound to the partition function. We arrive at this result by viewing
factor graphs through the lens of polynomials. In this process, we reformulate
the Bethe approximation as a polynomial optimization problem. Our sufficient
condition for the lower bound property to hold is inspired by recent
developments in the theory of real stable polynomials. We believe that this way
of viewing factor graphs and its connection to real stability might lead to a
better understanding of belief propagation and factor graphs in general.

they are described by a universal hadronic parameter that also appears for

results is that one can obtain $m_t$ in a short distance scheme by fitting the
hadron level jet mass distributions, predicted by our factorization formula, to

selected from the TiNy Titans survey. The H$\alpha$ emission is widespread and
corresponds to a total unobscured star formation rate (SFR) of 0.44 M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, 2.7 times higher than the SFR inferred from SDSS data. The implied
specific SFR (sSFR) for the system is elevated by more than an order of
magnitude above non-interacting dwarfs in the same mass range. This increase is
dominated by the lower-mass galaxy, which has a sSFR enhancement of $>$ 50.
Examining the spatially-resolved maps of classic optical line diagnostics, we
find the ISM excitation can be fully explained by star formation. The velocity
field of the ionized gas is not consistent with simple rotation. Dynamical
simulations indicate that the irregular velocity field and the stellar
structure is consistent with the identification of this system as an ongoing
interaction between two dwarf galaxies. The widespread, clumpy enhancements in
star formation in this system point to important differences in the effect of
mergers on dwarf galaxies, compared to massive galaxies: rather than the
funneling of gas to the nucleus and giving rise to a nuclear starburst,
starbursts in low-mass galaxy mergers may be triggered by large-scale ISM
compression, and thus be more distributed.

cosmological studies because the cluster mass determination becomes more
challenging. Thus, we need to understand the cluster properties of our samples
to reduce possible biases. This is complicated by the fact that different
experiments may detect different cluster populations. For example, SZ selected
cluster samples have been found to include a greater fraction of disturbed
systems than X-ray selected samples. In this paper we determined eight
morphological parameters for the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ESZ) objects
observed with XMM-Newton. We found that two parameters, concentration and
centroid-shift, are the best to distinguish between relaxed and disturbed
systems. For each parameter we provide the values that allow one to select the
most relaxed or most disturbed objects from a sample. We found that there is no

dispersion is roughly consistent with what is observed for M dwarfs, decreases

predominately depend on the star-formation history. Since this trend is due to
brown dwarf cooling, we expect the velocity dispersion as a function of

disk models, and present similar trends in disk thickness as a function of
spectral type. We suggest that future, wide-field photometric and/or

activity is linked to changes in the inner disk, and show that, at least in
some cases, the disk growth process is asymmetrical. Observational evidence of
Be star disks both growing and clearing from the inside out is presented. The
duration of disk buildup and dissipation phases are measured for 70 outbursts,
and we find that the average outburst takes about twice as long to dissipate as
it does to build up in optical photometry. Our analysis hints that dissipation
of the inner disk occurs relatively slowly for late-type Be stars.

evolving in time problems that have two components that have very different
time scales. Where the SSP property is needed, it has been shown that implicit
and implicit-explicit methods have very restrictive time-steps and are
therefore not efficient. For this reason, SSP integrating factor methods may
offer an attractive alternative to traditional time-stepping methods for
problems with a linear component that is stiff and a nonlinear component that
is not. However, the strong stability properties of integrating factor
Runge-Kutta methods have not been established. In this work we show that it is
possible to define explicit integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods that
preserve the desired strong stability properties satisfied by each of the two
components when coupled with forward Euler time-stepping, or even given weaker
conditions. We define sufficient conditions for an explicit integrating factor
Runge--Kutta method to be SSP, namely that they are based on explicit SSP
Runge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing abscissas. We find such methods of up
to fourth order and up to ten stages, analyze their SSP coefficients, and prove
their optimality in a few cases. We test these methods to demonstrate their
convergence and to show that the SSP time-step predicted by the theory is
generally sharp, and that the non-decreasing abscissa condition is needed in
our test cases. Finally, we show that on typical total variation diminishing
linear and nonlinear test-cases our new explicit SSP integrating factor
Runge-Kutta methods out-perform the corresponding explicit SSP Runge-Kutta
methods, implicit-explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods, and some well-known
exponential time differencing methods.

very large number of samples to achieve good performance. Model-based
algorithms, in principle, can provide for much more efficient learning, but
have proven difficult to extend to expressive, high-capacity models such as
deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that medium-sized neural
network models can in fact be combined with model predictive control (MPC) to
achieve excellent sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning
algorithm, producing stable and plausible gaits to accomplish various complex
locomotion tasks. We also propose using deep neural network dynamics models to
initialize a model-free learner, in order to combine the sample efficiency of
model-based approaches with the high task-specific performance of model-free
methods. We empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo locomotion tasks that our pure
model-based approach trained on just random action data can follow arbitrary
trajectories with excellent sample efficiency, and that our hybrid algorithm
can accelerate model-free learning on high-speed benchmark tasks, achieving
sample efficiency gains of 3-5x on swimmer, cheetah, hopper, and ant agents.

  Pseudolikelihood Estimation and the Parametric Bootstrap",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growth of interest in network data across fields, the Exponential
Random Graph Model (ERGM) has emerged as the leading approach to the
statistical analysis of network data. ERGM parameter estimation requires the
approximation of an intractable normalizing constant. Simulation methods
represent the state-of-the-art approach to approximating the normalizing
constant, leading to estimation by Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMLE).
MCMLE is accurate when a large sample of networks is used to approximate the
normalizing constant. However, MCMLE is computationally expensive, and may be
prohibitively so if the size of the network is on the order of 1,000 nodes
(i.e., one million potential ties) or greater. When the network is large, one
option is maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE). The standard MPLE is
simple and fast, but generally underestimates standard errors. We show that a
resampling method---the parametric bootstrap---results in accurate coverage
probabilities for confidence intervals. We find that bootstrapped MPLE can be
run in 1/5th the time of MCMLE. We study the relative performance of MCMLE and
MPLE with simulation studies, and illustrate the two different approaches by
applying them to a network of bills introduced in the United State Senate.

network constructed solely of deterministic spiking neurons. In contrast to
previous investigations that were based on a spike rate model of the neuron,
the control signal here is determined by the precise temporal positions of
spikes generated by the output neurons of the network. We model the problem
formally as a hybrid dynamical system comprised of a closed loop between a
plant and a spiking neuron network. We derive a novel synaptic weight update
rule via which the spiking neuron network controller learns to hold process
variables at desired set points. The controller achieves its learning objective
based solely on access to the plant's process variables and their derivatives
with respect to changing control signals; in particular, it requires no
internal model of the plant. We demonstrate the efficacy of the rule by
applying it to the classical control problem of the cart-pole (inverted
pendulum) and a model of fish locomotion. Experiments show that the proposed
controller has a stability region comparable to a traditional PID controller,
its trajectories differ qualitatively from those of a PID controller, and in
many instances the controller achieves its objective using very sparse spike
train outputs.

establish, by building on the fundamental work of Frantzikinakis and Host
[13,14], a structure theorem which gives a decomposition of $\mathbb{1}_E$ into
an almost periodic and a pseudo-random parts. Using this structure theorem
together with the technique developed by the authors in [3], we obtain the
following result pertaining to polynomial multiple recurrence.
  Let $E=\{n_1<n_2<\ldots\}$ be a level set of an arbitrary multiplicative
function with positive density. Then the following are equivalent:
  - $E$ is divisible, i.e. the upper density of the set $E\cap u\mathbb{N}$ is
positive for all $u\in\mathbb{N}$;
  - $E$ is an averaging set of polynomial multiple recurrence, i.e. for all
measure preserving systems $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$, all $A\in\mathcal{B}$ with
$\mu(A)>0$, all $\ell\geq 1$ and all polynomials $p_i\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$,
$i=1,\ldots,\ell$, with $p_i(0)=0$ we have $$
\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \mu\big(A\cap
T^{-p_1(n_j)}A\cap\ldots\cap T^{-p_\ell(n_j)}A\big)>0. $$
  We also show that if a level set $E$ of a multiplicative function has
positive upper density, then any self-shift $E-r$, $r\in E$, is a set of
averaging polynomial multiple recurrence. This in turn leads to the following
refinement of the polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem (cf. [4]).
  Let $E$ be a level set of an arbitrary multiplicative function, suppose $E$
has positive upper density and let $r\in E$. Then for any set $D\subset
\mathbb{N}$ with positive upper density and any polynomials
$p_i\in\mathbb{Q}[t]$, $i=1,\ldots,\ell$, which satisfy
$p_i(\mathbb{Z})\subset\mathbb{Z}$ and $p_i(0)=0$ for all
$i\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$, there exists $\beta>0$ such that the set $$
\left\{\,n\in E-r:\overline{d}\Big(D\cap (D-p_1(n))\cap \ldots\cap(D-p_\ell(n))
\Big)>\beta \,\right\} $$ has positive lower density.

their fascinating and technologically relevant properties. Their
functionalities can be often tailored by the interlayer stacking pattern.
Low-frequency (LF) Raman spectroscopy provides a quick, non-destructive and
inexpensive optical technique for stacking characterization, since the
intensities of LF interlayer vibrational modes are sensitive to the details of
the stacking. A simple and generalized interlayer bond polarizability model is
proposed here to explain and predict how the LF Raman intensities depend on
complex stacking sequences for any thickness in a broad array of 2D materials,
including graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, NbSe2, Bi2Se3, GaSe, h-BN, etc. Additionally,
a general strategy is proposed to unify the stacking nomenclature for these 2D
materials. Our model reveals the fundamental mechanism of LF Raman response to
the stacking, and provides general rules for stacking identification.

by scattering of radiation. We introduce a time dependent, special relativistic
code which dynamically couples Monte Carlo radiative transfer to the flow
hydrodynamics. The code also self-consistently implements electron-positron
pair production and annihilation. We simulate shocks with properties relevant
for GRBs and study the steady-state solutions, which are accurate deep below
the jet photosphere. The shock generates a power-law photon spectrum through
the first-order Fermi mechanism, extending upwards from the typical upstream
photon energy. Strong shocks (for which the downstream pressure is much larger
than the upstream pressure) have rising $\nu F_\nu$ shock spectra. The spectrum
extends up to $\epsilon_{max} \equiv E_{max}/m_e c^2 \sim v^2$ for
non-relativistic shocks, where $m_e$ is the electron rest mass and $v$ is the
relative speed between the upstream and downstream in units of the speed of
light $c$. For mildly relativistic shocks the power law softens at $\epsilon
\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ due to Klein-Nishina effects, and shocks with $v\gamma \gtrsim
1$, where $\gamma \equiv (1-v^2)^{-1/2}$, produce electron-positron pairs. As
an example, a strong shock with $v\gamma = 3$ and a photon-to-proton ratio of
$n_\gamma/n_p = 2 \times 10^5$ has a peak pair-to-proton ratio of $Z_\pm
\approx 225$. The main effect of pairs in a steady-state shock is to decrease
its spatial width by a factor of $\sim Z_\pm$. The post-shock spectrum
thermalizes in the downstream. In absence of emission and absorption processes,
kinetic equilibrium at temperature $\theta_d \equiv kT_d/m_e c^2 \approx
\epsilon_d/3$ is reached at an optical depth of $\tau \gg \theta_d^{-1}$ behind
the shock, where $\epsilon_d$ is the average downstream photon energy.

of increasing number of statistics (stat) and event metrics in big data system.
In this paper, I propose an automatic DBMS diagnosis system that detects
anomaly periods with abnormal DB stat metrics and finds causal events in the
periods. Reconstruction error from deep autoencoder and statistical process
control approach are applied to detect time period with anomalies. Related
events are found using time series similarity measures between events and
abnormal stat metrics. After training deep autoencoder with DBMS metric data,
efficacy of anomaly detection is investigated from other DBMSs containing
anomalies. Experiment results show effectiveness of proposed model, especially,
batch temporal normalization layer. Proposed model is used for publishing
automatic DBMS diagnosis reports in order to determine DBMS configuration and
SQL tuning.

with so-called $R$-positive recurrent kernels. If kernel $M$ is $R$-positive
recurrent, then the main result determines the limit of the scaled kernel
iterations $R^nM^n$ as $n\to\infty$. In the Nummelin's monograph this important
result is proven using a regeneration method whose major focus is on $M$ having
an atom. In the special case when $M=P$ is a stochastic kernel with an atom,
the regeneration method has an elegant explaination in terms of an associated
split chain.
  In this paper we give a new probabilistic interpretation of the general
regeneration method in terms of multi-type Galton-Watson processes producing
clusters of particles. Treating clusters as macro-individuals, we arrive at a
single-type Crump-Mode-Jagers process with a naturally embedded renewal
structure.

Recognizing the fast evolution of the field of deep learning, we make no
attempt to capture the design space of all possible model architectures in a
domain- specific language (DSL) or similar configuration language. We allow
users to write code to define their models, but provide abstractions that guide
develop- ers to write models in ways conducive to productionization. We also
provide a unifying Estimator interface, making it possible to write downstream
infrastructure (e.g. distributed training, hyperparameter tuning) independent
of the model implementation. We balance the competing demands for flexibility
and simplicity by offering APIs at different levels of abstraction, making
common model architectures available out of the box, while providing a library
of utilities designed to speed up experimentation with model architectures. To
make out of the box models flexible and usable across a wide range of problems,
these canned Estimators are parameterized not only over traditional
hyperparameters, but also using feature columns, a declarative specification
describing how to interpret input data. We discuss our experience in using this
framework in re- search and production environments, and show the impact on
code health, maintainability, and development speed.

implemented using the Spark distributed computing engine and deployed on three
different processing units: an in-house server, in-house high performance

learning problem: An unknown element $x \in X$ is chosen uniformly at random. A
learner tries to learn $x$ from a stream of samples, $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2)
\ldots$, where for every $i$, $a_i \in A$ is chosen uniformly at random and
$b_i = M(a_i,x)$.
  Assume that $k,\ell, r$ are such that any submatrix of $M$ of at least
$2^{-k} \cdot |A|$ rows and at least $2^{-\ell} \cdot |X|$ columns, has a bias
of at most $2^{-r}$. We show that any learning algorithm for the learning
problem corresponding to $M$ requires either a memory of size at least
$\Omega\left(k \cdot \ell \right)$, or at least $2^{\Omega(r)}$ samples. The
result holds even if the learner has an exponentially small success probability
(of $2^{-\Omega(r)}$).
  In particular, this shows that for a large class of learning problems, any
learning algorithm requires either a memory of size at least $\Omega\left((\log
|X|) \cdot (\log |A|)\right)$ or an exponential number of samples, achieving a
tight $\Omega\left((\log |X|) \cdot (\log |A|)\right)$ lower bound on the size
of the memory, rather than a bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left\{(\log
|X|)^2,(\log |A|)^2\right\}\right)$ obtained in previous works [R17,MM17b].
  Moreover, our result implies all previous memory-samples lower bounds, as
well as a number of new applications.
  Our proof builds on [R17] that gave a general technique for proving
memory-samples lower bounds.

Manifold calculus, due to Goodwillie and Weiss, is a calculus of functors
suitable for studying contravariant functors (cofunctors) F: O(M)--> Top from
O(M) to the category of spaces. Weiss showed that polynomial cofunctors of
degree <= k are determined by their values on O_k(M), where O_k(M) is the full
subposet of O(M) whose objects are open subsets diffeomorphic to the disjoint

cutpoints applied a posteriori to phylogenetic estimates. Although in practice,
Bayesian and bootstrap-based clustering tend to lead to similar estimates, they
often produce conflicting measures of confidence in clusters. The current study
proposes a new Bayesian phylogenetic clustering algorithm, which we refer to as
DM-PhyClus, that identifies sets of sequences resulting from quick transmission
chains, thus yielding easily-interpretable clusters, without using any ad hoc
distance or confidence requirement. Results. Simulations reveal that DM-PhyClus
can outperform conventional clustering methods, as well as the Gap procedure, a
pure distance-based algorithm, in terms of mean cluster recovery. We apply
DM-PhyClus to a sample of real HIV-1 sequences, producing a set of clusters
whose inference is in line with the conclusions of a previous thorough
analysis. Conclusions. DM-PhyClus, by eliminating the need for cutpoints and
producing sensible inference for cluster configurations, can facilitate
transmission cluster detection. Future efforts to reduce incidence of
infectious diseases, like HIV-1, will need reliable estimates of transmission
clusters. It follows that algorithms like DM-PhyClus could serve to better
inform public health strategies.

charmonium that we model accordingly. We construct the ratio $R_\gamma$, akin
to $R_K$ and likewise sensitive to lepton-universality violation. Provided the
two rates in this ratio are integrated in a suitable region that minimises
bremsstrahlung contributions while maximising statistics, the ratio is very
close to unity and the form-factor dependence cancels to an extent that makes
it a new valuable probe of lepton-universality violating contributions in the
effective Hamiltonian. We finally speculate on additional ideas to extract
short-distance information from resonance regions, which are theoretically
interesting but statistically limited at present.

through the associated electron sheath can dramatically increase the ionization
rate of neutrals near the electrode surface. It has previously been observed
that if the ionization rate is great enough, a double layer separates a
luminous high-potential plasma attached to the electrode surface (called an
anode spot or fireball) from the bulk plasma. Here, results of the first 2D
particle-in-cell simulations of anode spot formation are presented along with a
theoretical model describing the formation process. It is found that ionization
leads to the buildup of an ion-rich layer adjacent to the electrode, forming a
narrow potential well near the electrode surface that traps electrons born from
ionization. Anode spot onset occurs when a quasineutral region is established
in the potential well and the density in this region becomes large enough to
violate the steady-state Langmuir condition, which is a balance between
electron and ion fluxes across the double layer. A model for steady-state
properties of the anode spot is also presented, which predicts values for the
anode spot size, double layer potential drop, and form of the sheath at the
electrode by considering particle, power, and current balance. These

expensive functions. The construction of accurate surrogate models with large
numbers of independent variables is currently prohibitive because it requires a
large number of function evaluations. Gradient-enhanced kriging has the
potential to reduce the number of function evaluations for the desired accuracy
when efficient gradient computation, such as an adjoint method, is available.
However, current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the
number of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the
correlation matrix where new information is added for each sampling point in
each direction of the design space. They do not scale well with the number of
independent variables either due to the increase in the number of
hyperparameters that needs to be estimated. To address this issue, we develop a
new gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that drastically reduced the
number of hyperparameters through the use of the partial-least squares method
that maintains accuracy. In addition, this method is able to control the size
of the correlation matrix by adding only relevant points defined through the
information provided by the partial-least squares method. To validate our
method, we compare the global accuracy of the proposed method with conventional
kriging surrogate models on two analytic functions with up to 100 dimensions,
as well as engineering problems of varied complexity with up to 15 dimensions.
We show that the proposed method requires fewer sampling points than
conventional methods to obtain the desired accuracy, or provides more accuracy
for a fixed budget of sampling points. In some cases, we get over 3 times more
accurate models than a bench of surrogate models from the literature, and also
over 3200 times faster than standard gradient-enhanced kriging models.

As a product of molecular evolution that sought to maximize replicative

unidirectional self-replicators and hence would have been evolutionarily more

that at low monomer concentrations that possibly prevailed in the primordial
oceans, asymmetric unidirectional self-replicators would have an evolutionary
advantage over bidirectional self-replicators. The competing requirements of
low and high kinetic barriers for formation and long lifetime of inter-strand
bonds respectively are simultaneously satisfied through asymmetric kinetic
influence of inter-strand bonds, resulting in evolutionarily successful
unidirectional self-replicators.

false negatives (i.e., failing to label a variable). We describe an efficient
discriminative rule that finds optimal solutions for a subset of variables. Our
technique provides both per-instance and worst-case guarantees concerning the

algorithms. Previous approaches utilize a two-step procedure (visible feature
estimation and visible image reconstruction) to synthesize the visible image
given the corresponding polarimetric thermal image. However, these are regarded
as two disjoint steps and hence may hinder the performance of visible face
reconstruction. We argue that joint optimization would be a better way to
reconstruct more photo-realistic images for both computer vision algorithms and
human-examiners to examine. To this end, this paper proposes a Generative
Adversarial Network-based Visible Face Synthesis (GAN-VFS) method to synthesize
more photo-realistic visible face images from their corresponding polarimetric
images. To ensure that the encoded visible-features contain more semantically
meaningful information in reconstructing the visible face image, a guidance
sub-network is involved into the training procedure. To achieve photo realistic
property while preserving discriminative characteristics for the reconstructed
outputs, an identity loss combined with the perceptual loss are optimized in
the framework. Multiple experiments evaluated on different experimental
protocols demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

rates on deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) was investigated using a
state-of-the-art large eddy simulation (LES) strategy. Specifically, detonation
attenuation by a porous medium, and the subsequent re-initiation for
methane-oxygen, a moderately unstable mixture, was considered. The purpose of
the investigation was to validate the numerical strategy with previous
experimental observations, and to determine what specific roles turbulent
mixing and shock compression have on flame acceleration during the final stages
of DDT. The modelling procedure adopted was a grid-within-a-grid approach: The
compressible linear eddy model for large eddy simulation (CLEM-LES). It was
found that average turbulent fluctuations greater than the laminar flame speed
were required in order to maintain wave velocities above the Chapman-Jouguet
(CJ)-deflagration velocity threshold, a precursor requirement for DDT to occur.
It was also found that sufficient turbulent burning on the flame surface was
required in order to drive pressure waves to sufficiently strengthen the
leading shock wave, locally, in order to trigger auto-ignition hot spots in the
wave front. These local explosion events, which were found to burn out through
turbulent surface reactions, drive transverse pressure waves outward. Upon
subsequent shock reflections or interactions of the transverse waves, new local
explosion events occurred, which further strengthened the adjacent leading
shock wave above the CJ-detonation speed. Eventually, through this process, the
wave sustained the CJ-detonation speed, on average, through the cyclic
mechanism of local explosion events followed by turbulent surface reactions.
Finally, combustion of the flame acceleration process was found to lie
predominantly within the thin-reaction zones regime.

galaxies at higher metallicity, we have investigated the dependence on the
metallicity of the IR-radio relationship at 24 um, 70 um, 100 um and 160 um
bands as well as the integrated FIR luminosity. It is found that metal-poor
galaxies have on average lower qIR than metal-rich ones with larger offsets at
longer IR wavelengths, from -0.06 dex in q24um to -0.6 dex in q160um. The qIR
of all galaxies as a whole at 160 um show positive trends with the metallicity
and IR-to-FUV ratio, and negative trends with the IR color, while those at
lower IR wavelengths show weaker correlations. We proposed a mechanism that
invokes combined effects of low obscured-SFR/total-SFR fraction and warm dust
temperature at low metallicity to interpret the above behavior of qIR, with the
former reducing the IR radiation and the latter further reducing the IR
emission at longer IR wavelength. Other mechanisms that are related to the
radio emission including the enhanced magnetic field strength and increased
thermal radio contribution are unable to reconcile the IR-wavelength-dependent
differences of qIR between metal-poor and metal- rich galaxies. In contrast to
qIR, the mean total-SFR/radio ratio of metal-poor galaxies is the same as the

natural scenes and images generated by VAE, DCGAN and WGAN models. In
particular, generated images do not have scale invariant mean power spectrum
magnitude, which indicates existence of extra structures in these images.
Inspecting how well the statistics of deep generated images match the known

non-Gaussianity, and Weibull contrast distribution, can a) reveal the degree to
which deep learning models capture the essence of the natural scenes, b)
provide a new dimension to evaluate models, and c) allow possible improvement

well-suited for representing convex functions. In particular, we prove that
ReLU nets with width $d+1$ can approximate any continuous convex function of

topologically protected one-dimensional states (also named as zero-line modes)
arise. Here, we focus on the quantum anomalous Hall effect based zero-line
modes formed at the interface between regimes with different Chern numbers. We
find that, these zero-line modes are chiral and unilaterally conductive due to
the breaking of time-reversal invariance. For a beam splitter consisting of two
intersecting zero lines, the chirality ensures that current can only be
injected from two of the four terminals. Our numerical results further show
that, in the absence of contact resistance, the (anti-)clockwise partitions of
currents from these two terminals are the same owing to the current
conservation, which effectively simplifies the partition laws. We find that the
partition is robust against relative shift of Fermi energy, but can be
effectively adjusted by tuning the relative magnetization strengths at
different regimes or relative angles between zero lines.

higher-order elliptic operator with rough coefficients and various boundary
conditions. The operator compression is achieved by using localized basis
functions, which are energy-minimizing functions on local patches. On a regular

diameter $O(h\log(1/h))$ and give optimal compression rate of the solution
operator. We show that by using localized basis functions with supports of
diameter $O(h\log(1/h))$, our method achieves the optimal compression rate of

method to solve elliptic equations, the localized basis functions have the
optimal convergence rate $O(h^k)$ for a $(2k)$th-order elliptic problem in the

than existing latent semantic vector space methods. The addition of NVSM to a
mixture of lexical language models and a state-of-the-art baseline vector space

Consequently, NVSM adds a complementary relevance signal. Next to semantic

needed.
  NVSM learns a notion of term specificity directly from the document

regularities related to Luhn significance. Finally, we give advice on how to
deploy NVSM in situations where model selection (e.g., cross-validation) is
infeasible. We find that an unsupervised ensemble of multiple models trained

The few methods that account for dependencies translate to sampling scenarios

Consequently, we propose a systematic framework to readily generate and
evaluate ellipsoidal prediction regions, with predefined probability and
minimum volume. A skill score is proposed for quantitative assessment of the
quality of prediction ellipsoids. A set of experiments is used to illustrate
the discrimination ability of the proposed scoring rule for misspecification of

become distinguishable. The resulting strongly interacting system can exhibit
exotic topological and pairing behaviors, many of which are yet to be observed
in condensed matter systems. Ultracold atomic gases offer a promising pathway
for simulating these rich phenomena. Two recent experiments reported the
observation of single atom SOC in optical lattice clocks (OLCs) based on
alkaline-earth atoms. In these works encoding the effective spin degree of

detrimental effects of spontaneous emission and heating that have thus far
hindered the study of interacting SOC with alkali atoms. Beyond first studies
of interacting SOC with alkali atoms in a bulk gas and with two particles in a

a non-degenerate $U$-process of a general order indexed by a function class. We
are primarily interested in situations where the function class as well as the
underlying distribution change with the sample size, and the $U$-process itself
is not weakly convergent as a process. Such situations arise in a variety of
modern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely,
approximate the $U$-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and
derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations
are, however, not often directly applicable in statistical problems since the
covariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown. This
motivates us to study bootstrap-type approximations to the $U$-process
supremum. We propose a novel jackknife multiplier bootstrap (JMB) tailored to
the $U$-process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds for the
proposed JMB method. All these results are non-asymptotic, and established
under fairly general conditions on function classes and underlying
distributions. Key technical tools in the proofs are new local maximal
inequalities for $U$-processes, which may be useful in other problems. We also
discuss applications of the general approximation results to testing for
qualitative features of nonparametric functions based on generalized local

problem in mathematical fluid dynamics. As a follow up to our work \cite{EJSI},
we give examples of finite-energy and Lipschitz continuous velocity field and
density $(u_0,\rho_0)$ which are $C^\infty$-smooth away from the origin and
belong to a natural local well-posedness class for the Boussinesq equation
whose corresponding local solution becomes singular in finite time. That is,
while the sup norm of the gradient of the velocity field and the density remain
finite on the time interval $t\in [0,1)$, both quantities become infinite as
$t\rightarrow 1$. The key is to use scale-invariant solutions similar to those
introduced in \cite{EJSI}. The proof consists of three parts: local
well-posedness for the Boussinesq equation in critical spaces, the analysis of
certain special infinite-energy solutions belonging to those critical spaces,
and finally a cut-off argument to ensure finiteness of energy. All of this is
done on spatial domains $\{(x_1,x_2): x_1 \ge \gamma|x_2|\}$ for any $\gamma >
0$ so that we can get arbitrarily close to the half-space case. We remark that
the $2D$ Euler equation is globally well-posed in all of the situations we look
at, so that the singularity is not coming from the domain or the lack of
smoothness on the data but from the vorticity amplification due to the presence
of a density gradient. It is conceivable that our methods can be adapted to
produce finite-energy $C^\infty$ solutions on $\mathbb{R}^2_+$ which become
singular in finite time.

OGLE-2016-BLG-0263L. Unlike most low-mass companions that were detected through
perturbations to the smooth and symmetric light curves produced by the primary,
the companion was discovered through the channel of a repeating event, in which
the companion itself produced its own single-mass light curve after the event
produced by the primary had ended. Thanks to the continuous coverage of the
second peak by high-cadence surveys, the possibility of the repeating nature
due to source binarity is excluded with a $96\%$ confidence level. The mass of
the companion estimated by a Bayesian analysis is $M_{\rm p}=4.1_{-2.5}^{+6.5}\
M_{\rm J}$. The projected primary-companion separation is $a_\perp =
6.5^{+1.3}_{-1.9}$ au. The ratio of the separation to the snow-line distance of
$a_\perp/a_{\rm sl}\sim 15.4$ corresponds to the region beyond Neptune, the
outermost planet of the solar system. We discuss the importance of high-cadence
surveys in expanding the range of microlensing detections of low-mass

with probability at least $1-\delta$}, whether the distributions are identical
versus $\varepsilon$-far in total variation distance. Most prior work focused
on the case that $\delta = \Omega(1)$, for which the sample complexity of
identity testing is known to be $\Theta(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$. Given such an
algorithm, one can achieve arbitrarily small values of $\delta$ via black-box
amplification, which multiplies the required number of samples by
$\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$.
  We show that black-box amplification is suboptimal for any $\delta = o(1)$,
and give a new identity tester that achieves the optimal sample complexity. Our
new upper and lower bounds show that the optimal sample complexity of identity
testing is \[
  \Theta\left( \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\left(\sqrt{n \log(1/\delta)} +

simple: to test whether $p = U_n$ versus $d_{\mathrm TV}(p, U_n) \geq
\varepsilon$, we simply threshold $d_{\mathrm TV}(\widehat{p}, U_n)$, where
$\widehat{p}$ is the empirical probability distribution. The fact that this
simple ""plug-in"" estimator is sample-optimal is surprising, even in the

1280, 610, 325 and 235 MHz, and extended from June 26.89 UT (a day after the
strongest radio/X-ray outburst) to July 12.93 UT. We find the low-frequency
radio emission of V404 Cygni to be extremely bright and fast-decaying in the
outburst phase, with an inverted spectrum below 1.5 GHz and an intermediate
X-ray state. The radio emission settles to a weak, quiescent state $\approx 11$
days after the outburst, with a flat radio spectrum and a soft X-ray state.
Combining the GMRT measurements with flux density estimates from the
literature, we identify a spectral turnover in the radio spectrum at $\approx
1.5$ GHz on $\approx$ June 26.9 UT, indicating the presence of a synchrotron
self-absorbed emitting region. We use the measured flux density at the turnover
frequency with the assumption of equipartition of energy between the particles
and the magnetic field to infer the jet radius ($\approx 4.0 \times 10^{13}$
cm), magnetic field ($\approx 0.5$ G), minimum total energy ($\approx 7 \times
10^{39}$ ergs) and transient jet power ($\approx 8 \times 10^{34}$ erg
s$^{-1}$). The relatively low value of the jet power, despite V404 Cygni's high
black hole spin parameter, suggests that the radio jet power does not correlate
with the spin parameter.

N-fold faster than in the uncorrelated case, where N for example can be the
number of entangled atoms in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Here we
propose and demonstrate the use of correlated spin-Hamiltonians for the
realization of Heisenberg-limited Rabi-type spectroscopy. Rather than probing
the free evolution of the phase of an entangled state with respect to a local
oscillator (LO), we probe the evolution of an, initially separable, two-atom
register under an Ising spin-Hamiltonian with a transverse field. The resulting
correlated spin-rotation spectrum is twice as narrow as compared with
uncorrelated rotation. We implement this Heisenberg-limited Rabi spectroscopy
scheme on the optical-clock electric-quadrupole transition of $^{88}$Sr$^+$
using a two-ion crystal. We further show that depending on the initial state,
correlated rotation can occur in two orthogonal sub-spaces of the full Hilbert
space, yielding Heisenberg-limited spectroscopy of either the average
transition frequency of the two ions or their difference from the mean
frequency. The potential improvement of clock stability due to the use of
entangled states depends on the details of the method used and the dominating
decoherence mechanism. The use of correlated spin-rotations can therefore
potentially lead to new paths for clock stability improvement.

orders of magnitude in HI mass fraction (fHI). The radial distribution of HI
gas with respect to the stellar disc is correlated with fHI but with a large
scatter. We confirm the previously found correlations between the total HI mass
and star formation rate (SFR), and between HI surface densities and SFR surface
densities beyond R25. However, the former correlation becomes much weaker when
the average surface densities rather than total mass or rate are considered,
and the latter correlation also becomes much weaker when the effect of stellar
mass is removed or controlled. Hence the link between SFR and HI is
intrinsically weak in these regions, consistent with what was found on kpc
scales in the galactic inner regions. We find a strong correlation between the
SFR surface density and the stellar mass surface density, which is consistent
with the star formation models where the gas is in quasi-equilibrium with the
mid-plane pressure. We find no evidence for HI warps to be linked with
decreasing star forming efficiencies.

However, due to the similarity of the spectra of water bodies, built-up areas,
approaches based on high-resolution satellites sometimes confuse these
features. A popular direction to detect water is spectral index, often
requiring the ground truth to find appropriate thresholds manually. As for
traditional machine learning methods, they identify water merely via
differences of spectra of various land covers, without taking specific

automatic approach to detect water bodies based on Dempster-Shafer theory,
combining supervised learning with specific property of water in spectral band
in a fully unsupervised context. The benefits of our approach are twofold. On
the one hand, it performs well in mapping principle water bodies, including
little streams and branches. On the other hand, it labels all objects usually
confused with water as `ignorance', including half-dry watery areas, built-up
areas and semi-transparent clouds and shadows. `Ignorance' indicates not only
limitations of the spectral properties of water and supervised learning itself
but insufficiency of information from multi-spectral bands as well, providing
valuable information for further land cover classification.

sophistication of software security flaws increase as well. The analysis of
these flaws began as a manual approach, but it soon became apparent that tools
were necessary to assist human experts in this task, resulting in a number of
techniques and approaches that automated aspects of the vulnerability analysis
process.
  Recently, DARPA carried out the Cyber Grand Challenge, a competition among
autonomous vulnerability analysis systems designed to push the tool-assisted
human-centered paradigm into the territory of complete automation. However,
when the autonomous systems were pitted against human experts it became clear
that certain tasks, albeit simple, could not be carried out by an autonomous
system, as they require an understanding of the logic of the application under
analysis.
  Based on this observation, we propose a shift in the vulnerability analysis
paradigm, from tool-assisted human-centered to human-assisted tool-centered. In
this paradigm, the automated system orchestrates the vulnerability analysis
process, and leverages humans (with different levels of expertise) to perform
well-defined sub-tasks, whose results are integrated in the analysis. As a
result, it is possible to scale the analysis to a larger number of programs,
and, at the same time, optimize the use of expensive human resources.
  In this paper, we detail our design for a human-assisted automated
vulnerability analysis system, describe its implementation atop an open-sourced
autonomous vulnerability analysis system that participated in the Cyber Grand
Challenge, and evaluate and discuss the significant improvements that
non-expert human assistance can offer to automated analysis approaches.

We show that stable motion prevails for inclinations below 60 degrees and
mass-ratios $\mu < 0.04$ for typical integration times up to $10^6$ revolution

planar case -- stable orbits were found to exist for up to $10^7$ periods at
moderate inclinations. We extracted the librational frequencies on a grid in

Several resonances between the short and long period librational frequency as
well as the vertical frequency lie inside the investigated region. The
application of the Lyapunov characteristic indicator and spectral number

applicable in the Solar system for low mass ratios for Trojans of the planets,

followed by the final state interaction of pairs of mesons to describe how the

use of different masses for the charged and neutral kaons, either in the
propagators of the pairs of mesons created in the $\chi_{c1}$ decay, or in the
propagators inside the $T$ matrix, constructed through the unitarization of the
scattering and transition amplitudes of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons. We find
that violating isospin inside the $T$ matrix makes the $\pi^0\eta \to

enhances the effect of the $K\bar{K}$ term. Also, we find that in the total

as Dirac node-line semimetals, and subsequent study is urgent to exploit the
promising application of unusual magnetoresistance property. In this work, we
systematically investigated the anisotropic magnetoresistance in the
newly-discovered Dirac node-line material ZrSiSe. By applying a magnetic field
of 3 T by a vector field, the three-dimensional (3D) magnetoresistance (MR)
shows strong anisotropy. The MR ratio of maximum and minimum directions can
reach 7 at 3 T and keeps increasing at the higher magnetic field. The
anisotropic MR forms a butterfly-shaped curve, which indicates the quasi-2D
electronic structures. This is further confirmed by the angular-dependent
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. The first-principles calculations
establish the quasi-2D tubular-shaped Fermi surface near the X point in the
Brillouin zone. Our findings shed light on the 3D mapping of MR and the
potential applications in magnetic sensors based on ZrSiSe Dirac materials.

of polytopes arising from a simplex by truncations. This notation allows us to
view inclusion of faces as the process of contracting tree edges. Our notation
instantiates to the well-known notations for the faces of associahedra and
permutohedra. Various authors have independently introduced combinatorial tools
for describing such polytopes. We build on the particular approach developed by
Dosen and Petric, who used the formalism of hypergraphs to describe the
interval of polytopes from the simplex to the permutohedron. This interval was
further stretched by Petric to allow truncations of faces that are themselves
obtained by truncations, and iteratively so. Our notation applies to all these
polytopes. We illustrate this by showing that it instantiates to a notation for
the faces of the permutohedron-based associahedra, that consists of
parenthesised words with holes. Dosen and Petric have exhibited some families
of hypergraph polytopes (associahedra, permutohedra, and hemiassociahedra)
describing the coherences, and the coherences between coherences etc., arising
by weakening sequential and parallel associativity of operadic composition. We
complement their work with a criterion allowing us to recover the information
whether edges of these ""operadic polytopes"" come from sequential, or from
parallel associativity. We also give alternative proofs for some of the
original results of Dosen and Petric.

surface states, which is the projection of Fermi arc. The property of surface

  The property that is sufficient and necessary for a unique decoding is the
separability of the tests, but unfortunately no linear time algorithm is known

Density Functions (PDFs) in order to investigate stochastic logistic and
Gompertz models, which are two of the most popular growth models. We consider
different types of short-correlated internal (multiplicative) and external
(additive) stochastic noises and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two
models, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on
the form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a
bimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the
additive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to
a significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We
point out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in
understanding statistical properties of the growth far from equilibrium,
highlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these
two models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the
growth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time
by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in
time. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of
different states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the
information length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become
more similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the
merit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic
evolution of different growth processes.

junctions. Specifically, single-layer WS$_2$ undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal
transition when epitaxially grown on Ag(111), while it remains a direct band
gap semiconductor on Au(111). The metallicity of the single layer on Ag(111) is
established by lineshape analysis of core level photoemission spectra.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy locates the metallic states near the
Q point of the WS$_2$ Brillouin zone. Density functional theory calculations
show that the metallic states arise from hybridization between Ag bulk bands
and the local conduction band minimum of WS$_2$ near the Q point.

signals by transferring electron spin polarization to nuclei. As DNP requires
microwave magnetic fields B1 strong enough to saturate electron spins,
microwave resonators are generally used to achieve a sufficient B1, at the
expense of restricting the sample size. Higher fields improve NMR sensitivity
and resolution. However, resonators at 9 T for example can only hold
nano-liters (nL). Larger volumes are possible by avoiding resonators, but the
higher power needed to reach B1 is likely to evaporate the sample. Here, we
demonstrate a breakthrough in liquid state DNP at 9 T, boosting the sample size
to the microliter range. We could use high-power (70 W) microwaves thanks to a
planar probe designed to alleviate dielectric heating. We enhanced the 1H NMR
signal intensity of 2 uL of liquid water by a factor of 14, while maintaining

in possibility of assertion violations, race conditions or runtime errors) and
plain reachability (as in deadlock-freedom) of phaser programs. Phasers are a
modern non-trivial synchronization construct that supports dynamic parallelism
with runtime registration and deregistration of spawned tasks. They allow for
collective and point-to-point synchronizations. For instance, phasers can
enforce barriers or producer-consumer synchronization schemes among all or
subsets of the running tasks. Implementations %of these recent and dynamic
synchronization are found in modern languages such as X10 or Habanero Java.
Phasers essentially associate phases to individual tasks and use their runtime
values to restrict possible concurrent executions. Unbounded phases may result
in infinite transition systems even in the case of programs only creating
finite numbers of tasks and phasers. We introduce an exact gap-order based
procedure that always terminates when checking control reachability for
programs generating bounded numbers of coexisting tasks and phasers. We also
show verifying plain reachability is undecidable even for programs generating
few tasks and phasers. We then explain how to turn our procedure into a sound
analysis for checking plain reachability (including deadlock freedom). We
report on preliminary experiments with our open source tool.

concern in many countries. One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning
of immunity. In some disease systems, the process of waning immunity can be
non-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration of immunity
and subsequent boosting of immunity through asymptomatic re-exposure.
  We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine
the interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration of
infection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity,
we explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease
patterns and prevalence of infection.
  Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its
ability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration of
infection-acquired immunity and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity. We find
that increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in
overall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary
infections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period
and taller peaks.
  Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease
may change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs
from that of infection-acquired immunity. Our study highlights that for any
particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the
duration of protection and how that duration is influenced by infection
prevalence is important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.

remarkable self-assembly process in many natural systems, where a small number

icosahedral cage. In turn, this has inspired synthetic biologists to design de
novo protein cages. We use simple models, on multiple scales, to investigate
the self-assembly of a spherical cage, focusing on the regularity of the
packing of protein-like objects on the surface. Using building blocks, which
are able to pack with icosahedral symmetry, we examine how stable these highly
symmetric structures are to perturbations that may arise from the interplay
between flexibility of the interacting blocks and entropic effects. We find
that, in the presence of those perturbations, icosahedral packing is not the
most stable arrangement for a wide range of parameters; rather disordered
structures are found to be the most stable. Our results suggest that (i) many
designed, or even natural, protein cages may not be regular in the presence of
those perturbations, and (ii) that optimizing those flexibilities can be a
possible design strategy to obtain regular synthetic cages with full control

of Calabi-Yau's $\mathbb{P}^{n|n+1}$. Last, with an eye to applications to
physics, we show in full detail how to endow $\mathbb{P}^{1|2}$ with the
structure of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Riemann surface and we obtain its
SUSY-preserving infinitesimal automorphisms from first principles, that prove
to be the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp} (2|2)$. A particular effort has been

those that focus on the properties of planetary systems (Questions A1--A2),
those that focus on the properties of individual planets (Questions B1--B4),
and questions that relate to planetary processes (Questions C1--C4). The
questions in categories A, B, and C require different target samples and often
different observational approaches. For each questions we summarize the current

smaller than the astrophysical foregrounds. One of the methods to deal with the
problem is to avoid a wedge-shaped region in the Fourier $k_{\perp} -
k_{\parallel}$ space which contains the signal from the spectrally smooth
foregrounds. However, measuring the spherically averaged power spectrum using
only modes outside this wedge (i.e., in the reionization window), leads to a
bias. We provide a prescription, based on expanding the power spectrum in terms
of the shifted Legendre polynomials, which can be used to compute the angular
moments of the power spectrum in the reionization window. The prescription
requires computation of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of
the power spectrum using the theoretical model under consideration and also the
knowledge of the effective extent of the foreground wedge in the $k_{\perp} -

obstructs the visions of the two other robots. The mutual visibility problem
asks the robots to coordinate their movements to form a configuration, within
finite time and without collision, in which no three robots are collinear.
Robots are endowed with a constant bits of persistent memory. In this work, we
consider the FSTATE computational model in which the persistent memory is used
by the robots only to remember their previous internal states. Except from this
persistent memory, robots are oblivious i.e., they do not carry forward any
other information from their previous computational cycles. The paper presents
a distributed algorithm to solve the mutual visibility problem for a set of

explosions of stars about ten times as massive as our Sun, with densities
comparable to the atomic nucleus', spinning with periods from few milliseconds
up to few seconds, and endowed with magnetic fields thousands billion times
stronger than the Earth's, where particles are accelerated to the relativistic
regime producing electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum. Although
there is a general consensus on the fact that pulsars' radio emission is
coherent in nature, whereas the emission from the optical to high-energy
$\gamma$-rays is due to incoherent processes, it has not been established yet
at which wavelengths the transition occurs, a key information for all emission
models of pulsar magnetospheres. Of course, to address this issue covering the
spectral region between high-frequency radio waves and the mid-IR is crucial.
We used the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) to observe the Vela pulsar
(PSR\, B0833$-$45), one of the very few observed in radio and from the
mid-infrared up to the very high-energy $\gamma$-rays. We detected Vela at
frequencies of 97.5, 145, 233, 343.5 GHz and found that its energy density
spectrum follows a power-law of spectral index $\alpha = -0.93 \pm 0.16$. The
ALMA spectrum corresponds to very high brightness temperatures - from $10^{17}$
to $10^{15}$ K - suggesting that a coherent radiative process still contributes
to the mm/sub-mm emission. This is, therefore, the first indication of coherent
emission other than radio originating in pulsars. At the same time, we
identified an extended structure, preliminarily detected in ground-based
observations. We support its interpretation as a counter-jet protruding from
the pulsar.

in climate and environment modeling. In contrast to simulation based on partial
differential equations derived from first-principles modeling, ExaGeoStat
employs a statistical model based on the evaluation of the Gaussian
log-likelihood function, which operates on a large dense covariance matrix.
Generated by the parametrizable Matern covariance function, the resulting
matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The computational tasks involved
during the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function become daunting
as the number n of geographical locations grows, as O(n2) storage and O(n3)
operations are required. While many approximation methods have been devised
from the side of statistical modeling to ameliorate these polynomial
complexities, we are interested here in the complementary approach of
evaluating the exact algebraic result by exploiting advances in solution
algorithms and many-core computer architectures. Using state-of-the-art high
performance dense linear algebra libraries associated with various leading edge
parallel architectures (Intel KNLs, NVIDIA GPUs, and distributed-memory
systems), ExaGeoStat raises the game for statistical applications from climate
and environmental science. ExaGeoStat provides a reference evaluation of
statistical parameters, with which to assess the validity of the various
approaches based on approximation. The framework takes a first step in the
merger of large-scale data analytics and extreme computing for geospatial
statistical applications, to be followed by additional complexity reducing
improvements from the solver side that can be implemented under the same
interface. Thus, a single uncompromised statistical model can ultimately be
executed in a wide variety of emerging exascale environments.

Odometry. To address this issue, this paper presents a visual odometry method
based on point and line features that leverages both measurements from a depth
sensor and depth estimates from camera motion. Depth estimates are generated
continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of
features to compensate for the lack of depth measurements and inaccurate
feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of
triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and
obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, depth measurements are exploited by
propagating them through a depth map registration module and using a
frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3D-to-2D and 2D-to-3D
reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on
large indoor and outdoor scenes, where depth sensor limitations are critical,
show that the combination of depth measurements and estimates through our
approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of depth measurements.

  in the Wild",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning is a proven technique for an agent to learn a task.
However, when learning a task using reinforcement learning, the agent cannot
distinguish the characteristics of the environment from those of the task. This
makes it harder to transfer skills between tasks in the same environment.
Furthermore, this does not reduce risk when training for a new task. In this
paper, we introduce an approach to decouple the environment characteristics
from the task-specific ones, allowing an agent to develop a sense of survival.
We evaluate our approach in an environment where an agent must learn a sequence
of collection tasks, and show that decoupled learning allows for a safer
utilization of prior knowledge.

interesting that a ribbon with a specific width can be a normal or

attention map is then applied to weight the features. Besides, the occlusion

automatically plan a gradient-descent path towards a given target point in the
domain, avoiding obstacles that may be present. A key requirement from such
distance functions is the absence of spurious local minima, which may foil such
an approach, and this has led to the common use of harmonic potential
functions. Based on the planar Laplace operator, the potential function
guarantees the absence of spurious minima, but is well known to be slow to
numerically compute and prone to numerical precision issues. To alleviate the
first of these problems, we propose a family of novel divergence distances.
These are based on f-divergence of the Poisson kernel of the domain. We define
the divergence distances and compare them to the harmonic potential function
and other related distance functions.
  Our first result is theoretical: We show that the family of divergence
distances are equivalent to the harmonic potential function on simply-connected
domains, namely generate paths which are identical to those generated by the
potential function. The proof is based on the concept of conformal invariance.
  Our other results are more practical and relate to two special cases of
divergence distances, one based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and one
based on the total variation divergence. We show that using divergence
distances instead of the potential function and other distances has a
significant computational advantage, as, following a pre-processing stage, they
may be computed up to an order of magnitude faster than the others when taking
advantage of certain sparsity properties of the Poisson kernel. Furthermore,
the computation is ""embarrassingly parallel"", so may be implemented on a GPU
with up to three orders of magnitude speedup.

(2014). In this work, powered by a stacking technique plus a background
subtraction for contamination removal, a finer correction and more precise
results are obtained than in our previous work. We find that while the
quiescent fraction increases with decreasing group-centric radius the median
SSFRs of star-forming galaxies in groups at fixed stellar mass drop slightly
from the field toward the group center. This suggests that the major quenching
process in groups is likely a fast mechanism. On the other hand, a reduction in
SSFRs by ~0.2 dex is seen inside clusters as opposed to the field galaxies. If
the reduction is attributed to the slow quenching effect, the slow quenching
process acts dominantly in clusters. In addition, we also examine the
density-color relation, where the density is defined by using a sixth-nearest
neighbor approach. Comparing the quiescent fractions contributed from the
density and radial effect, we find that the density effect dominates over the
massive group or cluster galaxies, and the radial effect becomes more effective
in less massive galaxies. The results support mergers and/or starvation as the
main quenching mechanisms in the group environment, while harassment and/or
starvation dominate in clusters.

non-invasive treatment of kidney (renal) cancer, but the clinical outcomes have
been variable. In this study, the efficacy of renal HIFU therapy was studied
using nonlinear acoustic and thermal simulations in three patients. Methods:
The acoustic simulations were conducted with and without refraction in order to
investigate its effect on the shape, size and pressure distribution at the
focus. The values for the attenuation, sound speed, perfusion and thermal
conductivity of the kidney were varied over the reported ranges to determine
the effect of variability on heating. Furthermore, the phase aberration was
studied in order to quantify the underlying phase shifts using a second order
polynomial function. Results: The ultrasound field intensity was found to drop
on average 11.1 dB with refraction and 6.4 dB without refraction. Reflection at
tissue interfaces was found to result in a loss less than 0.1 dB. Focal point
splitting due to refraction significantly reduced the heating efficacy.
Perfusion did not have a large effect on heating during short sonication
durations. Small changes in temperature were seen with varying attenuation and
thermal conductivity, but no visible changes were present with sound speed
variations. The aberration study revealed an underlying trend in the spatial
distribution of the phase shifts. Conclusion: The results show that the
efficacy of HIFU therapy in the kidney could be improved with aberration
correction. Significance: A method is proposed by which patient specific
pre-treatment calculations could be used to overcome the aberration and
therefore make ultrasound treatment possible.

Published in the IEEE Access",,,,"cs.IT cs.DC cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a challenging task to design a random access protocol that achieves the
optimal throughput in multi-cell random access with decentralized transmission
due to the difficulty of coordination. In this paper, we present a
decentralized interference-aware opportunistic random access (IA-ORA) protocol
that enables us to obtain the optimal throughput scaling in an ultra-dense
multi-cell random access network with one access point (AP) and a number of
users. In sharp contrast to opportunistic scheduling for cellular multiple
access where users are selected by base stations, under the IA-ORA protocol,
each user opportunistically transmits with a predefined physical layer (PHY)
data rate in a decentralized manner if not only the desired signal power to the
serving AP is sufficiently large but also the generating interference leakage
power to the other APs is sufficiently small (i.e., two threshold conditions
are fulfilled). As a main result, it is shown that the optimal aggregate
throughput scaling (i.e., the MAC throughput of $\frac{1}{e}$ in a cell and the
power gain) is achieved in a high signal-to-noise ratio regime if the number of
per-cell users exceeds some level. Additionally, it is numerically demonstrated
via computer simulations that under practical settings, the proposed IA-ORA
protocol outperforms conventional opportunistic random access protocols in
terms of aggregate throughput.

R-CNN or R-FCN have already shown promising results for object detection by
combining the region proposal subnetwork and the classification subnetwork
together. Although R-FCN has achieved higher detection speed while keeping the
detection performance, the global structure information is ignored by the
position-sensitive score maps. To fully explore the local and global
properties, in this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network,
named as CoupleNet, to couple the global structure with local parts for object
detection. Specifically, the object proposals obtained by the Region Proposal
Network (RPN) are fed into the the coupling module which consists of two
branches. One branch adopts the position-sensitive RoI (PSRoI) pooling to
capture the local part information of the object, while the other employs the
RoI pooling to encode the global and context information. Next, we design
different coupling strategies and normalization ways to make full use of the
complementary advantages between the global and local branches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on all three challenging datasets, i.e. a mAP of 82.7%

range of velocities. Several ""bubbles"" are clearly identified in the Carina
Nebula Complex, produced by the impact of the massive star clusters located in
this region. An HI absorption profile obtained towards the strong extragalactic
radio source PMN J1032--5917 showed the distribution of the cold component of
the atomic gas along the Galactic disk, with the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus
spiral arms clearly distinguishable. Preliminary calculations of the optical
depth and spin temperatures of the cold atomic gas show that the HI line is
opaque ($\tau \gtrsim$ 2) at several velocities in the Sagittarius-Carina
spiral arm. The spin temperature is $\sim100$ K in the regions with the highest
optical depth, although this value might be lower for the saturated components.
The atomic mass budget of Gum 31 is $\sim35 \%$ of the total gas mass. HI self
absorption features have molecular counterparts and good spatial correlation
with the regions of cold dust as traced by the infrared maps. We suggest that
in Gum 31 regions of cold temperature and high density are where the atomic to

radiative transfer computation in the ultra-relativistic regime and assessed
the appropriate simulation conditions. The radiative transfer code was
validated through two test calculations: (1) computing in different inertial
frames and (2) computing in flow-fields with discontinuous and smeared shock
fronts. The simulation results of the angular distribution and spectrum were
compared among three different inertial frames and in good agreement with each
other. If the time duration for updating the flow-field was sufficiently small
to resolve a mean free path of a photon into ten steps, the results were
thoroughly converged. The spectrum computed in the flow-field with a
discontinuous shock front obeyed a power-law in frequency whose index was
positive in the range from 1 to 10 MeV. The number of photons in the
high-energy side decreased with the smeared shock front because the photons
were less scattered immediately behind the shock wave due to the small electron
number density. The large optical depth near the shock front was needed for
obtaining high-energy photons through bulk Compton scattering. Even
one-dimensional structure of the shock wave could affect the results of
radiation transport computation.

the MHD simulation is updated based on the PIC variables (PIC to MHD coupling).
This method can be useful for simulating large plasma systems, where kinetic
effects captured by particle-in-cell simulations are localized but affect
global dynamics. We describe the numerical implementation of this coupling, its
time-stepping algorithm, and its parallelization strategy, emphasizing the
novel aspects of it. We test the stability and energy/momentum conservation of
this method by simulating a steady-state plasma. We test the dynamics of this
coupling by propagating plasma waves through the embedded PIC domain. Coupling
with MHD shows satisfactory results for the fast magnetosonic wave, but
significant distortion for the circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave. Coupling
with Hall-MHD shows excellent coupling for the whistler wave. We also apply
this methodology to simulate a Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) challenge

larger scales with MHD and Hall-MHD. In both these cases we see the expected
signatures of kinetic reconnection in the PIC domain, implying that this method

of elastic proton-proton scattering remains almost energy-independent at the
transferred momentum $t\approx - 0.21\, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ at the level of
$\approx 7.5 \mathrm{\ mb}/\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$. This property of $ d\sigma/dt$
(the ""first"" stationary point) appears due to the correlated growth of the
total cross-section and the local slope parameter and can be expressed as a
relation between the latter quantities. We anticipate that this property will
be true up to 13 TeV. This enables us to normalize the preliminary TOTEM data
for $ d\sigma/dt$ at 13 TeV and $ 0.05 < |t| < 3.4\, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ and
predict the values of $ d\sigma/dt$ at this energy. These data give an evidence
of the second stationary point at $t\approx - 2.3\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ at the
level of $\approx 33 \mathrm{\ nb}/\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$. The energy evolution of $
d\sigma/dt$ looks as if the high energy elastic scattering amplitude is a sum
of two similar terms. We argue that the existence of the two stationary points
and the two-component structure of the high energy elastic scattering amplitude
are general properties for all elastic processes.

time when the size grows to the level where maintenance is needed prevents
unexpected efforts and helps to spot problematic artifacts before they become
critical.
  Although the amount of prediction approaches in literature is vast, it is
unclear how well they fit with prerequisites and expectations from practice. In
this paper, we perform an industrial case study at an automotive manufacturer
to explore applicability and usability of prediction approaches in practice. In
a first step, we collect the most relevant prediction approaches from
literature, including both, approaches using statistics and machine learning.
Furthermore, we elicit expectations towards predictions from practitioners
using a survey and stakeholder workshops. At the same time, we measure software
size of 48 software artifacts by mining four years of revision history,
resulting in 4,547 data points. In the last step, we assess the applicability
of state-of-the-art prediction approaches using the collected data by
systematically analyzing how well they fulfill the practitioners' expectations.
  Our main contribution is a comparison of commonly used prediction approaches
in a real world industrial setting while considering stakeholder expectations.
We show that the approaches provide significantly different results regarding

In this paper, from systematic time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations for the

strongly on the orientations of $^{238}$U, quantum shells, and collision

many-proton transfer from $^{238}$U to $^{124}$Sn can be explained by a
multinucleon transfer mechanism governed by enhanced neck evolution in tip
collisions; (ii) Novel reaction dynamics are observed in tip collisions at
energies substantially above the Coulomb barrier, where a number of nucleons
are transferred from $^{124}$Sn to $^{238}$U, producing transuranium nuclei as
primary reaction products, that could be a means to synthesize superheavy
nuclei. Both results indicate the importance of the neck (shape) evolution
dynamics, which are sensitive to the orientations, shell effects and collision
energies, for exploring possible pathways to produce new unstable nuclei.

to be modeled using agent-based modeling, a paradigm well-known for modeling
Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). While agent-based models are also well-known to
effectively model CAS, often times models can tend to be ambiguous and the use

However, to the best of our knowledge, no such model has been developed in
conjunction with AIDS. In this paper, we present a Formal Agent-Based

employs the use of a formal specification model in conjunction with an

to the free energy of a two-dimensional system at a conformal invariant
critical point is linearly related to the central charge of the corresponding
conformal field theory. However, experimental determination of the central
charge of a non-unitary conformal invariant critical theory has not been done
before because of the intrinsic difficulty that complex parameters occurs in
non-unitary theory, which is not physical. Here we propose to extract the
central charge of the non-unitary conformal invariant critical point of a
two-dimensional lattice models from the quantum coherence measurement of a
probe spin which is coupled to the two-dimensional lattice models. A recent
discovery shows that quantum decoherence of a probe spin which is coupled to a
bath is proportional to the partition function of the bath with a complex
parameter. Thus the central charge of a non-unitary conformal field theory
could be extracted from quantum decoherence measurement of a probe spin which
is coupled to a bath. We have applied the method to a typical non-unitary

the two-dimensional Ising model and extracted the central charge of the

important computational problem related to MRFs, called maximum a posteriori

this task, linear programming (LP) relaxation and dual decomposition (DD), have
a strong connection both providing an optimal solution to the MAP problem when
a corresponding LP relaxation is tight. However, less is known about their

two components: i) the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database containing protein

the unknown sequences. Hence, for all proteins we have available the sequence

scaffolds obtained by electrospinning of the solution of
poly({\epsilon}-caprolactone) and arginine in common solvent. The influence of
arginine content on structure, mechanical, surface and biological properties of
the scaffolds was investigated. It was found that with an increase of arginine
concentration diameter of the scaffold fibers was reduced, which was
accompanied by an increase of scaffold strength and Young modulus. It was
demonstrated that porosity and water contact angle of the scaffold are
independent from arginine content. The best cell adhesion and viability was
shown on scaffolds with arginine concentration from 0.5 to 1 % wt.
