information about the evolution of their internal structures. In this article I
show that the glitch-events observed in pulsars are exact quantum signatures
for their metamorphosis into dark super-baryons (SBs), whose interiors are made
of purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids. Here the
quantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels
of the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates
$\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event
corresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy
level to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in
turn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the
negative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal
scalar field $\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter. As
dictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, the prompt spin-down must be
associated with increase of the dimensions of the embryonic SB to finally
convert the entire pulsar into SB-Objects on the scale of Gyrs. Based on our
calculations, a Vela-like pulsar should display billions of glitches during its
lifetime, before it metamorphoses entirely into a maximally compact SB-object
and disappears from our observational windows. The present model predicts the
mass of SBs and $\Delta \Omega/\Omega$ in young pulsars to be relatively lower
than their older counterparts.

  Codes","15 Pages, 15figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate multi-message authentication to combat
adversaries with infinite computational capacity. An authentication framework
over a wiretap channel $(W_1,W_2)$ is proposed to achieve information-theoretic
security with the same key. The proposed framework bridges the two research
areas in physical (PHY) layer security: secure transmission and message
authentication. Specifically, the sender Alice first transmits message $M$ to
the receiver Bob over $(W_1,W_2)$ with an error correction code; then Alice
employs a hash function (i.e., $\varepsilon$-AWU$_2$ hash functions) to
generate a message tag $S$ of message $M$ using key $K$, and encodes $S$ to a
codeword $X^n$ by leveraging an existing strongly secure channel coding with
exponentially small (in code length $n$) average probability of error; finally,
Alice sends $X^n$ over $(W_1,W_2)$ to Bob who authenticates the received
messages. We develop a theorem regarding the requirements/conditions for the
authentication framework to be information-theoretic secure for authenticating
a polynomial number of messages in terms of $n$. Based on this theorem, we
propose an authentication protocol that can guarantee the security
requirements, and prove its authentication rate can approach infinity when $n$
goes to infinity. Furthermore, we design and implement an efficient and
feasible authentication protocol over binary symmetric wiretap channel (BSWC)
by using \emph{Linear Feedback Shifting Register} based (LFSR-based) hash
functions and strong secure polar code. Through extensive experiments, it is
demonstrated that the proposed protocol can achieve low time cost, high
authentication rate, and low authentication error rate.

attributed to so-called 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' arise from the same
fundamental physical process: the emergence, from the quantum level, of
spacetime itself. This creation of spacetime results in metric expansion around
mass points in addition to the usual curvature due to stress-energy sources of
the gravitational field. A recent modification of Einstein's theory of general
relativity by Chadwick, Hodgkinson, and McDonald incorporating spacetime
expansion around mass points, which accounts well for the observed galactic
rotation curves, is adduced in support of the proposal. Recent observational
evidence corroborates a prediction of the model that the apparent amount of
'dark matter' increases with the age of the universe. In addition, the proposal
leads to the same result for the small but nonvanishing cosmological constant,
related to 'dark energy, as that of the causet model of Sorkin et al.

Stanford CoreNLP with the Twitter model had an average F1 of 0.69 while the
improved system had a F1 of 0.77. The accuracy of the system could be improved
by using a complete domain specific corpus. Since the system used linguistic

(AM0112-554, RR23), composed of an early-type (NGC 454 E) and a star forming
late-type companion (NGC 454 W). We aim at characterizing this wet merger
candidate via a multi-lambda analysis, from near-UV to optical using
SWIFT-UVOT, and mapping the Halpha intensity (I) distribution, velocity (Vr),
and velocity dispersion (sigma) fields with SAM+Perot-Fabry at SOAR
observations. Luminosity profiles suggest that NGC 454 E is an S0. Distortions
in its outskirts caused by the on-going interaction are visible in both optical
and near-UV frames. In NGC 454 W, the NUV-UVOT images and the Halpha show a set
of star forming complexes connected by a faint tail. Halpha emission is
detected along the line connecting NGC 454 E to the NGC 454 main HII complex.
We investigate the (I-sigma), (I-Vr ) (Vr-sigma) diagnostic diagrams of the HII
complexes, most of which can be interpreted in a framework of expanding
bubbles. In the main HII complex, enclosed in the UV brightest region, the gas
velocity dispersion is highly supersonic reaching 60 km/s. However, Halpha
emission profiles are mostly asymmetric indicating the presence of multiple
components with an irregular kinematics. Observations point towards an advanced
stage of the encounter. Our SPH simulations with chemophotometric
implementation suggest that this mixed pair can be understood in terms of a 1:1
gas/halos encounter giving rise to a merger in about 0.2 Gyr from the present
stage.

is a transition in the nature of the magnetic activity from chromospheric and
coronal to planet-like and auroral, from local impulsive heating via flares and
MHD wave dissipation to energy dissipation from strong large-scale
magnetospheric current systems. We examine this transition and the prevalence
of auroral activity in brown dwarfs through a compilation of multi-wavelength
surveys of magnetic activity, including radio, X-ray, and optical. We compile
the results of those surveys and place their conclusions in the context of
auroral emission as the consequence of large-scale magnetospheric current
systems that accelerate energetic electron beams and drive the particles to
impact the cool atmospheric gas. We explore the different manifestation of
auroral phenomena in brown dwarf atmospheres, like H$\alpha$, and define their
distinguishing characteristics. We conclude that large amplitude photometric
variability in the near infrared is most likely a consequence of clouds in
brown dwarf atmospheres, but that auroral activity may be responsible for
long-lived stable surface features. We report a connection between auroral
H$\alpha$ emission and quiescent radio emission in ECMI pulsing brown dwarfs,
suggesting a potential underlying physical connection between the quiescent and

These oscillations occur with a fundamental period that a semiclassical

Bloch oscillations whose periodicity is an integer ($\mu{>}1$) multiple of the
fundamental period. The period multiplier $\mu$ is a topological invariant
protected by the space groups of crystals, which include more than just
translational symmetries. For example, $\mu$ divides $n$ for crystals with an
$n$-fold rotational or screw symmetry; with a reflection, inversion or glide
symmetry, $\mu$ equals two. We identify the commonality underlying all
period-multiplied oscillations: the multi-band Berry-Zak phases, which encode
the holonomy of adiabatic transport of Bloch functions in quasimomentum space,
differ pairwise by integer multiples of $2\pi/\mu$. For a class of multi-band
subspaces whose projected-position operators commute, period multiplication has
a complementary explanation through the real space distribution of Wannier
functions. This complementarity follows from a one-to-one correspondence
between Berry-Zak phases and the centers of Wannier functions. A Wannier
description of period multiplication does not always exist, as we exemplify
with band subspaces with either a nonzero Chern number or $\mathbb{Z}_2$
Kane-Mele topological order. To help identify band subspaces with $\mu{>}1$, a
general theorem is presented that outputs Zak phases that are
symmetry-protected to integer multiples of $2\pi/n$, given the point-group

radiation pressure is capable of accelerating the clouds to hundreds of

observations. We compare these results to simulations where acceleration is
provided by entrainment in a hot wind, where the momentum injection of the hot

neutron star (NS) in a close orbit around an early-B supergiant donor star.
Accretion of the donor star's wind onto the NS powers its strong X-ray
luminosity. To understand the physics of HMXBs, detailed knowledge about the
donor star winds is required. AIMS: To gain a realistic picture of the donor
star in Vela X-1, we constructed a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere model
describing the wind stratification while properly reproducing the observed
donor spectrum. To investigate how X-ray illumination affects the stellar wind,
we calculated additional models for different X-ray luminosity regimes.
METHODS: We use the recently updated version of the PoWR code to consistently
solve the hydrodynamic equation together with the statistical equations and the
radiative transfer. RESULTS: The wind flow in Vela X-1 is driven by ions from
various elements with Fe III and S III leading in the outer wind. The
model-predicted mass-loss rate is in line with earlier empirical studies. The
mass-loss rate is almost unaffected by the presence of the accreting NS in the
wind. The terminal wind velocity is confirmed at $v_\infty \approx 600$ km/s.
On the other hand, the wind velocity in the inner region where the NS is
located is only $\approx 100$ km/s, which is not expected on the basis of a
standard $\beta$-velocity law. In models with an enhanced level of X-rays, the
velocity field in the outer wind can be altered. If the X-ray flux is too high,
the acceleration breaks down because the ionization increases. CONCLUSIONS:
Accounting for radiation hydrodynamics, our Vela X-1 donor atmosphere model
reveals a low wind speed at the NS location, and it provides quantitative
information on wind driving in this important HMXB.

mixtures of classes, which are common in collider physics. Crucially, neither
individual labels nor class proportions are required, yet we prove that the
optimal classifier in the CWoLa paradigm is also the optimal classifier in the
traditional fully-supervised case where all label information is available.
After demonstrating the power of this method in an analytical toy example, we
consider a realistic benchmark for collider physics: distinguishing quark-

generally, CWoLa can be applied to any classification problem where labels or

the astrophysics of galaxy formation and in model testing, parameter space
searching and mock catalogue building. In this work we present a new model for
gas cooling in halos in semi-analytic models, which improves over previous
cooling models in several ways. Our new treatment explicitly includes the
evolution of the density profile of the hot gas driven by the growth of the
dark matter halo and by the dynamical adjustment of the gaseous corona as gas
cools down. The effect of the past cooling history on the current mass cooling
rate is calculated more accurately, by doing an integral over the past history.
The evolution of the hot gas angular momentum profile is explicitly followed,
leading to a self-consistent and more detailed calculation of the angular
momentum of the cooled down gas. This model predicts higher cooled down masses
than the cooling models previously used in GALFORM, closer to the predictions
of the cooling models in L-GALAXIES and MORGANA, even though those models are
formulated differently. It also predicts cooled down angular momenta that are
higher than in previous GALFORM cooling models, but generally lower than the
predictions of L-GALAXIES and MORGANA. When used in a full galaxy formation
model, this cooling model improves the predictions for early-type galaxy sizes
in GALFORM.

AdS/CFT, the theory is in a confined phase dual to the planar AdS black hole.
When the radion is stabilized, \`a la Goldberger-Wise, a holographic
first-order phase transition proceeds. The brane-localized curvature
contributes to the radion kinetic energy, substantially decreasing the critical
bubble energy. Contrary to previous results, the phase transition completes at
much larger values of $N$, the number of degrees of freedom in the CFT.
Moreover, the field value of the bulk scalar on the TeV-brane is allowed to
become large, while remaining consistent with back-reaction constraints.
Assisted by this fact, we find that for a wide region in the parameter space
tunneling happens rather quickly, i.e. the nucleation temperature becomes of
the order of the critical temperature. At zero temperature, the most important
signature of brane-localized curvature is the reduction of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein
graviton masses and a heavier radion.

the clumping free density profile is above the average profile obtained by

gas fraction beyond $R_{500}$; the pressure profile is flatter than the fit
obtained by the Planck collaboration; the entropy profile is flatter than the
mean one predicted from non-radiative simulations; the analysis in azimuthal

about 40 per cent from non-thermal to the total pressure at $R_{200}$.

entropy of the dual CFT$_2$. Previous work had considered the reconstruction of
closed or open spacelike curves in global AdS, and of infinitely extended
spacelike curves in Poincare AdS that are subject to a periodicity condition at
infinity. Working first at constant time, we find that a closed curve in
Poincare is described in the CFT by a family of intervals that covers the
spatial axis at least twice. We also show how to reconstruct open curves,
points and distances, and obtain a CFT action whose extremization leads to bulk
points. We then generalize all of these results to the case of curves that vary
in time, and discover that generic curves have segments that cannot be
reconstructed using the standard hole-ographic construction. This happens
because, for the nonreconstructible segments, the tangent geodesics fail to be
fully contained within the Poincare wedge. We show that a previously discovered
variant of the hole-ographic method allows us to overcome this challenge, by
reorienting the geodesics touching the bulk curve to ensure that they all
remain within the wedge. Our conclusion is that all spacelike curves in
Poincare AdS can be completely reconstructed with CFT data, and each curve has
in fact an infinite number of representations within the CFT.

assumes that the directions of nuclear recoils can be measured in the Galactic
rest frame. However, this is not possible with all directional detection
technologies. In nuclear emulsions, for example, the recoil events must be
detected and measured after the exposure time of the experiment. Unless the
entire detector is mounted and rotated with the sidereal day, the recoils
cannot be reoriented in the Galactic rest frame. We examine the effect of this
`time integration' on the primary goals of directional detection, namely: (1)
confirming that the recoils are anisotropic; (2) measuring the median recoil
direction to confirm their Galactic origin; and (3) probing below the neutrino
floor. We show that after time integration the DM recoil distribution retains a
preferred direction and is distinct from that of Solar neutrino-induced
recoils. Many of the advantages of directional detection are therefore
preserved and it is not crucial to mount and rotate the detector. Rejecting
isotropic backgrounds requires a factor of 2 more signal events compared with
an experiment with event time information, whereas a factor of 1.5-3 more
events are needed to measure a median direction in agreement with the
expectation for DM. We also find that there is still effectively no neutrino
floor in a time-integrated directional experiment. However to reach a cross
section an order of magnitude below the floor, a factor of 8 larger exposure is
required than with a conventional directional experiment. We also examine how
the sensitivity is affected for detectors with only 2D recoil track readout,
and/or no head-tail measurement. As for non-time-integrated experiments, 2D
readout is not a major disadvantage, though a lack of head-tail sensitivity is.

in the accretion processes and generation of jets and outflows. In the past few
years, masers have been successfully used to probe the magnetic field
morphology and strength at scales of a few au around massive protostars, by
measuring linear polarisation angles and Zeeman splitting. The massive
protostar IRAS 18089-1732 is a well studied high-mass-star forming region,
showing a hot core chemistry and a disc-outflow system. Previous SMA
observations of polarised dust revealed an ordered magnetic field oriented
around the disc of IRAS 18089-1732. Aims. We want to determine the magnetic
field in the dense region probed by 6.7 GHz methanol maser observations and
compare it with observations in dust continuum polarisation, to investigate how
the magnetic field in the compact maser region relates to the large-scale field
around massive protostars. Methods. We reduced MERLIN observations at 6.7 GHz
of IRAS 18089-1732 and we analysed the polarised emission by methanol masers.
Results. Our MERLIN observations show that the magnetic field in the 6.7 GHz
methanol maser region is consistent with the magnetic field constrained by the
SMA dust polarisation observations. A tentative detection of circularly
polarised line emission is also presented. Conclusions. We found that the
magnetic field in the maser region has the same orientation as in the disk.
Thus the large-scale field component, even at the au scale of the masers,
dominates over any small-scale field fluctuations. We obtained, from the
circular polarisation tentative detection, a field strength along the line of
sight of 5.5 mG which appeared to be consistent with the previous estimates.

essentially optimal dimension for the correct choice of sparsity. However,
their analysis of the upper bound on the dimension and sparsity requires a
complicated combinatorial graph-based argument similar to Kane and Nelson's
analysis of sparse JL. We present a simple, combinatorics-free analysis of
sparse, sign-consistent JL that yields the same dimension and sparsity upper
bounds as the original analysis. Our analysis also yields dimension/sparsity
tradeoffs, which were not previously known.
  As with previous proofs in this area, our analysis is based on applying
Markov's inequality to the pth moment of an error term that can be expressed as
a quadratic form of Rademacher variables. Interestingly, we show that, unlike
in previous work in the area, the traditionally used Hanson-Wright bound is not
strong enough to yield our desired result. Indeed, although the Hanson-Wright
bound is known to be optimal for gaussian degree-2 chaos, it was already shown
to be suboptimal for Rademachers. Surprisingly, we are able to show a simple
moment bound for quadratic forms of Rademachers that is sufficiently tight to

integrated across the many modules of the brain. While classic
information-theoretic measures have transformed our understanding of
feedforward information processing in the brain's sensory periphery, comparable
measures for information flow in the massively recurrent networks of the rest
of the brain have been lacking. To address this, recent work in information
theory has produced a sound measure of network-wide ""integrated information,""
which can be estimated from time-series data. But, a computational hurdle has
stymied attempts to measure large-scale information integration in real brains.
Specifically, the measurement of integrated information involves a
combinatorial search for the informational ""weakest link"" of a network, a
process whose computation time explodes super-exponentially with network size.
Here, we show that spectral clustering, applied on the correlation matrix of
time-series data, provides an approximate but robust solution to the search for
the the informational weakest link of large networks. This reduces the
computation time for integrated information in large systems from longer than
the lifespan of the universe to just minutes. We evaluate this solution in
brain-like systems of coupled oscillators as well as in high-density
electrocortigraphy data from two macaque monkeys, and show that the
informational ""weakest link"" of the monkey cortex splits posterior sensory
areas from anterior association areas. Finally, we use our solution to provide
evidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that information
integration is maximized by networks with a high global efficiency, and that
modular network structures promote the segregation of information.

  Measurement with Sparse Inverse Analysis",,,"10.1088/1361-665X/aaacba",,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The impedance/admittance measurements of a piezoelectric transducer bonded to
or embedded in a host structure can be used as damage indicator. When a
credible model of the healthy structure, such as the finite element model, is
available, using the impedance/admittance change information as input, it is
possible to identify both the location and severity of damage. The inverse
analysis, however, may be under-determined as the number of unknowns in
high-frequency analysis is usually large while available input information is
limited. The fundamental challenge thus is how to find a small set of solutions
that cover the true damage scenario. In this research we cast the damage
identification problem into a multi-objective optimization framework to tackle
this challenge. With damage locations and severities as unknown variables, one
of the objective functions is the difference between impedance-based model
prediction in the parametric space and the actual measurements. Considering
that damage occurrence generally affects only a small number of elements, we
choose the sparsity of the unknown variables as another objective function,
deliberately, the l0 norm. Subsequently, a multi-objective Dividing RECTangles
(DIRECT) algorithm is developed to facilitate the inverse analysis where the
sparsity is further emphasized by sigmoid transformation. As a deterministic
technique, this approach yields results that are repeatable and conclusive. In
addition, only one algorithmic parameter, the number of function evaluations,
is needed. Numerical and experimental case studies demonstrate that the
proposed framework is capable of obtaining high-quality damage identification
solutions with limited measurement information.

In this paper, we propose a set of materials selection rules aimed at
predicting the formation of amorphous complexions, with an emphasis on (1)
encouraging the segregation of dopants to the interfaces and (2) lowering the
formation energy for a glassy structure. To validate these predictions, binary
Cu-rich metallic alloys encompassing a range of thermodynamic parameter values
were created using sputter deposition and subsequently heat treated to allow
for segregation and transformation of the boundary structure. All of the alloys
studied here experienced dopant segregation to the grain boundary, but
exhibited different interfacial structures. Cu-Zr and Cu-Hf formed nanoscale
amorphous intergranular complexions while Cu-Nb and Cu-Mo retained crystalline
order at their grain boundaries, which can mainly be attributed to differences
in the enthalpy of mixing. Finally, using our newly formed materials selection
rules, we extend our scope to a Ni-based alloy to further validate our
hypothesis, as well as make predictions for a wide variety of transition metal
alloys.

values), while challenging frames are processed with invariant but expensive
deep features. We formulate the adaptive tracking problem as a decision-making

confidence on an early layer, or continue processing subsequent layers of a
network. This significantly reduces the feed-forward cost for easy frames with
distinct or slow-moving objects. We train the agent offline in a reinforcement
learning fashion, and further demonstrate that learning all deep layers (so as
to provide good features for adaptive tracking) can lead to near real-time
average tracking speed of 23 fps on a single CPU while achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Perhaps most tellingly, our approach provides a

the system undergoes a direct transition at a critical $D = D_c$ between a
paramagnetic state at $D > D_c$ and an ordered state with broken U(1) symmetry
at $D < D_c$. We show that beyond mean field the phase diagram is very
different and includes an intermediate, partially ordered chiral liquid phase.
Specifically, we find that inside the paramagnetic phase the Ising ($J_z$)

state with zero total momentum and spin. This bound state condenses at $D >

leaves the spin-rotational U(1) and time-reversal symmetries intact. This
chiral liquid phase is characterized by a finite vector chirality without long
range dipolar magnetic order. In our analytical treatment, the chiral phase
appears for arbitrarily small $J_z$ because the magnon-magnon attraction
becomes singular near the single-magnon condensation transition. This phase
exists in a finite range of $D$ and transforms into the magnetically ordered

the differential gravity across their diameters can fix the rotation rate at a
specific frequency, a process called tidal locking. Tidally locked planets on
circular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will
either librate or rotate super-synchronously. I calculate how habitable planets
evolve under two commonly-used models and find, for example, that one model
predicts that the Earth's rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr
if its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always
maintained the modern Earth's tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will
induce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal
locking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars.
For fast rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that
circularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the
orbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M
dwarfs (<0.15 solar masses) are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr and
hence those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly
tidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet
could be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and
potentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could
be tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide
range of assumptions, and the vast majority of all cases are found to tidally
lock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a
major factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets

to the formation of gapless edge states at the domain walls, as further
illustrated by the analysis of the bulk-edge correspondence and of the
associated topological invariants. Although time reversal symmetry is still
intact in these systems, the edge states are topologically protected when
inter-valley mixing is either weak or negligible. Interestingly, topological
edge states can also be triggered at the boundary of a single domain if

simulations of various biomolecular systems. They can capture conformational
transitions much slower than an average or maximal length of a single molecular
dynamics (MD) trajectory from the set of trajectories used to build the MSM. A
rule of thumb claiming that the slowest implicit timescale captured by an MSM
should be comparable by the order of magnitude to the aggregate duration of all
MD trajectories used to build this MSM has been known in the field. However,
this rule have never been formally proved. In this work, we present analytical
results for the slowest timescale in several types of MSMs, supporting the
above rule. We conclude that the slowest implicit timescale equals the product
of the aggregate sampling and four factors that quantify: (1) how much
statistics on the conformational transitions corresponding to the longest
implicit timescale is available, (2) how good the sampling of the destination
Markov state is, (3) the gain in statistics from using a sliding window for
counting transitions between Markov states, and (4) a bias in the estimate of
the implicit timescale arising from finite sampling of the conformational
transitions. We demonstrate that in many practically important cases all these
four factors are on the order of unity, and we analyze possible scenarios that
could lead to their significant deviation from unity. Overall, we provide for
the first time analytical results on the slowest timescales captured by MSMs.
These results can guide further practical applications of MSMs to biomolecular
dynamics and allow for higher computational efficiency of simulations.

of 0 < z < 5, the star formation density exhibits a strong redshift dependence,
increasing from the present day before peaking at a redshift of z ~ 2.5. Thus,
there is a stark contrast between the star formation rate and the abundance of
raw material available to fuel it. However, using the ratio of the strength of
the HI 21-cm absorption to the total neutral gas column density to quantify the
spin temperature of the gas, it has recently been shown that its reciprocal may
trace the star formation density. This would be expected on the grounds that
the cloud of gas must be sufficiently cool to collapse under its own gravity.
This, however, relies on very limited data and so here we explore the potential
of applying the above method to absorbers for which individual column densities
are not available (primarily MgII absorption systems). By using the mean value

find that 1/T (degenerate with the absorber-emitter size ratio) traces the SF

potential effectiveness of infecting mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria to
control the ongoing mosquito-borne epidemics, such as dengue fever,
chikungunya, and Zika. Wolbachia is a natural parasitic microbe that stops the
proliferation of the harmful viruses inside the mosquito and reduces disease
transmission. It is difficult to sustain an infection of the maternal
transmitted Wolbachia in a wild mosquito population because of the reduced
fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and cytoplasmic incompatibility
limiting maternal transmission. The infection will only persist if the fraction
of the infected mosquitoes exceeds a minimum threshold. Our two-sex mosquito
model captures the complex transmission-cycle by accounting for heterosexual
transmission, multiple pregnant states for female mosquitoes, and the
aquatic-life stage. We identify important dimensionless numbers and analyze the
critical threshold condition for obtaining a sustained Wolbachia infection in
the natural population. This threshold effect is characterized by a backward
bifurcation with three coexisting equilibria of the system of differential
equations: a stable disease-free equilibrium, an unstable
intermediate-infection endemic equilibrium and a stable high-infection endemic
equilibrium. We perform sensitivity analysis on epidemiological and
environmental parameters to determine their relative importance to Wolbachia
transmission and prevalence. We also compare the effectiveness of different
integrated mitigation strategies and observe that the most efficient approach
to establish the Wolbachia infection is to first reduce the natural mosquitoes
and then release both infected males and pregnant females. The initial
reduction of natural population could be accomplished by either residual
spraying or ovitraps.

their derivatives, and allows bracketing/following the zeros of the plasma
dielectric function which corresponds to different roots of the ITG dispersion

of instability the unstable branch is rather asymmetric with oscillating
solutions towards lower wave numbers (i.e. drift waves), and damped solutions
toward higher wave numbers. This suggests a process akin to inverse cascade by

such as universal logic gates. The benefit of modular information processing,
in contrast to globally integrated information processing, is that complex
global computations are more easily and flexibly implemented via a series of
simpler, localized information processing operations which only control and
change local degrees of freedom. We show that, despite these benefits, there
are unavoidable thermodynamic costs to modularity---costs that arise directly
from the operation of localized processing and that go beyond Landauer's
dissipation bound for erasing information. Integrated computations can achieve
Landauer's bound, however, when they globally coordinate the control of all of
an information reservoir's degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, global
correlations among the information-bearing degrees of freedom are easily lost
by modular implementations. This is costly since such correlations are a
thermodynamic fuel. We quantify the minimum irretrievable dissipation of
modular computations in terms of the difference between the change in global
nonequilibrium free energy, which captures these global correlations, and the
local (marginal) change in nonequilibrium free energy, which bounds modular
work production. This modularity dissipation is proportional to the amount of
additional work required to perform the computational task modularly. It has
immediate consequences for physically embedded transducers, known as
information ratchets. We show how to circumvent modularity dissipation by
designing internal ratchet states that capture the global correlations and
patterns in the ratchet's information reservoir. Designed in this way,
information ratchets match the optimum thermodynamic efficiency of globally
integrated computations.

a flow-forming instability of the homogeneous turbulent state (`zonostrophic

demonstrated using the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework with a
closure at second order. Furthermore, it was shown that for small
supercriticality the flow-forming instability follows Ginzburg-Landau (G-L)
dynamics. Here, the SSD framework is used to study the equilibration of this
flow-forming instability for small supercriticality. First, we compare the
predictions of the weakly nonlinear G-L dynamics to the fully nonlinear SSD
dynamics closed at second order for a wide ranges of parameters. A new branch
of jet equilibria is revealed that is not contiguously connected with the G-L
branch. This new branch at weak supercriticalities involves jets with larger
amplitude compared to the ones of the G-L branch. Furthermore, this new branch
continues even for subcritical values with respect to the linear flow-forming
instability. Thus, a new nonlinear flow-forming instability out of homogeneous
turbulence is revealed. Second, we investigate how both the linear flow-forming
instability and the novel nonlinear flow-forming instability are equilibrated.
We identify the physical processes underlying the jet equilibration as well as
the types of eddies that contribute in each process. Third, we propose a
modification of the diffusion coefficient of the G-L dynamics that is able to
capture the asymmetric evolution for weak jets at scales other than the

based Reynolds number range from $Re_{\delta_2}=570$ to $13800$, with a
self-similar region from $Re_{\delta_2} = 10000$ to $12300$. Within this domain
the average non-dimensional pressure gradient parameter $\beta=39$, where for a
unit density $\beta=\delta_1 P_e^\prime / \tau_w$, with $\delta_1$ the
displacement thickness, $\tau_w$ the mean shear stress at the wall, and
$P_e^\prime$ the farfield pressure gradient. This flow is compared to previous
zero pressure gradient (ZPG) and mild APG TBL ($\beta=1$) results of similar
Reynolds number. All flows are generated via the DNS of a TBL on a flat surface
with farfield boundary conditions tailored to apply the desired pressure
gradient. The conditions for self-similarity, and the appropriate length and
velocity scales are derived. The mean and Reynolds stress profiles are shown to
collapse when non-dimensionalised on the basis of these length and velocity
scales. As the pressure gradient increases the flow has properties less like a
ZPG TBL and more akin to a free shear layer.

ranking of explanatory variables and, in settings of low correlations between
variables and strong true effect sizes, expect that variables at the very top
of this ranking are truly relevant to the response. In a regime of certain
sparsity levels, however, three examples of sequential procedures--forward
stepwise, the lasso, and least angle regression--are shown to include the first
spurious variable unexpectedly early. We derive a rigorous, sharp prediction of
the rank of the first spurious variable for these three procedures,
demonstrating that the first spurious variable occurs earlier and earlier as
the regression coefficients become denser. This counterintuitive phenomenon
persists for statistically independent Gaussian random designs and an
arbitrarily large magnitude of the true effects. We gain a better understanding
of the phenomenon by identifying the underlying cause and then leverage the
insights to introduce a simple visualization tool termed the double-ranking
diagram to improve on sequential methods. As a byproduct of these findings, we
obtain the first provable result certifying the exact equivalence between the
lasso and least angle regression in the early stages of solution paths beyond
orthogonal designs. This equivalence can seamlessly carry over many important
model selection results concerning the lasso to least angle regression.

of moduli space, we argue that the operator retains a finite gap and has a
ground state that differs from the CFT vacuum only by order one corrections. In
this region the torus operator is much like the cylinder operator. But in
another region of moduli space we find a puzzle. Although our ${\mathcal T}$ is
of the manifestly positive form $A^\dagger A$, studying the most tractable
phases of $\text{Tr}( {\mathcal T}^n)$ suggests that ${\mathcal T}$ has
negative eigenvalues. It seems clear that additional phases must become
relevant at large $n$, perhaps leading to novel behavior associated with a
radically different ground state or a much higher density of states. By
studying the action of two such torus operators on the CFT ground state, we
also provide evidence that, even at large $n$, the relevant bulk saddles have
$t=0$ surfaces with small genus.

a perturbative approximation. Here we apply this principle to a physical
implementation of quantum annealing in a D-Wave 2000Q system. We use samples
from the quantum annealing hardware and per-qubit anneal offsets to produce
nonuniform driver Hamiltonians. On small instances with severe perturbative
anticrossings, our algorithm yields an increase in minimum eigengaps, ground
state success probabilities, and escape rates from metastable valleys. We also
demonstrate that the same approach can mitigate biased sampling of degenerate

quantum critical point (dQCP) between the easy-plane antiferromagnet and the
VBS order on the square lattice may have an emergent O(4) symmetry, due to the
self-duality of the $N=2$ noncompact QED$_3$. Recent numerical progresses
suggest that this easy-plane dQCP does exist and it has an emergent O(4)
symmetry. But for the O(4) symmetry to really emerge at the dQCP, certain O(4)
symmetry breaking perturbations need to be irrelevant at the putative O(4)
fixed point. It is more convenient to study these symmetry breaking
perturbations in the $N=2$ noncompact QED$_3$. We demonstrate that a natural
large-$N$ generalization and a controlled $1/N$ expansion supports the
stability of the O(4) fixed point against the symmetry breaking perturbations.
We also develop the theory for two tricritical points close to the easy-plane
dQCP. One tricritical point is between the dQCP and a {\it self-dual} $Z_2$
topological order; the other is the tricritical point that connects the
continuous dQCP and a first order N\'{e}el-VBS transition, motivated by recent

consumers appropriate items (e.g., movies, news articles) according to the
current context including both the consumer and item content information.
However, such context information is often unavailable in practice for the
recommendation, where only the users' interaction data on items can be
utilized. Moreover, the lack of interaction records, especially for new users
and items, worsens the performance of recommendation further. To address these
issues, collaborative filtering (CF), one of the recommendation techniques
relying on the interaction data only, as well as the online multi-armed bandit
mechanisms, capable of achieving the balance between exploitation and
exploration, are adopted in the online interactive recommendation settings, by
assuming independent items (i.e., arms). Nonetheless, the assumption rarely
holds in reality, since the real-world items tend to be correlated with each
other (e.g., two articles with similar topics). In this paper, we study online
interactive collaborative filtering problems by considering the dependencies
among items. We explicitly formulate the item dependencies as the clusters on
arms, where the arms within a single cluster share the similar latent topics.
In light of the topic modeling techniques, we come up with a generative model
to generate the items from their underlying topics. Furthermore, an efficient

interference in heterogenous wireless communication systems with large number
of machine-type-devices (MTD). We consider a system with a
machine-type-aggregator (MTA) as underlay to cellular network with a multi
antenna base station (BS). Cellular users share uplink radio resources with
MTDs. Handling the interference from MTDs on the BS is the focus of this
article. Our method takes advantage of received interference diversity on BS at
each time on each resource block and allocates the radio resources to the MTD
with the minimum interference on the BS. In this method, BS does not need to
take the interference from MTD into account in the design of the receive
beamformer for uplink cellular user, hence, the degrees of freedom is not used
for interference management. Our simulation results show that each resource
block can be shared between a cellular user and an MTD, with almost no harmful
interference on the cellular user.

absorption coefficients using boundary measurements for a time dependent

quantify how the error is amplified in the process of reconstruction. In the
forward setting, the solution to the RTE behaves differently in different
regimes, and the stability of the inverse problem vary accordingly. In
particular, we consider two scalings in this paper. The first one concerns with
a diffusive scaling whose macroscopic limit is a diffusion equation. In this

analyze the coverage and link throughput of K users for the cooperative NOMA

cooperative NOMA can significantly improve the coverage and link throughput of

video-on-demand (VoD) services becomes increasingly important. By exploiting
the potential cache ability at the client side, the performance of VoD
multicast delivery can be improved through video segment pre-caching. In this
paper, we address the performance limits of client caching enabled VoD schemes
in wireless multicast networks with asynchronous requests. Both reactive and
proactive systems are investigated. Specifically, for the reactive system where
videos are transmitted on demand, we propose a joint cache allocation and
multicast delivery scheme to minimize the average bandwidth consumption under
the zero-delay constraint. For the proactive system where videos are
periodically broadcasted, a joint design of the cache-bandwidth allocation
algorithm and the delivery mechanism is developed to minimize the average
waiting time under the total bandwidth constraint. In addition to the full
access pattern where clients view videos in their entirety, we further consider
the access patterns with random endpoints, fixed-size intervals and downloading
demand, respectively. The impacts of different access patterns on the
resource-allocation algorithm and the delivery mechanism are elaborated.
Simulation results validate the accuracy of the analytical results and also
provide useful insights in designing VoD networks with client caching.

Oscillations (BAO), $\alpha_{\perp}D_{M, \text{fid}}(z)/r_{d,

Yet, at $ z_{\text{drag}} \simeq 1060$, $D_{M, \text{fid}}(1060)/r_{d,
\text{fid}}\simeq D_{M}(1060)/r_{d}$. Since $\alpha_{\perp}$ does not change
with increasing redshift, we conclude that the algorithms deviate from true
solutions with increasing $z$. We investigate that departure through an
assumption of a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. At the relatively low redshifts at
which isotropic BAO studies were performed, the divergence is smaller than
study uncertainties. However, while the transverse measure, $\alpha_{\perp}$
provides a reliable value in real space, not corrupted by redshift distortion,
the isotropic measure, $\alpha$, has a radial component, and is influenced by
redshift distortion. That distortion recommends against the inclusion of
isotropic studies in cosmological parameter evaluations. At the high redshifts
of Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO studies, $z\sim$ 2.35, the deviations of the
anisotropic BAO algorithms from the flat $\Lambda$CDM solutions give rise to
markedly deceptive results. We replicate an example, in which those algorithms
lead to a value of $\Omega_{m}$ which is more than 15 per cent lower than that
of the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology computation. The BAO algorithms are
inappropriate for the next generation of BAO studies. A flat $\Lambda$CDM
analysis offers an alternative means of assessment.

identified based on their optical and near-infrared colors. As part of the
Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, we have obtained $g$, $r$,
and $z$ band photometry of 26 TNOs using Subaru and Gemini Observatories.
Previous color surveys have not utilized $z$ band reflectance, and the
inclusion of this band reveals significant surface reflectance variations
between sub-populations. The colors of TNOs in $g-r$ and $r-z$ show obvious
structure, and appear consistent with the previously measured bi-modality in
$g-r$. The distribution of colors of the two dynamically excited surface types
can be modeled using the two-component mixing models from Fraser \& Brown
(2012). With the combination of $g-r$ and $r-z$, the dynamically excited
classes can be separated cleanly into red and neutral surface classes. In $g -
r$ and $r - z$, the two dynamically excited surface groups are also clearly
distinct from the cold classical TNO surfaces, which are red, with
$g-r\gtrsim$0.85 and $r-z\lesssim$0.6, while all dynamically excited objects
with similar $g-r$ colors exhibit redder $r-z$ colors. The $z$ band photometry
makes it possible for the first time to differentiate the red excited TNO
surfaces from the red cold classical TNO surfaces. The discovery of different
$r-z$ colors for these cold classical TNOs makes it possible to search for cold
classical surfaces in other regions of the Kuiper belt and to completely
separate cold classical TNOs from the dynamically excited population, which
overlaps in orbital parameter space.

pedestrian positions are updated at discrete time intervals. It takes into
account the major normal conditions of a simple pedestrian situated in a crowd

to simulate the pedestrian crowd realistically towards a simulation of
believable pedestrian behaviors. Typical pedestrian phenomena, including the
unidirectional and bidirectional movement in a corridor as well as the flow
through bottleneck, are simulated. The conducted simulations show that our
model is able to produce realistic pedestrian behaviors. The obtained
fundamental diagram and flow rate at bottleneck agree very well with classic

undirected, unweighted interval graphs with $k$ terminal vertices.
  To start with, we show that finding an optimal distance-preserving subgraph
is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for general graphs. Then, we show that every interval
graph admits a subgraph with $O(k)$ branching vertices that approximates
pairwise terminal distances up to an additive term of $+1$. We also present an
interval graph $G_{\mathrm{int}}$ for which the $+1$ approximation is necessary
to obtain the $O(k)$ upper bound on the number of branching vertices. In
particular, any distance-preserving subgraph of $G_{\mathrm{int}}$ has
$\Omega(k\log k)$ branching vertices. Furthermore, we prove that every interval
graph admits a distance-preserving subgraph with $O(k\log k)$ branching
vertices, implying that the $\Omega(k\log k)$ lower bound for interval graphs
is tight. To conclude, we show that there exists an interval graph such that
every optimal distance-preserving subgraph of it has $O(k)$ branching vertices

branching vertices and branching edges.
  The $O(k)$ bound for distance-approximating subgraphs follows from a na\""ive

constructed using bit-reversal permutation matrices. The $O(k\log k)$ bound for

t-> (e(t),p(t)), where e_i(t) and p_i(t) are the elastic and plastic
deformations of spring i, defined on [t0,\infty) by the initial condition

  After we rigorously convert the problem into a Moreau sweeping process with a
moving polyhedron C(t) in a vector space E of dimension d, it becomes natural
to expect (based on a result by Krejci) that the solution t->(e(t),p(t)) always
converges to a T-periodic function. The achievement of this paper is in
spotting a class of loadings where the Krejci's limit doesn't depend on the
initial condition (e(t0),p(t0)) and so all the trajectories approach the same
T-periodic regime. The proposed class of sweeping processes is the one for
which the normal vectors of any d different facets of the moving polyhedron
C(t) are linearly independent. We further link this geometric condition to
mechanical properties of the given network of springs. We discover that the
normal vectors of any d different facets of the moving polyhedron C(t) are
linearly independent, if the number of displacement-controlled loadings is two
less the number of nodes of the given network of springs and when the magnitude
of the stress-controlled loading is sufficiently large (but admissible). The
result can be viewed as an analogue of the high-gain control method for
elastoplastic systems. In continuum theory of plasticity, the respective result

data on radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of steep-spectrum sources and
multi-frequency source counts. The modeling indicates that the DE slowly
increase as $(1+z)^{0.3 \thicksim 1.3}$ out to $z \thicksim 0.8$, and then
rapidly decreases as $(1+z)^{-6.8 \thicksim -5.7}$, while the LE rapidly
increase as $(1+z)^{4.8}$ out to a higher redshift (at least $z>3.5$). We find
a high-redshift decline (i.e. redshift cutoff) in the number density of
steep-spectrum radio sources, but we cannot conclude whether such decline is
sharp or shallow. We believe that whether a redshift cutoff occurs or not
depends mainly on DE, while its steepness is decided by LE, which, however,
cannot be well constrained due to the lack of high-redshift samples. Most
intriguingly, according to our mixture evolution scenario, there appears to be
no need for different evolution for the low- and high-power radio-loud AGNs.

their allocation maximizes their utility; and the market clears (MC), meaning
that the price of unallocated goods is zero. EF is desirable to ensure the
long-term viability of the market. MC ensures that demand meets supply. Any
allocation that is part of a WE is also welfare-maximizing; however, it need
not be revenue-maximizing. Furthermore, WE need not exist, e.g., in markets
where bidders have combinatorial valuations. The traditional approach to
simultaneously addressing both existence and low revenue is to relax the MC
condition and instead require the price of unallocated goods be some, positive
reserve price. The resulting solution concept, known as Envy-Free Pricing
(EFP), has been studied in some special cases, e.g., single-minded bidders. In
this paper, we go one step further; we relax EF as well as MC. We propose a
relaxation of the EF condition where only winners are envy-free, and further
relax the MC condition so that unallocated goods are priced at least at the
reserve. We call this new solution concept Restricted Envy-Free Pricing (REFP).
We investigate what REFP entails for single-minded bidders, and show that for
size-interchangeable bidders (a generalization of single-minded introduced in
this paper) we can compute a REFP in polynomial time, given a fixed allocation.
As in the study of EFP, we remain interested in maximizing seller revenue.
Instead of computing an outcome that simultaneously yields an allocation and
corresponding prices, one could first solve for an allocation that respects a
reserve price, and then solve for a corresponding set of supporting prices,
each one at least the reserve. This two-step process fails in the case of EFP

prove that there are no sure profits via flash strategies if and only if asset

theory of processes and provides the most general formulation of the well-known
fact that, in an arbitrage-free financial market, asset prices (including
dividends) should not exhibit jumps of a predictable direction or magnitude at

small transaction costs and imply that, under minimal assumptions, price

materials holds a key to the characterization of the early solar system and the
Moon's formation. The Moon and Earth are chemically and isotopically very
similar. However, the Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements and the
origin of this depletion is still debated. We present gallium isotopic and
elemental measurements in a large set of lunar samples to constrain the origin
of this volatile depletion. We show that while Ga has a geochemical behavior
different from zinc, both elements show a systematic enrichment in the heavier
isotopes in lunar mare basalts and Mg-suite rocks compared to the silicate
Earth, pointing to a global-scale depletion event. On the other hand, the
ferroan anorthosites are isotopically heterogeneous, suggesting a secondary
distribution of Ga at the surface of the Moon by volatilization and
condensation. The isotopic difference of Ga between Earth and the Moon and the
isotopic heterogeneity of the crustal ferroan anorthosites suggest that the
volatile depletion occurred following the giant impact and during the lunar
magma ocean phase. These results point toward a Moon that has lost its volatile
elements during a whole-scale evaporation event and that is now relatively dry
compared to Earth.

proposed for the fiber-optical channel and have been extensively used in the
literature. Although these models are mainly developed for the low-power
regime, they are used at moderate or high powers as well. It remains unclear to
what extent the capacity of these models is affected by the simplifying
assumptions under which they are derived. In this paper, we consider single
channel data transmission based on three continuous-time optical models i) a
regular perturbative channel, ii) a logarithmic perturbative channel, and iii)
the stochastic nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) channel. We apply two simplifying
assumptions on these channels to obtain analytically tractable discrete-time
models. Namely, we neglect the channel memory (fiber dispersion) and we use a
sampling receiver. These assumptions bring into question the physical relevance
of the models studied in the paper. Therefore, the results should be viewed as
a first step toward analyzing more realistic channels. We investigate the
per-sample capacity of the simplified discrete-time models. Specifically, i) we
establish tight bounds on the capacity of the regular perturbative channel; ii)
we obtain the capacity of the logarithmic perturbative channel; and iii) we
present a novel upper bound on the capacity of the zero-dispersion NLS channel.
Our results illustrate that the capacity of these models departs from each
other at high powers because these models yield different capacity pre-logs.
Since all three models are based on the same physical channel, our results
highlight that care must be exercised in using simplified channel models in the
high-power regime.

Instability in a relativisitically expanding striped wind. This instability is
the generalization of Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the presence of a magnetic
field. It has been suggested to produce a self-sustained acceleration mechanism
in strongly magnetized outflows found in active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray
bursts, and micro-quasars. The instability leads to magnetic reconnection, but
in contrast with steady-state Sweet-Parker reconnection, the dissipation rate
is not limited by the current layer's small aspect ratio. We performed
two-dimensional (2D) relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations
featuring two cold and highly magnetized ($1\leq\sigma\leq10^{3}$) plasma
layers with an anti-parallel magnetic field separated by a thin layer of
relativistically hot plasma with a local effective gravity induced by the
outflow's acceleration. Our simulations show how the heavier relativistically
hot plasma in the reconnecting layer drips out and allows oppositely oriented
magnetic field lines to reconnect. The instability's growth rate in the linear
regime matches the predictions of linear stability analysis. We find turbulence
rather than an ordered bulk flow near the reconnection region, with turbulent
velocities up to $\sim0.1$c, largely independent of model parameters. However,
the magnetic energy dissipation rate is found to be much slower, corresponding
to an effective ordered bulk velocity inflow into the reconnection region
$v_{\rm in}=\beta_{\rm in}c$, of $10^{-3}\lesssim\beta_{\rm in}\lesssim
5\times10^{-3}$. This occurs due to the slow evacuation of hot plasma from the
current layer, largely because of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability experienced
by the dripping plasma. 3D RMHD simulations are needed to further investigate

classification to mitigate insufficient labeled data problem in medical domain.
Instead of direct transfer learning from source to small number of labeled
target data, we propose a modality-bridge transfer learning which employs the
bridge database in the same medical imaging acquisition modality as target
database. By learning the projection function from source to bridge and from
bridge to target, the domain difference between source (e.g., natural images)
and target (e.g., X-ray images) can be mitigated. Experimental results show
that the proposed method can achieve a high classification performance even for
a small number of labeled target medical images, compared to various transfer

coverage, it is certain that 5G networks will be even more heterogeneous and
dense. However, as smaller cells are introduced in the network, interference
will inevitably become a serious problem as they are expected to share the same
radio resources. Another central feature envisioned for future cellular
networks is carrier aggregation (CA), which allows users to simultaneously use
several component carriers of various widths and frequency bands. By exploiting
the diversity of the different carriers, CA can also be used to effectively
mitigate the interference in the network. In this paper, we leverage the above
key features of next-generation cellular networks and formulate a downlink
power setting problem for the different available carriers. Using game theory,
we design a distributed algorithm that lets cells dynamically adjust different
transmit powers for the different carriers. The proposed solution greatly
improves network performance by reducing interference and power consumption,
while ensuring coverage for as many users as possible. We compare our scheme to
other interference mitigation techniques, in a realistic large-scale scenario.

goal to generate high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) input

patch-to-patch mapping from LR to HR images and are regardless of the
contextual interdependency between patches, we propose a novel Attention-aware
Face Hallucination (Attention-FH) framework which resorts to deep reinforcement
learning for sequentially discovering attended patches and then performing the
facial part enhancement by fully exploiting the global interdependency of the
image. Specifically, in each time step, the recurrent policy network is
proposed to dynamically specify a new attended region by incorporating what
happened in the past. The state (i.e., face hallucination result for the whole
image) can thus be exploited and updated by the local enhancement network on
the selected region. The Attention-FH approach jointly learns the recurrent
policy network and local enhancement network through maximizing the long-term
reward that reflects the hallucination performance over the whole image.
Therefore, our proposed Attention-FH is capable of adaptively personalizing an
optimal searching path for each face image according to its own characteristic.
Extensive experiments show our approach significantly surpasses the
state-of-the-arts on in-the-wild faces with large pose and illumination
variations.

neutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition
in order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology.
Whereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded
events, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic
solution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid
the design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes
the use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which
individual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology.
Many tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and,
together, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper
describes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools
used to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE
detector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are
presented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state
event topologies.

with infinite Prandtl number is studied by means of upper bounds on the Nusselt
number $Nu$ as a function of the Marangoni number $Ma$. Using the background
method for the temperature field, it has recently been proven by Hagstrom &
Doering that $ Nu\leq 0.838\,Ma^{2/7}$. In this work we extend previous
background method analysis to include balance parameters and derive a
variational principle for the bound on $Nu$, expressed in terms of a scaled
background field, that yields a better bound than Hagstrom & Doering's
formulation at a given $Ma$. Using a piecewise-linear, monotonically decreasing
profile we then show that $Nu \leq 0.803\,Ma^{2/7}$, lowering the previous
prefactor by 4.2%. However, we also demonstrate that optimisation of the
balance parameters does not affect the asymptotic scaling of the optimal bound
achievable with Hagstrom & Doering's original formulation. We subsequently
utilise convex optimisation to optimise the bound on $Nu$ over all admissible
background fields, as well as over two smaller families of profiles constrained
by monotonicity and convexity. The results show that $Nu \leq O(Ma^{2/7}(\ln
Ma)^{-1/2})$ when the background field has a non-monotonic boundary layer near
the surface, while a power-law bound with exponent 2/7 is optimal within the
class of monotonic background fields. Further analysis of our upper-bounding
principle reveals the role of non-monotonicity, and how it may be exploited in
a rigorous mathematical argument.

introduced by conventional techniques for thermal conductivity measurements can
lead to unreliable results when applied to nanostructures, because heaters and

analytical models used for the interpretation of the 3$\omega$ data, we propose
to use a numerical solution, performed by means of finite element modeling, of

production in the North Sea, Indonesia and Mexico were used to model the future
maximum possible oil production per annum in all larger countries and regions
of the planet from 2015 to 2050.
  In part II, the oil export and oil consumption patterns, that were
established in recent decades, are combined with the consequences of the
forecast declines in regional oil production that were developed in part I of
this analysis. The results are quantitative predictions of the maximum possible
region-by-region oil consumption during the next 20 years.
  The predictions indicate that several of the larger oil consuming and
importing countries and regions will be confronted with the economic
consequences of the onset of the world's final oil supply crisis as early as
2020. In particular, during the next few years a reduction of the average per
capita oil consumption of about 5%/year is predicted for most OECD countries in
Western Europe, and slightly smaller reductions, about 2-3%/year, is predicted
for all other oil importing countries and regions. The consequences of the
predicted oil supply crisis are thoroughly at odds with business-as-usual,
never-ending-global-growth predictions of oil production and consumption.

problems (SS-VRP) aim at modeling and solving real-life operational problems by
considering uncertainty on data. We consider the SS-VRPTW-CR introduced in
Saint-Guillain et al. (2017). Like the SS-VRP introduced by Bertsimas (1992),
we search for optimal first stage routes for a fleet of vehicles to handle a
set of stochastic customer demands, i.e., demands are uncertain and we only
know their probabilities. In addition to capacity constraints, customer demands
are also constrained by time windows. Unlike all SS-VRP variants, the
SS-VRPTW-CR does not make any assumption on the time at which a stochastic
demand is revealed, i.e., the reveal time is stochastic as well. To handle this
new problem, we introduce waiting locations: Each vehicle is assigned a
sequence of waiting locations from which it may serve some associated demands,
and the objective is to minimize the expected number of demands that cannot be
satisfied in time. In this paper, we propose two new recourse strategies for
the SS-VRPTW-CR, together with their closed-form expressions for efficiently
computing their expectations: The first one allows us to take vehicle
capacities into account; The second one allows us to optimize routes by
avoiding some useless trips. We propose two algorithms for searching for routes
with optimal expected costs: The first one is an extended branch-and-cut
algorithm, based on a stochastic integer formulation, and the second one is a
local search based heuristic method. We also introduce a new public benchmark
for the SS-VRPTW-CR, based on real-world data coming from the city of Lyon. We
evaluate our two algorithms on this benchmark and empirically demonstrate the
expected superiority of the SS-VRPTW-CR anticipative actions over a basic
""wait-and-serve"" policy.

versatile nanostructures. Here, we present the application of low temperature
solution processed ZnO/Al-doped ZnO (AZO) bilayer thin film as electron
transport layers (ETLs) in the inverted perovskite solar cells, which provide a
stair-case band profile. Experimental results revealed that the power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells were significantly
increased from 12.25 to 16.07% by employing the AZO thin film as the buffer
layer. Meanwhile, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage

interface in ETL with stair-case band alignment of ZnO/AZO/CH3NH3PbI3, which
allows more efficient extraction of photogenerated electrons in the CH3NH3PbI3

These ecosystems are characterized by multiple type of interactions, in

ecosystem stability should decrease as the number of species in the community
increases and that cooperative systems are less stable than communities with
only competitive and/or exploitative interactions. Here we propose a stochastic
model of population dynamics, which includes exploitative interactions as well
as cooperative interactions induced by cross-feeding. The model is exactly
solved and we obtain results for relevant macro-ecological patterns, such as
species abundance distributions and correlation functions. In the large system
size limit, any number of species can coexist for a very general class of
interaction networks and stability increases as the number of species grows.
For pure mutualistic/commensalistic interactions we determine the topological
properties of the network that guarantee species coexistence. We also show that
the stationary state is globally stable and that inferring species interactions
through species abundance correlation analysis may be misleading. Our
theoretical approach thus show that appropriate models of cooperation naturally
leads to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability

supermassive black holes and, in turn, yield important clues about how the
Universe evolved since the first (Pop III) stars started forming. Yet even
basic questions regarding the seeds of these objects and their growth mechanism
remain unanswered. The anticipated launch of eROSITA and ATHENA is expected to
facilitate observations of high-redshift quasars needed to resolve these
issues. In this paper, we compare accretion-based supermassive black hole
growth in the concordance LCDM model with that in the alternative
Friedmann-Robertson Walker cosmology known as the R_h=ct universe. Previous
work has shown that the timeline predicted by the latter can account for the
origin and growth of the > 10^9 M_sol highest redshift quasars better than that
of the standard model. Here, we significantly advance this comparison by
determining the soft X-ray flux that would be observed for Eddington-limited
accretion growth as a function of redshift in both cosmologies. Our results
indicate that a clear difference emerges between the two in terms of the number
of detectable quasars at redshift z > 6, raising the expectation that the next
decade will provide the observational data needed to discriminate between these
two models based on the number of detected high-redshift quasar progenitors.
For example, while the upcoming ATHENA mission is expected to detect ~0.16

landslide prediction studies. These units hierarchically subdivide the
geographic space from the highest grid-based resolution to the stronger
morphodynamic-oriented slope units. Here we integrate both mapping units into a
single hierarchical model, by treating the landslide triggering locations as a
random point pattern. This approach diverges fundamentally from the unanimously
used presence-absence structure for areal units since we focus on modeling the
expected landslide count jointly within the two mapping units. Predicting this
landslide intensity provides more detailed and complete information as compared
to the classically used susceptibility mapping approach based on relative
probabilities. To illustrate the model's versatility, we compute absolute
probability maps of landslide occurrences and check its predictive power over

models for landslides only in the sense that covariates are spatially
distributed, no actual spatial dependence has been explicitly integrated so far

temperatures, is a powerful means to investigate the structure of accretion

material is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk
motion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first
time the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a
Doppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This
test should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,
and constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in
the X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the
position of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW
Hya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that
the plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with
respect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this
X-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the
accretion stream, and not in coronal structures. The comparison of the observed
velocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with the inferred intrinsic
velocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that the
footpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on
the stellar surface. Our results indicate that complex magnetic field
geometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude accretion spots.
Moreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very
similar to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550
Ang, as found by Ardila et al. (2013), then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at
0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions.

within the Markov Stability framework, which uses the diffusion of a Markov
process on the graph to uncover intrinsic network substructures across all
scales. Here we reformulate multiscale community detection as a max-sum length
vector partitioning problem with respect to the set of time-dependent node
vectors expressed in terms of eigenvectors of the transition matrix. This
formulation provides a geometric interpretation of Markov Stability in terms of
a time-dependent spectral embedding, where the Markov time acts as an
inhomogeneous geometric resolution factor that zooms the components of the node
vectors at different rates. Our geometric formulation encompasses both
modularity and the multi-resolution Potts model, which are shown to correspond
to vector partitioning in a pseudo-Euclidean space, and is also linked to
spectral partitioning methods, where the number of eigenvectors used
corresponds to the dimensionality of the underlying embedding vector space.
Inspired by the Louvain optimisation for community detection, we then propose
an algorithm based on a graph-theoretical heuristic for the vector partitioning
problem. We apply the algorithm to the spectral optimisation of modularity and
Markov Stability community detection. The spectral embedding based on the
transition matrix eigenvectors leads to improved partitions with higher
information content and higher modularity than the eigen-decomposition of the
modularity matrix. We illustrate the results with random network benchmarks.

techniques have consequences on observable post-starburst galaxy parameters,
such as colour, morphology and environment and how this affects interpretations
of their role in the galaxy duty cycle. We identify a master sample of
H$\delta$ strong (EW$_{H\delta}$ > 3\AA) post-starburst galaxies from the
value-added catalogue in the 7th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS DR7) over a redshift range 0.01 < $z$ < 0.1. From this sample we select
two E+A subsets, both having a very little [OII] emission (EW$_{[OII]}$ $>
-2.5$\AA) but one having an additional cut on EW$_{H\alpha}$ ($> -3$\AA). We
examine the differences in observables and AGN fractions to see what effect the
H$\alpha$ cut has on the properties of post-starburst galaxies and what these
differing samples can tell us about the duty cycle of post-starburst galaxies.
We find that H$\delta$ strong galaxies peak in the `blue cloud', E+As in the
`green valley' and pure E+As in the `red sequence'. We also find that pure E+As
have a more early-type morphology and a higher fraction in denser environments
compared with the H$\delta$ strong and E+A galaxies. These results suggest that
there is an evolutionary sequence in the post-starburst phase from blue disky
galaxies with residual star formation to passive red early-types.

Here, we unveil the existence and analyse this phase in a chiral multiferroic
model system. Conventionally, MBL occurrence is traced via level statistics by
implementing a standard finite-size scaling procedure. Here, we present an
approach based on the full distribution of the ratio of adjacent energy
spacings. We find a strong broadening of the histograms of counts of these
level spacings directly at the transition point from MBL to the ergodic phase.
The broadening signals reliably the transition point without relying on an
averaging procedure. The fast convergence of the histograms even for relatively
small systems allows moni- toring the MBL dynamics with much less computational
effort. Numerical results are presented for a chiral spin chain with a
dynamical Dzyaloshinskii Moriya (DM) interaction, an established model to
describe the spin excitations in a single phase spin-driven multiferroic
system. The multiferroic MBL phase is uncovered and it is shown how to steer it
via electric fields.

muons from hydrogen to heavier gases is necessary for this purpose. In June
2014, within a preliminary experiment, a pressurized gas-target was exposed to
the pulsed low-energy muon beam at the RIKEN RAL muon facility (Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory, UK). The main goal of the test was the characterization of
both the noise induced by the pulsed beam and the X-ray detectors. The
apparatus, to some extent rudimental, has served admirably to this task.
Technical results have been published that prove the validity of the choices
made and pave the way for the next steps. This paper presents the results of
physical relevance of measurements of the muon transfer rate to carbon dioxide,
oxygen, and argon from non-thermalized excited mu-p atoms. The analysis
methodology and the approach to the systematics errors are useful for the
subsequent study of the transfer rate as function of the kinetic energy of the

common approaches of utilizing embeddings for IR is to estimate the

syntactic usage are usually very close to each other in the embeddings space,
although they are not semantically similar, the D2Q similarity approach may
suffer from the problem of ""multiple degrees of similarity"". To this end, this

increasing data locality. Unlike traditional loop fusion or blocking, the loops
may have different iteration spaces and access shared datasets through indirect
memory accesses, such as A[map[i]] -- hence the name ""sparse"". One notable
example of such loops arises in discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods,
because of the computation of numerical integrals over different domains (e.g.,
cells, facets). The major challenge with sparse tiling is implementation -- not
only is it cumbersome to understand and synthesize, but it is also onerous to
maintain and generalize, as it requires a complete rewrite of the bulk of the
numerical computation. In this article, we propose an approach to extend the
applicability of sparse tiling based on raising the level of abstraction.
Through a sequence of compiler passes, the mathematical specification of a
problem is progressively lowered, and eventually sparse-tiled C for-loops are
generated. Besides automation, we advance the state-of-the-art by introducing:
a revisited, more efficient sparse tiling algorithm; support for
distributed-memory parallelism; a range of fine-grained optimizations for
increased run-time performance; implementation in a publicly-available library,

Population A and B sources. H{\beta} serves as an estimator of black hole mass,
Eddington ratio and source rest frame, the latter a valuable input for
Civ{\lambda}1549 studies which allow us to isolate the blueshifted wind
component. Optical and HST-UV spectra yield H{\beta} and Civ{\lambda}1549
spectra for low-luminosity sources while VLT-ISAAC and FORS and TNG-LRS provide
spectra for high Luminosity sources. New high S/N data for Civ in
high-luminosity quasars are presented here for comparison with the other
previously published data. Comparison of H{\beta} and Civ{\lambda}1549 profile
widths/shifts indicates that much of the emission from the two lines arise in
regions with different structure and kinematics. Covering a wide range of
luminosity and redshift shows evidence for a correlation between
Civ{\lambda}1549 blueshift and source Eddington ratio, with a weaker trend with
source luminosity (similar amplitude outflows are seen over 4 of the 5 dex
luminosity range in our combined samples). At low luminosity (z < 0.7) only
Population A sources show evidence for a significant outflow while at high
luminosity the outflow signature begins to appear in Population B quasars as
well.

complicated because of the exponential growth of Hilbert space. Mean-field

the generalized many-body representation is highly desirable. In this respect,
the rotational-invariant slave boson (RISB) approach in its mean-field

its original form, due to numerical complexity, the RISB approach is limited to
about three correlated orbitals per lattice site. We thus present a thorough
symmetry-adapted advancement of RISB theory, suited to efficiently deal with
multi-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonians for complete atomic-shell manifolds. It is
utilized to study the intriguing problem of Hund's physics for three- and
especially five-orbital manifolds on the correlated lattice, including
crystal-field terms as well as spin-orbit interaction. The well-known
Janus-face phenomenology, i.e. strenghtening of correlations at

flow is studied in the case where the particles undergo inelastic collisions
with the solid object. The collision efficiency, which gives the flux of
particles experiencing at least one bounce on the sphere, is found to depend
upon the sphere Reynolds number only through the value of the critical Stokes
number below which no collision occurs. In the absence of molecular diffusion,
it is demonstrated that multiple bounces do not provide enough energy
dissipation for the particles to stick to the surface within a finite time.
This excludes the possibility of any kind of inelastic collapse, so that
determining an accretion efficiency requires modelling more precisely
particle-surface microphysical interactions. A straightforward choice is to
assume that the particles stick when their kinetic energy at impact is below a
threshold. In this view, numerical simulations are performed in order to
describe the statistics of impact velocities at various values of the Reynolds
number. Successive bounces are shown to enhance accretion. These results are
put together in order to provide a general qualitative picture on how the
accretion efficiency depends upon the non dimensional parameters of the

due to the misalignment between individual and social objectives. The focus of
this paper is to design a new mechanism framework that induces an efficient and
fair equilibrium in a general class of games. To achieve this goal, we propose
a taxation framework, which first imposes a tax on each player based on the
perceived payoff (income), and then redistributes the collected tax to other
players properly. By turning the tax rate, this framework spans the continuum
space between strategic interactions (of selfish players) and altruistic
interactions (of unselfish players), hence provides rich modeling
possibilities. The key challenge in the design of this framework is the proper
taxing rule (i.e., the tax exemption and tax rate) that induces the desired
equilibrium in a wide range of games. First, we propose a flat tax rate (i.e.,
a single tax rate for all players), which is necessary and sufficient for
achieving an efficient equilibrium in any static strategic game with common
knowledge. Then, we provide several tax exemption rules that achieve some
typical fairness criterions (such as the Max-min fairness) at the equilibrium.
We further illustrate the implementation of the framework in the game of
Prisoners' Dilemma.

between possible companions (secondaries) and giants (primaries) is chosen as
M_B = -19 and M_R = -20, respectively for the two catalogs. We have created
pseudo-clusters by shuffling positions or velocities of the primaries and
search for significant over-densities of possible companions around giants by
comparison with the data. This method was developed and applied first to the
Virgo cluster by Ferguson (1992). In a second approach we introduced a modified
nearest neighbor analysis using several interaction parameters for all
galaxies. We find evidence for some excesses due to possible companions for
both catalogs. Satellites are typically found among the faintest dwarfs (M_B <
-16) around high-luminosity primaries. The most significant excesses are found
around very luminous late-type giants (spirals) in the outskirts, which is
expected in an infall scenario of cluster evolution. A rough estimate for an
upper limit of bound galaxies within Coma is 2 - 4 percent, to be compared with
ca. 7 percent for Virgo. The results agree well with the expected low frequency

illuminated (the emissivity profile) by X-rays emitted from the continuum
source above the black hole (corona). The differences in the emissivity
profiles produced by various corona geometries are explored via general
relativistic ray tracing simulations. Through the analysis of various
parameters of the geometries simulated it is found that emissivity profiles
produced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical slabs and
spheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles
produced by point source and conical geometries are not significantly
different, requiring an analysis of reflection fraction to differentiate the
two geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources are also simulated in
an effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most
evident in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an
approximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and
velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the
various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral
differences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most
extreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in
distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high quality spectral
data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with
reflection fraction, timing, and spectral analysis we may use emissivity
profiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.

on the example of the spin system described by the XXZ Heisenberg model with
external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian of the resulting nonlinear scalar
field theory is derived for arbitrary value of the anisotropy parameter
$\Delta$. We show that the linear scalar field theory is reconstructed in the
large spin limit. For $\Delta=1$ a non-relativistic scalar field theory
satisfying the Born reciprocity principle is recovered. As expected, for the
vanishing anisotropy parameter $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ the standard relativistic
Klein-Gordon field is obtained. Various aspects of the obtained class of the
scalar fields are studied, including the fate of the relativistic symmetries
and the properties of the emerging interaction terms. We show that, in a
certain limit, the so-called polymer quantisation of the field variables is
recovered. This and other discussed properties suggest a possible relevance of
the considered framework in the context of quantum gravity.

remaining comparable in computational time, even if no parallelisation is being

simulations, we can treat the sharp ($\delta$-function) contribution from
spinwaves (magnons) and a continuum at higher energy. The results for the
Heisenberg model agree with neutron scattering experiments on
Cu(DCOO)$_2$$\cdot$4D$_2$O, where a broad spectral-weight continuum at
$q=(\pi,0)$ was interpreted as deconfined spinons. Our results at $(\pi,0)$
show a similar reduction of the magnon weight and a large continuum, while the
continuum is much smaller at $q=(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ (as also seen experimentally).
Turning on $Q$, we observe a rapid reduction of the $(\pi,0)$ magnon weight to
zero, well before the deconfined quantum phase transition into a spontaneously
dimerized state. We re-interpret the picture of deconfined spinons at $(\pi,0)$
in the experiments as nearly deconfined spinons---a precursor to deconfined
quantum criticality. To further elucidate the picture of a fragile
$(\pi,0)$-magnon in the Heisenberg model and its depletion in the $J$-$Q$
model, we introduce an effective model in which a magnon can split into two
spinons that do not separate but fluctuate in and out of the magnon space (in
analogy with the resonance between a photon and a particle-hole pair in the
exciton-polariton problem). The model reproduces the $(\pi,0)$ and
$(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ features of the Heisenberg model. It can also account for the
rapid loss of the $(\pi,0)$ magnon with increasing $Q$ and a remarkable
persistence of a large magnon pole at $q=(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ even at the deconfined
critical point.

applications in the field of spintronics. PtBi$_2$ is one of such interesting
compounds showing large linear magnetoresistance (MR) in its both the hexagonal
and pyrite crystal structure. We use angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the
mechanism of liner MR observed in the hexagonal PtBi$_2$. Our results uncover
for the first time linear dispersive surface Dirac states at the
$\bar{\Gamma}$-point, crossing Fermi level with node at a binding energy of
$\approx$ 900 meV, in addition to the previously reported Dirac states at the
$\bar{M}$-point in the same compound. We further notice from our dichroic
measurements that these surface states show an asymmetric spectral intensity
when measured with left and right circularly polarized light, hinting at a
substantial spin polarization of the bands. Following these observations, we
suggest that the linear dispersive Dirac states at the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and
$\bar{M}$-points are likely to play a crucial role for the linear field
dependent magnetoresistance recorded in this compound.

show that at high magnetic fields, long range spin correlation functions decay
rapidly, signaling a transition to a long-sought-after field-induced quantum

that guides its operation using provided hints, the Hint-Based Adaptive Random
Prioritization - HARP. Hints are indications or suggestions provided by
developers about error-prone functionalities. As hints may be hard to collect
automatically, we also propose an approach of collecting them. To validate our
findings, we performed an experiment measuring the effect of introducing hints
to HARP. It shows that hints can improve HARP's performance comparing to its
baseline. Then, we investigated the ability of developers/managers to provide
good hints and used them in a case study. This analysis showed that developers
and managers are able to provide useful hints, which improves HARP's fault
detection comparing to its baseline. Nonetheless, the provided hints should be
consensual among the development team members.

(VLA) observations at 7mm were included in the analysis. A simulated annealing
algorithm was invoked to search for the optimum model. The radiative transfer
analysis demonstrates that most radial components (i.e., >6AU) of the disk
become optically thin at a wavelength of 7mm, which allows us to constrain, for
the first time, the dust density distribution in the inner region of the disk.
We found that a homogeneous grain size distribution is not sufficient to
explain the observed images at different wavelengths simultaneously, while
models with a shallower grain size distribution in the inner disk work well. We
found clear evidence that larger grains are trapped in the first bright ring.
Our results imply that dust evolution has already taken place in the disk at a
relatively young (i.e., ~1Myr) age. We compared the midplane temperature
distribution, optical depth, and properties of various dust rings with those
reported previously. Using the Toomre parameter, we briefly discussed the
gravitational instability as a potential mechanism for the origin of the dust

proposed to order test cases for achieving a goal during test execution,
particularly, revealing faults sooner. In the Model-Based Testing (MBT)
context, such techniques are usually based on heuristics related to structural
elements of the model and derived test cases. In this sense, techniques'
performance may vary due to a number of factors. While empirical studies
comparing the performance of TCP techniques have already been presented in
literature, there is still little knowledge, particularly in the MBT context,
about which factors may influence the outcomes suggested by a TCP technique. In
a previous family of empirical studies focusing on labeled transition systems,
we identified that the model layout, i.e. amount of branches, joins, and loops
in the model, alone may have little influence on the performance of TCP
techniques investigated, whereas characteristics of test cases that actually
fail definitely influences their performance. However, we considered only
synthetic artifacts in the study, which reduced the ability of representing
properly the reality. In this paper, we present a replication of one of these
studies, now with a larger and more representative selection of techniques and
considering test suites from industrial applications as experimental objects.
Our objective is to find out whether the results remain while increasing the
validity in comparison to the original study. Results reinforce that there is
no best performer among the investigated techniques and characteristics of test
cases that fail represent an important factor, although adaptive random based
techniques are less affected by it.

embed items into a latent space such that they optimize a supervised objective
in that latent space. The dimensions of the latent space have no clear
semantics, and this reduces the interpretability of the system. For example, in
personalization models, it is hard to explain why a particular item is ranked
high for a given user profile. We propose a novel model of representation
learning called Supervised Explicit Semantic Analysis (SESA) that is trained in
a supervised fashion to embed items to a set of dimensions with explicit

explicit space, where each dimension corresponds to a concept from a knowledge
base. This work extends Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) with a supervised
model for ranking problems. We apply this model to the task of Job-Profile

cranking model (MCRM) for nuclear collective rotation about a single axis and
its coupling to intrinsic motion is generalized. This generalization allow us
to consider the limit of vanishingly small collective angular velocity and
hence collective angular momentum while the collective moment of inertia
remains finite. In this limit, the collective flow become large and oppose one
another collaborating the vanishing of the collective angular momentum. In this
limit, the MCRM equation for the angular-momentum constraint on the intrinsic
wavefunction becomes identical to that of the conventional cranking model
(CCRM). In this limit, the MCRM Schrodinger equation also becomes identical to
that of the CCRM with an added irrotational-flow kinetic energy component. In
this limit, the time-reversal invariance of the MCRM Schrodinger equation is
destroyed. The two MCRM equations (with no free parameters) are solved for the
ground-state rotational band in the nucleus for a simple deformed harmonic
oscillator potential. The predicted excitation energy and quadrupole moment are
close to those observed empirically, with the differences seemingly
attributable to the absence, in the model, of pairing correlations at low
angular momenta and Coriolis-force induced quasi-particle rotation alignment at
higher angular momenta. The ground-state terminal (cut-off) angular momentum is
predicted to be 10 instead of 8 observed empirically and predicted by the CCRM.
It is assumed that pairing correlations would reduce the cut-off angular

equilibrium. A two-part solution to this cosmic initial entropy problem is
proposed. Following Penrose, we argue that the evenly distributed matter of the
early universe is equivalent to low gravitational entropy. There are two
competing explanations for how this initial low gravitational entropy comes
about. (1) Inflation and baryogenesis produce a virtually homogeneous
distribution of matter with a low gravitational entropy. (2) Dissatisfied with
explaining a low gravitational entropy as the product of a 'special' scalar
field, some theorists argue (following Boltzmann) for a 'more natural' initial
condition in which the entire universe is in an initial equilibrium state of
maximum entropy. In this equilibrium model, our observable universe is an
unusual low entropy fluctuation embedded in a high entropy universe. The
anthropic principle and the fluctuation theorem suggest that this low entropy
region should be as small as possible and have as large an entropy as possible,
consistent with our existence. However, our low entropy universe is much larger
than needed to produce observers, and we see no evidence for an embedding in a
higher entropy background. The initial conditions of inflationary models are as
natural as the equilibrium background favored by many theorists.

variation we called ECI+. It was brought to our attention that the definition
of ECI+ was equivalent to the variation of the metric proposed in 2012. We have
verified this claim, and found that while the equations are not exactly the
same, they are similar enough to be our own oversight. More importantly, we now
ask: how many variations of the original ECI work? In this paper we provide a
simple unifying framework to explore multiple variations of ECI, including both
the original 2009 ECI and the 2012 variation. We found that a large fraction of
variations have a similar predictive power, indicating that the chance of
finding a variation of ECI that works, after the seminal 2009 measure, are
surprisingly high. In fact, more than 28 percent of these variations have a
predictive power that is within 90 percent of the maximum for any variation.
These findings show that, once the idea of measuring economic complexity was
out, creating a variation with a similar predictive power (like the ones
proposed in 2012) was trivial (a 1 in 3 shot). More importantly, the result
show that using exports data to measure the knowledge intensity of an economy
is a robust phenomenon that works for multiple functional forms. Moreover, the
fact that multiple variations of the 2009 ECI perform close to the maximum,
tells us that no variation of ECI will have a performance that is substantially
better. This suggests that research efforts should focus on uncovering the
mechanisms that contribute to the diffusion and accumulation of productive
knowledge instead of on exploring small variations to existing measures.

proposed temporal stochastic differential equations with case specific drift

model porous media. A new method is proposed to extend the state space of

extremely low velocities in particle trajectories and extend the applicability

classical models of finite-state processes communicating through FIFO perfect
channels and timed automata, in the sense that the finite-state processes are
replaced by timed automata, and messages inside the perfect channels are
equipped with clocks representing their ages. In addition to the standard
operations (resetting clocks, checking guards of clocks) each automaton can
either (1) append a message to the tail of a channel with an initial age or (2)
receive the message at the head of a channel if its age satisfies a set of
given constraints. In this paper, we show that the reachability problem is
undecidable even in the case of two timed automata connected by one
unidirectional timed channel if one allows global clocks (that the two automata
can check and manipulate). We prove that this undecidability still holds even
for CTA consisting of three timed automata and two unidirectional timed
channels (and without any global clock). However, the reachability problem
becomes decidable (in $\mathsf{EXPTIME}$) in the case of two automata linked
with one unidirectional timed channel and with no global clock. Finally, we
consider the bounded-context case, where in each context, only one timed
automaton is allowed to receive messages from one channel while being able to
send messages to all the other timed channels. In this case we show that the
reachability problem is decidable.

zeta function $\zeta(s), \ s = \sigma + it, \quad 0<\sigma<1, \quad t>0 , \
t\to\infty,$ can be expressed in terms of a transcendental sum. The sharp
estimation of this sum remains one of the most important open problems in
mathematics with a long and illustrious history. Lindel\""of's hypothesis states
that for $\sigma=1/2$, this sum is of order $O\left(t^\varepsilon\right)$ for
every $\varepsilon>0$. We have recently introduced a novel approach for
estimating such transcendental sums: we have first embedded the Riemann zeta
function in a certain Riemann-Hilbert problem and we have began the analysis of
the large $t$-asymptotics of the associated integral equation. The asymptotic
analysis of the resulting integral equation requires the further splitting of
the relevant interval of integration into four subintervals which are defined
in terms of the small positive numbers $\{\delta_j\}_1^4$. The rigorous
asymptotic analysis of the first two relevant integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, was
performed in [F]. Here, the rigorous analysis is performed of the last two
integrals, $I_3$ and $I_4$. The combination of the above results yields a proof
for the analogue of Lindel{\""o}f's hypothesis for a slight variant of the
transcendental sum characterising the large $t$-asymptotics of $|\zeta(s)|^2$,
namely for a sum which differs from the latter sum only in the occurrence of a
logarithmic term which is larger than $\frac{1}{2}\ln t$ and smaller than
$t^{\varepsilon}$. Interestingly, the parameter $\varepsilon$ in Lindel\""of's
hypothesis is explicitly defined in terms of $\delta_3$.

history of mathematics, states that for large $t$, Riemann's zeta function
$\zeta(1/2+it)$ is of order $O(t^{\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ . It
is well known that for large $t$, the leading order asymptotics of the Riemann
zeta function can be expressed in terms of a transcendental exponential sum.
The usual approach to the Lindel\""of hypothesis involves the use of ingenious
techniques for the estimation of this sum. However, since such estimates can
not yield an asymptotic formula for the above sum, it appears that this
strategy cannot lead to the proof of Lindel\""of's hypothesis. Here, a
completely different approach is introduced. In particular, a novel linear
integral equation is derived for $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2, \ 0<\sigma<1$ whose
asymptotic analysis yields asymptotic results for a certain Riemann zeta-type
double exponential sum. This sum has the same structure as the sum describing
the leading asymptotics of $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$, namely it involves
$m_1^{-\sigma-it}m_2^{-\sigma-it}$, but its summation limits are different than
those of the sum corresponding to $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$. The analysis of the
above integral equation requires the asymptotic estimation of four different
integrals denoted by $I_1,I_2,\tilde{I}_3,\tilde{I}_4$, as well as the
derivation of an exact relation between certain double exponential sums. Here,
the latter relation is derived, and also the rigorous analysis of the first two
integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ is presented. For the remaining two integrals, formal
results are only derived that suggest a possible roadmap for the derivation of
rigorous asymptotic results of the above double exponential sum, as well as for
other sums associated with $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$. Additional developments
suggested by the above novel approach are also discussed.

to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution
is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We
consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act
directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth,
anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This
prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while
simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial
clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion
therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7 coupled
polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to
host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary
differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a Pseudomonas
aeruginosa burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against in
vivo data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain
bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of
treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model
consists of two physical compartments: the epithelium and the exudate. It is
found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor
treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the epithelium
and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the epithelium into the
exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the
bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or
continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible.
Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our
mathematical model.

stainless steel reinforced with Cr3C2 ceramic particles) were investigated. The
steel matrix composites (SMC) with three reinforcing percentages (3, 6, and 9
wt.%) were manufactured by Additive Manufacturing technologies (SLM: Selective
Laser Melting). The wear behaviour was studied by using a pin-on-disk wear test
at room temperature. The worn surface was analysed using Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that the friction coefficient does not
have a clear tendency or direct correlation with the reinforcement variation
while the wear rate decreases with increasing content of reinforcement. The
better properties combination were achieved with 6 wt.% of reinforcement.

  Battery Pack: A Distributed Kalman Filtering Approach",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the ever-increasing use across different sectors, the lithium-ion
batteries (LiBs) have continually seen serious concerns over their thermal
vulnerability. The LiB operation is associated with the heat generation and
buildup effect, which manifests itself more strongly, in the form of highly
uneven thermal distribution, for a LiB pack consisting of multiple cells. If
not well monitored and managed, the heating may accelerate aging and cause
unwanted side reactions. In extreme cases, it will even cause fires and
explosions, as evidenced by a series of well-publicized incidents in recent
years. To address this threat, this paper, for the first time, seeks to
reconstruct the three-dimensional temperature field of a LiB pack in real time.
The major challenge lies in how to acquire a high-fidelity reconstruction with
constrained computation time. In this study, a three-dimensional thermal model
is established first for a LiB pack configured in series. Although spatially
resolved, this model captures spatial thermal behavior with a combination of
high integrity and low complexity. Given the model, the standard Kalman filter
is then distributed to attain temperature field estimation at substantially
reduced computational complexity. The arithmetic operation analysis and
numerical simulation illustrate that the proposed distributed estimation
achieves a comparable accuracy as the centralized approach but with much less
computation. This work can potentially contribute to the safer operation of the
LiB packs in various systems dependent on LiB-based energy storage, potentially
widening the access of this technology to a broader range of engineering areas.

Letaief","Cache Placement in Fog-RANs: From Centralized to Distributed Algorithms","13 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To deal with the rapid growth of high-speed and/or ultra-low latency data
traffic for massive mobile users, fog radio access networks (Fog-RANs) have
emerged as a promising architecture for next-generation wireless networks. In
Fog-RANs, the edge nodes and user terminals possess storage, computation and
communication functionalities to various degrees, which provides high
flexibility for network operation, i.e., from fully centralized to fully
distributed operation. In this paper, we study the cache placement problem in
Fog-RANs, by taking into account flexible physical-layer transmission schemes
and diverse content preferences of different users. We develop both centralized
and distributed transmission aware cache placement strategies to minimize
users' average download delay subject to the storage capacity constraints. In
the centralized mode, the cache placement problem is transformed into a matroid
constrained submodular maximization problem, and an approximation algorithm is
proposed to find a solution within a constant factor to the optimum. In the
distributed mode, a belief propagation based distributed algorithm is proposed
to provide a suboptimal solution, with iterative updates at each BS based on
locally collected information. Simulation results show that by exploiting
caching and cooperation gains, the proposed transmission aware caching
algorithms can greatly reduce the users' average download delay.
