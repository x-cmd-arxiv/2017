distributed optimization problems over a network of processors, where the goal
is to optimize a global objective composed of a sum of local functions. In
these problems, due to the large scale of the data sets, the data and
computation must be distributed over processors resulting in the need for
distributed algorithms. In this paper, we consider a popular distributed
gradient-based consensus algorithm, which only requires local computation and
communication. An important problem in this area is to analyze the convergence
rate of such algorithms in the presence of communication delays that are
inevitable in distributed systems. We prove the convergence of the
gradient-based consensus algorithm in the presence of uniform, but possibly
arbitrarily large, communication delays between the processors. Moreover, we
obtain an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the algorithm as a function
of the network size, topology, and the inter-processor communication delays.

a variety of methods have been proposed, it still remains an open question how
to predict the temporal boundaries of action segments precisely. Most works use
segment-level classifiers to select video segments pre-determined by action
proposal or dense sliding windows. However, in order to achieve more precise
action boundaries, a temporal localization system should make dense predictions
at a fine granularity. A newly proposed work exploits
Convolutional-Deconvolutional-Convolutional (CDC) filters to upsample the
predictions of 3D ConvNets, making it possible to perform per-frame action
predictions and achieving promising performance in terms of temporal action
localization. However, CDC network loses temporal information partially due to
the temporal downsampling operation. In this paper, we propose an elegant and
powerful Temporal Preservation Convolutional (TPC) Network that equips 3D
ConvNets with TPC filters. TPC network can fully preserve temporal resolution
and downsample the spatial resolution simultaneously, enabling frame-level
granularity action localization. TPC network can be trained in an end-to-end

noise ratio (SNR) is high, its predictive performance deteriorates when the SNR
is low. In particular, it is outperformed by continuous shrinkage methods, such

best subset selection in the high-noise regimes; and (b) perform favorably,
while generally delivering substantially sparser models, relative to the best
predictive models available via ridge regression and the Lasso. We conduct an
extensive theoretical analysis of the predictive properties of the proposed

small quantum-scale displacements has led to breakthroughs such as the first
detection of gravitational waves \cite{LIGO,LIGODC} and of the motions of
quantum ground-state cooled mechanical oscillators \cite{Teufel2011,Chan2011}.
While heterodyne detection of the cavity field preserves asymmetries which
provide a key signature that mechanical oscillators has attained the quantum
regime, detection of a rotating quadrature of the light averages out important
quantum correlations, yielding a weaker signal and lower sensitivity than
homodyne detection. In turn, homodyning, detects a single optical quadrature,
but loses the important quantum sideband asymmetries. In the present work we
present and experimentally demonstrate a technique, involving judicious
construction of the autocorrelators of the output current using filter
functions, which can restore the lost correlations (whether classical or
quantum), drastically augmenting the useful information extracted: the
filtering adjusts for moderate errors in the locking phase of the local
oscillator, allowing efficient single-shot measurement of hundreds of different
field quadratures and rapid mapping of detailed features from a simple
heterodyne trace. One may also control whether the correlations are recovered
in isolation or interfere with the usual stationary heterodyne sidebands. In
the latter case we obtain a spectrum of hybrid homodyne-heterodyne character,
with motional sidebands of combined amplitudes comparable to homodyne. We term
such recovery of lost heterodyne correlations with filter functions
r-heterodyning: although investigated here in a thermal regime, its robustness

displacements.

need to go through a base station (BS). Meanwhile, due to the adoption of
underlay D2D communication protocol, power control mechanisms are thereby
necessary to be applied to mitigate the interference to conventional cellular
communications. Based on these considerations, we analyze the outage
performance of the proposed system, and derive the exact expressions of outage
probabilities when bulk and per-subcarrier relay selection criteria are
applied. Furthermore, closed-form expressions of outage probabilities are also
obtained for special cases when the instantaneous channel state information

a static power control mechanism is applied. Subsequently, we also investigate
the outage performance optimization problem by coordinating transmit power
among DUE transmitter and relays, and provide a suboptimal solution, which is
capable of improving the outage performance. All analysis is substantiated by
numerical results provided by Monte Carlo simulations. The analytical and

relay selection schemes for two-hop orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) systems in a Poisson field of relays. In particular, special emphasis is
placed on decode-and-forward (DF) relay systems, equipped with bulk and
per-subcarrier selection schemes, respectively. The exact expressions for
outage probability are derived in integrals for general cases. In addition,
asymptotic expressions for outage probability in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) region in the finite circle relay distribution region are determined in
closed forms for both relay selection schemes. Also, the outage probabilities
for free space in the infinite relay distribution region are derived in closed
forms. Meanwhile, a series of important properties related to cooperative
systems in random networks are investigated, including diversity, outage
probability ratio of two selection schemes and optimization of the number of
subcarriers in terms of system throughput. All analysis is numerically verified
by simulations. Finally, a framework for analyzing the outage performance of
OFDM systems with spatially random relays is constructed, which can be easily
modified to analyze other similar cases with different forwarding protocols,
location distributions and/or channel conditions.

model (UMM) can be described in terms of topologies of two dimensional droplets
on a plane spanned by eigenvalue and number of boxes in Young diagram.
Information about different phases of UMM is encoded in the geometry of
droplets. These droplets are similar to phase space distributions of a unitary
matrix quantum mechanics (UMQM) ($(0 + 1)$ dimensional) on constant time
slices. We find that for a given UMM, it is possible to construct an effective
UMQM such that its phase space distributions match with droplets of UMM on
different time slices at large $N$. Therefore, large $N$ phase transitions in
UMM can be understood in terms of dynamics of an effective UMQM. From the
geometry of droplets it is also possible to construct Young diagrams
corresponding to $U(N)$ representations and hence different large $N$ states of
the theory in momentum space. We explicitly consider two examples : single
plaquette model with $\text{Tr} U^2$ terms and Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$. We
describe phases of CS theory in terms of eigenvalue distributions of unitary

$Z\to\ell\ell$. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the
expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an
observed significance of 3.5 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of
3.0 standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the Higgs boson
decay into $b$-quarks and for its production in association with a vector

ratio of the measured signal events to the Standard Model expectation equal to

subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of
biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved
from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The
essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are
trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In
this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output
pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely
labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections
to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN
regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is
possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from
the predicted compressed vector using $L_1$-norm optimization. In the past,
output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in
conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space
encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where
the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or
at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other
state-of-the-art methods.

rotation, i.e. significant amount of rotation around the major axis, including
two cases in the Local Group. Although expected theoretically, this phenomenon
is rarely observed and remains elusive. In order to explore its origin we study
the population of well-resolved galaxies in the Illustris cosmological
simulation. We identify 59 convincing examples of prolate rotators at the
present time, more frequently among more massive galaxies, with the number
varying very little with redshift. We follow their evolution back in time using
the main progenitor branch galaxies of the Illustris merger trees. We find that
the emergence of prolate rotation is strongly correlated with the time of the
last significant merger the galaxy experienced, although other evolutionary
paths leading to prolate rotation are also possible. The transition to prolate
rotation most often happens around the same time as the transition to prolate
shape of the stellar component. The mergers leading to prolate rotation have
slightly more radial orbits, higher mass ratios, and occur at more recent times
than mergers in the reference sample of twin galaxies we construct for
comparison. However, they cover a wide range of initial conditions in terms of
the mass ratio, merger time, radiality of the progenitor orbits, and the
relative orientations of spins of the progenitors with respect to the orbital
angular momenta. About half of our sample of prolate rotators were created
during gas-rich mergers and the newly formed stars usually support prolate
rotation.

evolved to different resolutions with the similarity RG (SRG), the initial

region. In some regions, for example, the FSI are largely unaffected by
evolution, while elsewhere FSI are greatly reduced. For certain kinematics, the
impulse approximation at a high RG resolution gives an intuitive picture in
terms of a one-body current breaking up a short-range correlated neutron-proton
pair, although FSI distort this simple picture. With evolution to low
resolution, however, the cross section is unchanged but a very different and
arguably simpler intuitive picture emerges, with the evolved current
efficiently represented at low momentum through derivative expansions or
low-rank singular value decompositions. A consequence is that intuition about

intense single-cycle THz pulse. The atomic vibrations reveal themselves through
periodic modulation of the refractive index of the film. The largest signal is
detected at the frequency of 4.05 THz that corresponds to the $E_g^2$ mode. The
generation of $E_g^2$ phonons is interpreted as resonant excitation of the
Raman mode by the second harmonic of THz-driven nonlinear $E_u^1$ oscillator,
the fundamental frequency of which (2.05 THz) is approximately half that of
$E_g^2$. The origin of nonlinearity in this case is cubic lattice
anharmonicity, while generation of $E_g^1$ (1.1 THz) and $A_{1g}^1$ (2.25 THz)
phonons is a manifestation of quartic anharmonicity enhanced by the occasional
combination relations between phonon frequencies in $Bi_2Se_3$.

More generally, though, this resistance is contextual, it depends on the
presence of functional groups/charges and fluctuations, as well as the

generically requires all-atom simulations, but this demands enormous resources

particles interior to the snow line. However, radial transport of solids in the
outer disk operates on timescales much longer than the typical timescale of an
FU Ori outburst ($10^{1}$--$10^{2}$ yr). Consequently, a steady-state pileup is
unlikely. We argue that it is only necessary to consider water evaporation and
re-coagulation of silicates to explain the recent ALMA observation of V883 Ori
because these processes are short enough to have had their impact since the

thick before the outburst, and our results suggest that the carbon content of

comparable-mass galaxies in the local universe. Our observations suggest that
quenching does not require the total removal or depletion of molecular gas, as
many quenching models suggest. However, further observations are required both
to determine if these apparently quiescent objects host highly obscured star
formation and to investigate the intrinsic variation in the molecular gas

to a destination node in many deployed wireless ad-hoc networks. Today's
implemented routing algorithms seek to efficiently find the path/route with the
largest Full-Duplex (FD) capacity, which is given by the minimum among the
point-to-point link capacities in the path. Such an approach may be suboptimal
if then the nodes in the selected path are operated in Half-Duplex (HD) mode.
Recently, the capacity (up to a constant gap that only depends on the number of
nodes in the path) of an HD line network i.e., a path) has been shown to be
equal to half of the minimum of the harmonic means of the capacities of two
consecutive links in the path. This paper asks the questions of whether it is
possible to design a polynomial-time algorithm that efficiently finds the path
with the largest HD capacity in a relay network. This problem of finding that
path is shown to be NP-hard in general. However, if the number of cycles in the
network is polynomial in the number of nodes, then a polynomial-time algorithm
can indeed be designed.

improvement over the surface morphology and superconducting properties as well
as the reduction of defects. We employed a novel deposition technique, i.e.
biased target ion beam deposition technique (BTIBD) to prepare Nb thin films
with controlled crystallinity and surface morphology. We found that the target
current (ITarget) and the target bias (VTarget) were critical to the
crystallinity and surface morphology of Nb films. The high target current
(ITarget >500 mA and VTarget = 400 V bias) during the deposition degraded the
Nb crystallinity, and subsequently reduced the critical temperature for
superconductivity (Tc). VTarget was critical to the surface morphology, i.e.
grain size and shape and the surface roughness. The optimized growth condition
yielded very smooth film with RMS roughness of 0.4 nm that was an order of
magnitude smoother than that of Nb films by sputtering process. The critical
temperature for superconductivity was also close to the value of the bulk Nb.
The quality of Nb film was evident in the presence of a very thin proximity
layer (~ 0.8 nm). The experimental results demonstrated that the preparation of
smooth Nb films with adequate superconductivity by BTIBD could serve as a base
electrode for the in-situ magnetic layer or insulating layer for
superconducting electronic devices.

the probability of excitation transfer. Hence in order to achieve higher value

tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to solve the two tasks

object-level shape prior to regularize part segments while the part-level
segments constrain the variation of pose locations. Specifically, we first
train two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part
FCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part
potential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are
fused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel
segment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial
consistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose
and the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the
skeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part
segments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human
detection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty
times faster.
  Since there's no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we
extend the PASCAL VOC part dataset with human pose joints and perform extensive
experiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies. We
show that on this dataset our algorithm surpasses competing methods by a large

privacy protection. One approach to achieve anonymity is to relay messages
through multiple routers, where each router shuffles messages independently. To
achieve anonymity, at least one router needs to be honest. In the presence of
an adversary that is controlling a subset of the routers unbiased routing is
important for guaranteeing anonymity. However, the routing strategy also
influenced other factors such as the scalability and the performance of the
system. One solution is to use a fixed route for relaying all messages with
many routers. If the route is not fixed the routing decision can either be made
by the communication initiator or the intermediate routers. However, the
existing routing types each have limitations. For example, one faces
scalability issues when increasing the throughput of systems with fixed routes.
Moreover, when the routing decision is left to the initiator, the initiator
needs to maintain an up-to-date view of the system at all times, which also
does not scale. If the routing decision is left to intermediate routers the
routing of the communication can be influenced by an adversary. In this work,
we propose a novel multiparty routing approach for anonymous communication that
addresses these shortcomings. We distribute the routing decision and verify the
correctness of routing to achieve routing integrity. More concretely, we
provide a mixnet design that uses our routing approach and that in addition,

declarative policy rules. We show how to use the logic to implement a trust

interactions between a variety of objects, such as genes, chemicals, molecular
signatures, diseases, pathways and environmental exposures. Often, any pair of
objects--such as a gene and a disease--can be related in different ways, for
example, directly via gene-disease associations or indirectly via functional
annotations, chemicals and pathways. Different ways of relating these objects
carry different semantic meanings. However, traditional methods disregard these
semantics and thus cannot fully exploit their value in data modeling.
  Results: We present Medusa, an approach to detect size-k modules of objects
that, taken together, appear most significant to another set of objects. Medusa
operates on large-scale collections of heterogeneous data sets and explicitly
distinguishes between diverse data semantics. It advances research along two
dimensions: it builds on collective matrix factorization to derive different
semantics, and it formulates the growing of the modules as a submodular
optimization program. Medusa is flexible in choosing or combining semantic
meanings and provides theoretical guarantees about detection quality. In a
systematic study on 310 complex diseases, we show the effectiveness of Medusa
in associating genes with diseases and detecting disease modules. We
demonstrate that in predicting gene-disease associations Medusa compares
favorably to methods that ignore diverse semantic meanings. We find that the
utility of different semantics depends on disease categories and that, overall,
Medusa recovers disease modules more accurately when combining different
semantics.

by the preferred cellular geometry, echoing experimental findings. An
attractive variant of these models uses a Voronoi tessellation to describe the

leading to rich, glassy behavior. This glassy behavior was suggested to be
inextricably linked to an underlying jamming transition. We test this
conjecture, exploring the low-effective-temperature limit of the Voronoi model

CD8$^{+}$ T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal
three dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell
interactions as well as cell birth and death to establish that cell growth
rate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological
niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the
tumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The
mean square displacement, $\Delta(t)$, of cells exhibits glassy behavior at
times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive
behavior, $\Delta (t) \approx t^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha > 1$), at longer times. We
derive the value of $\alpha \approx 1.33$ using a field theoretic approach
based on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality
of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems.
Super diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell
birth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also
suggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative
agreement with {\it in vitro} experiments. Although set in the context of tumor
invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in
growing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of
particles play a role.

against node failure is commonly provided by storing redundancy in a number of
other nodes and performing repair mechanism to reproduce the content of the
failed nodes. Efficiency is then achieved by minimizing the storage overhead
and the amount of data transmission required for data reconstruction and
repair, provided by coding solutions such as regenerating codes [1]. Common
explicit regenerating code constructions enable efficient repair through
accessing a predefined number, $d$, of arbitrary chosen available nodes, namely
helpers. In practice, however, the state of the system dynamically changes
based on the request load, the link traffic, etc., and the parameters which
optimize system's performance vary accordingly. It is then desirable to have
coding schemes which are able to operate optimally under a range of different
parameters simultaneously. Specifically, adaptivity in the number of helper
nodes for repair is of interest. While robustness requires capability of
performing repair with small number of helpers, it is desirable to use as many
helpers as available to reduce the transmission delay and total repair traffic.
  In this work we focus on the minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, where
each node is supposed to store $\alpha$ information units, and the source data
of size $k\alpha$ could be recovered from any arbitrary set of $k$ nodes. We
introduce a class MSR codes that realize optimal repair bandwidth
simultaneously with a set of different choices for the number of helpers,
namely $D=\{d_{1}, \cdots, d_{\delta}\}$. Our coding scheme follows the Product

generalization of the PM MSR code presented in [2], such that any $d_{i} =

variations in electronic energy levels, such as those that arise in disordered
molecular systems, can actually increase charge dissociation yields. We
demonstrate that this is a nonequilibrium effect that is mediated by the

are long-lived because they cannot easily recombine. We present a kinetic model
that incorporates these states and show that it is capable of reproducing

interfacial slip for entangled polymer melts on ideal surfaces; this Navier-de
Gennes model was confirmed using dewetting experiments on ultra-smooth,
low-energy substrates. Here, we use capillary leveling - surface tension driven
flow of films with initially non-uniform thickness - of polymeric films on
these same substrates. Measurement of the slip length from a robust
one-parameter fit to a lubrication model is achieved. We show that at the lower

employed substrates can no longer be considered ideal. The data is instead
consistent with physical adsorption of polymer chains at the solid/liquid

caused by the combination of camera shakes, object motions, and depth

motion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex
scenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this
paper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the
scene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide
optical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the
blur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this
assumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is
different from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship
between motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise
non-linear kernel model to account for motion blur. The proposed blur model is
based on the non-linear optical flow, which describes complex motion blur more
effectively. Extensive experiments on challenging blurry videos demonstrate the

items so as to identify, with a minimal number of tests, a ""small"" subset of
$d$ defective items. In ""classical"" non-adaptive group testing, it is known
that when $d$ is substantially smaller than $n$, $\Theta(d\log(n))$ tests are
both information-theoretically necessary and sufficient to guarantee recovery
with high probability. Group testing schemes in the literature meeting this
bound require most items to be tested $\Omega(\log(n))$ times, and most tests
to incorporate $\Omega(n/d)$ items.
  Motivated by physical considerations, we study group testing models in which
the testing procedure is constrained to be ""sparse"". Specifically, we consider
(separately) scenarios in which (a) items are finitely divisible and hence may
participate in at most $\gamma \in o(\log(n))$ tests; or (b) tests are
size-constrained to pool no more than $\rho \in o(n/d)$items per test. For both
scenarios we provide information-theoretic lower bounds on the number of tests
required to guarantee high probability recovery. In both scenarios we provide
both randomized constructions (under both $\epsilon$-error and zero-error
reconstruction guarantees) and explicit constructions of designs with
computationally efficient reconstruction algorithms that require a number of
tests that are optimal up to constant or small polynomial factors in some
regimes of $n, d, \gamma,$ and $\rho$. The randomized design/reconstruction
algorithm in the $\rho$-sized test scenario is universal -- independent of the
value of $d$, as long as $\rho \in o(n/d)$. We also investigate the effect of
unreliability/noise in test outcomes. For the full abstract, please see the

isotopologues. We use absorption by optically thin transitions of c-C3H2 to
estimate the N(H2), and argue that this method is preferable to more commonly
used methods. We discuss the kinematic structure and abundance patterns of
small molecules including the sulfur-bearing species CS, SO, CCS, H2CS, and
HCS+; oxygen-bearing molecules OH, SiO, and H2CO; and simple hydrocarbon
molecules c-C3H2, l-C3H, and l-C3H+. We discuss the implications of the
observed chemistry for the structure of the gas and dust in the ISM.
  Highlighted results include the following. First, whereas gas in the disk has
a molecular hydrogen fraction of 0.65, clouds on the outer edge of the Galactic
Bar and in or near the Galactic Center have molecular fractions of 0.85 and
>0.9, respectively. Second, we observe trends in isotope ratios with
Galactocentric distance; while carbon and silicon show enhancement of the rare
isotopes at low Galactocentric distances, sulfur exhibits no trend with
Galactocentric distance; the ratio of c-C3H2/c-H13CCCH provides a good estimate
of the 12C:13C ratio, whereas H2CO/H2^13CO exhibits fractionation. Third, we
report the presence of l-C3H+ in diffuse clouds for the first time. Finally, we
suggest that CS has an enhanced abundance within higher density clumps of
material in the disk, and therefore may be diagnostic of cloud conditions. If
this holds, the diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk contain multiple embedded
hyperdensities in a clumpy structure, and the density profile is not a simple
function of A_V.

decade, efficient similarity search methods have become a crucial component of
large-scale information retrieval systems. A popular strategy is to represent
original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of
machine learning methods have been utilized, but they often lack expressiveness
and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent
advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its
capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex
data. Especially, deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness
of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural
networks, which is very suitable for text modeling. However, little work has
leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing.
  In this paper, we propose a series of novel deep document generative models
for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one
is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model
further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of
words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides
a principled framework for model extension, uncertainty estimation, simulation,
and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization,
the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks
and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed
representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of

the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.

annealers and quantum processors has shown potential in solving certain
families of complex combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than
conventional CPUs. We show that to address an industrial optimization problem,
a hybrid architecture of CPUs and non-CPU devices is inevitable. In this paper,
we propose problem decomposition as an effective method for designing a hybrid
CPU--non-CPU optimization solver. We introduce the required algorithmic
elements for making problem decomposition a viable approach in meeting the
real-world constraints such as communication time and the potential higher cost
of using non-CPU hardware. We then turn to the well-known maximum clique
problem, and propose a new method of decomposition for this problem. Our method
enables us to solve the maximum clique problem on very large graphs using
non-CPU hardware that is considerably smaller than the size of the graph. As an
example, we show that the maximum clique problem on the com-Amazon graph, with
334,863 vertices and 925,872 edges, can be solved with a single call to a
device that can embed a fully connected graph of size at least 21 nodes, such
as the D-Wave 2000Q. We also show that our proposed problem decomposition
approach can improve the runtime of two of the best-known classical algorithms
for large, sparse graphs, namely PMC and BBMCSP, by orders of magnitude. In the
light of our study, we believe that new non-CPU hardware that is small in size
could become competitive with CPUs if it could be either mass produced and
highly parallelized, or able to provide high-quality solutions to specific,
small-sized problems significantly faster than CPUs.

the surface tension of the interface separating neighboring relaxing regions is
thought to play a crucial role in deciding both their size and
morphology(8-10), owing to the amorphous nature of these regions, even
identifying these interfaces has not been possible in bulk liquids. Here, by
devising a scheme to identify self-induced disorder sites in bulk colloidal
liquids, we directly quantified the dynamics of interfaces delineating regions
of high and low configurational overlap. This procedure also helped unveil a
non-monotonicity in dynamical correlations that has never been observed in bulk
supercooled liquids. Using the capillary fluctuation method (11,12), we
measured the surface tension of amorphous-amorphous interfaces with
supercooling and find that it increases rapidly across the mode-coupling area
fraction. Remarkably, a similar growth in the surface tension is also seen in
the presence of a pinned amorphous wall. Our observations help prune theories
of glass formation and opens up new research avenues aimed at tuning the
properties of amorphous-amorphous interfaces, and hence the glass itself, in a
manner analogous to grain boundary engineering in polycrystals (13).

  One of the plethora of factors to be considered in that process is the
climatic variability of the exo-Earths in question. In the Solar System, the
Earth's long-term climate is driven by several factors, including the modifying
influence of life on our atmosphere, and the temporal evolution of solar
luminosity. The gravitational influence of the other planets in the Solar
System adds an extra complication, driving the Milankovitch cycles that are
thought to have caused the on-going series of glacial and interglacial periods

  Here we present preliminary results of three suites of integrations that
together examine the influence of Solar System architecture on the Earth's
Milankovitch cycles. We consider separately the influence of the planets
Jupiter, Mars and Venus, each of which contributes to the forcing of Earth's
orbital evolution. Our results illustrate how small changes to the architecture
of a given planetary system can result in marked changes in the potential

in the device, this has caused some debate. Here we show that the asymmetry
arises from the formation of a quasi-dark-state of the two atoms, which
saturates at extremely low power. In this case the nonlinear saturability
explicitly breaks the assumptions of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Moreover,
we show that the statistics of the output field from the driven system can be
explained by a very simple stochastic mirror model and that at steady state,
the two atoms and the local field are driven to an entangled, tripartite
$\left| W \right\rangle$ state. Because of this, we argue that the device is

planets. We showed previously that in the solar case it induces RV variations
with an amplitude over the cycle on the order of 8 m/s, with signals on short
and long timescales. The major component is the inhibition of the convective
blueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major
component of stellar radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars. The
convective blueshift depends on line depths; we use this property to develop a
method that will characterize the amplitude of this effect and to correct for
this RV component. We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs
computed using different sets of lines, including lines in different depth
ranges. We characterize the performance of the method used to reconstruct the
signal without the convective component and the detection limits derived from
the residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set
of lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good
precision and to correct for it. For the full temporal sampling, the power in
the range 100-500~d significantly decreased, by a factor of 100 for a RV noise
below 30 cm/s. We also studied the impact of noise contributions other than the
photon noise, which lead to uncertainties on the RV computation, as well as the
impact of the temporal sampling. We found that these other sources of noise do
not greatly alter the quality of the correction, although they need a better
noise level to reach a similar performance level. A very good correction of the
convective component can be achieved providing very good RV noise levels
combined with a very good instrumental stability and realistic granulation
noise. Under the conditions considered in this paper, detection limits at 480~d
lower than 1 MEarth could be achieved for RV noise below 15 cm/s.

exercise for four different vertical profiles peaking at different depths below

on average the profile approaches the height $M$ algebraically in time, with an
exponent that is essentially independent of the boundary conditions. However,
the actual value of the dynamic exponent turns out to be significantly smaller

terms of the entropic repulsion exerted by the impenetrable boundary on the

mechanism is analyzed in detail for a single (fractional) Brownian walker,
which describes the anomalous diffusion of a tagged monomer of the interface as
it approaches the absorbing boundary. The present study sheds light on the

which was initially applied to range-separated ground-state-density-functional
Hamiltonians, is adapted in this work to ghost-interaction-corrected (GIC)
range-separated ensemble density-functional theory (eDFT) for excited states.
While standard extrapolations rely on energies that decay as $\mu^{-2}$ in the
large range-separation-parameter $\mu$ limit, we show analytically that
(approximate) range-separated GIC ensemble energies converge more rapidly (as
$\mu^{-3}$) towards their pure wavefunction theory values
($\mu\rightarrow+\infty$ limit), thus requiring a different extrapolation
correction. The purpose of such a correction is to further improve on the
convergence and, consequently, to obtain more accurate excitation energies for
a finite (and, in practice, relatively small) $\mu$ value. As a proof of
concept, we apply the extrapolation method to He and small molecular systems
(viz. H$_{2}$, HeH$^{+}$ and LiH), thus considering different types of
excitations like Rydberg, charge transfer and double excitations. Potential
energy profiles of the first three and four singlet $\Sigma^+$ excitation
energies in HeH$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$, respectively, are studied with a particular
focus on avoided crossings for the latter. Finally, the extraction of
individual state energies from the ensemble energy is discussed in the context
of range-separated eDFT, as a perspective.

one- and two-dimensional numerical test cases, the present approach has been
able to reproduce all the major aspects encountered when a flame is subject to
an imposed electric field and the main effects of the different chemical
mechanisms. Moreover, the proposed model is shown to produce a large reduction
in the computational cost, being able to shorten the time needed to perform a

instability on cylindrical or spherical surface which consists of a capillary
wave equation and a linear perturbation equation is constructed, based on the
leading order governing equation in standard cylindrical or spherical
coordinate system. A disjoining pressure model is introduced to simulate the
partial wetting process near moving contact line. The fingering number in high
$Bo$ coating flow is focused on from a linear perspective. Using an asymptotic
theory, the high $Bo$ limits of the linear perturbation equations for both the
cylindrical and spherical problems are proved to degenerate into a common
eigenvalue problem. Two analytical formulae concerning the most unstable wave
number which can be described as two power laws are derived via a method of
modal analysis for the cylindrical and spherical problem, respectively. These
formulae provide a succinct method to estimate the fingering number if the
onset of the fingering instability is known. A method of transient growth
analysis which makes no high $Bo$ assumptions is used to verify the accuracy of
the asymptotic theory and modal analysis. In particular, an asymptotic behavior
of the most unstable wave number as $Bo$ increases is highlighted. We show that
the linear growth rate may be improved by the disjoining pressure, which can be
attributed to the effect of partial wetting, but the most unstable wave number
is insensitive to the wetting model.

different chirality, under stimulus of paralleled E and B, will have different
chemical potential that gives rise to an extra current, whose role likes a
chiral battery in solids. However, up to now, the experimental evidence for
chiral magnetic effect is the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance rather
than a chiral electric source. Here, totally different from previous reports,
we observed the giant chiral magnetic effect evidenced by: 'negative'
resistivity and corresponding voltage-current curves lying the second-fourth
quadrant in type-II Weyl semimetal WP$_{2+\delta}$ under following conditions:
the misaligned angle between E and B is smaller than 20$^\circ$, temperature
<30 K and externally applied E<50 mA. Phenomenologically, based on macroscopic

$M_\odot$ range form in galaxy mergers, and live in galactic nuclei with large
and poorly constrained concentrations of gas and stars. There are currently no
observations of merging SMBHBs--- it is in fact possible that they stall at
their final parsec of separation and never merge. While LIGO has detected high
frequency GWs, SMBHBs emit GWs in the nanohertz to millihertz band. This is
inaccessible to ground-based interferometers, but possible with Pulsar Timing
Arrays (PTAs). Using data from local galaxies in the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey,
together with galaxy merger rates from Illustris, we find that there are on
average $91\pm7$ sources emitting GWs in the PTA band, and $7\pm2$ binaries
which will never merge. Local unresolved SMBHBs can contribute to GW background
anisotropy at a level of $\sim20\%$, and if the GW background can be
successfully isolated, GWs from at least one local SMBHB can be detected in 10
years.

the task of automated lyric annotation (ALA). Like text simplification, a goal
of ALA is to rephrase the original text in a more easily understandable manner.
However, in ALA the system must often include additional information to clarify
niche terminology and abstract concepts. To stimulate research on this task, we
release a large collection of crowdsourced annotations for song lyrics. We
analyze the performance of translation and retrieval models on this task,
measuring performance with both automated and human evaluation. We find that

of turbulence and the upscale or downscale nature of its energy transfers. We
do so by forcing low-$Rm$ magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a confined
channel, while precisely controlling its dimensionality by means of an
externally applied magnetic field. We first identify a specific lengthscale
$\hat{l}_\perp^c$ that separates smaller three-dimensional structures from
larger quasi-two-dimensional ones. We then show that an inverse energy cascade
of horizontal kinetic energy along horizontal scales is always observable at
large scales, but that it extends well into the region of 3D structures. At the
same time, a direct energy cascade confined to the smallest and strongly 3D
scales is observed. These dynamics therefore appear not to be simply determined
by the dimensionality of individual scales, nor by the forcing scale, unlike in
other studies. In fact, our findings suggest that the relationship between
kinematics and dynamics is not universal and may strongly depend on the forcing
and dissipating mechanisms at play.

balance depends not only on the properties of migration and selection, but also
on the dominance relations among alleles and on linkage to other loci under

loci are subject to selection caused by an abrupt environmental change. The
habitat is one-dimensional and unbounded, selection at each locus is modeled by
step functions such that in one region one allele at each locus is advantageous
and in the other deleterious. We admit an environmentally independent,
intermediate degree of dominance at both loci, including complete dominance.
First, we derive an explicit expression for the single-locus cline with
dominance, thus generalizing classical results by Haldane (1948). We show that
the slope of the cline in the center (at the step) or, equivalently, the width
of the cline, is independent of the degree of dominance. Second, under the
assumption of strong recombination relative to selection and migration, the
first-order approximations of the allele-frequency clines at each of the loci
and of the linkage disequilibrium are derived. This may be interpreted as the
quasi-linkage-equilibrium approximation of the two-locus cline. Explicit
asymptotic expressions for the clines are deduced as $x\to\pm\infty$. For
equivalent loci, explicit expressions for the whole clines are derived. The
influence of dominance and of linkage on the slope of the cline in the center
and on a global measure of steepness are investigated. This global measure
reflects the influence of dominance. Finally, the accuracy of the
approximations and the dependence of the shape of the two-locus cline on the

view on their behaviour. The internetwork fibrils are found to support
wave-like behaviour, which we interpret as Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink
waves. The properties of these waves, that is, amplitude, period, and
propagation speed, are measured from time-distance diagrams and we attempt to
exploit them via magneto-seismology in order to probe the variation of plasma
properties along the wave-guides. We found that the Internetwork (IN) fibrils
appear, disappear, and re-appear on timescales of tens of minutes, suggesting
that they are subject to repeated heating. No clear photospheric footpoints for
the fibrils are found in photospheric magnetograms or H$\alpha$ wing images.
However, we suggest that they are magnetised features as the majority of them
show evidence of supporting propagating MHD kink waves, with a modal period of
$120$~s. Additionally, one IN fibril is seen to support a flow directed along
its elongated axis, suggesting a guiding field. The wave motions are found to
propagate at speeds significantly greater than estimates for typical
chromospheric sound speeds. Through their interpretation as kink waves, the
measured speeds provide an estimate for local average Alfv\'en speeds.
Furthermore, the amplitudes of the waves are also found to vary as a function
of distance along the fibrils, which can be interpreted as evidence of
stratification of the plasma in the neighbourhood of the IN fibril.

at nearly the same time. Optical polarization measurements showed dramatic
changes during the flare, with a strong anti-correlation between optical flux
and degree of polarization (which rose from ~ 3% to ~ 20%) during the declining
phase of the flare. The flare was accompanied by large rapid swings in
polarization angle of ~ 170 degree. This combination of behaviors appear to be
unique. We have cm-band radio data during the same period but they show no
correlation with variations at higher frequencies. Such peculiar behavior may
be explained using jet models incorporating fully relativistic effects with a
dominant source region moving along a helical path or by a shock-in-jet model
incorporating three-dimensional radiation transfer if there is a dominant
helical magnetic field. We find that spectral energy distributions at different
times during the flare can be fit using modified one-zone models where only the
magnetic field strength and particle break frequencies and normalizations need
change. An optical spectrum taken at nearly the same time provides an estimate

interface-related mechanisms at the thinner layer thicknesses. The high

stability and strength retention for the NMMs with larger layer thicknesses

deformation mechanism occurred as the layer thickness decreased, to a
deformation response controlled by diffusion processes along the interfaces,
which resulted in temperature-induced softening. A deformation mechanism map,

the presence of a growing autocatalytic structure, i.e. a portion of the

autocatalytic set display greater fitness, i.e. they tend to appear in a
greater number of patents, thus suggesting the presence of positive spillovers

problem in Dirac-like Hamiltonians. Individually, both features are well known.
First, simple electrostatic gates do not confine electrons due to the Klein

derivative $k \rightarrow -i\partial_x$ skips the central point and allow
spurious low-energy, highly oscillating solutions known as fermion doublers.
While a no-go theorem states that the doublers cannot be eliminated without
artificially breaking a symmetry, here we show that the symmetry broken by the
Wilson's mass approach is equivalent to the enforcement of hard-wall boundary
conditions, thus making the no-go theorem irrelevant when confinement is
foreseen. We illustrate our arguments by calculating the following: (i) the
band structure and transport properties across thin films of the topological
insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$, for which we use ab-initio density functional theory
calculations to justify the model; and (ii) the band structure of zigzag

approximation. In this setting, we are given a problem instance and a parameter
$\alpha>1$, and the goal is to design an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm with
the fastest possible running time. We show the following results:
  - An $r$-approximation for maximum independent set in $O^*(\exp(\tilde O(n/r
\log^2 r+r\log^2r)))$ time,
  - An $r$-approximation for chromatic number in $O^*(\exp(\tilde{O}(n/r \log

  - A $(2-1/r)$-approximation for minimum vertex cover in
$O^*(\exp(n/r^{\Omega(r)}))$ time, and
  - A $(k-1/r)$-approximation for minimum $k$-hypergraph vertex cover in
$O^*(\exp(n/(kr)^{\Omega(kr)}))$ time.
  (Throughout, $\tilde O$ and $O^*$ omit $\mathrm{polyloglog}(r)$ and factors
polynomial in the input size, respectively.) The best known time bounds for all
problems were $O^*(2^{n/r})$ [Bourgeois et al. 2009, 2011 & Cygan et al. 2008].
For maximum independent set and chromatic number, these bounds were
complemented by $\exp(n^{1-o(1)}/r^{1+o(1)})$ lower bounds (under the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)) [Chalermsook et al., 2013 & Laekhanukit,
2014 (Ph.D. Thesis)]. Our results show that the naturally-looking
$O^*(2^{n/r})$ bounds are not tight for all these problems. The key to these
algorithmic results is a sparsification procedure, allowing the use of better
approximation algorithms for bounded degree graphs. For obtaining the first two
results, we introduce a new randomized branching rule.
  Finally, we show a connection between PCP parameters and exponential-time
approximation algorithms. This connection together with our independent set
algorithm refute the possibility to overly reduce the size of Chan's PCP [Chan,
2016]. It also implies that a (significant) improvement over our result will
refute the gap-ETH conjecture [Dinur 2016 & Manurangsi and Raghavendra, 2016].

location, who we talk to, our habits, and our interests. Smartphone users trade
access to this data by permitting apps to use it, and in return obtain
functionality provided by the apps. In many cases, however, users fail to
appreciate the scale or sensitivity of the data that they share with
third-parties when they use apps. To this end, prior work has looked at the
threat to privacy posed by apps and the third-party libraries that they embed.
Prior work, however, fails to paint a realistic picture of the full threat to
smartphone users, as it has typically examined apps and third-party libraries
in isolation.
  In this paper, we describe a novel and potentially devastating privilege
escalation attack that can be performed by third-party libraries. This attack,
which we call intra-library collusion, occurs when a single library embedded in
more than one app on a device leverages the combined set of permissions
available to it to pilfer sensitive user data. The possibility for
intra-library collusion exists because libraries obtain the same privileges as
their host app and popular libraries will likely be used by more than one app
on a device.
  Using a real-world dataset of over 30,000 smartphones, we find that many
popular third-party libraries have the potential to aggregate significant
sensitive data from devices by using intra-library collusion. We demonstrate
that several popular libraries already collect enough data to facilitate this
attack. Using historical data, we show that risks from intra-library collusion
have increased significantly over the last two-and-a-half years. We conclude
with recommendations for mitigating the aforementioned problems.

very good agreement with the predictions from an energy-density functional

analysis allows to separate the pygmy dipole resonance from both the tail of
the giant dipole resonance and multi-phonon excitations. Combined with earlier

an orthogonal basis for the tensor observables which diagonalizes the Gaussian
two-point functions. The centres of the algebras are associated with
correlators which are expressible in terms of Kronecker coefficients

symmetry present in the Gaussian model, as well as a large class of interacting

algebras. This discussion is extended to a general number of colors $d$: it is
used to prove the integrality of an infinite family of number sequences related

(CES). In the former, a supernova explosion within a close binary ejects the
secondary star, while in the latter close multi-body interactions in a dense
cluster cause one or more of the stars to be ejected from the region at high
velocity. Both mechanisms have the potential to affect the surface composition
of the runaway star. TLUSTY non-LTE model atmosphere calculations have been
used to determine atmospheric parameters and carbon, nitrogen, magnesium and
silicon abundances for a sample of B-type runaways. These same analytical tools
were used by Hunter et al. (2009) for their analysis of 50 B-type open cluster
Galactic stars (i.e. non-runaways). Effective temperatures were deduced using
the silicon-ionization balance technique, surface gravities from Balmer line
profiles and microturbulent velocities derived using the Si spectrum. The
runaways show no obvious abundance anomalies when compared with stars in the
open clusters. The runaways do show a spread in composition which almost
certainly reflects the Galactic abundance gradient and a range in the
birthplaces of the runaways in the Galactic disk. Since the observed Galactic
abundance gradients of C, N, Mg and Si are of a similar magnitude, the
abundance ratios (e.g., N/Mg) are, as obtained, essentially uniform across the
sample.

of output variability generated by an upstream function that can be
tolerated/absorbed by a downstream function, without significantly increasing
of its subsequent output variability. A fuzzy based quantification of the VR on
expert judgment has been developed when quantitative data are not available.

electric vehicles (EV) to provide distributed primary control and to eliminate
frequency peaks. To do so we for the first time explicitly model the network
structure and incorporate non-Gaussian, strongly intermittent fluctuations
typical for RES.
  We show that EVs can completely eliminate frequency peaks. Using threshold
randomization we further demonstrate that demand synchronization effects and
battery stresses can be greatly reduced. In contrast, explicit frequency
averaging has a strong destabilizing effect, suggesting that the role of delays
in distributed control schemes requires further studies.
  Overall we find that distributed control outperforms central one. The results
are robust against a further increase in renewable power production and

approaches have been published for analyzing identifiability. However, they are
typically computationally demanding, difficult to perform and/or not applicable

  Here, an intuitive approach is presented which enables quickly testing of
parameter identifiability. Numerical optimization with a penalty in radial
direction enforcing displacement of the parameters is used to check whether
estimated parameters are unique, or whether the parameters can be altered
without loss of agreement with the data indicating non-identifiability. This
Identifiability-Test by Radial Penalization (ITRP) can be employed for every
model where optimization-based fitting like least-squares or maximum likelihood
is feasible and is therefore applicable for all typical deterministic models.

charge and pairing fluctuations. Each fluctuation channel acquires substantial
dependencies on all three Matsubara frequencies, such that the frequency
dependence of the vertex cannot be accurately represented by a channel sum with
only one frequency variable in each term. At the temperatures we are able to
access, the leading instabilities are mostly antiferromagnetic, with an
incommensurate wave vector. However, at large doping, a divergence in the
charge channel occurs at a finite frequency transfer, if the vertex flow is
computed without self-energy feedback. This enigmatic instability was already
observed in a calculation by Husemann et al. [Phys. Rev. B 85, 075121 (2012)],
who used an approximate separable ansatz for the frequency dependence of the
vertex. We identify a simple mechanism for this instability in terms of a
random phase approximation for the charge channel with a frequency dependent
effective magnetic interaction as input. In spite of the strong momentum and
frequency dependence of the vertex, the self-energy has a Fermi liquid form. At
the moderate interaction strength where our approach is applicable, we obtain a
moderate reduction of the quasi-particle weight and a sizable decay rate with a
pronounced momentum dependence. Nevertheless, the self-energy feedback into the
vertex flow turns out to be crucial, as it suppresses the unphysical finite
frequency charge instability.

Herein, we show that both the proposed new scalings and the Prandtl Plus
scalings have a theoretical underpinning which requires that the boundary layer
must show whole profile similarity for the scalings to be applicable. The
problem is that wall-bounded turbulent boundary layers are generally
acknowledged as not showing whole profile similarity under any circumstances.
Thus, applying scaling parameters that subsume whole profile similarity to
boundary layers that do not show whole profile similarity means that, at best,
the result represents a good approximation. Computer simulation results are
used to explore these issues and provides at least preliminary experimental
support of the theoretical failures.

ASASSN-14li, PTF15af and iPTF16fnl display strong nitrogen emission lines but
weak or undetectable carbon lines. In these three objects, the upper limits of
the C III] $\lambda 1908$/N III] $\lambda 1750$ ratio are about two orders of
magnitude lower than those of quasars, suggesting a high abundance ratio of
[N/C]. With detailed photoionization simulations, we demonstrate that $C^{2+}$
and $N^{2+}$ are formed in the same zone, so the C III]/N III] ratio depends
only moderately on the physical conditions in the gas and weakly on the shape
of the ionizing continuum. There are smaller than $0.5$ dex variations in the
line ratio over wide ranges of gas densities and ionization parameters at a
given metallicity. This allows a robust estimate of the relative abundance
ratio nitrogen to carbon. We derive a relative abundance ratio of [N/C]$>1.5$
for ASASSN-14li, and even higher for PTF15af and iPTF16fnl. This suggests that
the broad line region in those TDE sources is made of nitrogen-enhanced core
material that falls back at later times. Based on stellar evolution models, the
lower limit of the disrupted star should be larger than 0.6M$_{\odot}$. The
chemical abundance of the line emitting gas gives a convincing evidence that
the flares origin from stellar tidal disruptions. The coincidence of the
weakness of the X-ray emission with the strong broad absorption lines in
PTF15af, iPTF16fnl and the strong X-ray emission without such lines in
ASASSN-li14 are in analogy to quasars with and without broad absorption lines.

distributed synchronization of columns of rotation matrices. More precisely, k
specific columns shall be synchronized and only the corresponding k columns of
the relative rotations between the agents are assumed to be available for the
control design. When one specific column is considered, the problem is
equivalent to synchronization on the (d-1)-dimensional unit sphere and when all
the columns are considered, the problem is equivalent to synchronization on
SO(d). We design dynamic control laws for these synchronization problems. The
control laws are based on the introduction of auxiliary variables in
combination with a QR-factorization approach. The benefit of this
QR-factorization approach is that we can decouple the dynamics for the k
columns from the remaining d-k ones. Under the control scheme, the closed loop
system achieves almost global convergence to synchronization for quasi-strong
interaction graph topologies.

extending at least 65kpc and with luminosity >10^41 erg/s, while a further 3
groups host smaller galaxy-scale gas halos. The X-ray bright groups have masses
in the range M_500=0.5-5x10^13 Msol, based on system temperatures of 0.4-1.4
keV, and X-ray luminosities in the range 2-200x10^41 erg/s. We find that

than found by previous archival surveys. Approximately 30% of the X-ray bright
groups show evidence of recent dynamical interactions (mergers or sloshing),
and ~35% of their dominant early-type galaxies host AGN with radio jets. We
find no groups with unusually high central entropies, as predicted by some
simulations, and confirm that CLoGS is in principle capable of detecting such
systems. We identify three previously unrecognized groups, and find that they
are either faint (L_X,R500<10^42 erg/s) with no concentrated cool core, or
highly disturbed. This leads us to suggest that ~20% of X-ray bright groups in
the local universe may still be unidentified.

evidence that the long-range multi-particle azimuthal correlations persist to
events with low multiplicity. Furthermore, $v_2\{4\}$ is found to be smaller

on a genetic method, namely differential evolution, the algorithm can exploit
all available information of an iFROG measurement to retrieve the complex
electric field of a pulse. The retrieval is subjected to a series of numerical
tests to prove robustness of the algorithm against experimental artifacts and
noise. These tests show that the integrated error-correction mechanisms of the
iFROG method can be successfully used to remove the effect from timing errors
and spectrally varying efficiency in the detection. Moreover, the accuracy and
noise resilience of the new algorithm are shown to outperform retrieval based
on the generalized projections algorithm, which is widely used as the standard
method in FROG retrieval. The differential evolution algorithm is further
validated with experimental data, measured with unamplified three-cycle pulses
from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. Additionally introducing group delay
dispersion in the beam path, the retrieval results show excellent agreement
with independent measurements with a commercial pulse measurement device based
on spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field retrieval. Further
experimental tests with strongly attenuated pulses indicate resilience of
differential evolution based retrieval against massive measurement noise.

scattering (QENS) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous

et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 014105 (2016)]. To investigate their dynamics, ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using
$\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$ with 001 cation order as a
simple model system for the tetragonal platelets in NBT-3.6BT. Similarly,
111-ordered $\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$ was used as a
model for the rhombohedral matrix. The measured single crystal QENS spectra
could be reproduced by a linear combination of calculated spectra. We find that
the relaxational dynamics of NBT-3.6BT are concentrated in the tetragonal
platelets. Chaotic stages, during which the local tilt order changes
incessantly on the timescale of several picoseconds, cause the most significant
contribution to the quasielastic intensity. They can be regarded as an excited
state of tetragonal platelets, whose relaxation back into a quasistable state
might explain the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties of
NBT-3.6BT in the 100 GHz to THz range. This substantiates the assumption that
the relaxor properties of NBT-3.6BT originate from the tetragonal platelets.

to stabilize the system linearly. The nonlinear dynamics are much less
sensitive to sheared flows than the average linear growthrates, and very small
amplitude perturbations can lead to sustained turbulence. We explore the
general problem of characterizing how and when the transition from near-laminar
states to sustained turbulence occurs; a model of the interchange instability
being used as a concrete example. These questions are fundamentally nonlinear,
and the answers must go beyond the linear transient amplification of small
perturbations. Two methods that account for nonlinear interactions are
therefore explored here. The first method explored is edge tracking, which
identifies the boundary between the basins of attraction of the laminar and
turbulent states. Here, the edge is found to be structured around an exact,
localized, traveling wave solution; a solution that is qualitatively similar to
avalanche-like bursts seen in the turbulent regime. The second method is an
application of nonlinear, non-modal stability theory which allows us to
identify the smallest disturbances which can trigger turbulence (the minimal
seed for the problem) and hence to quantify how stable the laminar regime is.
The results obtained from these fully nonlinear methods provides confidence in
the derivation of a semi-analytic approximation for the minimal seed.

microscope capable of fluorescence lifetime imaging beyond the diffraction
limit. The utility of FLIM for biological research is illustrated by examples
of experimental studies of the molecular structure of sarcomeres in muscle
fibres and of signalling at the immune synapse. The application of
microstructured optical fibre to provide tunable supercontinuum excitation
source for a range of FLIM microscopes is presented, including wide-field,
Nipkow disk confocal and hyper-spectral line scanning FLIM microscopes. The
application of supercontinuum generation to the first super-resolved FLIM
microscope is then described. This novel microscope exploited the concept of
STED with a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser providing a tunable
excitation beam by pumping microstructured optical fibre for supercontinuum
generation and directly providing the (longer wavelength) STED beam. This STED
microscope was implemented in a commercial scanning confocal microscope to
provide compatibility with standard biological imaging, and exploited digital
holography using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to provide the appropriate
phase manipulation for shaping the STED beam profile and to compensate for
aberrations. The STED microscope was shown to be capable of recording
superresolution images in both the lateral and axial planes, according to the
settings of the SLM.

These limitations can manifest themselves in dynamically inconsistent state
estimates. We investigate this issue in this paper for highly oscillatory
Hamiltonian systems with a dynamical behavior which satisfies certain balance
relations. We first demonstrate that the standard ensemble Kalman filter can
lead to estimates which do not satisfy those balance relations, ultimately
leading to filter divergence. We also propose two remedies for this phenomenon
in terms of blended time-stepping schemes and ensemble-based penalty methods.
The effect of these modifications to the standard ensemble Kalman filter are
discussed and demonstrated numerically for two model scenarios. First, we
consider balanced motion for highly oscillatory Hamiltonian systems and,

we show the following for domains $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$:

absolute continuity of interior and exterior elliptic measures for {\it any}

have dimension $n$.
  2. We generalize the work of Kenig and Toro [KT06] and show that VMO
equivalence of doubling interior and exterior elliptic measures for general

  3. In a uniform domain that satisfies the capacity density condition and
whose boundary is locally finite and has a.e. positive lower $n$-Hausdorff
density, we show that if the elliptic measure is absolutely continuous with
respect to $n$-Hausdorff measure then the boundary is rectifiable. This
generalizes the work of Akman, Badger, Hofmann, and Martell [ABHM17].

states in a single-component fluid. It is either found or predicted, usually at
extreme conditions, for a broad group of very different substances, including
helium, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur,tellurium, cerium, hydrogen and
tin tetraiodide. This phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply
supercooled water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental
limit of homogeneous ice formation. We present a generic phenomenological
approach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component fluid, which is
completely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. We show that
fluid polyamorphism may occur either in the presence or the absence of fluid
phase separation depending on the symmetry of the order parameter. In the
latter case, it is associated with a second-order transition, such as in liquid
helium or liquid sulfur. To specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with
thermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct interconvertible states or
molecular structures. A fundamental signature of this concept is the
identification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules involved in each of
these alternative states. However, the existence of the alternative structures
may result in polyamorphic fluid phase separation only if mixing of these
structures is not ideal. The two-state thermodynamics unifies all the debated
scenarios of fluid polyamorphism in different areas of condensed-matter
physics, with or without phase separation, and even goes beyond the phenomenon
of polyamorphism by generically describing the anomalous properties of fluids
exhibiting interconversion of alternative molecular states.

perturbations that close the spectral gap. Moreover, we prove formulas also for
higher order response coefficients.
  Our justification of linear response theory is based on a novel extension of
the adiabatic theorem to situations where a time-dependent perturbation closes
the gap. According to the standard version of the adiabatic theorem, when the
perturbation is switched on adiabatically and as long as the gap does not
close, the initial ground state evolves into the ground state of the perturbed
operator. The new adiabatic theorem states that for perturbations that are
either slowly varying potentials or small quasi-local operators, once the
perturbation closes the gap, the adiabatic evolution follows non-equilibrium
almost-stationary states (NEASS) that we construct explicitly.

new WN stars, and 6 candidates awaiting confirmation, providing little evidence

exploits the diversity from different parts of a high-dimensional feature

Specifically, given an image, the extracted feature is divided into

iteratively encoded into a new feature. Finally, the new features from the same

Specifically, the fractal networks are characterized by the direct social
connection and the self-similarity. Firstly, for a fractal D2D social network
with direct social communications, it is proved that the maximum capacity is $
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log n}}\right) $ if a user communicates with one
of his/her direct contacts randomly, where $ n $ denotes the total number of

the inter-connected multiple users, the fractal D2D social network with these

reduced in proportional to $ \frac{1}{{\log n}} $ if $ 2<\epsilon<3 $, while

the traditional signature. Two Boolean functions, f and g, may be equivalent
when they have the same SS vector. The symmetry mark can distinguish symmetric
variables and asymmetric variables and search multiple variable mappings in a
single variable-mapping search operation, which reduces the search space
significantly. Updating the SS vector using Shannon decomposition provides
benefits in distinguishing unidentified variables, and the group mark and the
phase collision check discover incorrect variable mappings quickly, which also
speeds up the NPN Boolean matching process. Using the algorithm proposed in
this paper, we tested both equivalent and non-equivalent matching peeds on the
MCNC benchmark circuit sets and the random circuit sets. In the experiment, our
algorithm is two times faster than competitors when testing equivalent circuits

  from a Single Image","11 pages, 9 figures, NIPS",,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D reconstruction from a single image is a key problem in multiple
applications ranging from robotic manipulation to augmented reality. Prior
methods have tackled this problem through generative models which predict 3D
reconstructions as voxels or point clouds. However, these methods can be
computationally expensive and miss fine details. We introduce a new
differentiable layer for 3D data deformation and use it in DeformNet to learn a
model for 3D reconstruction-through-deformation. DeformNet takes an image
input, searches the nearest shape template from a database, and deforms the
template to match the query image. We evaluate our approach on the ShapeNet
dataset and show that - (a) the Free-Form Deformation layer is a powerful new
building block for Deep Learning models that manipulate 3D data (b) DeformNet
uses this FFD layer combined with shape retrieval for smooth and
detail-preserving 3D reconstruction of qualitatively plausible point clouds
with respect to a single query image (c) compared to other state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods, DeformNet quantitatively matches or outperforms their
benchmarks by significant margins. For more information, visit:

have access to another (non-acoustic) modality for feature learning but not at

recently proposed deep generative method for multi-view representation
learning. We also extend VCCA with improved latent variable priors and with
adversarial learning. Compared to other techniques for multi-view feature
learning, VCCA's advantages include an intuitive latent variable interpretation
and a variational lower bound objective that can be trained end-to-end
efficiently. We compare VCCA and its extensions with previous feature learning
methods on the University of Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Database, and show that
VCCA-based feature learning improves over previous methods for
speaker-independent phonetic recognition.

recent years quantum versions of classical games have been proposed and
studied. In this paper, we consider a quantum version of the classical
Barro-Gordon game which captures the problem of time inconsistency in monetary
economics. Such time inconsistency refers to the temptation of weak policy
maker to implement high inflation when the public expects low inflation. The
inconsistency arises when the public punishes the weak policy maker in the next
cycle. We first present a quantum version of the Barro-Gordon game. Next, we
show that in a particular case of the quantum game, time-consistent Nash
equilibrium could be achieved when public expects low inflation, thus resolving
the game.

It seems to be difficult to get solution formula for PDE model which

unified 2 factor model of structural and reduced form types and we study a
numerical analysis for it by explicit finite difference scheme. These equations
are parabolic equations with 3 variables and they include mixed derivatives, so
the explicit finite difference scheme is not stable in general. We find

  Microcavity","25 pages,5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities generate fascinating
effects such as long-range spatial coherence and Bose-Einstein Condensation
(BEC), which are attractive for their potential use in low threshold lasers,
vortices and slowing light, etc. However, currently most of exciton-polariton
effects either occur at cryogenic temperature or rely on expensive cavity
fabrication procedures. Further exploring new semiconductor microcavities with
stronger exciton photon interaction strength is extensively needed. Herein, we
demonstrate room temperature photon exciton strong coupling in hybrid
inorganic-organic CH3NH3PbBr3 Fabry-P\'erot microcavities for the first time.
The vacuum Rabi splitting energy is up to ~390 meV, which is ascribed to large
oscillator strength and photon confinement in reduced dimension of optical
microcavities. With increasing pumping energy, exciton-photon coupling strength
is weakened due to carrier screening effect, leading to occurrence of photonic
lasing instead of polartion lasing. The demonstrated strong coupling between
photons and excitons in perovskite microcavities would be helpful for
development of high performance polariton-based incoherent and coherent light
sources, nonlinear optics, and slow light applications.
