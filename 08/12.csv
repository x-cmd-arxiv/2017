4100 meters above sea level. HAWC is able to detect secondary particles from
extensive air showers (EAS) initiated in the interaction of a primary particle
(either a gamma or a charged cosmic ray) with the upper atmosphere. Because an
overwhelming majority of EAS events are triggered by cosmic rays, background
noise suppression plays an important role in the data analysis process of the
HAWC observatory. Currently, HAWC uses cuts on two parameters (whose values
depend on the spatial distribution and luminosity of an event) to separate
gamma-ray events from background hadronic showers. In this work, a search for
additional gamma-hadron separation parameters was conducted to improve the
efficiency of the HAWC background suppression technique. The best-performing
parameters were integrated to a feed-foward Multilayer Perceptron Neural
Network (MLP-NN), along with the traditional parameters. Various iterations of
MLP-NN's were trained on Monte Carlo data, and tested on Crab data. Preliminary
results show that the addition of new parameters can improve the significance
of the point source at high-energies (~ TeV), at the expense of slightly worse
performance in conventional low-energy bins (~ GeV). Further work is underway
to improve the efficiency of the neural network at low energies.

surveys - and is obscured by the Milky Way. The structure lies close to the
apex where residual bulkflows suggest considerable mass excess. The uncovered
Vela Supercluster (VSCL) conforms of a confluence of merging walls, but its

and N$_i$ in ZnGeN$_2$. Corrections to the band gap are included by means of
the LDA+U method.
  The Zn and Ge interstitials are both found to strongly prefer the larger
octahedral site compared to the two types of tetrahedral sites.
  The Zn interstitial is found to be a shallow double donor but has higher
energy than previously studied antisite defects. It has a resonance in the
conduction band which is Zn-$s$ like.
  The Ge interstitial is an even higher energy of formation defect and also
behaves as a shallow double donor but has also a deep level in the gap,
corresponding to a Ge-$s$ orbital character while the Ge-$p$ forms a resonance
in the conduction band.
  The nitrogen interstitial forms a split-interstitial configuration, as also
occurs in GaN. Its electronic levels can be related to that of a N$_2$
molecule. The defect levels in the gap correspond to the $\pi_g$-like lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecule, which here becomes filled
with 3 electrons in the defect's neutral charge state. They are found to prefer
a high-spin configuration in the $q=+1$ state.
  The corresponding transition levels are obtained and show that this is an
amphoteric trap level occurring in $+2$, $+1$, 0 and $-1$ charge states. The
two possible sites for this split interstitial, on top of Zn or on top of Ge
differ slightly in N$_2$ bond-length. While the N$_i$ defects have the lowest
formation energy among the interstitials, it is still higher than that of the
antisites.
  Hence they are not expected to occur in sufficient concentration to affect
the intrinsic Fermi level position. In particular, they do not contribute to
the unintentional n-type background doping.

segregating to the grain boundary the strain contribution to the work of grain
boundary decohesion is small and that the chemical contribution correlates with
the electronegativity difference between Cu and the impurity. The strain
contribution to the work of dislocation emission is calculated to be negative,
while the chemical contribution to be always positive. Both the strain and
chemical contributions to the work of dislocation emission generally become
weaker with the increasing electronegativity from Mg to S. By combining these
contributions together we find, in agreement with experimental observations,
that a strong segregation of S can reduce the work of grain boundary separation
below the work of dislocation emission, thus embrittling Cu, while such an
embrittlement cannot be produced by a P segregation because it lowers the
energy barrier for dislocation emission relatively more than for work
separation.

manifold traced out by the signal waveforms in the function space of data
segments. The $\chi^2$ is then defined as the square of the $L_2$ norm of the
data vector projected onto a finite dimensional subspace (the fibre) of the
Hilbert space of data trains and orthogonal to the signal waveform - any such
fibre leads to a $\chi^2$ discriminator and the full vector bundle comprising
the subspaces and the base manifold constitute the $\chi^2$ discriminator. We
show that the $\chi^2$ discriminators used so far in the CBC searches
correspond to different fiber structures constituting different vector bundles
on the same base manifold, namely, the parameter space. The general formulation
indicates procedures to formulate new $\chi^2$s which could be more effective
in discriminating against commonly occurring glitches in the data. It also
shows that no $\chi^2$ with a reasonable degree of freedom is foolproof. It
could also shed light on understanding why the traditional $\chi^2$ works so
well. As an example, we propose a family of ambiguity $\chi^2$ discriminators
that is an alternative to the traditional one. Any such ambiguity $\chi^2$
makes use of the filtered output of the template bank, thus adding negligible
cost to the overall search. We test the performance of ambiguity $\chi^2$ on
simulated data using spinless TaylorF2 waveforms. We show that the ambiguity
$\chi^2$ essentially gives a clean separation between glitches and signals.
Finally, we investigate the effects of mismatch between signal and templates on
the $\chi^2$ and also further indicate how the ambiguity $\chi^2$ can be
generalized to detector networks for coherent observations.

random--geometric graph (RGG) considers a set of vertices uniformly and
independently distributed on the unit square, while for a random--rectangular
graph (RRG) the embedding geometry is a rectangle. The RRG model depends on
three parameters: The rectangle side lengths $a$ and $1/a$, the connection
radius $r$, and the number of vertices $N$. We then study in detail the case
$a=1$ which corresponds to weighted RGGs and explore weighted RRGs
characterized by $a\sim 1$, i.e.~two-dimensional geometries, but also approach
the limit of quasi-one-dimensional wires when $a\gg1$. In general we look for
the scaling properties of $P(s)$ and $\ell$ as a function of $a$, $r$ and $N$.
We find that the ratio $r/N^\gamma$, with $\gamma(a)\approx -1/2$, fixes the
properties of both RGGs and RRGs. Moreover, when $a\ge 10$ we show that
spectral and eigenfunction properties of weighted RRGs are universal for the

correspond to the two different convergence regions of the nonlinear map. Based
on the analysis of the border (the so-called Julia set) between the two regions
of convergence, we show that it is always possible to find a map capable of
deciding whether an unknown state is within a neighborhood of fixed radius
around a desired quantum state. We analyze which one- and two-qubit operations

unitary gate for each map or, alternatively, a universal special two-qubit gate

sources in boron nitride, which appear in form of narrow lines emitting
centres. Here, we aim to compactly characterise their basic optical properties,
including the demonstration of several novel findings, in order to inspire
discussion about their origin and utility. Initial inspection reveals the
presence of narrow emission lines in boron nitride powder and exfoliated flakes
of hexagonal boron nitride deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates. Generally rather
stable, the boron nitride emitters constitute a good quality visible light
source. However, as briefly discussed, certain specimens reveal a peculiar type
of blinking effects, which are likely related to existence of meta-stable
electronic states. More advanced characterisation of representative stable
emitting centres uncovers a strong dependence of the emission intensity on the
energy and polarisation of excitation. On this basis, we speculate that rather
strict excitation selectivity is an important factor determining the character
of the emission spectra, which allows the observation of single and
well-isolated emitters. Finally, we investigate the properties of the emitting
centres in varying external conditions. Quite surprisingly, it is found that
the application of a magnetic field introduces no change in the emission
spectra of boron nitride emitters. Further analysis of the impact of
temperature on the emission spectra and the features seen in second-order
correlation functions is used to provide an assessment of the potential
functionality of boron nitride emitters as single photon sources capable of

bipolar or point-symmetric shapes of planetary nebulae (PNe) and PPNe are due
to binary interactions. Observations from three observatories were combined
from 2007-2015 to search for variations on the order of a few years and then
combined with earlier observations from 1991-1995 to search for variations on
the order of decades. All seven show velocity variations due to periodic
pulsation in the range of 35-135 days. However, in only one PPN, IRAS
22272+5435, did we find even marginal evidence found for multi-year variations
that might be due to a binary companion. This object shows
marginally-significant evidence of a two-year period of low semi-amplitude
which could be due to a low-mass companion, and it also displays some evidence
of a much longer period of >30 years. The absence of evidence in the other six
objects for long-period radial velocity variations due to a binary companion
sets significant constraints on the properties of any undetected binary
companions: they must be of low mass, <0.2 M(sun), or long period, >30 years.
Thus the present observations do not provide direct support for the binary
hypothesis to explain the shapes of PNe and PPNe and severely constrains the
properties of any such undetected companions.

b=0.78+/-0.08. The residuals are systematically different between the six
regions and reveal a strong correlation with metallicity Z, of the type c =
(-3.69+/-0.02) - (0.30+/-0.04) log Z/Zsun. A possible interpretation of this
trend is that when the metallicity is higher so is the radiation pressure and
this limits the accretion process, both in its rate and duration.

one gluon exchange quark interaction. The quark field is splitted into two
components, one for background constituent quarks and another one for
quark-antiquark states, light mesons and the scalar chiral condensate. By
considering a large quark effective mass derivative expansion, several
effective coupling constants are resolved as functions of the original model
parameters and of components of the quark and gluon propagators. Besides the
leading single vector meson-constituent quark gauge-type effective coupling,
several two-vector and axial mesons-constituent quark couplings are also
obtained in the next leading order. Among these, vector and axial mesons
mixings induced by constituent quark currents are found.Approximated and exact
ratios between the effective coupling constants in the limit of very large
quark effective mass and numerical estimates are exhibited. Numerical results
of the corresponding form factors and of the (strong) vector meson quadratic

simulation of a Milky Way--like halo. In this paper, we take advantage of the
first \textit{Gaia} data release, coupled with spectroscopic measurements from
the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE), to study the kinematics of stars
belonging to the metal-poor halo within an average distance of $\sim 5$ kpc of
the Sun. We study stars with iron abundances [Fe/H]$ < -1.5$ and $-1.8$ that
are located more than $1.5$ kpc from the Galactic plane. Using a Gaussian
mixture model analysis, we identify the stars that belong to the halo
population, as well as some kinematic outliers. We find that both metallicity
samples have similar velocity distributions for the halo component, within
uncertainties. Assuming that the stellar halo velocities adequately trace the
virialized dark matter, we study the implications for direct detection
experiments. The Standard Halo Model, which is typically assumed for dark
matter, is discrepant with the empirical distribution by $\sim6\sigma$ and
predicts fewer high-speed particles. As a result, the Standard Halo Model
overpredicts the nuclear scattering rate for dark matter masses below $\sim 10$
GeV. The kinematic outliers that we identify may potentially be correlated with
dark matter substructure, though further study is needed to establish this
correspondence.

failed to detect extended radio emission associated with the cluster as is
typically seen in such systems. We present new, multi-configuration $1-2$ GHz
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of Abell 2146 totalling 16
hours of observations. These data reveal for the first time the presence of an
extended ($\approx850$ kpc), faint radio structure associated with Abell 2146.
The structure appears to harbour multiple components, one associated with the
upstream shock which we classify as a radio relic and one associated with the
subcluster core which is consisted as being a radio halo bounded by the bow
shock. The newly detected structures have some of the lowest radio powers
detected thus far in any cluster ($P_{\rm 1.4 GHz,
halo}=2.4\pm0.2\times10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $P_{\rm 1.4 GHz,
relic}=2.2\pm0.2\times10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). The flux measurement of the halo,
as well as its morphology, also suggest that the halo was recently created
($\approx0.3$ Gyr after core passage), consistent with the dynamical state of
the cluster. These observations demonstrate the capacity of the upgraded VLA to
detect extremely faint and extended radio structures. Based on these
observations, we predict that many more radio relics and radio halos in merging

Identifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of

form and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting
subhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation
of this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more
physically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological
simulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass
function are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between
the two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive
subhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal
stripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more
concentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.
Subhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the
masses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This
may explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster
centres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the
peak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the
merger trees constructed using HBT+ do not suffer from the missing or switched
links that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo
finders. We make the HBT+ code publicly available.

  ANTARES neutrino telescope",,,,,"astro-ph.IM physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Muons created by $\nu_\mu$ charged current (CC) interactions in the water
surrounding the ANTARES neutrino telescope have been almost exclusively used so
far in searches for cosmic neutrino sources. Due to their long range, highly
energetic muons inducing Cherenkov radiation in the water are reconstructed
with dedicated algorithms that allow the determination of the parent neutrino
direction with a median angular resolution of about \unit{0.4}{\degree} for an
$E^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum. In this paper, an algorithm optimised for accurate
reconstruction of energy and direction of shower events in the ANTARES detector
is presented. Hadronic showers of electrically charged particles are produced
by the disintegration of the nucleus both in CC and neutral current (NC)
interactions of neutrinos in water. In addition, electromagnetic showers result
from the CC interactions of electron neutrinos while the decay of a tau lepton
produced in $\nu_\tau$ CC interactions will in most cases lead to either a
hadronic or an electromagnetic shower. A shower can be approximated as a point
source of photons. With the presented method, the shower position is
reconstructed with a precision of about \unit{1}{\metre}, the neutrino
direction is reconstructed with a median angular resolution between
\unit{2}{\degree} and \unit{3}{\degree} in the energy range of
\SIrange{1}{1000}{TeV}. In this energy interval, the uncertainty on the
reconstructed neutrino energy is about \SIrange{5}{10}{\%}. The increase in the
detector sensitivity due to the use of additional information from shower
events in the searches for a cosmic neutrino flux is also presented.

to the Fokker-Planck collisional operator, can be understood in terms of a
large entropic driving force that pushes the phase space distribution toward a
Maxwellian, and is a characteristic of the Lyupanov instability for the Coulomb

$m/n=1$ except near the edge, where $q_0$ increases monotonically. This state
is characterized as a single helicity Ohmic equilibrium with the helical

perpendicular current density drives large helical plasma flows. Sensitivity of
this state to flow boundary conditions, plasma resistivity profile, strength of
the electrostatic driving, and parameters such as the loop voltage and the

the votes given by other similar users. In a standard CF framework, it is
assumed that the credibility of every voting user is exactly the same with

to misleading recommendations in many practical applications. A natural
countermeasure is to design a trust-aware CF (TaCF) algorithm, which can take
account of the difference in the credibilities of the voting users when
performing CF. To this end, this paper presents a trust inference approach,
which can predict the implicit trust of the target user on every voting user
from a sparse explicit trust matrix. Then an improved CF algorithm termed
iTrace is proposed, which takes advantage of both the explicit and the
predicted implicit trust to provide recommendations with the CF framework. An
empirical evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed
algorithm provides a significant improvement in recommendation quality in terms
of mean absolute error (MAE).

to the fact that members disperse relatively quickly on Myr time-scales by
secular resonances and the Yarkovsky effect. The spreading of fragments in $a$
by the Yarkovsky effect is indistinguishable from the spreading caused by the
initial ejection of fragments. By examining families $<$20 Myrs-old, we can use
the V-shape identification technique to separate family shapes that are due to
the initial ejection velocity field and those that are due to the Yarkovsky
effect. $<$20 Myr-old asteroid families provide an opportunity to study the
velocity field of family fragments before they become too dispersed. Only the
Karin family's initial velocity field has been determined and scales inversely
with diameter, $D^{-1}$. We have applied the V-shape identification technique
to constrain young families' initial ejection velocity fields by measuring the
curvature of their fragments' V-shape correlation in semi-major axis, $a$, vs.
$D^{-1}$ space. Curvature from a straight line implies a deviation from a
scaling of $D^{-1}$. We measure the V-shape curvature of 11 young asteroid

anomalies in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and
statistical approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy,
traffic patterns. Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to
directly apply supervised learning for anomaly classification, we approached
the problem in two parts. First we used TensorFlow to train our various models
including DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected
value in the time series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that
compared the actual values to predicted values. Since the problem requires
finding sustained anomalies, rather than just short delays or momentary
inactivity in the data, our two detection methods focused on continuous
sections of activity rather than just single points. We tried multiple
combinations of our models and rules and found that using the intersection of
our two anomaly detection methods proved to be an effective method of detecting
anomalies on almost all of our models. In the process we also found that not
all data fell within our experimental assumptions, as one data stream had no

ABA tones and indicated when they heard a change in rhythm. This change is
caused by the manipulation of the B tones' timbre and indexes a change in
perception from integration to segregation, or vice versa. While it was
expected that musicians would detect a change in rhythm earlier when their own
instrument was involved, no such pattern was observed. In Experiment 1b,
designed to control for potential expectation effects in Experiment 1a,
participants heard sequences of static ABA tones and reported their initial
perceptions, whether the sequence was integrated or segregated. Results show
that participants tend to initially perceive these static sequences as
segregated, and that perception is influenced by similarity between the timbres
involved. Finally, in Experiment 2 violinists and flautists located mistuned
notes in an interleaved melody paradigm containing a violin and a flute melody.
Performance did not depend on the instrument the participant played but rather
which melody their attention was directed to. Taken together, results from the

have an influence on auditory grouping, but attentional mechanisms are
necessary for processing auditory scenes.

the Monte Carlo generated samples due to the changed assumptions of event
production dynamics, but without the need of re-generating events. With the
help of weights $\tau$-lepton production or decay processes can be modified
accordingly to a new physics model. In a recent paper a new version TauSpinner
ver.2.0.0 has been presented which includes a provision for introducing
non-standard states and couplings and study their effects in the
vector-boson-fusion processes by exploiting the spin correlations of
$\tau$-lepton pair decay products in processes where final states include also
two hard jets. In the present paper we document how this can be achieved taking
as an example the non-standard spin-2 state that couples to Standard Model
particles and tree-level matrix elements with complete helicity information
included for the parton-parton scattering amplitudes into a $\tau$-lepton pair
and two outgoing partons. This implementation is prepared as the external (user

generated by MadGraph5 and adopted to the TauSpinner algorithm format.
Consistency tests of the implemented matrix elements, reweighting algorithm and
numerical results for observables sensitive to $\tau$ polarization are

enforced by using a basis formed by the repeated application of the free

fundamental to flow visualization. Significant work has been devoted to these
tasks in flow represented by vector fields, but there are unique challenges in
addressing these tasks for time-varying particle data. The unstructured nature
of particle data, nonuniform and sparse sampling, and the inability to access
arbitrary particles in space-time make it difficult to define separation and
clustering for particle data. We observe that weaker notions of separation and
clustering through continuous measures of these structures are meaningful when
coupled with user exploration. We achieve this goal by defining a measure of
particle similarity between pairs of particles. More specifically, separation
occurs when spatially-localized particles are dissimilar, while clustering is
characterized by sets of particles that are similar to one another. To be
robust to imperfections in sampling we use diffusion geometry to compute
particle similarity. Diffusion geometry is parameterized by a scale that allows
a user to explore separation and clustering in a continuous manner. We
illustrate the benefits of our technique on a variety of 2D and 3D flow
datasets, from particles integrated in fluid simulations based on time-varying
vector fields, to particle-based simulations in astrophysics.

Relationships between musical expectancy and emotional responses were
investigated in a study conducted with 40 participants: 20 musicians and 20
non-musicians. Participants took part in one of two behavioural paradigms
measuring continuous expectancy or emotional responses (arousal and valence)
while listening to folk melodies that exhibited either high or low pitch
predictability and high or low onset predictability. The causal influence of
pitch predictability was investigated in an additional condition where pitch
was artificially manipulated and a comparison conducted between original and
manipulated forms; the dynamic correlative influence of pitch and timing
information and its perception on emotional change during listening was
evaluated using cross-sectional time series analysis. The results indicate that
pitch and onset predictability are consistent predictors of perceived
expectancy and emotional response, with onset carrying more weight than pitch.
In addition, musicians and non-musicians do not differ in their responses,
possibly due to shared cultural background and knowledge. The results
demonstrate in a controlled lab-based setting a precise, quantitative
relationship between the predictability of musical structure, expectation and
emotional response.

slightly older, up to $\sim$400 Myr. In this case a red $J-K_s$ color may be

states of a black-hole transient. During the latter, Cygnus X-1 shows a
one-sided relativistic radio-jet. Recent detection of the system in the high
energy (HE; $E\gtrsim60$ MeV) gamma-ray range with \textit{Fermi}-LAT
associates this emission with the outflow. Former MAGIC observations revealed a
hint of flaring activity in the very high-energy (VHE; $E\gtrsim100$ GeV)
regime during this X-ray state. We analyze $\sim97$ hr of Cygnus X-1 data taken
with the MAGIC telescopes between July 2007 and October 2014. To shed light on
the correlation between hard X-ray and VHE gamma rays as previously suggested,
we study each main X-ray state separately. We perform an orbital phase-folded
analysis to look for variability in the VHE band. Additionally, to place this
variability behavior in a multiwavelength context, we compare our results with
\textit{Fermi}-LAT, \textit{AGILE}, \textit{Swift}-BAT, \textit{MAXI},
\textit{RXTE}-ASM, AMI and RATAN-600 data. We do not detect Cygnus X-1 in the
VHE regime. We establish upper limits for each X-ray state, assuming a
power-law distribution with photon index $\Gamma=3.2$. For steady emission in
the hard and soft X-ray states, we set integral upper limits at 95\% confidence
level for energies above 200 GeV at $2.6\times10^{-12}$~photons
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $1.0\times10^{-11}$~photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$,
respectively. We rule out steady VHE gamma-ray emission above this energy
range, at the level of the MAGIC sensitivity, originating in the interaction
between the relativistic jet and the surrounding medium, while the emission
above this flux level produced inside the binary still remains a valid
possibility.

coherency scale in the current sheet associated with magnetic island formation

plasmoid density enhancement's longitudinal and transverse coherency scales as
a function of the guide field strength. We derive these coherency scales from
autocorrelation and wavelet analyses, and demonstrate how these scales may be
used to interpret the density enhancement fluctuation's Fourier power spectra
in terms of a structure formation range, an energy continuation range, and an
inertial range---each population with a distinct spectral slope. We discuss the

signifies the tendency of dislocation defects towards relatively unrestricted
motion. For an isolated dislocation the motion is in the slip plane with
velocity proportional to the shear stress, while due to the long range
interaction dislocation ensembles move towards satisfying emergent collective
elastoplastic modes. Such collective motions have been discussed in terms of
the elusively defined backstress. In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional
stochastic continuum dislocation dynamics theory that clarifies the role of
backstress and demonstrates a precise agreement with the collective behavior of
its discrete counterpart, as a function of applied load and with only three
essential free parameters. The main ingredients of the continuum theory is the
evolution equations of statistically stored and geometrically necessary
dislocation densities, which are driven by the long-range internal stress, a
stochastic flow stress term and, finally, two local diffusion-like terms. The

dwarfs in sigma Orionis over typical rotational time-scales and to search for
new substellar and planetary-mass cluster members. We used VIMOS at the VLT to
monitor a 24 arcmin x 16 arcmin field in the I-band. Using the individual
images from this run we investigated the photometric time series of nine
substellar cluster members with masses from 10 to 60 Mj. The deep stacked image
shows cluster members down to $\approx$ 5 Mj. We search for new planetary mass
objects by combining our deep I-band photometry with public J-band magnitudes
and by examining the nearby environment of known very low mass members for
possible companions. We find two brown dwarfs, with significantly variable,
aperiodic light curves, both with masses around 50 Mj, one of which was
previously unknown to be variable. The physical mechanism responsible for the
observed variability is likely different for the two objects. The variability
of the first object, a single-lined spectroscopic binary, is most likely linked
to its accretion disc, the second may be caused by variable extinction by large
grains. We find five new candidate members from the colour-magnitude diagram
and three from a search for companions within 2000 au. We rule all eight
sources out as potential members based on non-stellar shape and/or infrared
colours. The I-band photometry is made available as a public dataset. We
present two variable brown dwarfs. One is consistent with ongoing accretion,
the other, exhibiting apparent transient variability without presence of an
accretion disc. Our analysis confirms the existing census of substellar cluster
members down to $\approx$ 7 Mj. The zero result from our companion search
agrees with the low occurrence rate of wide companions to brown dwarfs found in
other works.

simple random walk on the integer lattice. It has been observed before that
several standard results for this model continue to hold for a more general
reference walk. Some finer results are known for the so-called long-range
directed polymer in which the reference walk lies in the domain of attraction
of an $\alpha$-stable process. In this note, low-temperature localization
properties recently proved for the classical case are shown to be true with any
reference walk. First, it is proved that the polymer's endpoint distribution is
asymptotically purely atomic, thus strengthening the best known result for
long-range directed polymers. A second result proving geometric localization
along a positive density subsequence is new to the general case. The proofs use
a generalization of the approach introduced by the author with S. Chatterjee in
a recent manuscript on the quenched endpoint distribution; this generalization
allows one to weaken assumptions on the both the walk and the environment. The
methods of this paper also give rise to a variational formula for free energy
which is analogous to the one obtained in the simple random walk case.

terms appear in the objective function. Such terms can represent overhead costs
associated with the underlying state variables. Specifically, this form of
optimization problem can be used to represent optimal scheduling of batteries
such as the Tesla Powerwall for electrical consumers subject to demand charges
- a charge based on the maximum rate of electricity consumption. These demand
charges reflect the cost to the utility of building and maintaining generating
capacity. Unfortunately, we show that dynamic programming problems with
supremum terms do not satisfy the principle of optimality. However, we also
show that the supremum is a special case of the class of forward separable
objective functions. To solve the dynamic programming problem, we propose a
general class of optimization problems with forward separable objectives. We
then show that for any problem in this class, there exists an augmented-state
dynamic programming problem which satisfies the principle of optimality and the
solutions to which yield solutions to the original forward separable problem.
We further generalize this approach to stochastic dynamic programming problems
and apply the results to the problem of optimal battery scheduling with demand
charges using a databased stochastic model for electricity usage and solar
generation by the consumer.

same time the static and dynamic electron correlation. The starting-point is a
determinant wavefunction formed with natural orbitals obtained from a new
interacting-pair model. The latter leads to a natural orbital functional (NOF)
capable of recovering the complete intra-pair, but only the static inter-pair
correlation. Using the solution of the NOF, two new energy functionals are
defined for both dynamic (Edyn) and static (Esta) correlation. Edyn is derived
from a modified second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), while
Esta is obtained from the static component of the new NOF. Double counting is
avoided by introducing the amount of static and dynamic correlation in each
orbital as a function of its occupation. As a result, the total energy is
represented by the sum Ehf + Edyn + Esta, where Ehf is the Hartree-Fock energy
obtained with natural orbitals. The new procedure called NOF-MP2 scales
formally as O(M^5)(M: number of basis functions), and is applied successfully
to the homolytic dissociation of a selected set of diatomic molecules,
paradigmatic cases of near-degeneracy effects. Its size-consistency has been
numerically demonstrated for singlets. The values obtained are in good

two variability timescales: (1) the shortest one, between 7 and 28 days, is
consistent with the light travel time between the ionizing source and the part
of the disk emitting the line; and (2) a longer one of $\gtrsim 3$ months

outer part of the the accretion disk. We modeled the line profiles as due to
emission from a region between $\approx$ 300 and 3000 gravitational radii of a
relativistic, Keplerian accretion disk surrounding the SMBH. Superposed on the
disk emissivity, the model includes an asymmetric feature in the shape of a
spiral arm with a rotation period of $\approx$ 21 months, which reproduces the
variations in the relative intensity of the blue and red sides of the profile.

burst (FRB) 121102 has led to the discovery of persistent radio and optical
counterparts, the identification of a host dwarf galaxy at a redshift of
$z=0.193$, and several campaigns of searches for higher-frequency counterparts,
which gave only upper limits on the emission flux. Although the origin of FRBs
remains unknown, most of the existing theoretical models are associated with
pulsars, or more specifically, magnetars. In this paper, we explore persistent
high-energy emission from a rapidly rotating highly magnetized pulsar
associated with FRB 121102 if internal gradual magnetic dissipation occurs in
the pulsar wind. We find that the efficiency of converting the spin-down
luminosity to the high-energy (e.g., X-ray) luminosity is generally much
smaller than unity, even for a millisecond magnetar. This provides an
explanation for the non-detection of high-energy counterparts to FRB 121102. We
further constrain the spin period and surface magnetic field strength of the
pulsar with the current high-energy observations. In addition, we compare our
results with the constraints given by the other methods in previous works and
would expect to apply our new method to some other open issues in the future.

parameters and predict the time evolution of complex dynamical models using
sequentially-collected data. Here we introduce a general methodology for the
joint estimation of the static parameters and the forecasting of the state
variables of nonlinear, and possibly chaotic, dynamical models. The proposed
scheme is essentially probabilistic. It aims at recursively computing the
sequence of joint posterior probability distributions of the unknown model
parameters and its (time varying) state variables conditional on the available
observations. The latter are possibly partial and contaminated by noise. The
new framework combines a Monte Carlo scheme to approximate the posterior
distribution of the fixed parameters with filtering (or {\em data
assimilation}) techniques to track and predict the distribution of the state
variables. For this reason, we refer to the proposed methodology as {\em nested
filtering}. In this paper we specifically explore the use of Gaussian filtering
methods, but other approaches fit naturally within the new framework. As an
illustrative example, we apply three different implementations of the
methodology to the tracking of the state, and the estimation of the fixed
parameters, of a stochastic two-scale Lorenz 96 system. This model is commonly
used to assess data assimilation procedures in meteorology. For this example,
we compare different nested filters and show estimation and forecasting results

spacetime modes, the so-called $w$-modes, of GWs emitted from a proto-neutron
star (PNS) in the postbounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. Using results
from recent three-dimensional supernova models, we study how to infer the
properties of the PNS based on a quasi-normal mode analysis in the context of
the GW asteroseismology. We find that the $w_1$-mode frequency multiplied by
the PNS radius is expressed as a linear function with respect to the ratio of
the PNS mass to the PNS radius. This relation is insensitive to the nuclear
equation of state (EOS) employed in this work. Combining with another universal
relation of the $f$-mode oscillations, we point out that the time dependent
mass-radius relation of the PNS can be obtained by observing both the $f$- and
$w_1$-mode GWs simultaneously. Our results suggest that the simultaneous
detection of the two modes could provide a new probe into finite-temperature
nuclear EOS that predominantly determines the PNS evolution.

between neighboring beamlets. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that SRS
can be almost completely suppressed with DBLs at the laser intensity
$\sim10^{15}$ W/cm$^2$. Moreover, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) will be
suppressed simultaneously with DBLs as long as SRS is suppressed. DBLs can be

non-rigidly aligned CAD models. Running these simulations allows us to apply
new, unseen forces to move or deform selected objects, change physical
parameters such as mass or elasticity, or even add entire new objects that
interact with the rest of the underlying scene. In Calipso, the user makes
edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then
transfered to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a
photo-realistic rendering process. To align the CAD models, we introduce an
efficient CAD-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and
non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input
shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene
motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics. We
demonstrate Calipso's physics-based editing on a wide range of examples

where $\mathbf{Q}$ is a nonrandom matrix of dimension $p\times k$, and
$\{\mathbf{x}_j\}$ is a sequence of independent $k$-dimensional random vector

here is that the dimension $k\ge p$ can be arbitrary, possibly infinity. This
new model of sample covariance matrices $\mathbf{B}_n$ covers most of the known
models as its special cases. For example, standard sample covariance matrices
are obtained with $k=p$ and $\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{T}_n^{1/2}$ for some positive
definite Hermitian matrix $\mathbf{T}_n$. Also with $k=\infty$ our model covers
the case of repeated linear processes considered in recent high-dimensional
time series literature. The CLT found in this paper substantially generalizes
the seminal CLT in Bai and Silverstein (2004). Applications of this new CLT are
proposed for testing the structure of a high-dimensional covariance matrix. The
derived tests are then used to analyse a large fMRI data set regarding its

an adverse effect on the zero mode, which extends further into the bulk and is
accompanied by an increased energy splitting between pairs of states of

showing an enhancement of localization at the system's end accompanied by a
reduction in the mean pairwise energy splitting. We discuss our results in the

optimal path and/or departure time based on the transportation network
characteristics and user behavior (e.g., selfish or social). In the literature,
most of the contributions study DTA problems without including traffic signal
control in the framework. The few contributions that report signal control
models are either mixed-integer or nonlinear formulations and computationally
intractable. The only continuous linear signal control method presented in the
literature is the Cycle-length Same as Discrete Time-interval (CSDT) control
scheme. This model entails a trade-off between cycle-length and cell-length.
Furthermore, this approach compromises accuracy and usability of the solutions.
  In this study, we propose a novel signal control model namely, Signal Control
with Realistic Cycle length (SCRC) which overcomes the trade-off between
cycle-length and cell-length and strikes a balance between complexity and
accuracy. The underlying idea of this model is to use a different time scale
for the cycle-length. This time scale can be set to any multiple of the time
slot of the Dynamic Network Loading (DNL) model (e.g. CTM, TTM, and LTM) and
enables us to set realistic lengths for the signal control cycles. Results
show, the SCRC model not only attains accuracy comparable to the CSDT model but
also more resilient against extreme traffic conditions. Furthermore, the
presented approach substantially reduces computational complexity and can
attain solution faster.

However, the mere detection of an outlying case does not always answer all
scientific questions associated with that data point. Outlier detection
techniques, classical and robust alike, will typically flag the entire case as
outlying, or attribute a specific case weight to the entire case. In practice,
particularly in high dimensional data, the outlier will most likely not be
outlying along all of its variables, but just along a subset of them. If so,
the scientific question why the case has been flagged as an outlier becomes of
interest. In this article, a fast and efficient method is proposed to detect
variables that contribute most to an outlier's outlyingness. Thereby, it helps
the analyst understand why an outlier lies out. The approach pursued in this
work is to estimate the univariate direction of maximal outlyingness. It is
shown that the problem of estimating that direction can be rewritten as the
normed solution of a classical least squares regression problem. Identifying
the subset of variables contributing most to outlyingness, can thus be achieved
by estimating the associated least squares problem in a sparse manner. From a
practical perspective, sparse partial least squares (SPLS) regression,
preferably by the fast sparse NIPALS (SNIPLS) algorithm, is suggested to tackle
that problem. The proposed methodology is illustrated to perform well both on

The impact of spatial heterogeneity on influenza epidemiology was complex.
First, when the nationwide alert was triggered, 32-41% of the administrative

nationwide alert was timely for the whole surveillance area, but, subsequently,
regions experienced distinct epidemic dynamics. Third, the epidemic dynamics
were homogeneous in space. Spatial heterogeneity analyses can provide the

introduced as causes of additional strong local anomalies, and their evolution
in the framework of the convecting mantle was tracked. The models confirm that
the additional buoyancy provided by the depletion of the mantle by regular
melting can establish a global stable stratification of the convecting mantle
and throttle crust production. Furthermore, the compositional buoyancy is
essential in the stabilization and preservation of local compositional
anomalies directly beneath the lithosphere and offers a possible explanation
for the existence of distinct, long-lived reservoirs in the martian mantle. The
detection of such anomalies by geophysical means is probably difficult,
however; they are expected to be detected by gravimetry rather than by seismic
or heat flow measurements. The results further suggest that the crustal
thickness can be locally overestimated by up to ~20 km if impact-induced
density anomalies in the mantle are neglected.

insights into general nuclear excitations. However, the two-particle two-hole

description of experimental data of various nuclear responses. The spin-flip
charge-exchange reactions $^{48}{\rm Ca}(p,n)^{48}{\rm Sc}$ are investigated to
clarify the role of the 2p2h effect on their cross sections. The Fermi
transition of $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ via the $(p,n)$ reaction is also investigated in
order to demonstrate our framework. The transition density is calculated
microscopically with the second Tamm-Dancoff approximation, and the
distorted-wave Born approximation is employed to describe the reaction process.
A phenomenological one-range Gaussian interaction is used to prepare the form
factor. For the Fermi transition, our approach describes the experimental
behavior of the cross section better than the Lane model, which is the
conventional method. For spin-flip excitations including the GT transition, the
2p2h effect decreases the magnitude of the cross section and does not change
the shape of the angular distribution. The $\Delta l=2$ transition of the
present reaction is found to play a negligible role. The 2p2h effect will not
change the angular-distributed cross section of spin-flip responses. This is
because the transition density of the Gamow-Teller response, the leading
contribution to the cross section, is not significantly varied by the 2p2h
effect.

component and the default training strategy in CNN frameworks, respectively.
However, when optimizing CNNs with SGD, the saturation behavior behind softmax
always gives us an illusion of training well and then is omitted. In this
paper, we first emphasize that the early saturation behavior of softmax will
impede the exploration of SGD, which sometimes is a reason for model converging
at a bad local-minima, then propose Noisy Softmax to mitigating this early
saturation issue by injecting annealed noise in softmax during each iteration.
This operation based on noise injection aims at postponing the early saturation
and further bringing continuous gradients propagation so as to significantly
encourage SGD solver to be more exploratory and help to find a better
local-minima. This paper empirically verifies the superiority of the early
softmax desaturation, and our method indeed improves the generalization ability
of CNN model by regularization. We experimentally find that this early
desaturation helps optimization in many tasks, yielding state-of-the-art or
competitive results on several popular benchmark datasets.

Galactocentric radii in the context of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Due
to its non-linear nature, escape is possible if the MW is considered embedded
in a constant external gravitational field (EF) from distant objects. We model
this situation using a fully self-consistent method based on a direct solution
of the governing equations out to several thousand disk scale lengths. We try
out a range of EF strengths and mass models for the MW in an attempt to match
the escape velocity measurements of Williams et al. (2017).
  A reasonable match is found if the EF on the MW is ${\sim 0.03 a_{_0}}$,
towards the higher end of the range considered. Our models include a hot gas
corona surrounding the MW, but our results suggest that this should have a very
low mass of ${\sim 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot}$ to avoid pushing the escape
velocity too high. Our analysis favours a slightly lower baryonic disk mass
than the ${\sim 7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot}$ required to explain its rotation
curve in MOND. However, given the uncertainties, MOND is consistent with both
the locally measured amplitude of the MW rotation curve and its escape velocity
over Galactocentric distances of 8$-$50 kpc.

shifted to a longer wavelength than that for Earth. We investigated plausible
red-edge position in terms of the light environment during the course of the

exoplanets may use visible light when they first evolve in the ocean and when
they first colonize the land. The adaptive evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis
may eventually also use NIR radiation, by one of two photochemical reaction
centers, with the other center continuing to use visible light. These
""two-color"" reaction centers can absorb more photons, but they will encounter
difficulty in adapting to drastically changing light conditions at the boundary
between land and water. NIR photosynthesis can be more productive on land,

distributions for the acoustic emission energies are reported in distinctly
different plastically deforming situations such as in hcp and, fcc single and
polycrystalline samples exhibiting smooth stress-strain curves, and in dilute
metallic alloys exhibiting discontinuous flow. This is surprising since the
underlying dislocation mechanisms in these two types of deformations are very
different. So far, there has been no models that predict the power law
statistics for the discontinuous flow. Furthermore, the statistics of the
acoustic emission signals in jerky flow is even more complex requiring
multifractal measures for a proper characterization. There has been no model
that explains the complex statistics either. Here, we address the problem of
statistical characterization of the acoustic emission signals associated with
the three types of Portevin-Le Chatelier bands. We set-up a wave equation for
elastic degrees of freedom with plastic strain rate as a source term. Using the
plastic strain rate obtained from the Ananthakrishna model for the Portevin-Le
Chatelier effect, we compute the acoustic emission spectrum corresponding to
the three Portevin-Le Chatelier bands, which is used for further statistical
characterization. Our results show that the model predicts power law statistics
for all the three types of Portevin-Le Chatelier bands with the exponent values
increasing with increasing strain rate. The calculated multifractal spectra
corresponding to the acoustic emission signals associated with these three band
types has a maximum spread for the type C decreasing with type B and A. We
further show that the acoustic emission signals associated with L\""uders like

their performance less sensitive to smoothing (Chernozhukov et al., 2016). This
property has been exploited to achieve valid (uniform) inference of the average
causal effect when data-adaptive estimators of the propensity score and
conditional outcome mean both converge to their respective truths at
sufficiently fast rate (e.g., van der Laan, 2014; Farrell, 2015; Belloni et
al., 2016). In this article, we extend this work in order to retain valid
(uniform) inference when one of these estimators does not converge to the
truth, regardless of which. This is done by generalising prior work for
low-dimensional settings by Vermeulen and Vansteelandt (2015) to incorporate
regularisation. The proposed penalised bias-reduced double-robust estimation
strategy exhibits promising performance in extensive simulation studies and a
data analysis, relative to competing proposals.

low cost array sensing system, utilizing gas sensors, dust particles and
ambient sensors such as temperature and humidity sensor. The odor or
smell-print emanated from various fire sources and building construction
materials at early stage are measured. For this purpose, odor profile data from
five common fire sources and three common building construction materials were
used to develop the classification model. Normalized feature extractions of the
smell print data were performed before subjected to prediction classifier.
These features represent the odor signals in the time domain. The obtained
features undergo the proposed multi-stage feature selection technique and
lastly, further reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimension
reduction technique. The hybrid PCA-PNN based approach has been applied on
different datasets from in-house developed system and the portable electronic
nose unit. Experimental classification results show that the dimension
reduction process performed by PCA has improved the classification accuracy and
provided high reliability, regardless of ambient temperature and humidity
variation, baseline sensor drift, the different gas concentration level and
exposure towards different heating temperature range.

  Coverage-Constrained Wireless Networks","30 pages, 15 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Green
  Communications and Networking",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we investigate the joint optimization of base station (BS)
location, its density, and transmit power allocation to minimize the overall
network operational cost required to meet an underlying coverage constraint at
each user equipment (UE), which is randomly deployed following the binomial
point process (BPP). As this joint optimization problem is nonconvex and
combinatorial in nature, we propose a non-trivial solution methodology that
effectively decouples it into three individual optimization problems. Firstly,
by using the distance distribution of the farthest UE from the BS, we present
novel insights on optimal BS location in an optimal sectoring type for a given
number of BSs. After that we provide a tight approximation for the optimal
transmit power allocation to each BS. Lastly, using the latter two results, the
optimal number of BSs that minimize the operational cost is obtained. Also, we
have investigated both circular and square field deployments. Numerical results
validate the analysis and provide practical insights on optimal BS deployment.
We observe that the proposed joint optimization framework, that solves the
coverage probability versus operational cost tradeoff, can yield a significant
reduction of about $65\%$ in the operational cost as compared to the benchmark
fixed allocation scheme.
