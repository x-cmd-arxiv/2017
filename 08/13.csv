problem, two emerging trends in technology have broadened the subject for new
investigations. The first trend is the development of self-driving vehicles.
This highly-anticipated shift from human- to autonomous-drivers is expected to
offer substantial benefits for traffic throughput by streamlining large-scale
collective behavior. The second trend is the widespread hacking of
Internet-connected devices, which as of 2015, includes vehicles. While the
first proof-of-concept automobile hack was done at the single-vehicle scale,
undesirable collective effects can easily arise if this activity becomes more
common. Motivated by these two trends, we explore the phenomena that arise in
an active matter model with lanes and lane-changing behavior. Our model
incorporates a simplified minimal description of essential differences between
human- and autonomous-drivers. We study the emergent collective behavior as the
population of vehicles shifts from all-human to all-autonomous. Within the
context of our model, we explore a worst-case scenario where Internet-connected
autonomous vehicles are disabled simultaneously and \textit{en masse}. Our
approach reveals a model-independent role for percolation in interpreting the
results. A broad lesson our work highlights is that seemingly minor malicious
activity can ultimately have major impacts when magnified through the action of
collective behavior.

the evacuation problem of two robots which are initially located at the center
of a unit disk. Both the robots have to evacuate the disk through the exits
situated on the perimeter of the disk at an unknown location. The distance
between two exits along the perimeter $d$ is given. We consider two different
communication models. First, in the wireless model, the robots can send a
message to each other over a long distance. Second, in face-to-face
communication model, the robots can exchange information with each other only
when they touch each other. The objective of the evacuation problem is to
design an algorithm which minimizes the evacuation time of both the robots. For
the wireless communication model, we propose a generic algorithm for two robots
moving to two points on the perimeter with an initial separation of $\zeta \leq
d$. We also investigate evacuation problem for both unlabeled and labeled exits
in the wireless communication model. For the face-to-face communication model,
we propose two different algorithms for $\zeta =0$ and $\zeta =d$ for unlabeled
exits. We also propose a generic algorithm for $\zeta \leq d$ for labeled
exits. We provide lower bounds corresponding to different $d$ values in the
face-to-face communication model. We evaluate the performance our algorithms
with simulation for both of the communication models.

excitations, with a spectrum linear in momentum, can play a major role in the
emission and propagation of neutrinos. In this paper, we focus on the
elementary modes in the region of proton superfluidity, where the neutron
component is expected to have a very small or zero pairing gap.
  We study the overall spectral functions of protons, neutrons and electrons on
the basis of the Coulomb and nuclear interactions. This study is performed in
the framework of the Random Phase Approximation, generalized in order to
describe the response of a superfluid system. The formalism we use ensures that
the Generalized Ward's Identities are satisfied. Despite their relative small
fraction, the protons turn out to modify the neutron spectral function as a
consequence of the nuclear neutron-proton interaction. This effect is
particularly evident at the lower density, just below the crust for a density
close to the saturation value, while at increasing density the neutrons and the
protons are mainly decoupled. The proton spectral function is characterized by
a pseudo-Goldstone mode below $ 2\Delta $, twice the pairing gap, and a
pair-breaking mode above $ 2\Delta $. The latter merges in the sound mode of
the normal phase at higher momenta. The neutron spectral function develops a
collective sound mode only at the higher density. The electrons have a strong
screening effect on the proton-proton interaction at the lower momenta, and
decouple from the protons at higher momenta.

  Temporal Visual Cues","12 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, autonomous driving algorithms using low-cost vehicle-mounted
cameras have attracted increasing endeavors from both academia and industry.
There are multiple fronts to these endeavors, including object detection on
roads, 3-D reconstruction etc., but in this work we focus on a vision-based
model that directly maps raw input images to steering angles using deep
networks. This represents a nascent research topic in computer vision. The
technical contributions of this work are three-fold. First, the model is
learned and evaluated on real human driving videos that are time-synchronized
with other vehicle sensors. This differs from many prior models trained from
synthetic data in racing games. Second, state-of-the-art models, such as
PilotNet, mostly predict the wheel angles independently on each video frame,
which contradicts common understanding of driving as a stateful process.
Instead, our proposed model strikes a combination of spatial and temporal cues,
jointly investigating instantaneous monocular camera observations and vehicle's
historical states. This is in practice accomplished by inserting
carefully-designed recurrent units (e.g., LSTM and Conv-LSTM) at proper network
layers. Third, to facilitate the interpretability of the learned model, we
utilize a visual back-propagation scheme for discovering and visualizing image
regions crucially influencing the final steering prediction. Our experimental
study is based on about 6 hours of human driving data provided by Udacity.
Comprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our model, even under scenarios like drastic lighting changes and
abrupt turning. The comparison with other state-of-the-art models clearly
reveals its superior performance in predicting the due wheel angle for a
self-driving car.

applications, we address the following problems:
  1. Computability of Approximately Optimal Noise Stable function over Gaussian
space: The goal is to find a partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $k$ parts, that
maximizes the noise stability. An $\delta$-optimal partition is one which is
within additive $\delta$ of the optimal noise stability.

  2. Decidability of Non-Interactive Simulation of Joint Distributions: A
""non-interactive simulation"" problem is specified by two distributions $P(x,y)$
and $Q(u,v)$: The goal is to determine if two players that observe sequences

from $P(x,y)$ can generate pairs $U$ and $V$ respectively (without
communicating with each other) with a joint distribution that is arbitrarily
close in total variation to $Q(u,v)$. Even when $P$ and $Q$ are extremely
simple, it is open in several cases if $P$ can simulate $Q$.
  In the special where $Q$ is a joint distribution over $\{0,1\} \times
\{0,1\}$, Ghazi, Kamath and Sudan (FOCS 2016) proved a computable bound on the
number of samples $n_0(\delta)$ that can be drawn from $P(x,y)$ to get
$\delta$-close to $Q$ (if it is possible at all). Recently De, Mossel & Neeman
obtained such bounds when $Q$ is a distribution over $[k] \times [k]$ for any
$k \ge 2$. We recover this result with improved explicit bounds on
$n_0(\delta)$.

historically been an issue. In recent works [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 180401 and

formulation of quantum mechanics -- extending work by Wigner, Weyl, Moyal, and
others to any quantum system. This work is structured in three parts. Firstly
we provide a brief modernized discussion of the general framework of
phase-space quantum mechanics. We extend previous work and show how this leads
to a framework that can describe any system in phase space -- putting it for
the first time on a truly equal footing to Schr\""odinger's and Heisenberg's
formulation of quantum mechanics. Importantly, we do this in a way that
respects the unifying principles of ""parity"" and ""displacement"" in a natural
broadening of previously developed phase space concepts and methods. Secondly
we consider how this framework is realized for different quantum systems; in
particular we consider the proper construction of Weyl functions for some
example finite dimensional systems. Finally we relate the Wigner and Weyl
distributions to statistical properties of any quantum system or set of
systems.

propagating with fixed normal velocity. We construct front solutions that leave
behind stripes in the pattern-forming region that are parallel to or at a small
oblique angle to the boundary.
  Technically, the construction of stripe formation parallel to the boundary
relies on ill-posed, infinite-dimensional spatial dynamics. Stripes forming at
a small oblique angle are constructed using a functional-analytic, perturbative
approach. Here, the main difficulties are the presence of continuous spectrum
and the fact that small oblique angles appear as a singular perturbation in a
traveling-wave problem. We resolve the former difficulty using a farfield-core

problem is resolved using preconditioners and boot-strapping.

covariate information. Using algebraic relationships between regression

the optimal weighting of the equations taking into account uncertainty

The reconstruction quality strongly depends on the photodetectors quantum
efficiency and other losses in the measurement setup. In this article we
analyse in detail a protocol of enhanced quantum tomography, proposed by
Leonhardt and Paul in 1994, which allows one to reduce the degrading effect of
detection losses. It is based on phase sensitive parametric amplification, with
the phase of the amplified quadrature being scanned synchronously with the
local oscil- lator phase. Although with sufficiently strong amplification the
protocol enables overcoming any detection inefficiency, it was so far not
implemented in experiment, probably due to the losses in the amplifier. Here we
discuss a possible proof-of-principle experiment with a traveling-wave
parametric amplifier. We show that with the state-of-the art optical elements,
the protocol enables high-fidelity tomographic reconstruction of bright
nonclassical states of light. We consider two examples: bright squeezed vacuum

changes in the distribution of types as mutations march toward fixation or
extinction. We describe motion as the swapping of individuals on graphs, and
more generally as the shuffling of individuals between reproductive updates.
Beginning with a one-dimensional graph, the cycle, we prove that motion
suppresses natural selection for death-birth updating or for any process that
combines birth-death and death-birth updating. If the rule is purely
birth-death updating, no change in fixation probability appears in the presence
of motion. We further investigate how motion affects evolution on the square
lattice and weighted graphs. In the case of weighted graphs we find that motion
can be either an amplifier or a suppressor of natural selection. In some cases,
whether it is one or the other can be a function of the relative reproductive
rate, indicating that motion is a subtle and complex attribute of evolving
populations. As a first step towards understanding less restricted types of
motion in evolutionary graph theory, we consider a similar rule on dynamic
graphs induced by a spatial flow and find qualitatively similar results
indicating that continuous motion also suppresses natural selection.

angiogenesis has revealed to be an highly complex, and extremely interesting
biomedical problem, due to the strong coupling between the kinetic parameters

capillary network, at the microscale, and the family of interacting underlying
biochemical fields, at the macroscale. In this paper an original revisited

advantage of the intrinsic multiscale structure of the system; one may keep the
stochasticity of the dynamics of the vessel tips at their natural microscale,

field approximation obtained by an averaging at a suitable mesoscale. While in

symptomatic infective are close. These theoretical results provide an intuitive
basis for understanding that the asymptomatic infective individuals and the
disease seasonal transmission promote the evolution of epidemic, which allow us
to predict the outcomes of control strategies during the course of the

Power-Imbalance Allocation Control (MLPIAC) is presented for a large-scale
power system partitioned into two or more areas. Centralized control is
implemented in each area while distributed control is implemented at the
coordination level of the areas. Besides restoring nominal frequency with a
minimal control cost, MLPIAC can improve the transient performance of the
system through an accelerated convergence of the control inputs without
oscillations. At the coordination level of the control areas, because the
number of the areas is smaller than that of nodes, MLPIAC is more effective to
obtain the minimized control cost than the purely distributed control law. At
the level of the control in each area, because the number of nodes is much
smaller than the total number of nodes in the whole network, the overheads in
the communications and the computations are reduced compared to the pure
centralized control. The asymptotic stability of MLPIAC is proven using the
Lyapunov method and the performance is evaluated through simulations.

described in terms of increased in-plane chemical pressure effect. A magnetic
anomaly below 8 K, probably because of ferromagnetic order of magnetic moment

some variables not provided by others as well as redundant and synergistic
components. However, the definition of multivariate measures of redundancy that
comply with nonnegativity and conform to certain axioms that capture
conceptually desirable properties of redundancy has proven to be elusive. We
here present a procedure to determine nonnegative multivariate redundancy

existing bivariate maximum entropy measures of redundancy and unique
information, defining measures of the redundant information that a group of
variables has about a target, and of the unique redundant information that a
group of variables has about a target that is not redundant with information
from another group. The two key ingredients for this approach are: First, the
identification of a type of constraints on entropy maximization that allows
isolating components of redundancy and unique redundancy by mirroring them to
synergy components. Second, the construction of rooted tree-based
decompositions of the mutual information, which conform to the axioms of the
redundancy lattice by the local implementation at each tree node of binary
unfoldings of the information using hierarchically related maximum entropy
constraints. Altogether, the proposed measures quantify the different
multivariate redundancy contributions of a nonnegative mutual information

low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), forms the minimum sensor suite for
metric six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) state estimation. However, the lack of
direct distance measurement poses significant challenges in terms of IMU
processing, estimator initialization, extrinsic calibration, and nonlinear
optimization. In this work, we present VINS-Mono: a robust and versatile
monocular visual-inertial state estimator.Our approach starts with a robust
procedure for estimator initialization and failure recovery. A tightly-coupled,
nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain high accuracy
visual-inertial odometry by fusing pre-integrated IMU measurements and feature
observations. A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly-coupled
formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation overhead.We
additionally perform four degrees-of-freedom pose graph optimization to enforce
global consistency. We validate the performance of our system on public
datasets and real-world experiments and compare against other state-of-the-art
algorithms. We also perform onboard closed-loop autonomous flight on the MAV
platform and port the algorithm to an iOS-based demonstration. We highlight
that the proposed work is a reliable, complete, and versatile system that is
applicable for different applications that require high accuracy localization.
We open source our implementations for both PCs and iOS mobile devices.

problem asks for a total coloring of $V$ extending $c$ to all vertices of $V$
that maximises the number of happy vertices (edges). Both problems are known to
be NP-hard in general even when $\ell = 3$, and is polynomially solvable when
$\ell = 2$. In [IWOCA 2016] it was shown that both problems are polynomially
solvable on trees, and for arbitrary $k$, it was shown that MHE is \NPH{} on
planar graphs and is \FPT{} parameterized by the number of precolored vertices
and branchwidth.
  We continue the study of this problem from a parameterized prespective. Our
focus is on both structural and standard parameterizations. To begin with, we
establish that the problems are \FPT{} when parameterized by the treewidth and
the number of colors used in the precoloring, which is a potential improvement
over the total number of precolored vertices. Further, we show that both the
vertex and edge variants of the problem is \FPT{} when parameterized by vertex
cover and distance-to-clique parameters. We also show that the problem of
maximizing the number of happy edges is \FPT{} when parameterized by the
standard parameter, the number of happy edges. We show that the maximum happy
vertex (edge) problem is \NPH{} on split graphs and bipartite graphs and
polynomially solvable on cographs.

lower metallicity, likely the population from which the SN progenitor

synthesized by depositing silicon on top of silver, where, however, the
different phases observed to date are so strongly hybridized with the substrate

electron energy loss spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory
to characterize the low-energy plasmon of a multiphase-silicene/Ag(111) sample,

this mode survives the interaction with the substrate, being perfectly matched

unique platform with the potential to develop different applications based on

Statistical applications have dominated the SOC stock mapping at regional scale
so far. However, the community has hardly ever attempted to implement Quantile
Regression (QR) to spatially predict the SOC distribution. In this
contribution, we test QR to estimate SOC stock (0-30 $cm$ depth) in the
agricultural areas of a highly variable semi-arid region (Sicily, Italy, around
25,000 $km2$) by using topographic and remotely sensed predictors. We also
compare the results with those from available SOC stock measurement. The QR
models produced robust performances and allowed to recognize dominant effects
among the predictors with respect to the considered quantile. This information,
currently lacking, suggests that QR can discern predictor influences on SOC
stock at specific sub-domains of each predictors. In this work, the predictive
map generated at the median shows lower errors than those of the Joint Research
Centre and International Soil Reference, and Information Centre benchmarks. The
results suggest the use of QR as a comprehensive and effective method to map

for calculating the acoustic emission spectrum accompanying any plastic

source term and include the Rayleigh-dissipation function to represent
dissipation accompanying acoustic emission. We devise a method of bridging the
widely separated time scales of plastic deformation and elastic degrees of
freedom. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated by considering three
distinct cases of plastic deformation. The first one is the acoustic emission
during a typical continuous yield exhibiting a smooth stress-strain curve. We
first construct an appropriate set of evolution equations for two types of
dislocation densities and then show that the shape of the model stress-strain
curve and accompanying acoustic emission spectrum match very well with
experimental results. The second and the third are the more complex cases of
the Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and the L\""uders band. These two cases are
dealt with in the context of the Ananthakrishna model since the model predicts
the three types of the Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and also L\""uders-like
bands. Our results show that for the type-C bands where the serration amplitude
is large, the acoustic emission spectrum consists of well-separated bursts of
acoustic emission. At higher strain rates of hopping type-B bands, the
burst-type acoustic emission spectrum tends to overlap, forming a nearly
continuous background with some sharp acoustic emission bursts. The latter can
be identified with the nucleation of new bands. The acoustic emission spectrum
associated with the continuously propagating type-A band is continuous. These
predictions are consistent with experimental results. The acoustic emission
spectrum of the L\""uders-like band matches with recent experiments as well.

unrealistic normality and soft-max assumptions. In this paper, we make the

a random utility function. As a consequence, we are able to easily calculate
the robot's best action for arbitrary belief and irrationality assumptions.

possible use in cosmology, some important correlations between the parameters
that describe their emission have been discovered, among which the ""Ep,i-Eiso""
correlation is the most studied. Because of this, it is fundamental to shed
light on the peculiar behaviour of a few events, namely GRB 980425 and GRB
031203, that appear to be important outliers of the Ep,i-Eiso correlation.
Aims. In this paper we investigate if the locations of GRB 980425 and GRB
031203, the two (apparent) outliers of the correlation, may be due to an
observational bias caused by the lacking detection of the soft X-ray emissions
associated with these GRBs, from respectively the BATSE detector on-board the
Compton Gamma-Ray Observer and INTEGRAL, that were operating at the epoch of
the observations. We analyse the observed emission of other similar
sub-energetic bursts (GRBs 060218, 100316D and 161219B) observed by Swift and
whose integrated emissions match the Ep,i-Eiso relation. We simulate their
integrated and time-resolved emissions as would have been observed by the same
detectors that observed GRB 980425 and GRB 031203, aimed at reconstructing the
light curve and spectra of these bursts. Results. If observed by old generation
instruments, GRB 060218, 100316D and 161219B would appear as outliers of the
Ep,i-Eiso relation, while if observed with Swift or WFM GRB 060218 would
perfectly match the correlation. We also note that the instrument BAT alone
(15-150 keV) actually measured 060218 as an outlier. Conclusions. We suggest
that if GRB 980425 and GRB 031203 would have been observed by Swift and by eXTP
they may have matched the Ep,i-Eiso relation. This provides strong support to
the idea that instrumental biases can make some events in the lower-left corner
of the Ep,i-Eiso plane appearing as outliers of the ""Amati relation"".

visual tracking, due to its robust feature representation of images. Recent
methods perform online tracking by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model to the
specific target object using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
back-propagation, which is usually time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a
recurrent filter generation methods for visual tracking. We directly feed the
target's image patch to a recurrent neural network (RNN) to estimate an
object-specific filter for tracking. As the video sequence is a spatiotemporal
data, we extend the matrix multiplications of the fully-connected layers of the
RNN to a convolution operation on feature maps, which preserves the target's
spatial structure and also is memory-efficient. The tracked object in the
subsequent frames will be fed into the RNN to adapt the generated filters to
appearance variations of the target. Note that once the off-line training
process of our network is finished, there is no need to fine-tune the network
for specific objects, which makes our approach more efficient than methods that
use iterative fine-tuning to online learn the target. Extensive experiments
conducted on widely used benchmarks, OTB and VOT, demonstrate encouraging
results compared to other recent methods.

  The method utilizes the Finite Isotropic Wavelet Transform with Meyer
function as the mother wavelet. Further, compressed sensing is realized by
optimizing a sparsity-promoting regularized objective function by means of the
Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm. Eventually, the regularization
parameter is selected by means of the Miller criterion.
  The method is applied against both synthetic data mimicking the

edge correlation functions of Majorana fermions analytically. Our results
indicate that the two edge correlation functions can be used to characterize
the trivial, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like topological and topological
superconductor phases. Furthermore, we find the existence of two different
coupling patterns of Majorana fermions in topological superconductor phase
characterized by different edge correlation functions, which can also be
distinguished by investigating the survival probability of an edge Majorana
under sudden quenching of parameters.

the process of keeping a record of the gender balance at the annual Australian

routes by which issues of equity can be addressed, and the situation improved.
We present an update based on the 16th Australian Space Research Conference,
held at RMIT, Melbourne, in September 2016. As in 2015, male attendees
outnumbered female attendees approximately 3:1. However, there was a small
shift (~2.3%) in the balance, with female delegates now making up 26.4% of the
total, up from 24.1% in 2015. This shift was mirrored in the gender
distribution of talks, with 28.9% of all oral presentations being given by
women (up from 25.2%). More striking, however, were the changes in the
distribution of plenary presentations (44.4% female, up from 22.2%), poster
presentations (31.8% female, up from 7.7%), and student awards (33.3% female,
up from 12.5%). These changes are encouraging, and will hopefully continue in
years to come. The conference organising committee again mirrored the gender
balance of the delegates as a whole (27.3 % female vs. 26.4% of delegates),
though the program committee was markedly more male-dominated this year than
last (82.4% male, against last year's 72.2%). At this year's 'Women in Space

make future conferences, and the wider community, a more equitable place... ---

  Review",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has
not yet been efficiently solved. However, its solution is crucial for many
experienced players who wish to compete against AI bots, but also prefer to
make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also
important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for
online broadcasting or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with
friends. Typically, such digitization tasks are performed by humans or with the
aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither solution is easy or
convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing
chessboard configurations.
  We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the angle
at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard
styles. The proposed algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each
iteration, it executes three major sub-processes: detecting straight lines,
finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we identify
all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard
notation. For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses
existing solutions. We support our algorithms by utilizing machine learning
techniques whenever possible.
  The described method performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy
over $99.5\%$ for detecting chessboard lattice points (compared to the $74\%$
for the best alternative), $95\%$ (compared to $60\%$ for the best alternative)
for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost $95\%$ for chess piece
recognition.

novel views of familiar objects and also to novel objects. We compare this
supervised scheme against guided policy search, and find that the LSTM network
reaches higher recognition accuracy compared to the guided policy method. We
further look into optimizing the observation function to increase the total
collected reward of optimal policy. In AOR, the observation function is known
only approximately. We propose a gradient-based method update to this

show that by optimizing the observation function and retraining the supervised

planar energy barrier in nanostructured thermoelectric generators, we reinforce
the non-trivial result that the anticipated enhancement in generated power at a
given efficiency via energy filtering is a characteristic of systems dominated
by incoherent scattering and is absent in ballistic devices. In such cases,
assuming an energy dependent relaxation time $\tau(E)=kE^r$, we show that there
exists a minimum value $r_{min}$ beyond which generation can be enhanced by
embedding nanobarriers. For bulk generators with embedded nanobarriers, we
delve into the details of inter sub-band scattering and show that it has finite
contribution to the enhancement in generation. We subsequently discuss the
realistic aspects, such as the effect of smooth transmission cut-off and show
that for $r>r_{min}$, the optimized energy barrier is just sufficiently wide
enough to scatter off low energy electrons, a very wide barrier being
detrimental to the performance. Analysis of the obtained results should provide
general design guidelines for enhancement in thermoelectric generation via
energy filtering. Our non-equilibrium approach is typically valid in the
absence of local quasi-equilibrium and hence sets the stage for future
advancements in thermoelectric device analysis, for example, Peltier cooling

consists of taking tools that have been shown to be effective for adaptive
boundary element methods and, where necessary, modifying them so that they can
be applied to the fractional PDE case. Improved a priori error estimates are
derived for the case of quasi-uniform meshes which are seen to deliver
sub-optimal rates of convergence owing to the presence of singularities.
Attention is then turned to the development of an a posteriori error estimate
and error indicators which are suitable for driving an adaptive refinement
procedure. We assume that the resulting refined meshes are locally

exploration of new materials with topological states is im- portant in both
physics and materials science. In this article, we report the synthesis and the
transport properties of high quality single crystals of YbMnSb$_2$. YbMnSb$_2$
is a new compound with metallic behavior. Quantum oscillations, including
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) type
oscillation, have been observed at low temperature and high magnetic field.
Small effective masses and nontrivial Berry phase are extracted from the
analyses of quantum oscillations, which provide the transport evidence for the
possible existence of Dirac fermions in YbMnSb$_2$. The measurements of
angular-dependent interlayer magnetoresistance (MR) indicate the interlayer
transport is coherent. The Fermi surface (FS) of YbMnSb$_2$ possesses quasi-two
dimensional (2D) characteristic as determined by the angular dependence of SdH
oscillation frequency. These findings suggest that YbMnSb$_2$ is a new

processing is how to compare between data points. The choice of the distance
metric is specifically challenging for high-dimensional data sets, where the
problem of meaningfulness is more prominent (e.g. the Euclidean distance
between images). In this paper, we propose to exploit a property of
high-dimensional data that is usually ignored - which is the structure stemming
from the relationships between the coordinates. Specifically we show that
organizing similar coordinates in clusters can be exploited for the
construction of the Mahalanobis distance between samples. When the observable
samples are generated by a nonlinear transformation of hidden variables, the
Mahalanobis distance allows the recovery of the Euclidean distances in the
hidden space.We illustrate the advantage of our approach on a synthetic example
where the discovery of clusters of correlated coordinates improves the
estimation of the principal directions of the samples. Our method was applied
to real data of gene expression for lung adenocarcinomas (lung cancer). By
using the proposed metric we found a partition of subjects to risk groups with

as well as of research into intergroup relations. Formal modelers of opinion
dynamics try to explain how intergroup polarization can arise from simple first
principles of interactions within and between groups. Models have been proposed
in which intergroup attitudes affect social influence in the form of homophily
or xenophobia, elaborated as fixed tendencies of individuals to interact more
with in-group members, be more open to influence from in-group members and
perhaps even distance oneself from attitudes of outgroup members. While these
models can generate polarization between groups, their underlying assumptions
curiously neglect a central insight from research on intergroup attitudes.
Intergroup attitudes are themselves subject to social influence in interactions
with both in- and outgroup members. I extend an existing model of opinion
formation with intergroup attitudes, by adding this feedback-effect. I show how
this changes model predictions about the process and the conditions of
polarization between groups. In particular, it is demonstrated how the model
implies that intergroup polarization can become less likely if intergroup
attitudes change under social influence; and how more complex patterns of
intergroup relations emerge. Especially, a renegade minority (outgroup-lovers)
can have a key role in avoiding mutually negative intergroup relations and even
elicit attitude reversal, resulting in a majority of individuals developing a
negative attitude towards their in-group and a positive one of the outgroup.
Interpretations of these theoretical results and directions for future research
are further discussed.

general, visual knowledge can usually be modeled as attributed relational

attributes describing the spatial relationship between parts. Thus, from a
practical perspective, such mining of maximal-size subgraphs can be regarded as
a general platform for discovering and modeling the common objects within
cluttered and unlabeled visual data. Then, from a theoretical perspective,
visual graph mining should encode and overcome the great fuzziness of messy
data collected from complex real-world situations, which conflicts with the
conventional theoretical basis of graph mining designed for tabular data.
Common subgraphs hidden in these ARGs usually have soft attributes, with
considerable inter-graph variation. More importantly, we should also discover
the latent pattern space, including similarity metrics for the pattern and
hidden node relations, during the mining process. In this study, we redefine
the visual subgraph pattern that encodes all of these challenges in a general
way, and propose an approximate but efficient solution to graph mining. We
conduct five experiments to evaluate our method with different kinds of visual

incorporating the viscoelastic effects applicable to unstable intermittent peel
dynamics is the introduction of a dynamization scheme that eliminates the
explicit time dependence in terms of dynamical variables. We find contrasting
influences of viscoelastic contribution in different regions of tape mass,
roller inertia, and pull velocity. As the model acoustic energy dissipated
depends on the nature of the peel front and its dynamical evolution, the
combined effect of the roller inertia and pull velocity makes the acoustic
energy noisier for small tape mass and low-pull velocity while it is burstlike
for low-tape mass, intermediate values of the roller inertia and high-pull
velocity. The changes are quantified by calculating the largest Lyapunov
exponent and analyzing the statistical distributions of the amplitudes and
durations of the model acoustic energy signals. Both single and two stage
power-law distributions are observed. Scaling relations between the exponents
are derived which show that the exponents corresponding to large values of
event sizes and durations are completely determined by those for small values.
The scaling relations are found to be satisfied in all cases studied.
Interestingly, we find only five types of model acoustic emission signals among
multitude of possibilities of the peel front configurations.

what the role of the criticality of GRNs is in forming morphologies. We found
that nontrivial spatial patterns were generated most frequently when GRNs were
at criticality. Our finding indicates that the criticality of GRNs facilitates
the formation of nontrivial morphologies in GRN-based morphogenetic systems.

  dense industrial wireless networks",,,,,"cs.NE cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The industrial wireless local area network (IWLAN) is increasingly dense, not
only due to the penetration of wireless applications into factories and
warehouses, but also because of the rising need of redundancy for robust
wireless coverage. Instead of powering on all the nodes with the maximal
transmit power, it becomes an unavoidable challenge to control the transmit
power of all wireless nodes on a large scale, in order to reduce interference
and adapt coverage to the latest shadowing effects in the environment.
Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) to solve
this transmit power control (TPC) problem for dense IWLANs, named GATPC.
Effective population initialization, crossover and mutation, parallel computing
as well as dedicated speedup measures are introduced to tailor GATPC for the
large-scale optimization that is intrinsically involved in this problem. In
contrast to most coverage-related optimization algorithms which cannot deal
with the prevalent shadowing effects in harsh industrial indoor environments,
an empirical one-slope path loss model considering three-dimensional obstacle
shadowing effects is used in GATPC, in order to enable accurate yet simple
coverage prediction. Experimental validation and numerical experiments in real
industrial cases show the promising performance of GATPC in terms of
scalability to a hyper-large scale, up to 37-times speedup in resolution
runtime, and solution quality to achieve adaptive coverage and to minimize
interference.

  industrial wireless networks",,"Expert Systems with Applications 2017","10.1016/j.eswa.2017.12.011",,"cs.NE cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An industrial indoor environment is harsh for wireless communications
compared to an office environment, because the prevalent metal easily causes
shadowing effects and affects the availability of an industrial wireless local
area network (IWLAN). On the one hand, it is costly, time-consuming, and
ineffective to perform trial-and-error manual deployment of wireless nodes. On
the other hand, the existing wireless planning tools only focus on office
environments such that it is hard to plan IWLANs due to the larger problem size
and the deployed IWLANs are vulnerable to prevalent shadowing effects in harsh
industrial indoor environments. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an
overdimensioning model and a genetic algorithm based over-dimensioning (GAOD)
algorithm for deploying large-scale robust IWLANs. As a progress beyond the
state-of-the-art wireless planning, two full coverage layers are created. The
second coverage layer serves as redundancy in case of shadowing. Meanwhile, the
deployment cost is reduced by minimizing the number of access points (APs); the
hard constraint of minimal inter-AP spatial paration avoids multiple APs
covering the same area to be simultaneously shadowed by the same obstacle. The
computation time and occupied memory are dedicatedly considered in the design
of GAOD for large-scale optimization. A greedy heuristic based
over-dimensioning (GHOD) algorithm and a random OD algorithm are taken as
benchmarks. In two vehicle manufacturers with a small and large indoor
environment, GAOD outperformed GHOD with up to 20% less APs, while GHOD
outputted up to 25% less APs than a random OD algorithm. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of this model and GAOD was experimentally validated with a real
deployment system.

Ultimately, it is the programmer's ability to code and, in the case of general

sequence of native instructions that make the circuit deliver the expected
performance to the end user. This way, the benefits of energy-efficient
circuits build upon energy-efficient devices could be obfuscated by poorly

circuits is no better in terms of energy efficiency than having poorly written
software running on energy-efficient circuits. Therefore, to get the most out
of the energy-saving capabilities of programmable circuits that support low
voltage operating modes, it is necessary to address software issues that might
work against the benefits of operating in such modes.

waveguide directional coupler is proposed. The sensor is designed using two
coupled asymmetric strip waveguides with a top-loaded grating structure in one
of the waveguides. Maximum light couples from one waveguide to the other at the
resonance wavelength, and the change in resonance wavelength with the change in
refractive index of the medium in the cover region is a measure of the
sensitivity. The proposed sensor would be an on-chip device with a high
refractive index sensitivity of ~ 104 nm/RIU, and negligible temperature
sensitivity (< 1nm/0C). The sensor configuration offers a low propagation loss,
thereby enhancing the sensitivity. Variation of the sensitivity with the
waveguide parameters of the proposed sensor have been studied to optimize the
design.

dressings via direct impregnation onto a suitable substrate. MH provides unique
antibacterial activity when compared with conventional honeys, owing partly to
one of its constituents, methylglyoxal (MGO). Aiming to investigate an
antibiotic-free antimicrobial strategy, we studied the antibacterial activity
of both MH and MGO (at equivalent MGO concentrations) when applied as a
physical coating to a nonwoven fabric wound dressing. When physically coated on
to a cellulosic hydroentangled nonwoven fabric, it was found that
concentrations of 0.0054 mg cm-2 of MGO in the form of MH and MGO was
sufficient to achieve 100 CFU% bacteria reduction against gram-positive
Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on BS EN
ISO 20743:2007. A 3- to 20- fold increase in MGO concentration (0.0170 - 0.1 mg
cm-2) was required to facilitate a good antibacterial effect (based on BS EN
ISO 20645:2004) in terms of zone of inhibition and lack of growth under the
sample. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal
concentration (MBC) was also assessed for MGO in liquid form against three
prevalent wound and healthcare-associated pathogens, i.e. Staphylococcus
aureus, gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive Enterococcus
faecalis. Other than the case of MGO-containing fabrics, solutions with much
higher MGO concentrations (128 mg L-1 - 1024 mg L-1) were required to provide
either a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. The results presented in this
study therefore demonstrate the relevance of MGO-based coating as an
environment-friendly strategy for the design of functional dressings with
antibiotic-free antimicrobial chemistries.
