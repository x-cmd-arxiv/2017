signatures of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ enlarged Standard Model (SM) encompassing three

(non-SM-like) Higgs boson and $Z'$ production followed by $\nu_h \rightarrow
l^\pm W^{\mp (*)}$ and $\nu_h \rightarrow \nu_l Z^{(*)}$ decays, ultimately
yielding a $3l+2j+E_{T}^{\rm{miss}}$ signature and, depending upon how boosted
the final state objects are, we define different possible selections aimed at
improving the signal to background ratio in LHC Run 2 data for a wide range of
heavy neutrino masses.

plasma with a decreasing background magnetic field, $B$, to study the effect of
velocity-space instabilities on the viscous heating and thermal conduction of
the plasma. If $B$ decreases, the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment
gives rise to pressure anisotropies with $p_{||,j} > p_{\perp,j}$ ($p_{||,j}$
and $p_{\perp,j}$ represent the pressure of species $j$ ($=i$ or $e$) parallel
and perpendicular to the magnetic field). Linear theory indicates that, for
sufficiently large anisotropies, different velocity-space instabilities can be
triggered. These instabilities, which grow on scales comparable to the electron
and ion Larmor radii, in principle have the ability to pitch-angle scatter the
particles, limiting the growth of the anisotropies. Our PIC simulations focus
on the nonlinear, saturated regime of the instabilities. This is done through
the permanent decrease of the magnetic field by an imposed shear in the plasma.
Our results show that, in the regime $2 \lesssim \beta_j \lesssim 20$ ($\beta_j
\equiv 8\pi p_j/B^2$), the saturated ion and electron pressure anisotropies are
controlled by the combined effect of the oblique ion firehose (OIF) and the
fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) instabilities. These instabilities grow
preferentially on the ion Larmor radius scale, and make the ion and electron
pressure anisotropies nearly equal: $\Delta p_e/p_{||,e} \approx \Delta
p_i/p_{||,i}$ (where $\Delta p_j=p_{\perp,j} - p_{||,j}$). We also quantify the
thermal conduction of the plasma by directly calculating the mean free path of
electrons along the mean magnetic field, which we find strongly depends on
whether $B$ decreases or increases. Our results can be applied in studies of
low collisionality plasmas such as the solar wind, the intracluster medium, and
some accretion disks around black holes.

(CPIMC) formalism that was previously applied to the spatially uniform electron
gas to the case of an inhomogeneous electron gas by adding a spatially periodic
external potential. This procedure has recently been successfully used in
permutation blocking path integral Monte Carlo simulations (PB-PIMC) of the

moderate densities} closing the gap left open by the PB-PIMC data. In this
paper we demonstrate how the CPIMC formalism can be efficiently extended to the
spatially inhomogeneous electron gas and present the first data points.

results for the SDRF in detail and present a solution how to remove them that

$T_N \sim (1-x/x_c)^{2/3}$ with $x_c$ very close to the calculated spin
percolation threshold which we determine by Monte Carlo simulations, indicating
that the zero-temperature phase transition is geometrically driven. We find
that this produces a form of compositionally-tuned, insulating, ferrimagnetic
quantum criticality. Close to the zero temperature phase transition we observe
the emergence of an electric-dipole glass induced by magneto-electric coupling.
The strong frequency behaviour of the glass freezing temperature $T_m$ has a
Vogel-Fulcher dependence with $T_m$ finite, or suppressed below zero in the
zero frequency limit, depending on composition $x$. These quantum-mechanical
properties, along with the multiplicity of low-lying modes near to the
zero-temperature phase transition, are likely to greatly extend applications of
hexaferrites into the realm of quantum and cryogenic technologies.

quadratic cost function provides asymptotically efficient estimates under
Gaussian noise and additional mild assumptions, but in general it requires

a non-parametric model as intermediate step to obtain the model of interest.
Weighted null-space fitting (WNSF) belongs to this class. It is a weighted
least-squares method consisting of three steps. In the first step, a high-order
ARX model is estimated. In a second least-squares step, this high-order
estimate is reduced to a parametric estimate. In the third step, weighted least
squares is used to reduce the variance of the estimates. The method is flexible
in parametrization and suitable for both open- and closed-loop data. In this

with closed-loop data. With the prediction error method (PEM), this issue is
solved by using a noise model that is flexible enough to capture the noise
spectrum. However, a too flexible noise model (i.e., too many parameters)
increases the model complexity, which can cause additional numerical problems
for PEM. In this paper, we consider the weighted null-space fitting (WNSF)
method. With this method, the system is first modeled using a non-parametric
ARX model, which is then reduced to a parametric model of interest using
weighted least squares. In the reduction step, a parametric noise model does
not need to be estimated if it is not of interest. Because the flexibility of
the noise model is increased with the sample size, this will still provide
consistent estimates in closed loop and asymptotically efficient estimates in
open loop. In this paper, we prove these results, and we derive the asymptotic
covariance for the estimation error obtained in closed loop, which is optimal
for an infinite-order noise model. For this purpose, we also derive a new
technical result for geometric variance analysis, instrumental to our end.
Finally, we perform a simulation study to illustrate the benefits of the method

to maximize submodular functions that are defined stochastically, i.e. the
submodular function is defined as an expectation over a family of submodular
functions with an unknown distribution. We will show how stochastic gradient

approximately maximize discrete, monotone submodular optimization problems via
projected gradient descent on a continuous relaxation, directly connecting the

degassing, and gas deposition by interplanetary dust particles. Our model
reproduces the elemental and isotopic compositions of N and noble gases (except
for Xe) in the Martian atmosphere, as inferred from exploration missions and
analyses of Martian meteorites. Other processes such as ionization-induced
fractionation, which are not included in our model, are likely to make a large
contribution in producing the current Xe isotope composition. Since intense
impacts during the heavy bombardment period greatly affect the atmospheric
mass, the atmospheric pressure evolves stochastically. Whereas a dense
atmosphere preserves primitive isotopic compositions, a thin atmosphere on
early Mars is severely influenced by stochastic impact events and following
escape-induced fractionation. The onset of fractionation following the decrease
in atmospheric pressure is explained by shorter timescales of isotopic
fractionation under a lower atmospheric pressure. The comparison of our
numerical results with the less fractionated N ($^15$N/$^14$N) and Ar
($^38$Ar/$^36$Ar) isotope compositions of the ancient atmosphere recorded in
the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 provides a lower limit of the
atmospheric pressure in 4 Ga to preserve the primitive isotopic compositions.

matrix. The asymptotic properties of the new test statistics are investigated
under the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis using random matrix
theory. For this purpose we study the weak convergence of linear spectral
statistics of central and (conditionally) non-central Fisher matrices. In
particular, a central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics of large
dimensional (conditionally) non-central Fisher matrices is derived which is
then used to analyse the power of the tests under the alternative.
  The theoretical results are illustrated by means of a simulation study where
we also compare the new tests with several alternative, in particular with the
commonly used corrected likelihood ratio test. It is demonstrated that the
latter test does not keep its nominal level, if the dimension of one sub-vector
is relatively small compared to the dimension of the other sub-vector. On the
other hand the tests proposed in this paper provide a reasonable approximation
of the nominal level in such situations. Moreover, we observe that one of the
proposed tests is most powerful under a variety of correlation scenarios.

authenticating human users. Numerous biometrics have been proposed and
evaluated, each with its own set of benefits and pitfalls. Static biometrics
(such as fingerprints) are geared for discrete operation, to identify users,
which typically involves some user burden. Meanwhile, behavioral biometrics
(such as keystroke dynamics) are well suited for continuous, and sometimes more
unobtrusive, operation. One important application domain for biometrics is
deauthentication, a means of quickly detecting absence of a previously
authenticated user and immediately terminating that user's active secure
sessions. Deauthentication is crucial for mitigating so called Lunchtime
Attacks, whereby an insider adversary takes over (before any inactivity timeout
kicks in) authenticated state of a careless user who walks away from her
computer. Motivated primarily by the need for an unobtrusive and continuous
biometric to support effective deauthentication, we introduce PoPa, a new
hybrid biometric based on a human user's seated posture pattern. PoPa captures
a unique combination of physiological and behavioral traits. We describe a low
cost fully functioning prototype that involves an office chair instrumented
with 16 tiny pressure sensors. We also explore (via user experiments) how PoPa
can be used in a typical workplace to provide continuous authentication (and
deauthentication) of users. We experimentally assess viability of PoPa in terms
of uniqueness by collecting and evaluating posture patterns of a cohort of
users. Results show that PoPa exhibits very low false positive, and even lower
false negative, rates. In particular, users can be identified with, on average,
91.0% accuracy. Finally, we compare pros and cons of PoPa with those of several
prominent biometric based deauthentication techniques.

connected layers in the VGG-16 which contains a large number of parameters.
Additionally, instead of relying on an image pyramid to detect faces with
various scales, SSH is scale-invariant by design. We simultaneously detect
faces with different scales in a single forward pass of the network, but from
different layers. These properties make SSH fast and light-weight.
Surprisingly, with a headless VGG-16, SSH beats the ResNet-101-based
state-of-the-art on the WIDER dataset. Even though, unlike the current
state-of-the-art, SSH does not use an image pyramid and is 5X faster. Moreover,
if an image pyramid is deployed, our light-weight network achieves
state-of-the-art on all subsets of the WIDER dataset, improving the AP by 2.5%.
SSH also reaches state-of-the-art results on the FDDB and Pascal-Faces datasets

are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There
are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the
continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). To meet this need, we
collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of
facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than
1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search
engines using 1250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About
half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven
discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet
is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in
the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two
different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to
classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence
and arousal. Various evaluation metrics show that our deep neural network
baselines can perform better than conventional machine learning methods and
off-the-shelf facial expression recognition systems.

method to optimize the optical imaging system by \emph{in-situ} imaging the

cooled to tens of or several microkelvin by the radio-frequency evaporation
cooling, and then are plugged using a blue-detuned laser beam, forming a hole
in the center of the atomic cloud. We image the hole with a charge-coupled
device (CCD) and quantitatively analyze the artificial spatial structure due to
the defocus effect. Through minimizing the artificial structures by precisely
adjusting the CCD position, we can optimize the imaging system with an accuracy
of 0.1 mm. We also demonstrate the necessity of this method in probing rubidium
BEC with a time of flight (TOF) of 5 ms. Compared to other methods in focusing
the imaging system, the proposal demonstrated in this paper is simple and
efficient, particularly for experimentally extracting large-scale parameters

the decentralized output feedback control of a linear time-varying system over
a finite horizon, subject to polyhedral constraints on the state and input
trajectories, and sparsity constraints on the controller's information
structure. As the determination of optimal control policies for such systems is
known to be computationally intractable in general, considerable effort has
been made in the literature to identify efficiently computable, albeit
suboptimal, feasible control policies. The construction of computationally
tractable bounds on their suboptimality is the primary motivation for the
techniques developed in this note. Specifically, given a decentralized control
problem with nonclassical information, we characterize an expansion of the
given information structure, which ensures its partial nestedness, while
maximizing the optimal value of the resulting decentralized control problem
under the expanded information structure. The resulting decentralized control
problem is cast as an infinite-dimensional convex program, which is further
relaxed via a partial dualization and restriction to affine dual control
policies. The resulting problem is a finite-dimensional conic program whose
optimal value is a provable lower bound on the minimum cost of the original
constrained decentralized control problem.

bonds can promote the formation of surface oxides with structures and
properties differing greatly from bulk. Determination of the oxide structure,
however, is often elusive through the use of indirect diffraction methods or
techniques that probe only the outer most layer. As a result, surface oxides
forming on widely used materials, such as group III-nitrides, have not been
unambiguously resolved, even though critical properties can depend sensitively
on their presence. In this work, aberration corrected scanning transmission
electron microscopy reveals directly, and with depth dependence, the structure
of native two--dimensional oxides that form on AlN and GaN surfaces. Through
atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy, we show that the oxide layers are
comprised of tetrahedra--octahedra cation--oxygen units, similar to bulk
$\theta$--Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$--Ga$_2$O$_3$. By applying density functional
theory, we show that the observed structures are more stable than previously
proposed surface oxide models. We place the impact of these observations in the
context of key III-nitride growth, device issues, and the recent discovery of
two-dimnesional nitrides.

speech processing. However, recent research on DNNs has indicated
ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially
for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous
driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by
demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and

researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by
simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model,
known as a black-box attack to DNNs.
  Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we
propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input

different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we
propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the
gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use
zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction,
hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack
black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to
the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute
models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on
MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective

challenge for the geotherms and evolution of continents. By transforming the
nonlinear stable heat conduction equation into a linear Poisson's potential
one, we propose a method to infer the HP in the stable continental lithosphere.
This method estimates the HP through the inversion of the corresponding heat
flow (HF) observations. Either the distribution of HP within the lithosphere or
geometry of HP interfaces (even the both) can be inverted. Herein we focus on
the inversion of the geometry of the HP interface. An analogical
Parker-Oldenburg formula, which is often used in the inversion of potential
field, is deduced for this purpose. This analogical formula is based on a
relationship between the Fourier transform of the corresponding HF observations
and the sum of the Fourier transform for the powers of the interface geometry.
When the mean depth of the HP interface and the HP contrast between the two
media are given, one to three-dimensional geometry of the HP interface can be
iteratively calculated. As a case study, we construct a HP model for the
lithosphere of the Ordos geological block and its adjacent area in China, in
which three-dimensional geometry of the upper crustal HP interface is
estimated. It is found that the geometry of this HP interface distribute uneven
in a magnitude of dozens of km. With this HP model, the geotherms for the Ordos
geological block and its adjacent area is calculated further, which fit the
constraints from the studies on the xenolith and tectonics well.

phenomenon, in the context of the first law of thermodynamics. It is expected
that the coherent ordered motion typically self-organises in the presence of
changes in the (generalised) internal energy and of (generalised) work done on,
or extracted from, the system. We aim to explicitly quantify changes in these
two quantities in a system of simulated self-propelled particles, and contrast
them with changes in the system's configuration entropy. In doing so, we adapt
a thermodynamic formulation of the curvatures of the internal energy and the
work, with respect to two parameters that control the particles' alignment.
This allows us to systematically investigate the behaviour of the system by
varying the two control parameters to drive the system across a kinetic phase
transition. Our results identify critical regimes and show that during the
phase transition, where the configuration entropy of the system decreases, the
rates of change of the work and of the internal energy also decrease, while
their curvatures diverge. Importantly, the reduction of entropy achieved
through expenditure of work is shown to peak at criticality. We relate this
both to a thermodynamic efficiency and the significance of the increased order
with respect to a computational path. Additionally, this study provides an
information-geometric interpretation of the curvature of the internal energy as
the difference between two curvatures: the curvature of the free entropy,
captured by the Fisher information, and the curvature of the configuration
entropy.

deriving structural fractals of central place models from the textural
fractals. The method is theoretical deduction based on the dimension rules of
fractal sets. The textural fractals of central place models are reconstructed,
the structural dimensions are derived from the textural dimensions, and the
central place fractals are formulated by the k numbers and g numbers. Three
structural fractal models are constructed for central place systems according
to the corresponding fractal dimensions. A theoretical finding is that the
classic central place models comprise Koch snowflake curve and Sierpinski space
filling curve, and an inference is that the traffic principle plays a leading
role in urban and rural evolution. The conclusion can be reached that the
textural fractal dimensions can be converted into the structural fractal
dimensions. The latter dimensions can be directly used to appraise urban and
rural settlement distributions in the real world. Thus, the textural fractals
can be indirectly utilized to explain the development of the systems of human

spherically symmetric spacetime, we propose the definition of the total
deflection angle $\alpha$ of the light ray by constructing a quadrilateral
$\Sigma^4$ on the optical reference geometry ${\cal M}^{\rm opt}$ determined by
the optical metric $\bar{g}_{ij}$. On the basis of the definition of the total
deflection angle $\alpha$ and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive two formulas
to calculate the total deflection angle $\alpha$; (i) the angular formula that
uses four angles determined on the optical reference geometry ${\cal M}^{\rm
opt}$ or the curved $(r, \phi)$ subspace ${\cal M}^{\rm sub}$ being a slice of
constant time $t$ and (ii) the integral formula on the optical reference
geometry ${\cal M}^{\rm opt}$ which is the areal integral of the Gaussian
curvature $K$ in the area of a quadrilateral $\Sigma^4$ and the line integral
of the geodesic curvature $\kappa_g$ along the curve $C_{\Gamma}$. As the curve
$C_{\Gamma}$, we introduce the unperturbed reference line that is the null
geodesic $\Gamma$ on the background spacetime such as the Minkowski or the de
Sitter spacetime, and is obtained by projecting $\Gamma$ vertically onto the
curved $(r, \phi)$ subspace ${\cal M}^{\rm sub}$. We demonstrate that the two
formulas give the same total deflection angle $\alpha$ for the Schwarzschild

case, the result coincides with Epstein--Shapiro's formula when the source $S$
and the receiver $R$ of the light ray are located at infinity. In addition, in
the Schwarzschild--de Sitter case, there appear order ${\cal O}(\Lambda m)$
terms in addition to the Schwarzschild-like part, while order ${\cal

strongly interacting particles that are seen in nature are hadrons, which are
composites of quarks and gluons. Since QCD is a strongly coupled theory at
distance scales that are characteristic of observable hadrons, there are no
rigorous, first-principle methods to derive the spectrum and properties of the
hadrons from the QCD Lagrangian, except for Lattice QCD simulations that are
not yet able to cope with all aspects of complex and short-lived states.
Instead, a variety of ""QCD inspired"" phenomenological models have been
proposed. Common features of these models are predictions for the existence of
hadrons with substructures that are more complex than the standard
quark-antiquark mesons and the three quark baryons of the original quark model
that provides a concise description of most of the low-mass hadrons. Recently,
an assortment of candidates for non-standard multi-quark mesons, meson-gluon
hybrids and pentaquark baryons that contain heavy (charm or bottom) quarks have
been discovered. Here we review the experimental evidence for these states and
make some general comparisons of their measured properties with standard
quark-model expectations and predictions of various models for non-standard
hadrons. We conclude that the spectroscopy of all but simplest hadrons is not

exploits the multipath characteristics of wideband channels. Specifically, when
the channel has a maximum of $L$ multipath taps, \textcolor{red}{it is shown
that $N_c\leq L$ cells can estimate the channels of their user equipments (UEs)

a typical long term evolution (LTE) channel environment having delay spread

$L=18$ cells can use this band. In practice, $T_d$ is constant for a particular
environment and carrier frequency, and hence $L$ increases as the bandwidth
increases. All the analytical expressions have been validated, and the
superiority of the proposed design over the existing ones is demonstrated using
extensive numerical simulations both for correlated and uncorrelated channels.
The proposed channel estimation and beamforming design is linear and simple to
implement.

The calculation, for which we develop the lagrangian and power counting, is
carried out up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the EFT expansion. The power
counting we adopt implies that Coulomb interactions must be included to all
orders in $\alpha_{\rm em}$. We do this via EFT Feynman diagrams computed in
time-ordered perturbation theory, and so recover existing quantum-mechanical
technology such as the two-potential formalism for the treatment of the
Coulomb-nuclear interference. Meanwhile the strong interactions and the E1
operator are dealt with via EFT expansions in powers of momenta, with a
breakdown scale set by the size of the ${}^7$Be core, $\Lambda \approx 70$ MeV.
Up to NLO the relevant physics in the different channels that enter the
radiative capture reaction is encoded in ten different EFT couplings. The
result is a model-independent parametrization for the reaction amplitude in the
energy regime of interest. To show the connection to previous results we fix
the EFT couplings using results from a number of potential model and
microscopic calculations in the literature. Each of these models corresponds to
a particular point in the space of EFTs. The EFT structure therefore provides a
very general way to quantify the model uncertainty in calculations of
$^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$. We also demonstrate that the only
N$^2$LO corrections in $^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$ come from an
inelasticity that is practically of N$^3$LO size in the energy range of
interest, and so the truncation error in our calculation is effectively

bottle into an orientable manifold with nonlocal boundary interactions. The
interpretation reveals the conceptual connection of the Klein bottle entropy
with the celebrated Affleck-Ludwig entropy in boundary CFT. We propose a
generic scheme to extract these universal boundary entropies from quantum Monte
Carlo calculation of partition function ratios in lattice models. Our numerical
results on the Affleck-Ludwig entropy and Klein bottle entropy for the
$q$-state quantum Potts chains with $q=2,3$ show excellent agreement with the
CFT predictions. For the quantum Potts chain with $q=4$, the Klein bottle
entropy slightly deviates from the CFT prediction, which is possibly due to
marginally irrelevant terms in the low-energy effective theory.

they couple to bosons which dress up fermions and lead to new massive composite

on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run
data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and

as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our
knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major
metabolomics technologies (i.e., LC-MS, FIA-MS, GC-MS, and NMR) can be analyzed
on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga
evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can
be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis
(including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output
results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI).
Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible
science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for
e-learning and training. The Workflow4Metabolomics 3.0 e-infrastructure thus
not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main
metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for
metabolomics workflows.

i) noise estimation, peak detection and quantification, ii) peak grouping

implemented a new indicator to quantify the potential alteration of the feature
peak shape due to matrix effect. The preprocessing is fast (less than 15 s per

inferred from the mass resolution of the instrument. Application to two

demonstrate that proFIA achieves very efficient and robust detection and

value in recent decades. We develop a pseudo-spectral velocity formulation of
the turbulence equations that smoothly interpolates between the highly
efficient but lower resolution 3D gyrofluid representation and the conventional
but more expensive 5D gyrokinetic representation. Our formulation is a
projection of the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation onto a Laguerre-Hermite
velocity-space basis. We discuss issues related to collisions, closures, and
entropy. While any collision operator can be used in the formulation, we
highlight a model operator that has a particularly sparse Laguerre-Hermite
representation, while satisfying conservation laws and the H theorem. Free
streaming, magnetic drifts, and nonlinear phase mixing each give rise to
closure problems, which we discuss in relation to the instabilities of interest
and to free energy conservation. We show that the model is capable of
reproducing gyrokinetic results for linear instabilities and zonal flow
dynamics. Thus the final model is appropriate for the study of instabilities,
turbulence, and transport in a wide range of geometries, including tokamaks and
stellarators.

  with Exogenous Interaction Networks","preprint for the MSMMUSE post-proceedings",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online social networks (OSNs) have become the main medium for connecting
people, sharing knowledge and information, and for communication. The social
connections between people using these OSNs are formed as virtual links (e.g.,
friendship and following connections) that connect people. These links are the
heart of today's OSNs as they facilitate all of the activities that the members
of a social network can do. However, many of these networks suffer from noisy
links, i.e., links that do not reflect a real relationship or links that have a
low intensity, that change the structure of the network and prevent accurate
analysis of these networks. Hence, a process for assessing and ranking the
links in a social network is crucial in order to sustain a healthy and real
network. Here, we define link assessment as the process of identifying noisy
and non-noisy links in a network. In this paper, we address the problem of link
assessment and link ranking in social networks using external interaction
networks. In addition to a friendship social network, additional exogenous
interaction networks are utilized to make the assessment process more
meaningful. We employed machine learning classifiers for assessing and ranking
the links in the social network of interest using the data from exogenous
interaction networks. The method was tested with two different datasets, each
containing the social network of interest, with the ground truth, along with
the exogenous interaction networks. The results show that it is possible to
effectively assess the links of a social network using only the structure of a
single network of the exogenous interaction networks, and also using the
structure of the whole set of exogenous interaction networks. The experiments
showed that some classifiers do better than others regarding both link
classification and link ranking.

Below Tc = 11,6 K the LTEC of the sample had a small negative value, which is
apparently due to the transition from the paramagnetic metal in the
superconducting state. There was a bend of temperature dependence of the LTEC,
which shows broad peak around 40 K and can be attributed to the elastic lattice
anomaly around the end-point of Mott boundary. A sharp jump in the LTEC values
and hysteresis was observed in the area of Tg ~ 75-77 K, what is likely
explained by the transition in a glass-like state. The isotope effect in the

of single cavitation bubbles using simultaneous time-resolved shadowgraphy and
hydrophone pressure measurements. The geometry of the bubbles is systematically
varied from spherical to very non-spherical by decreasing their distance to a
free or rigid surface or by modulating the gravity-induced pressure gradient
aboard parabolic flights. The non-spherical collapse produces multiple shocks
that are clearly associated with different processes, such as the jet impact
and the individual collapses of the distinct bubble segments. For bubbles
collapsing near a free surface, the energy and timing of each shock are
measured separately as a function of the anisotropy parameter $\zeta$, which
represents the dimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. For a given
source of bubble deformation (free surface, rigid surface or gravity), the
normalized shock energy depends only on $\zeta$, irrespective of the bubble
radius $R_{0}$ and driving pressure $\Delta p$. Based on this finding, we
develop a predictive framework for the peak pressure and energy of shock waves
from non-spherical bubble collapses. Combining statistical analysis of the
experimental data with theoretical derivations, we find that the shock peak
pressures can be estimated as jet impact-induced hammer pressures, expressed as
$p_{h} = 0.45\left(\rho c^{2}\Delta p\right)^{1/2} \zeta^{-1}$ at $\zeta >
10^{-3}$. The same approach is found to explain the shock energy quenching as a
function of $\zeta^{-2/3}$.

  Cooperative Jamming Relay",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In physical layer security (PHY-security), the frequently observed high
correlation between the main and wiretap channels can cause a significant loss
of secrecy. This paper investigates a slow fading scenario, where a transmitter
(Alice) sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver (Bob) while a
passive eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to decode the message from its received
signal. It is assumed that Alice is equipped with multiple antennas while Bob
and Eve each have a single antenna (i.e., a MISOSE system). In a MISOSE system,
high correlation results in nearly collinear main and wiretap channel vectors,
which help Eve to see and intercept confidential information. Unfortunately,
the signal processing techniques at Alice, such as beamforming and artificial
noise (AN), are helpless, especially in the extreme case of completely
collinear main and wiretap channel vectors. On this background, we first
investigate the achievable secrecy outage probability via beamforming and AN at
Alice with the optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal
and AN. Then, an ingenious model, in which a cooperative jamming relay (Relay)
is introduced, is proposed to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high
correlation. Based on the proposed model, the power allocation between the
information-bearing signal at Alice and the AN at Relay is also studied to
maximize secrecy. Finally, to validate our proposed schemes, numerical
simulations are conducted, and the results show that a significant performance
gain with respect to secrecy is achieved.

local parameter paradigm. Our main point is that the time sequence of the
eruptions did not go with these parameters. It is argued that an additional
factor, in the form of stabilizing force, should operate to determine the onset
of the first eruption and temporal behaviors of subsequent eruptions. As
supporting evidence, we report that the heating and fast plasma flow continuing
for a timescale of an hour was the direct cause for the first eruption, and
that the unidirectional propagation of the disturbance determined the timing of
subsequent eruptions. Both of these factors are associated with the overall
magnetic structure rather than local magnetic properties of the active region.

on the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) observations of the NOAA active

2012. The active region had the positive polarity magnetic fields in the center
surrounded by the negative polarity fields around. Since such a distribution of
magnetic polarity tends to form a dome-like magnetic fan structure confined
over the active region, the multiple eruptions was puzzling. Our investigation
reveals that this event exhibits several properties distinct from other
eruptions associated with magnetic fan structures: (i) a long filament
encircling the active region was present before the eruptions; (ii) expansion
of the open-closed boundary of the field lines after each eruption suggestive
of the growing fan-dome structure, and (iii) the ribbons inside the closed
magnetic polarity inversion line evolving in response to the expanding
open-closed boundary. It thus appears that in spite of multiple eruptions the
fan-dome structure remained undamaged, and the closing back field lines after
each eruption rather reinforced the fan-dome structure. We argue that the
multiple eruptions could occur in this active region in spite of its confined
magnetic structure because the filament encircling the active region was
adequate for slipping through the magnetic separatrix to minimize the damage to
its overlying fan-dome structure. The result of this study provides a new
insight into the productivity of eruptions from a confined magnetic structure.

optical imaging dataset that will support investigations of our Solar System,
Galaxy and Universe, across half the sky and over ten years of repeated
observation. However, exactly how the LSST observations will be taken (the
observing strategy or ""cadence"") is not yet finalized. In this
dynamically-evolving community white paper, we explore how the detailed
performance of the anticipated science investigations is expected to depend on
small changes to the LSST observing strategy. Using realistic simulations of
the LSST schedule and observation properties, we design and compute diagnostic
metrics and Figures of Merit that provide quantitative evaluations of different
observing strategies, analyzing their impact on a wide range of proposed
science projects. This is work in progress: we are using this white paper to
communicate to each other the relative merits of the observing strategy choices
that could be made, in an effort to maximize the scientific value of the
survey. The investigation of some science cases leads to suggestions for new
strategies that could be simulated and potentially adopted. Notably, we find
motivation for exploring departures from a spatially uniform annual tiling of
the sky: focusing instead on different parts of the survey area in different
years in a ""rolling cadence"" is likely to have significant benefits for a
number of time domain and moving object astronomy projects. The communal
assembly of a suite of quantified and homogeneously coded metrics is the vital
first step towards an automated, systematic, science-based assessment of any
given cadence simulation, that will enable the scheduling of the LSST to be as
well-informed as possible.

have considered attention for their applications in technology. The quantum
plasmonic properties of metallic nanostructures in the quantum size regime have
been difficult to describe by an appropriate model. Here the nonlocal quantum
plasmons are investigated in the most important metals of copper, gold, and
silver. Dispersion properties of these metals and propagation of longitudinal
quantum plasmons in the high photon energy regime are studied by a new model of
nonlocal quantum dielectric permittivity. The epsilon near zero properties are
investigated and the spectrum and the damping rate of the longitudinal quantum
plasmons are obtained in these metals. The quantum plasmon s wave function is
shown for both classical and quantum limits. It is shown that silver is the
most appropriate for quantum metallic structures in the development of next
generation of quantum optical and sensing technologies, due to low intrinsic

  Graph Wavelets","22 pages, 8 figures, Conference paper",,,,"stat.ME cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral graph wavelets introduce a notion of scale in networks, and are thus
used to obtain a local view of the network from each node. By carefully
constructing a wavelet filter function for these wavelets, a multi-scale
community detection method for monoplex networks has already been developed.
This construction takes advantage of the partitioning properties of the network
Laplacian. In this paper we elaborate on a novel method which uses spectral
graph wavelets to detect multi-scale communities in temporal networks. To do
this we extend the definition of spectral graph wavelets to temporal networks
by adopting a multilayer framework. We use arguments from Perturbation Theory
to investigate the spectral properties of the supra-Laplacian matrix for
clustering purposes in temporal networks. Using these properties, we construct
a new wavelet filter function, which attenuates the influence of uninformative
eigenvalues and centres the filter around eigenvalues which contain information
on the coarsest description of prevalent community structures over time. We use
the spectral graph wavelets as feature vectors in a connectivity-constrained
clustering procedure to detect multi-scale communities at different scales, and
refer to this method as Temporal Multi-Scale Community Detection (TMSCD). We
validate the performance of TMSCD and a competing methodology on various
benchmarks. The advantage of TMSCD is the automated selection of relevant
scales at which communities should be sought.

find that the PRS has greater statistical power than approaches that bin the
relative orientation angles, as it makes more efficient use of the information

preferential alignment results in a higher statistical significance, in each of
the four Vela C regions, with the greatest increase being by a factor 1.3 in

unconventional, dramatic modulation of the spin signal, showing one order of

epistemic operator and a belief operator, which allows to model the disclosure

  Our main motivation is to model rich privacy policies in online social
networks. Online Social Networks (OSNs) are increasingly used for social
interactions in the modern digital era, which bring new challenges and concerns
in terms of privacy. Most social networks today offer very limited mechanisms
to express the desires of users in terms of how information that affects their
privacy is shared. In particular, most current privacy policy formalisms allow
only static policies, which are not rich enough to express timed properties
like ""my location after work should not be disclosed to my boss"". The logic we
present in this paper enables to express rich properties and policies in terms
of the knowledge available to the different users and the precise time of
actions and deductions. Our framework can be instantiated for different OSNs,
by specifying the effect of the actions in the evolution of the social network
and in the knowledge disclosed to each agent.
  We present an algorithm for deducing knowledge, which can also be
instantiated with different variants of how the epistemic information is
preserved through time. Our algorithm allows to model not only social networks
with eternal information but also networks with ephemeral disclosures. Policies
are modelled as formulae in the logic, which are interpreted over timed traces
representing the evolution of the social network.

Decomposition depth is inductively defined: A (weighed) path graph has shortest
path decomposition (SPD) depth $1$. General graph has an SPD of depth $k$ if it
contains a shortest path whose deletion leads to a graph, each of whose
components has SPD depth at most $k-1$. In this paper we give an
$O(k^{\min\{\frac{1}{p},\frac{1}{2}\}})$-distortion embedding for graphs of SPD
depth at most $k$. This result is asymptotically tight for any fixed $p>1$,
while for $p=1$ it is tight up to second order terms.
  As a corollary of this result, we show that graphs having pathwidth $k$ embed
into $\ell_p$ with distortion $O(k^{\min\{\frac{1}{p},\frac{1}{2}\}})$. For
$p=1$, this improves over the best previous bound of Lee and Sidiropoulos that
was exponential in $k$; moreover, for other values of $p$ it gives the first
embeddings whose distortion is independent of the graph size $n$. Furthermore,
we use the fact that planar graphs have SPD depth $O(\log n)$ to give a new
proof that any planar graph embeds into $\ell_1$ with distortion $O(\sqrt{\log
n})$. Our approach also gives new results for graphs with bounded treewidth,

winds with the interstellar medium, with the prospect for particle acceleration
by the shocks. These objects are consequently candidates for non-thermal
emission. Our aim is to investigate the X-ray emission from these sources. We
observed with XMM-Newton a sample of 5 bow shock runaways, which constitutes a
significant improvement of the sample of bow shock runaways studied in X-rays
so far. A careful analysis of the data did not reveal any X-ray emission
related to the bow shocks. However, X-ray emission from the stars is detected,
in agreement with the expected thermal emission from stellar winds. On the
basis of background measurements we derive conservative upper limits between
0.3 and 10 keV on the bow shocks emission. Using a simple radiation model,
these limits together with radio upper limits allow us to constrain some of the
main physical quantities involved in the non-thermal emission processes, such
as the magnetic field strength and the amount of incident infrared photons. The
reasons likely responsible for the non-detection of non-thermal radiation are
discussed. Finally, using energy budget arguments, we investigate the
detectability of inverse Compton X-rays in a more extended sample of catalogued
runaway star bow shocks. From our analysis we conclude that a clear
identification of non-thermal X-rays from massive runaway bow shocks requires
one order of magnitude (or higher) sensitivity improvement with respect to

condensed matter. Their realization at room temperature (RT) in magnetic
multilayers has generated considerable interest, fueled by technological
prospects and the access granted to fundamental questions. The interaction of
skyrmions with charge carriers gives rise to exotic electrodynamics, such as
the topological Hall effect (THE), the Hall response to an emergent magnetic

be used to detect skyrmions needs to be tested quantitatively. For that it is
imperative to develop comprehensive understanding of skyrmions and other chiral
textures, and their electrical fingerprint. Here, using Hall transport and
magnetic imaging, we track the evolution of magnetic textures and their THE
signature in a technologically viable multilayer film as a function of

topological Hall resistivity ($\rho_\mathrm{TH}$) scales with the density of
isolated skyrmions ($n_\mathrm{sk}$) over a wide range of $T$, confirming the
impact of the skyrmion Berry-phase on electronic transport. We find that at
higher $n_\mathrm{sk}$ skyrmions cluster into worms which carry considerable
topological charge, unlike topologically-trivial spin spirals. While we
establish a qualitative agreement between $\rho_\mathrm{TH}(H,T)$ and areal
density of topological charge $n_\mathrm{T}(H,T)$, our detailed quantitative

robustly reconstruct integers, there are two kinds of traditional methods: the
one is to introduce common divisors in the moduli and the other is to directly
decrease the dynamic range. In this paper, we take further insight into the

strong restrictions are placed on the input. In this paper we seek to identify
structural properties of instances of stable matching problems which will allow
us to design efficient algorithms using elementary techniques. We focus on the
setting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be
partitioned into k different types, where the type of an agent determines his
or her preferences, and agents have preferences over types (which may be
refined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation
would arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small
collection of agents' attributes. We also consider a generalisation in which
each agent may consider some small collection of other agents to be
exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with their types;
this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact with a small number
of candidates. We show that (for the case without exceptions), several
well-studied NP-hard stable matching problems including Max SMTI (that of
finding the maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of stable
marriage with ties and incomplete lists) belong to the parameterised complexity
class FPT when parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed
to describe the instance. For Max SMTI this tractability result can be extended
to the setting in which each agent promotes at most one `exceptional' candidate
to the top of his/her list (when preferences within types are not refined), but
the problem remains NP-hard if preference lists can contain two or more
exceptions and the exceptional candidates can be placed anywhere in the
preference lists, even if the number of types is bounded by a constant.

column is strongly variable and correlates with the CO emission thus confirming
that the absorbing material must be in the foreground and reinforcing the

to lower shock velocities in this region, likely due to the interaction of the

recurrent network capable of varying and adjusting the recurrence depth between
input intervals is examined. The recurrence depth is extended by several
intermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in
determining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the
paper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and
improving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1)
Determining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different
tasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally
wasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and
high latency. Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with
the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing
function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the
proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each
input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate
hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is
achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate
layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all
intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an
expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments:
regression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling
on the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance
than other state-of-the-art recurrent networks in all three experiments.

dynamic, possibly unstable systems. The approach is new hence its analysis is
preliminary, and theoretical results are derived for nonlinear memoryless
plants and linear dynamic plants. However, the setting for the controller does
not require the plant-system to be either linear or stable, and this is

presented. The method arises from the specialisation of established variational
techniques to the unstable periodic orbits of the system. On such trajectories,
the adjoint problem becomes a time periodic boundary value problem. The adjoint
solution remains bounded in time and does not exhibit the typical unbounded
exponential growth observed using traditional methods over unstable
non-periodic trajectories (Lea et al., Tellus 52 (2000)). This enables the
sensitivity of period averaged quantities to be calculated exactly, regardless
of the orbit period, because the stability of the tangent dynamics is decoupled
effectively from the sensitivity calculations. We demonstrate the method on two
prototypical systems, the Lorenz equations at standard parameters and the
Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation
with chaotic behaviour. We report a statistical analysis of the sensitivity of
these two systems based on databases of unstable periodic orbits of size 10^5
and 4x10^4, respectively. The empirical observation is that most orbits predict
approximately the same sensitivity. The effects of symmetries, bifurcations and
intermittency are discussed and future work is outlined in the conclusions.

of the magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in transversely oscillating
coronal loops. Methods: We modelled a fundamental standing kink mode in a
straight, density-enhanced magnetic flux tube using the magnetohydrodynamics
code, Lare3d. In order to evaluate the impact of an azimuthal component of the
magnetic field, various degrees of twist were included within the flux tube's
magnetic field. Results: The process of resonant absorption is only weakly
affected by the presence of a twisted magnetic field. However, the subsequent
evolution of the KHI is sensitive to the strength of the azimuthal component of
the field. Increased twist values inhibit the deformation of the loop's density
profile, which is associated with the growth of the instability. Despite this,
much smaller scales in the magnetic field are generated when there is a
non-zero azimuthal component present. Hence, the instability is more energetic
in cases with (even weakly) twisted fields. Field aligned flows at the loop
apex are established in a twisted regime once the instability has formed.
Conclusions: The KHI may have implications for wave heating in the solar
atmosphere due to the creation of small length scales and the generation of a
turbulent regime. Whilst magnetic twist does suppress the development of the
vortices associated with the instability, the formation of the KHI in a twisted
regime will be accompanied by greater Ohmic dissipation due to the larger
currents that are produced, even if only weak twist is present. The presence of
magnetic twist will likely make the instability more difficult to detect in the
corona, but will enhance its contribution to heating the solar atmosphere.

the excited states are clearly exotic, in the sense that they cannot be
explained by the conventional baryons with three quarks, since their quantum
numbers are $(S,I)=(1,0)$ and $(-1,1)$. Similar to the charmed scalar meson
$D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ in $DK$ scattering and the hyperon $\Lambda(1405)$ in
$\bar{K}N$ scattering, one bound state below the $\Xi_{cc} \bar{K}$ threshold

clinical applications primarily due to its capability of providing quantitative
information about material properties. The quantitative integrity of the
reconstructed data depends on the accuracy of the data corrections applied to
the measurements. Scatter correction is a particularly sensitive correction in
spectral CT as it depends on system effects as well as the object being imaged
and any residual scatter is amplified during the non-linear material
decomposition. An accurate way of removing scatter is subtracting the scatter
estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. However, to get sufficiently good scatter
estimates, extremely large numbers of photons is required, which may lead to
unexpectedly high computational costs. Other approaches model scatter as a
convolution operation using kernels derived using empirical methods. These
techniques have been found to be insufficient in spectral CT due to their
inability to sufficiently capture object dependence. In this work, we develop a
deep residual learning framework to address both issues of computation
simplicity and object dependency. A deep convolution neural network is trained
to determine the scatter distribution from the projection content in training
sets. In test cases of a digital anthropomorphic phantom and real water
phantom, we demonstrate that with much lower computing costs, the proposed
network provides sufficiently accurate scatter estimation.

Our simulations reproduce Th-230 and Pa-231 dissolved concentrations: they
compare well with recent GEOTRACES observations in many parts of the ocean.
Particulate Th-230 and Pa-231 concentrations are significantly improved
compared to previous studies, but they are still too low because of missing
particles from nepheloid layers. Our simulation reproduces the main

will facilitate the integration process, improving feedback speeds and offer
potential solutions to wiring and layout challenges. Integrating classical and
quantum devices monolithically, using complementary metal-oxide-transistor
(CMOS) processes, enables the processor to profit from the most mature
industrial technology for the fabrication of large scale circuits. Here we
demonstrate the integration of a single-electron charge storage CMOS quantum
dot with a CMOS transistor for control of the readout via gate-based dispersive
sensing using a lumped element $LC$ resonator. The control field-effect
transistor (FET) and quantum dot are fabricated on the same chip using
fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We obtain a charge sensitivity
of $\delta q=165\, \mu e \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ when the quantum dot readout is
enabled by the control FET. Additionally, we observe a single-electron
retention time of the order of a second when storing a single-electron charge
on the quantum dot at milli-Kelvin temperatures. These results demonstrate
first steps towards time-based multiplexing of gate-based dispersive qubit

different underlying student behaviours, where the sequence of actions from
each session belongs to an underlying student behaviour. We model student
behaviour as Markov chains, such that a student is modelled as a distribution
of Markov chains, which are estimated using a modified k-means clustering
algorithm. The resulting Markov chains are readily interpretable, and in a
qualitative analysis around 125,000 student sessions are identified as
exhibiting unproductive student behaviour. Based on our results this student
representation is promising, especially for educational systems offering many
different learning usages, and offers an alternative to common approaches like
modelling student behaviour as a single Markov chain often done in the

Recently, we know that partial order is a universal property of the
construction with a sublinear complexity for polar codes. In order to describe
the partial order, addition and left-swap operators are only defined as
universal up to now. In this study, we first propose $1+\log_2 \log_2 N$
universal operators to describe multiple partial order for the block length
$N=2^n$. By using these operators, some known antichains can be universally
ordered.
  Furthermore, by using a simple geometric property of Gaussian approximation,
we define an attractor that is a pre-defined subset of synthetic channels. They
are universally less reliable than the natural channel $W$. Then, we show that
the cardinality of this attractor is $(n+2)$-th Fibonacci number which is a
significantly large number of channels for long codes. The main contribution is
that there are significant number of synthetic channels explicitly defined as
almost useless by the help of attractor and multiple partial order. As a
result, proposed attractor with multiple partial order can be seen as an
efficient tool to investigate and design extremely long codes.

An often-made explicit or implicit assumption is that one single critical state
is responsible for two separate notions of criticality (avalanche criticality
and dynamical edge of chaos criticality). Previously, we provided an isolated
counter-example for co-occurrence. Here, we reveal a persistent paradigm of
structural transitions that such networks undergo, as the overall connectivity
strength is varied over its biologically meaningful range. Among these
transitions, only one avalanche critical point emerges, with edge of chaos
failing to co-occur. Our observations are based on ensembles of networks
obtained from variations of network configuration and their neurons. This
suggests that not only non-coincidence of criticality, but also the persistent
paradigm of network structural changes in function of the overall connectivity
strength, could be generic features of a large class of biological neural
networks.

model is based on a new tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) (Kilmer and
Martin 2011) and its induced tensor tubal rank and tensor nuclear norm.
Consider that we have a 3-way tensor ${\mathcal{X}}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_1\times
n_2\times n_3}$ such that ${\mathcal{X}}={\mathcal{L}}_0+{\mathcal{E}}_0$,
where ${\mathcal{L}}_0$ has low tubal rank and ${\mathcal{E}}_0$ is sparse. Is
that possible to recover both components? In this work, we prove that under
certain suitable assumptions, we can recover both the low-rank and the sparse
components exactly by simply solving a convex program whose objective is a
weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the $\ell_1$-norm, i.e.,
$\min_{{\mathcal{L}},\ {\mathcal{E}}} \
\|{{\mathcal{L}}}\|_*+\lambda\|{{\mathcal{E}}}\|_1, \ \text{s.t.} \
{\mathcal{X}}={\mathcal{L}}+{\mathcal{E}}$, where $\lambda=
{1}/{\sqrt{\max(n_1,n_2)n_3}}$. Interestingly, TRPCA involves RPCA as a special
case when $n_3=1$ and thus it is a simple and elegant tensor extension of RPCA.
Also numerical experiments verify our theory and the application for the image

of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1 with the propagating mass accretion rate
fluctuations model PROPFLUC. The model simultaneously predicts power spectra,
time lags, and coherence of the variability as a function of energy. The
observations cover the soft and the hard state of the source, and the
transition between the two. We find good agreement between model pre-dictions
and data in the hard and in the soft state. Our analysis suggests that in the
soft state the fluctuations propagate in an optically thin hot flow extending
up to large radii above and below a stable optically thick disc. In the hard
state, our results are consistent with a truncated disc geometry, where the hot
flow extends radially inside the inner radius of the disc. In the transition
from soft to hard state, the characteristics of the rapid variability are too
complex to be successfully described with PROPFLUC. The surface density profile
of the hot flow predicted by our model and the lack of QPOs in the soft and
hard state, suggest that the spin of the black hole is aligned with the inner
accretion disc and therefore probably with the rotational axis of the binary
system.

h_{t/\ep}k_t l_{\ep t}$ composed of three smooth maps with separated time
scales: slow, intermediate and fast; corresponding to the big, little, and
lesser whorls in Richardson's well-known metaphor for turbulence. Under
homogenisation, as $\lim \ep\to0$, the composition $h_{t/\ep}k_t $ of the fast
flow and the intermediate flow is known to be describable as a single
stochastic flow $\dd g$. The interaction of the homogenised stochastic flow
$\dd g$ with the slow flow of the big whorl is obtained by going into its
non-inertial moving reference frame, via the composition of maps $(\dd g)l_{\ep
t}$. This procedure parameterises the interactions of the three flow components
of the Richardson triple as a single stochastic fluid flow in a moving
reference frame.
  The Kelvin circulation theorem for the stochastic dynamics of the Richardson
triple reveals the interactions among its three components. Namely, (i) the
velocity in the circulation integrand acquires is kinematically swept by the
large scales; and (ii) the velocity of the material circulation loop acquires
additional stochastic Lie transport by the small scales. The stochastic
dynamics of the composite homogenised flow is derived from a stochastic
Hamilton's principle, and then recast into Lie-Poisson bracket form with a
stochastic Hamiltonian. Several examples are given, including fluid flow with
stochastically advected quantities, and rigid body motion under gravity, i.e.,
the stochastic heavy top in a rotating frame.

We
answer this question for the case of dexterous grasping of unfamiliar objects.
By dexterous grasping we simply mean grasping by any hand with more than two
fingers, such that the robot has some choice about where to place each finger.
Such grasps typically fail in one of two ways, either unmodeled objects in the
scene cause collisions or object reconstruction is insufficient to ensure that
the grasp points provide a stable force closure. These problems can be solved
more easily if active sensing is guided by the anticipated actions. Our
approach has three stages. First, we take a single view and generate candidate
grasps from the resulting partial object reconstruction. Second, we drive the
active vision approach to maximise surface reconstruction quality around the
planned contact points. During this phase, the anticipated grasp is continually
refined. Third, we direct gaze to improve the safety of the planned reach to
grasp trajectory. We show, on a dexterous manipulator with a camera on the
wrist, that our approach (80.4% success rate) outperforms a randomised
algorithm (64.3% success rate).

determine a stochastic cascade process, which provides information of the
general multipoint statistics. Furthermore the evolution of single trajectories
in scale, which characterize wave height fluctuations in the surroundings of a
chosen location, can be determined. The explicit knowledge of the stochastic
process enables to assign entropy values to all wave events. We show that for
these entropies the integral fluctuation theorem, a basic law of

negative entropy events must occur. Extreme events like rogue waves are
characterized as negative entropy events. The statistics of these entropy

decision processes (POMDPs), where the objective is to compute a strategy for

computationally intractable in general. We alleviate this difficulty by
focusing on planning applications and exploiting typical structural properties
of such scenarios; for instance, we assume that the agent has the ability to
observe its own position inside an environment. We propose an abstraction
refinement framework which turns such a POMDP model into a (fully observable)

verification and synthesis tools allow to determine strategies with optimal
safety and performance measures, which approximate optimal schedulers on the
POMDP. If the approximation is too coarse to satisfy the given specifications,
an refinement scheme improves the computed strategies. As a running example, we
use planning problems where an agent moves inside an environment with randomly
moving obstacles and restricted observability. We demonstrate that the proposed
method advances the state of the art by solving problems several
orders-of-magnitude larger than those that can be handled by existing POMDP
solvers. Furthermore, this method gives guarantees on safety constraints, which
is not supported by the majority of the existing solvers.

cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a
threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal
population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic
burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold
neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise
intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying
the noise intensity $D$ in the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for
the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a
power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a
few ""hubs"" (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a ""Matthew"" effect in
synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good
burst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic
strengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression
(LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing
$D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In
the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network
architecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic
strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the
distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the
post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the
post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a
multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in
comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

interacting medium under equilibrium conditions form the baseline upon which
various possible scenarios in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments are
built. Many of these quantities have been obtained in the lattice QCD framework
with reliable continuum extrapolations. Recently the
Polyakov$-$Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model has been reparametrized to some extent to
reproduce quantitatively the lattice QCD equation of state at vanishing
chemical potentials. The agreement was precise except at low temperatures,
possibly due to inadequate representation of the hadronic degrees of freedom in
the model. This disagreement was also observed for some of the fluctuation and
correlations considered. Here we address this issue by introducing the effects
of hadrons through the Hadron Resonance Gas model. The total thermodynamic
potential is now a weighted sum of the thermodynamic potential of the
Polyakov$-$Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model and that of the Hadron Resonance Gas
model. We find that the equation of state and the fluctuations and correlations
obtained in this hybrid model agrees satisfactorily with the lattice QCD data
in the low temperature regime.

elastodynamics. The source term is supposed to be the product of a spatial
function and a temporal function with compact support. We present
frequency-domain and time-domain approaches to show uniqueness in determining
the spatial function from wave fields on a large sphere over a finite interval.
Stability estimate of the temporal function from the data of one receiver and
uniqueness result using partial boundary data are proved. Our arguments rely
heavily on the use of the Fourier transform, which motivated inversion schemes
that can be easily implemented. A Landweber iterative algorithm for recovering
the spatial function and a non-iterative inversion scheme based on the
uniqueness proof for recovering the temporal function are proposed. Numerical
examples are demonstrated in both two and three dimensions.

via the maximum entropy principle. Three different types of the production
terms in the system, which are suggested by a generalized BGK-type collision
term in the Boltzmann equation, are adopted. In particular, the rational

possible to forecast these failures so preventive actions can be taken to
increase the reliability of a datacenter? To answer these questions, we have
studied what are probably the largest, publicly available datacenter traces,
containing more than 104 million events from 12,500 machines. Among these
samples, we observe and categorize three types of machine failures, all of
which are catastrophic and may lead to information loss, or even worse,
reliability degradation of a datacenter. We further propose a two-stage
framework-DC-Prophet-based on One-Class Support Vector Machine and Random
Forest. DC-Prophet extracts surprising patterns and accurately predicts the
next failure of a machine. Experimental results show that DC-Prophet achieves
an AUC of 0.93 in predicting the next machine failure, and a F3-score of 0.88
(out of 1). On average, DC-Prophet outperforms other classical machine learning
methods by 39.45% in F3-score.

presence of a medium that is axially symmetric, in particular with respect to
Casimir-Polder interaction energies. As an application, we derive the
Casimir-Polder interaction energy between an electric $\delta$-function plate
and an anisotropically polarizable molecule for arbitrary orientations of the
principal axes of polarizabilities of the molecule. We show that in the perfect
conductor limit for the plate the interaction is insensitive to the orientation
of the polarizabilities of the molecule. We obtain the Casimir-Polder energy
between an electric $\delta$-function sphere and an anisotropically polarizable
molecule, again for arbitrary orientations of the principal axes of
polarizabilities of the molecule. We derive results when the polarizable
molecule is either outside the sphere, or inside the sphere. We present the
perfectly conducting limit for the $\delta$-function sphere, and also the
interaction energy for the special case when the molecule is at the center of
the sphere. Our general proposition is that the Casimir-Polder energy between a
dielectric body with axial symmetry and an unidirectionally polarizable
molecule placed on the axis with its polarizability parallel to the axis gets
non-zero contribution only from the $m=0$ azimuth mode. This feature in
conjunction with the property that the $m=0$ mode separates into transverse
electric and transverse magnetic modes allows the evaluation of Casimir-Polder
energies for axially symmetric systems in a relatively easy manner.
