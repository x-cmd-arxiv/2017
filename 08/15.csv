method to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images
of the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping
effect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal
studies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the
interaction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this
work is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three
and more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient
vectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part
of the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual
particle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the
performance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the
simulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle
image for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the
maximum error smaller than 2 nm for 5.53 {\mu}m silica particles in contact
condition.

the magnetic ground state for both the iron-telluride and BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O
families of superconductors. Double-stripe order is captured within a
$J_1-J_2-J_3$ Heisenberg model in the regime $J_3 \gg J_2 \gg J_1$.
Intriguingly, besides breaking spin-rotational symmetry, the ground state
manifold has three additional Ising degrees of freedom associated with
bond-ordering. Via their coupling to the lattice, they give rise to an
orthorhombic distortion and to two non-uniform lattice distortions with
wave-vector $(\pi, \pi)$. Because the ground state is four-fold degenerate,
modulo rotations in spin space, only two of these Ising bond order parameters
are independent. Here we introduce an effective field theory to treat all Ising
order parameters, as well as magnetic order, and solve it within a large-$N$
limit. All three transitions, corresponding to the condensations of two Ising
bond order parameters and one magnetic order parameter are simultaneous and
first order in three dimensions, but lower dimensionality, or equivalently
weaker interlayer coupling, and weaker magnetoelastic coupling can split the
three transitions, and in some cases allows for two separate Ising phase
transitions above the magnetic one.

two different ways how the layer spacing of the particles in the smectic A

decrease or increase depending on the aspect ratio and flexibility. For the
smectic B and the crystalline phases, increasing the concentration always
decreases the layer spacing. We find that the layer spacing jumps to a larger

options, be dealt with using an interface-tracking approach with the
Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized-Space-Time (DSD/SST) formulation. A
difficult issue that is connected with this type of approach is the
determination of a suitable coupling mechanism between the fluid velocity at
the boundary and the displacement of the boundary mesh nodes. In order to avoid
large mesh distortions, one goal is to keep the nodal movements as small as
possible; but of course still compliant with the no-penetration boundary
condition. Standard displacement techniques are full velocity, velocity in a
specific coordinate direction, and velocity in normal direction. In this work,
we investigate how the interface-tracking approach can be combined with
isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization. If NURBS basis functions
of sufficient order are used for both the geometry and the solution, both a
continuous normal vector as well as the velocity are available on the entire
boundary. This circumstance allows the weak imposition of the no-penetration
boundary condition. We compare this option with an alternative that relies on
strong imposition at discrete points. Furthermore, we examine several coupling
methods between the fluid equations, boundary conditions, and equations for the
adjustment of interior control point positions.

stations that have a similar pickup and drop-off profiles during weekdays and
weekends. We provide the temporal profile of the center of each cluster which
can be used as a simple and practical approach for approximating the number of
pickups and drop-offs of the stations. We also define two indices based on
stations' shortages and surpluses that reflect the degree of balancing aid a
station needs. These indices can help stakeholders improve the quality of the
bike-share user experience in at-least two ways. It can act as a complement to
balancing optimization efforts, and it can identify stations that need
expansion. We mine the District of Columbia's regional bike-share data and
discuss the findings of this data set. We examine the bike-share system during
different quarters of the year and during both peak and non-peak hours.
Findings reflect that on weekdays most of the pickups and drop-offs happen
during the morning and evening peaks whereas on weekends pickups and drop-offs
are spread out throughout the day. We also show that throughout the day, more
than 40% of the stations are relatively self-balanced. Not worrying about these
stations during ordinary days can allow the balancing efforts to focus on a
fewer stations and therefore potentially improve the efficiency of the
balancing optimization models.

was combined with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and an

However, taking a quick shot frequently yields a blurry result due to unwanted
camera shake during recording or moving objects in the scene. Removing these
artifacts from the blurry recordings is a highly ill-posed problem as neither
the sharp image nor the motion blur kernel is known. Propagating information
between multiple consecutive blurry observations can help restore the desired
sharp image or video. Solutions for blind deconvolution based on neural
networks rely on a massive amount of ground-truth data which is hard to
acquire. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to produce a
significant amount of realistic training data and introduce a novel recurrent
network architecture to deblur frames taking temporal information into account,
which can efficiently handle arbitrary spatial and temporal input sizes. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach in a comprehensive comparison on a

semiconductor with a direct, layer-dependent bandgap in energy corresponding to
the spectral range from the visible to the mid-infrared (mid-IR), as well as
many other attractive optoelectronic attributes. It is, therefore, a very
promising material for various optoelectronic applications, particularly in the
important mid-IR range. While mid-IR technology has been advancing rapidly,
both photodetection and electro-optic modulation in the mid-IR rely on
narrow-band compound semiconductors, which are difficult and expensive to
integrate with the ubiquitous silicon photonics. For mid-IR photodetection,
black phosphorus has been proven to be a viable alternative. Here, we
demonstrate electro-optic modulation of mid-IR absorption in few-layer black
phosphorus under field applied by an electrostatic gate. Our experimental and
theoretical results find that, within the doping range obtainable in our
samples, the quantum confined Franz-Keldysh effect is the dominant mechanism of
electro-optic modulation. Spectroscopic study on samples with varying thickness
reveals strong layer-dependence in the inter-band transition between different
sub-bands. Our results show black phosphorus is a very promising material to
realizing efficient mid-IR modulators.

We show that light rings always come in pairs, one being a saddle point and the
other a local extremum of an effective potential. This result follows from a
topological argument based on the Brouwer degree of a continuous map, with no
assumptions on the spacetime dynamics, and hence it is applicable to any metric

a stable light ring) if the energy-momentum tensor satisfies the null energy

polynomial-time approximation algorithms, subexponential-time algorithms, and
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. The questions, which have been asked
several times (e.g., [Marx08, FGMS12, DF13]), are whether there is a
non-trivial FPT-approximation algorithm for the Maximum Clique (Clique) and
Minimum Dominating Set (DomSet) problems parameterized by the size of the
optimal solution. In particular, letting $\text{OPT}$ be the optimum and $N$ be
the size of the input, is there an algorithm that runs in
$t(\text{OPT})\text{poly}(N)$ time and outputs a solution of size
$f(\text{OPT})$, for any functions $t$ and $f$ that are independent of $N$ (for
Clique, we want $f(\text{OPT})=\omega(1)$)?
  In this paper, we show that both Clique and DomSet admit no non-trivial
FPT-approximation algorithm, i.e., there is no
$o(\text{OPT})$-FPT-approximation algorithm for Clique and no
$f(\text{OPT})$-FPT-approximation algorithm for DomSet, for any function $f$
(e.g., this holds even if $f$ is the Ackermann function). In fact, our results
imply something even stronger: The best way to solve Clique and DomSet, even
approximately, is to essentially enumerate all possibilities. Our results hold
under the Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Dinur16, MR16], which
states that no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable
3SAT formula and one which is not even $(1 - \epsilon)$-satisfiable for some
constant $\epsilon > 0$.
  Besides Clique and DomSet, we also rule out non-trivial FPT-approximation for
Maximum Balanced Biclique, Maximum Subgraphs with Hereditary Properties, and
Maximum Induced Matching in bipartite graphs. Additionally, we rule out
$k^{o(1)}$-FPT-approximation algorithm for Densest $k$-Subgraph although this
ratio does not yet match the trivial $O(k)$-approximation algorithm.

rate $\Gamma$ for the $b$-quark, using mass-independent renormalization. To
finite order of perturbation theory the series for $\Gamma$ will depend on the
unphysical renormalization scale parameter $\mu$ and on the particular choice
of mass-independent renormalization scheme; these dependencies will only be
removed after summing the series to all orders. In this paper we show that all
explicit $\mu$-dependence of $\Gamma$, through powers of ln$(\mu)$, can be
summed by using the renormalization group equation. We then find that this
explicit $\mu$-dependence can be combined together with the implicit
$\mu$-dependence of $\Gamma$ (through powers of both the running coupling
$a(\mu)$ and the running $b$-quark mass $m(\mu)$) to yield a $\mu$-independent
perturbative expansion for $\Gamma$ in terms of $a(\mu)$ and $m(\mu)$ both
evaluated at a renormalization scheme independent mass scale $I\!\!M$ which is
fixed in terms of either the ""$\overline{MS}$ mass"" $\overline{m}_b$ of the $b$
quark or its pole mass $m_{pole}$. At finite order the resulting perturbative
expansion retains a degree of arbitrariness associated with the particular
choice of mass-independent renormalization scheme. We use the coefficients
$c_i$ and $g_i$ of the perturbative expansions of the renormalization group
functions $\beta(a)$ and $\gamma(a)$, associated with $a(\mu)$ and $m(\mu)$
respectively, to characterize the remaining renormalization scheme
arbitrariness of $\Gamma$. We further show that all terms in the expansion of
$\Gamma$ can be written in terms of the $c_i$ and $g_i$ coefficients and a set
of renormalization scheme independent parameters $\tau_i$.

For such data the system process is typically multi-dimensional consisting of
coupled Markov processes, where each component corresponds to a different
characterisation of the population, such as age group, gender or breeding
status. The associated system process equations describe the biological
mechanisms under which the system evolves over time. However, there is often
limited information in the count data alone to sensibly estimate demographic

these models to the data can be challenging, especially if the state-space

simulations. In similarity with systems which are far from equilibrium but near
the onset of jamming [O'Hern et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 165702 (2004)],
we find that the relaxation is characterized by two time-scales: the decay of
long-wavelength (slow) fluctuations of potential energy is controlled by the
the slope $[\partial (G/N)/\partial \phi]$ of the Gibbs free energy ($G$) at a
unique value of per particle potential energy $\phi = \phi_{mid}$. The
short-wavelength (fast) fluctuations are controlled by the bath temperature
$T$. The relaxation of the supercooled liquid is initiated with a dynamical
crossover after which the potential energy fluctuations are biased towards
values progressively lesser than $\phi_{mid}$. The dynamical crossover leads to
the change of time-scale, i.e., the decay of long-wavelength potential energy
fluctuations (intermediate relaxation). Because of the condition [$\partial^2
(G/N)/\partial \phi^2 = 0$] at $\phi = \phi_{mid}$, the slope $[\partial
(G/N)/\partial \phi]$ has a unique value and governs the intermediate stage of
relaxation, which ends just after the crossover. In the subsequent stage, there
is a relatively rapid crystallization due to lack of long-wavelength
fluctuations and the instability at $\phi_{mid}$, i.e., the condition that $G$
decreases as configurations with potential energies lower than $\phi_{mid}$ are
accessed. The dynamical crossover point and the associated change in the
time-scale of fluctuations is found to be consistent with the previous studies.

PER",,"10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020110",,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The physics community explores and explains the physical world through a
blend of theoretical and experimental studies. The future of physics as a
discipline depends on training of students in both the theoretical and
experimental aspects of the field. However, while student learning within
lecture courses has been the subject of extensive research, lab courses remain
relatively under-studied. In particular, there is little, if any, data
available that addresses the effectiveness of physics lab courses at
encouraging students to recognize the nature and importance of experimental
physics within the discipline as a whole. To address this gap, we present the
first large-scale, national study ($N_{institutions}=75$ and
$N_{students}=7167$) of undergraduate physics lab courses through analysis of
students' responses to a research-validated assessment designed to investigate
students' beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. We find that
students often enter and leave physics lab courses with ideas about
experimental physics as practiced in their courses that are inconsistent with
the views of practicing experimental physicists, and this trend holds at both
the introductory and upper-division levels. Despite this inconsistency, we find
that both introductory and upper-division students are able to accurately
predict the expert-like response even in cases where their views about
experimentation in their lab courses disagree. These finding have implications
for the recruitment, retention, and adequate preparation of students in
physics.

quantum-mechanical crystalline insulators, higher multipole bulk moments
manifest themselves by the presence of boundary-localized moments of lower

are quantized, and their boundary signatures are fractionalized. These

of these phases is described by ""nested"" Wilson loops, which reflect the
bulk-boundary correspondence in a way that makes evident a hierarchical
classification of the multipole moments. Just as a varying dipole generates
charge pumping, a varying quadrupole generates dipole pumping, and a varying
octupole generates quadrupole pumping. For non-trivial adiabatic cycles, the
transport of these moments is quantized. An analysis of these interconnected
phenomena leads to the conclusion that a new kind of Chern-type insulator
exists, which has chiral, hinge-localized modes in 3D. We provide the minimal

path (MFP) for hydrogen ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization. We
directly measure the MFP by averaging the distance 1 Ry photons travel before
reaching an optical depth of unity along random lines-of-sight. During
reionization the free paths tend to end in neutral gas with densities near the
cosmic mean, while after reionizaton the end points tend to be overdense but
highly ionized. Despite the increasing importance of discrete, over-dense
systems, the cumulative contribution of systems with $N_{\rm{HI}} \lesssim
10^{16.5}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ suffices to drive the MFP at $z \approx 6$, while at
earlier times higher column densities are more important. After reionization
the typical size of HI systems is close to the local Jeans length, but during
reionization it is much larger. The mean free path for photons originating
close to galaxies, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$, is much smaller than the cosmic MFP. After
reionization this enhancement can remain significant up to starting distances
of $\sim 1$ comoving Mpc. During reionization, however, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$ for
distances $\sim 10^2 - 10^3$ comoving kpc typically exceeds the cosmic MFP.
These findings have important consequences for models that interpret the
intergalactic MFP as the distance escaped ionizing photons can travel from
galaxies before being absorbed and may cause them to under-estimate the
required escape fraction from galaxies, and/or the required emissivity of
ionizing photons after reionization.

stacked frustrated kagome antiferromagnets, naturally available in various real
materials. Most crucially, the Weyl nodes in the current system occur at the
lowest excitation and possess a topological (anomalous) thermal Hall effect,
therefore they are experimentally accessible at low temperatures due to the
population effect of bosonic quasiparticles. In stark contrast to other
magnetic systems, the current Weyl nodes do not rely on time-reversal symmetry
breaking by the magnetic order. Rather, they result from explicit
macroscopically broken time reversal symmetry by the scalar spin chirality of
noncoplanar spin textures, and can be generalized to chiral spin liquid states.
Moreover, the scalar spin chirality gives a real space Berry curvature which is
not available in previously studied magnetic Weyl systems. We show the
existence of magnon arc surface states connecting projected Weyl magnon nodes
on the surface Brillouin zone. We also uncover the first realization of
triply-degenerate nodal magnon point in the non-collinear regime with zero

that the dark matter associated with one of the cluster's central galaxies may
be offset. The new spectroscopic data enable better subtraction of foreground
light, and better identification of multiple background images. The inferred
distribution of dark matter is consistent with being centered on the galaxies,
as expected by LCDM. Each galaxy's dark matter also appears to be symmetric.
Whilst we do not find an offset between mass and light (suggestive of
self-interacting dark matter) as previously reported, the numerical simulations
that have been performed to calibrate Abell 3827 indicate that offsets and

satellites found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (together
these surveys cover nearly half the sky) to estimate the total luminosity
function of satellites down to $M_{\rm V}=0$. We apply a new Bayesian inference
method in which we assume that the radial distribution of satellites
independently of absolute magnitude follows that of subhaloes selected
according to their peak maximum circular velocity. We find that there should be
at least $124^{+40}_{-27}$ (68 per cent CL, statistical error) satellites
brighter than $M_{\rm V}=0$ within $300$ kpc of the Sun. As a result of our use
of new data and better simulations, and a more robust statistical method, we
infer a much smaller population of satellites than reported in previous studies
using earlier SDSS data only; we also address an underestimation of the
uncertainties in earlier work by accounting for stochastic effects. We find
that the inferred number of faint satellites depends only weakly on the assumed
mass of the MW halo and we provide scaling relations to extend our results to
different assumed halo masses and outer radii. We predict that half of our

probability distribution of a simple low-dimensional noise process into the

biological networks operate along similar principles to implement a
probabilistic model of the environment through transformations of intrinsic
noise processes. The intrinsic neural and synaptic noise processes in
biological networks, however, are quite different from the noise processes used
in current abstract generative networks. This, together with the discrete

several difficulties when using recent generative modeling frameworks to train
biologically motivated models. In this paper, we show that a biologically
motivated model based on multi-layer winner-take-all (WTA) circuits and
stochastic synapses admits an approximate analytical description. This allows
us to use the proposed networks in a variational learning setting where
stochastic backpropagation is used to optimize a lower bound on the data log
likelihood, thereby learning a generative model of the data. We illustrate the

interdiction problem (SNIP). In this problem, a defender interdicts arcs on a
directed graph to minimize an attacker's probability of undetected traversal
through the network. The attacker's origin and destination are unknown to the
defender and assumed to be random. SNIP can be formulated as a stochastic
mixed-integer program via a deterministic equivalent formulation (DEF). As the
size of this DEF makes it impractical for solving large instances, current
approaches to solving SNIP rely on modifications of Benders decomposition. We
present two new approaches to solve SNIP. First, we introduce a new DEF that is
significantly more compact than the standard DEF. Second, we propose a new
path-based formulation of SNIP. The number of constraints required to define
this formulation grows exponentially with the size of the network, but the
model can be solved via delayed constraint generation. We present valid
inequalities for this path-based formulation which are dependent on the
structure of the interdicted arc probabilities. We propose a branch-and-cut
(BC) algorithm to solve this new SNIP formulation. Computational results
demonstrate that directly solving the more compact SNIP formulation and this BC
algorithm both provide an improvement over a state-of-the-art implementation of

to have flat faint-end slopes. I find that a fairly simple model in which the
position of the knee in the mass function of each individual group is allowed
to vary is able to account for both of these observations. If this model
reflects reality, the ALFALFA result points to an interesting `conspiracy'
whereby the differing group HIMFs always sum up to form global HIMFs with the
same faint-end slope in different environments. More generally, this result
implies that global environmental HIMFs do not necessarily reflect the HIMFs in
individual groups belonging to that environment, and cannot be used to directly
measure variations in group-specific HIMFs with environment.

resonators have led to the development of single photon counters that rely on
kinetic inductance for their operation. While concurrent progress in additive
manufacturing, `3D printing', opens up a previously inaccessible design space
for waveguide resonators. In this manuscript, we present results from the first
synthesis of these two technologies in a titanium, aluminum, vanadium
(Ti-6Al-4V) superconducting radio frequency resonator which exploits a design
unattainable through conventional fabrication means. We find that Ti-6Al-4V has
two distinct superconducting transition temperatures observable in heat
capacity measurements. The higher transition temperature is in agreement with
DC resistance measurements. While the lower transition temperature, not
previously known in literature, is consistent with the observed temperature
dependence of the superconducting microwave surface impedance. From the surface
reactance, we extract a London penetration depth of $8\pm3{\mu}$m - roughly an
order of magnitude larger than other titanium alloys and several orders of
magnitude larger than other conventional elemental superconductors. This large
London penetration depth suggests that Ti-6Al-4V may be a suitable material for
high kinetic inductance applications such as single photon counting or
parametric amplification used in quantum computing.

the formation of graphene surface plasmons when a charge is in motion either

electron-energy loss (EEL) spectrum of the electron is computed, showing that
the resonances in the spectrum are linked to the frequency of the graphene
surface plasmons. In the second case, we discuss the formation of plasmonic
wakes due to the dragging of the surface plasmons induced by the motion of the
charge. This effect is similar to Coulomb drag between two electron gases at a
distance from each other. We derive simple expressions for the electrostatic
potential induced by the moving charge on graphene. We find an analytical
expression for the angle of the plasmonic wake valid in two opposite regimes.
We show that there is a transition from a Mach-type wake at high speeds to a
Kelvin-type wake at low ones and identify the Froude number for plasmonic
wakes. We show that the Froude number can be controlled externally tunning both
the Fermi energy in graphene and the dielectric function of the environment, a
situation with no parallel in ship wakes.
  Using EEL we propose a source of graphene plasmons, based on a graphene drum
built in a metallic waveguide and activated by an electron beam created by the
tip of an electronic microscope.

is a physical time over which quantum fields at all values of space and

opposed to an ensemble average. It is further hypothesized that the Langevin
time also paces the motion of particles through coordinate time and is equal to
the coordinate time of the present hypersurface in the frame of the Hubble
expansion. Despite having a preferred frame, special relativity continues to
hold in this formulation as a dynamical symmetry due to the presumed Lorentz
invariance of interactions. The measurement process becomes an integral part of
the theory and is realized as a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The
continuously fluctuating history of fields, characteristic of having two times,
and the switch from ensemble averages to time averages allows for logical and
straightforward explanations of many quantum measurement paradoxes. The
fluctuating history also evades hidden-variable prohibitions allowing an

(TGE) to estimate the power spectrum of the diffuse sky signal. The TGE has
three novel features. First, the estimator uses gridded visibilities to
estimate the power spectrum which is computationally much faster than
individually correlating the visibilities. Second, a positive noise bias is
removed by subtracting the auto-correlation of the visibilities which is
responsible for the noise bias. Third, the estimator allows us to taper the
field of view so as to suppress the contribution from the sources in the outer
regions and the sidelobes of the telescope's primary beam. We first consider
the two dimensional (2D) TGE to estimate the angular power spectrum $C_{\ell}$.
We have also extended the TGE to estimate the three dimensional (3D) power
spectrum $P({\bf k})$ of the cosmological 21-cm signal. Analytic formulas are
presented for predicting the variance of the binned power spectrum. Both the
estimators and their variance predictions are validated using simulations of
$150 \, {\rm MHz}$ GMRT observations. We have applied the 2D TGE to estimate
$C_{\ell}$ using visibility data for two of the fields observed by TIFR GMRT

design.
  The first is the Florida second election (FSE) option, offered to public

convert from a defined contribution (DC) plan to a defined benefit (DB) plan at
a time of their choosing. The cost of the switch was assessed in terms of the
ABO (Accrued Benefit Obligation), which is the expected present value of the
accrued DB pension at the time of the switch. If the ABO was greater than the
DC account, the employee was required to fund the difference.
  The second is the DB Underpin option, also known as a floor offset, under
which the employee participates in a DC plan, but with a guaranteed minimum
benefit based on a traditional DB formula.
  The third option can be considered a variation on each of the first two. We
remove the requirement from the FSE option for employees to fund any shortfall
at the switching date. The resulting option is very similar to the DB underpin,
but with the possibility of early exercise. Since we assume that exercise is
only permitted at discrete, annual intervals, this option is a Bermudan
variation on the DB Underpin.
  We adopt an arbitrage-free pricing methodology to value the option. We
analyse and value the optimal switching strategy for the employee by
constructing an exercise frontier, and illustrate numerically the difference
between the FSE, DB Underpin and Bermudan DB Underpin options.

at slightly longer than double this at approximately 111 days. There appears to
be a long-term change in the shape of the modulation near 111 days, which may

size as a function of the maximum degree $\Delta$. In this paper we explore the
complexity of edge coloring in the LOCAL model in different palette size
regimes.
  1. We simplify the \emph{round elimination} technique of Brandt et al. and
prove that $(2\Delta-2)$-edge coloring requires $\Omega(\log_\Delta \log n)$
time w.h.p. and $\Omega(\log_\Delta n)$ time deterministically, even on trees.
The simplified technique is based on two ideas: the notion of an irregular
running time and some general observations that transform weak lower bounds
into stronger ones.
  2. We give a randomized edge coloring algorithm that can use palette sizes as
small as $\Delta + \tilde{O}(\sqrt{\Delta})$, which is a natural barrier for
randomized approaches. The running time of the algorithm is at most
$O(\log\Delta \cdot T_{LLL})$, where $T_{LLL}$ is the complexity of a
permissive version of the constructive Lovasz local lemma.
  3. We develop a new distributed Lovasz local lemma algorithm for
tree-structured dependency graphs, which leads to a $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge
coloring algorithm for trees running in $O(\log\log n)$ time. This algorithm
arises from two new results: a deterministic $O(\log n)$-time LLL algorithm for
tree-structured instances, and a randomized $O(\log\log n)$-time graph
shattering method for breaking the dependency graph into independent $O(\log
n)$-size LLL instances.
  4. A natural approach to computing $(\Delta+1)$-edge colorings (Vizing's
theorem) is to extend partial colorings by iteratively re-coloring parts of the
graph. We prove that this approach may be viable, but in the worst case
requires recoloring subgraphs of diameter $\Omega(\Delta\log n)$. This stands
in contrast to distributed algorithms for Brooks' theorem, which exploit the
existence of $O(\log_\Delta n)$-length augmenting paths.

existence of a unique specific QPO excitation radius. Consequently, there is a
simple behaviour of dimensionless frequency $M\times\nu_{U}(a)$ represented by
a single continuous function having solely one maximum close to $a\gtrsim1$.
Only one of these models is compatible with the expectation of $a\gtrsim 1$.

gained a lot of attention from academia as well as companies such as Facebook,
Twitter and Google. In this paper, we examine the robustness of video analysis
algorithms in adversarial settings. Specifically, we propose targeted attacks
on two fundamental classes of video analysis algorithms, namely video
classification and shot detection. We show that an adversary can subtly
manipulate a video in such a way that a human observer would perceive the
content of the original video, but the video analysis algorithm will return the
adversary's desired outputs.
  We then apply the attacks on the recently released Google Cloud Video
Intelligence API. The API takes a video file and returns the video labels
(objects within the video), shot changes (scene changes within the video) and
shot labels (description of video events over time). Through experiments, we
show that the API generates video and shot labels by processing only the first
frame of every second of the video. Hence, an adversary can deceive the API to
output only her desired video and shot labels by periodically inserting an
image into the video at the rate of one frame per second. We also show that the
pattern of shot changes returned by the API can be mostly recovered by an
algorithm that compares the histograms of consecutive frames. Based on our
equivalent model, we develop a method for slightly modifying the video frames,
in order to deceive the API into generating our desired pattern of shot
changes. We perform extensive experiments with different videos and show that
our attacks are consistently successful across videos with different
characteristics. At the end, we propose introducing randomness to video
analysis algorithms as a countermeasure to our attacks.

Christodoulou, we study the evolution of tidal energy for the motion of two
gravitating incompressible fluid balls with free boundaries obeying the
Euler-Poisson equations. The orbital energy is defined as the mechanical energy
of the two bodies' center of mass. According to the classical analysis of
Kepler and Newton, when the fluids are replaced by point masses, the conic
curve describing the trajectories of the masses is a hyperbola when the orbital
energy is positive and an ellipse when the orbital energy is negative. The
orbital energy is conserved in the case of point masses. If the point masses
are initially very far, then the orbital energy is positive, corresponding to
hyperbolic motion. However, in the motion of fluid bodies the orbital energy is
no longer conserved because part of the conserved energy is used in deforming
the boundaries of the bodies. In this case the total energy
$\tilde{\mathcal{E}}$ can be decomposed into a sum
$\tilde{\mathcal{E}}:=\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{orbital}}}}+\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{tidal}}}}$,
with $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{tidal}}}}$ measuring the energy used in
deforming the boundaries, such that if
$\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{orbital}}}}<-c<0$ for some absolute constant
$c>0$, then the orbit of the bodies must be bounded. In this work we prove that
under appropriate conditions on the initial configuration of the system, the
fluid boundaries and velocity remain regular up to the point of the first
closest approach in the orbit, and that the tidal energy
$\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{tidal}}}}$ can be made arbitrarily large
relative to the total energy $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}$. In particular under these
conditions $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}_{{\mathrm{orbital}}}}$, which is initially
positive, becomes negative before the point of the first closest approach.

(CF), which is based on the idea that similar users are interested in similar
items. Most model-based approaches to CF seek to train a
machine-learning/data-mining model based on sparse data; the model is then used
to provide recommendations. While most of the proposed approaches are effective
for small-size situations, the combinatorial nature of the problem makes it
impractical for medium-to-large instances. In this work we present a novel
approach to CF that works by training a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) on
corrupted baskets, i.e., baskets from which one or more items have been
removed. The DAE is then forced to learn to reconstruct the original basket
given its corrupted input. Due to recent advancements in optimization and other
technologies for training neural-network models (such as DAE), the proposed
method results in a scalable and practical approach to CF. The contribution of
this work is twofold: (1) to identify missing items in observed baskets and,
thus, directly providing a CF model; and, (2) to construct a generative model
of baskets which may be used, for instance, in simulation analysis or as part
of a more complex analytical method.

details than the quasi-particle (QP) spectrum, which suggests that the
experimental investigation of satellites could yield additional information
beyond the usual studies of the band structure. In particular, a comparison to
the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) shows that the satellites are influenced by
the crystal environment, although the crystal potential in sodium is weak.
Moreover, the temperature dependence of the lattice constant is reflected in
the position of the satellites. Details of the screening also play an important
role; in particular, the contribution of transitions from 2s and 2p semi-core
levels influence the satellites, but not the QP. Moreover, inclusion of
contributions to the screening beyond the RPA has an effect on the satellites.
Finally, we elucidate the importance of the coupling of electrons and holes by
comparing the results of the time-ordered (TOC) and the retarded (RC) cumulant
expansion approximations. Again, we find small but noticeable differences.
Since all the small effects add up, our most advanced calculation yields a
satellite position which is improved with respect to previous calculations by
almost one eV. This stresses the fact that the calculation of satellites is
much more delicate than the calculation of a QP band structure.

efficiency control to networked vehicle control. The lack of predictable
interference control in existing mechanisms of inter-vehicle communications,
however, makes them incapable of ensuring predictable communication
reliability. For predictable interference control, we propose the
Cyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework that leverages the PRK interference
model and addresses the challenges of vehicle mobility to PRK-based scheduling.
In particular, CPS leverage physical locations of vehicles to define the gPRK
interference model, a geometric approximation of the PRK model, for effective
interference relation estimation, and CPS leverages cyber-physical structures
of vehicle traffic flows (particularly, spatiotemporal interference correlation
as well as macro- and micro-scopic vehicle dynamics) for effective use of the
gPRK model. Through experimental analysis with high-fidelity ns-3 and SUMO
simulation, we observe that CPS enables predictable reliability while achieving
high throughput and low delay in communication. To the best of our knowledge,
CPS is the first field deployable method that ensures predictable interference
control and thus reliability in inter-vehicle communications.

the action, etc. Different verbs have different roles (e.g. attacking has
weapon), and each role can take on many possible values (nouns). We propose a
model based on Graph Neural Networks that allows us to efficiently capture
joint dependencies between roles using neural networks defined on a graph.
Experiments with different graph connectivities show that our approach that
propagates information between roles significantly outperforms existing work,
as well as multiple baselines. We obtain roughly 3-5% improvement over previous
work in predicting the full situation. We also provide a thorough qualitative
analysis of our model and influence of different roles in the verbs.

common classifiers, yet its performance competes with the most complex

measuring the distance or similarity between the tested examples and the

to be used for the KNN classifier among a large number of distance and
similarity measures available? This review attempts to answer this question
through evaluating the performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall)
of the KNN using a large number of distance measures, tested on a number of
real-world datasets, with and without adding different levels of noise. The
experimental results show that the performance of KNN classifier depends
significantly on the distance used, and the results showed large gaps between
the performances of different distances. We found that a recently proposed
non-convex distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing
to the other tested distances. In addition, the performance of the KNN with
this top performing distance degraded only about $20\%$ while the noise level
reaches $90\%$, this is true for most of the distances used as well. This means
that the KNN classifier using any of the top $10$ distances tolerate noise to a
certain degree. Moreover, the results show that some distances are less
affected by the added noise comparing to other distances.

diagonalization type methods for solving Kohn-Sham density functional theory
(KSDFT). One example is the pole expansion and selected inversion (PEXSI)
method, which approximates the Fermi operator by rational matrix functions and
reduces the computational complexity to at most quadratic scaling for solving
KSDFT. Unlike diagonalization type methods, the chemical potential often cannot
be directly read off from the result of a single step of evaluation of the
Fermi operator. Hence multiple evaluations are needed to be sequentially
performed to compute the chemical potential to ensure the correct number of
electrons within a given tolerance. This hinders the performance of FOE methods
in practice. In this paper we develop an efficient and robust strategy to
determine the chemical potential in the context of the PEXSI method. The main
idea of the new method is not to find the exact chemical potential at each
self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration iteration, but to dynamically and
rigorously update the upper and lower bounds for the true chemical potential,
so that the chemical potential reaches its convergence along the SCF iteration.
Instead of evaluating the Fermi operator for multiple times sequentially, our
method uses a two-level strategy that evaluates the Fermi operators in
parallel. In the regime of full parallelization, the wall clock time of each
SCF iteration is always close to the time for one single evaluation of the
Fermi operator, even when the initial guess is far away from the converged
solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method using examples
with metallic and insulating characters, as well as results from ab initio
molecular dynamics.

radiance - magnetic flux power-law relationship ($I\propto\Phi^{\alpha}$) to
the AIA 335 \AA\ passband, and the Fe XVIII 93.93 \AA\ spectral line in the 94
\AA\ passband. We find that the total unsigned magnetic flux divided by the
polarity separation ($\Phi/D$) is a better indicator of radiance for the Fe
XVIII line with a slope of $\alpha=3.22\pm0.03$. We then use these results to
test our current understanding of magnetic flux evolution and coronal heating.
We use magnetograms from the simulated decay of these active regions produced
by the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model as boundary conditions for
potential extrapolations of the magnetic field in the corona. We then model the
hydrodynamics of each individual field line with the Enthalpy-based Thermal
Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model with steady heating scaled as the ratio of the
average field strength and the length ($\bar{B}/L$) and render the Fe XVIII and
335 \AA\ emission. We find that steady heating is able to partially reproduce
the magnitudes and slopes of the EUV radiance - magnetic flux relationships and
discuss how impulsive heating can help reconcile the discrepancies. This study
demonstrates that combined models of magnetic flux transport, magnetic topology

  technologies",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation: Seed filtering is critical in DNA read mapping, a process where
billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped onto a
reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor. Read mappers 1)
quickly generate possible mapping locations (i.e., seeds) for each read, 2)
extract reference sequences at each of the mapping locations, and then 3) check
similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a
computationally expensive dynamic programming algorithm (alignment) to
determine the origin of the read. Location filters come into play before
alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would have deemed a poor
match. The ideal location filter would discard all poor matching locations
prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on poor alignments.
  Results: We propose a novel filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to
exploit emerging 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a
stacked logic layer, enabling processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly
filters locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained
segments of the reference genome and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory
operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our
evaluations show that for 5% error acceptance rates, GRIM-Filter eliminates
5.59x-6.41x more false negatives and exhibits end-to-end speedups of
1.81x-3.65x compared to mappers employing the best previous filtering
algorithm.

with speed $v_{i}$, there exists a critical impact velocity of penetration
$v_{C}$. For the droplet with $v_{i}<v_{C}$, it flows with the soap film after
the impact whereas with $v_{i}>v_{C}$, it tunnels through. In all cases, the
film remains intact despite the fact that the droplet radius ($R_{0}=26\,\mu
m$) is much greater than the film thickness ($0<h\lesssim10\,{\mu}m$). The
critical velocity $v_{C}$ was measured as a function of $h$, and interestingly
$v_{C}$ approaches an asymptotic value $v_{C0}\simeq520\,$ cm/s in the limit
$h\rightarrow0$. This indicates that in addition to an inertial effect, a
deformation or stretching energy of the film is required for penetration.
Quantitatively, we found that this deformation energy corresponds to the
creation of $\sim14$ times of the cross-sectional area of the droplet ($14\pi

reduced system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes stable
configurations of multiple co-rotating vortices (vortex crystals). This
description is found to be quite accurate quantitatively especially in the case
of multiple vortices. In the limit of many vortices, BECs are known to form
vortex crystal structures, whereby vortices tend to arrange themselves in a
hexagonal-like spatial configuration. Using our asymptotic reduction, we derive
the effective vortex crystal density and its radius. We also obtain an
asymptotic estimate for the maximum number of vortices as a function of
rotation rate. We extend considerations to the anisotropic trap case,
confirming that a pair of vortices lying on the long (short) axis is linearly
stable (unstable), corroborating the ODE reduction results with full PDE
simulations. We then further investigate the many-vortex limit in the case of
strong anisotropic potential. In this limit, the vortices tend to align

Graphlets are now commonly used to quantify local and global topology of
networks in the field. Methods exist to exhaustively enumerate all graphlets
(and their orbits) in large networks as efficiently as possible using orbit
counting equations. However, the number of graphlets in $G$ is exponential in
both the number of nodes and edges in $G$. Enumerating them all is already
unacceptably expensive on existing large networks, and the problem will only
get worse as networks continue to grow in size and density. Here we introduce
an efficient method designed to aid statistical sampling of graphlets up to
size $k=8$ from a large network. We define graphettes as the generalization of
graphlets allowing for disconnected graphlets. Given a particular (undirected)
graphette $g$, we introduce the idea of the canonical graphette $\mathcal K(g)$
as a representative member of the isomorphism group $Iso(g)$ of $g$. We compute
the mapping $\mathcal K$, in the form of a lookup table, from all
$2^{k(k-1)/2}$ undirected graphettes $g$ of size $k\le 8$ to their canonical
representatives $\mathcal K(g)$, as well as the permutation that transforms $g$
to $\mathcal K(g)$. We also compute all automorphism orbits for each canonical
graphette. Thus, given any $k\le 8$ nodes in a graph $G$, we can in constant
time infer which graphette it is, as well as which orbit each of the $k$ nodes
belongs to. Sampling a large number $N$ of such $k$-sets of nodes provides an
approximation of both the distribution of graphlets and orbits across $G$, and
the orbit degree vector at each node.

international collaborations, which enables a fair evaluation of national

three socio-economic indices: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Human
Development Index (HDI) and the Education Index (EI). Despite some progress,
there remains a backlog of LA compared to the dominant countries, which cannot
be explained solely by economic deficiency. In general, a detailed correlation
between the socio-economic and scientific evolution is not obvious.

is the convolution of this source with multiple channel responses, each of

convolution, first proposed and analyzed in the 1990s, provide an elegant
mathematical framework for attacking this problem. However, these now classical
methods are very sensitive to noise, especially when working from relatively
small sample sizes.
  In this paper, we show that a linear subspace model on the coefficients of
the impulse responses of the channels can make this problem well-posed. We
derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the generic subspace model by analyzing
the spectral gap of the cross-correlation matrix of the channels relative to
the perturbation introduced by noise. Numerical results show that this modified

outperforms other competing methods for multichannel blind deconvolution.

Gaussian walk compared to the minimum of the Brownian motion obtained when
interpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, both up to the same time

measurement record that noisily tracks the observable. For a classical process
such noise may be reduced to recover an average signal by minimizing the mean
squared error between the noisy record and a smooth dynamical estimate. We show
that for a monitored qubit this usual procedure returns unusual results. While
the record seems centered on the expectation value of the observable during
causal generation, examining the collected past record reveals that it better
approximates a moving-mean Gaussian stochastic process centered at a distinct
(smoothed) observable estimate. We show that this shifted mean converges to the
real part of a generalized weak value in the time-continuous limit without
additional postselection. We verify that this smoothed estimate minimizes the
mean squared error even for individual measurement realizations. We go on to
show that if a second observable is weakly monitored concurrently, then that
second record is consistent with the smoothed estimate of the second observable
based solely on the information contained in the first observable record.
Moreover, we show that such a smoothed estimate made from incomplete
information can still outperform estimates made using full knowledge of the
causal quantum state.

clustered, forming a narrow chain of low-mass associations that trace the
densest HI gas in the Magellanic Bridge and extend, in projection, from the SMC
to the outer disk of the LMC. The associations in our survey footprint have
ages $\lesssim 30$ Myr, masses in the range $\sim 100-1200\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and
very diffuse structures with half-light radii of up to $\sim 100$ pc. The two
most populous are strongly elliptical, and aligned to $\approx 10^{{\rm o}}$
with the axis joining the centres of the LMC and SMC. These observations
strongly suggest that the young inter-Cloud populations formed in situ, likely
due to the compression of gas stripped during the most recent close LMC-SMC
encounter. The associations lie at distances intermediate between the two
Clouds, and we find no evidence for a substantial distance gradient across the
imaged area. Finally, we identify a vast shell of young stars surrounding a
central association, that is spatially coincident with a low column density
bubble in the HI distribution. The properties of this structure are consistent
with a scenario where stellar winds and supernova explosions from massive stars
in the central cluster swept up the ambient gas into a shell, triggering a new
burst of star formation. This is a prime location for studying stellar feedback
in a relatively isolated environment.

learning architectures, however, there still exist three major challenges that
hinder the detection performance for scenes with complex compositions, multiple
salient objects, and salient objects of diverse scales. In particular, output
maps of the existing methods remain low in spatial resolution causing blurred
edges due to the stride and pooling operations, networks often neglect
descriptive statistical and handcrafted priors that have potential to
complement saliency detection results, and deep features at different layers
stay mainly desolate waiting to be effectively fused to handle multi-scale
salient objects. In this paper, we tackle these issues by a new fully
convolutional neural network that jointly learns salient edges and saliency
labels in an end-to-end fashion. Our framework first employs convolutional
layers that reformulate the detection task as a dense labeling problem, then
integrates handcrafted saliency features in a hierarchical manner into lower
and higher levels of the deep network to leverage available information for
multi-scale response, and finally refines the saliency map through dilated
convolutions by imposing context. In this way, the salient edge priors are
efficiently incorporated and the output resolution is significantly improved
while keeping the memory requirements low, leading to cleaner and sharper
object boundaries. Extensive experimental analyses on ten benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistently superior performance and
attains robustness for complex scenes in comparison to the very recent
state-of-the-art approaches.

magnetic energy stored in unneutralized currents in coronal loops is released
into energetic electrons in the impulsive phase and into mass motion in a CME.
The energy release is due to a change in current configuration effectively
reducing the net current path. A flare is driven by the electromotive force
(EMF) due to the changing magnetic flux. The EMF drives a flare-associated
current whose cross-field closure is achieved by redirection along field lines
to the chromosphere and back. The essential roles that currents play are
obscured in the ""standard"" model and are described incorrectly in circuit
models. A semi-quantitative treatment of the energy and the EMF is provided by
a multi-current model, in which the currents are constant and the change in the
current paths is described by time-dependent inductances. There is no
self-consistent model that includes the intrinsic time dependence, the EMF, the
flare-associated current and the internal energy transport during a flare. The
current, through magnetic helicity, plays an important role in a CME, with

cascades of excitation towards scales larger than the forcing scale in a
variety of contexts, from two-dimensional fluids and wave turbulence, to
geophysical flows in the presence of rotation and stratification. We briefly
discuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such
cascades. We then show that the cascade of some invariant, for example the
total energy, may be transferred through nonlinear interactions to both the
small scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This is
in contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in
the context of atmospheric and oceanic observations, direct numerical
simulations and modeling. We also show that this dual cascade of total energy
can in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic
and potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small
enough. In all cases, the potential energy flux remains small, of the order of
10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux. Finally, we demonstrate that,
in the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between potential
and kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with
strong departure at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse
cascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial frequency, and at small scales due
to unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl number is equal to
one.

non-conservative systems with dissipation. Moreover, theoretical studies of
chimera patterns have also been limited either to the non-conservative case or
to simplified models that describe the dynamics only in terms of a scalar phase
field. Here, we show for the first time explicitly that the formation of
chimera patterns can also be observed in conservative Hamiltonian systems with
nonlocal hopping in which both energy and particle number are conserved, and
where the local phase and amplitude are non-separable even in the weak coupling
regime. Effective nonlocality can be realized in a physical system with only
local coupling if different time scales exist, which we illustrate by a minimal
conservative model with an additional mediating channel. Finally, we show that
chimera patterns should be observable in ultracold atomic systems: Nonlocal
spatial hopping over up to tens of lattice sites with independently tunable
hopping strength and on-site nonlinearity can be implemented in a two-component
Bose-Einstein condensate with a spin-dependent optical lattice, where the
untrapped component serves as the matter-wave mediating field.

slowly to the target posterior distribution and we show that some of the widely

large, current online evaluation metrics for interactive systems such as search

full ground-state constrained-path Monte Carlo (CPMC) method using the
extended, attractive Hubbard model. Our results in a careful extrapolation to

derived from a space-time POD problem for statistically stationary flows and
leads to modes that each oscillate at a single frequency. This form of POD goes
back to the original work of Lumley (Stochastic tools in turbulence, Academic
Press, 1970), but has been overshadowed by a space-only form of POD since the
1990s. We clarify the relationship between these two forms of POD and show that
SPOD modes represent structures that evolve coherently in space and time while
space-only POD modes in general do not. We also establish a relationship
between SPOD and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD); we show that SPOD modes are
in fact optimally averaged DMD modes obtained from an ensemble DMD problem for
stationary flows. Accordingly, SPOD modes represent structures that are dynamic
in the same sense as DMD modes but also optimally account for the statistical
variability of turbulent flows. Finally, we establish a connection between SPOD
and resolvent analysis. The key observation is that the resolvent-mode
expansion coefficients must be regarded as statistical quantities to ensure
convergent approximations of the flow statistics. When the expansion
coefficients are uncorrelated, we show that SPOD and resolvent modes are
identical. Our theoretical results and the overall utility of SPOD are
demonstrated using two example problems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation

converges to a unique stationary ranking. In contrast to the traditional random
walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization
function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector.
Importantly, we establish how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology,
enabling the future extension in a probabilistic way. To show the rationale and
extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to rank for the
more generic n-partite graphs. BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph
structure and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses
flexibly. To illustrate its functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank
(ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two real-world applications: a
general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items, and a
personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate

Co-training is a representative paradigm of them, which trains two classifiers
separately on two sufficient and redundant views; while for the applications
where there is only one view, several successful variants of co-training with
two different classifiers on single-view data instead of two views have been

concentric growth of laminations. The model predicts a limiting size with the
sequential width variation of growth rings comparing favourably with those

present numerical results that show that for given interference thresholds of

system exhibits intermediary performance in terms of achievable capacity
compared to OFDM and FBMC-based CR systems. Interestingly, for a certain degree
of robustness of the PUs, the UF-OFDM performs equally well as FBMC.
Furthermore, the percentage rate-gain of UF-OFDM based CR system increases by a

expelled from it. We then vary the surface charge density $\sigma$ on the wall.
For $\sigma>0$ the anions remain accumulated, but for $\sigma<0$ the cations

potential drop $\Psi(\sigma)$ is nonmonotonic when the solvent interaction
parameter $\chi(T)$ exceeds a critical value $\chi_c$ determined by the

transition between two kinds of electric double layers with different $\sigma$

TCR-pMHC and LFA1-ICAM1 protein complexes. These segregate to form a special
pattern, known as the immunological synapse (IS), consisting of a central
quasi-circular domain of TCR-pMHC bonds surrounded by a peripheral domain of
LFA1-ICAM1 complexes. Insights gained from imaging studies had led to the
conclusion that the formation of the central adhesion domain in the IS is
driven by active (ATP-driven) mechanisms. Recent studies, however, suggested
that passive (thermodynamic) mechanisms may also play an important role in this
process. Here, we present a simple physical model, taking into account the
membrane-mediated thermodynamic attraction between the TCR-pMHC bonds and the
effective forces that they experience due to ATP-driven actin retrograde flow
and transport by dynein motor proteins. Monte Carlo simulations of the model
exhibit a good spatio-temporal agreement with the experimentally observed
pattern evolution of the TCR-pMHC microclusters. The agreement is lost when one
of the aggregation mechanisms is ""muted"", which helps to identify the
respective roles in the process. We conclude that actin retrograde flow drives
the centripetal motion of TCR-pMHC bonds, while the membrane-mediated
interactions facilitate microcluster formation and growth. In the absence of
dynein motors, the system evolves into a ring-shaped pattern, which highlights
the role of dynein motors in the formation of the final concentric pattern. The
interplay between the passive and active mechanisms regulates the rate of the
accumulation process, which in the absence of one them proceeds either too
quickly or slowly.

accumulated precipitation based on the monsoon seasons 2007-2014 for three
regions within northern tropical Africa. To assess the full potential of raw

postprocessing methods in form of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble
Model Output Statistics (EMOS), and verify against station and spatially
aggregated, satellite-based gridded observations. Raw ensemble forecasts are
uncalibrated, unreliable, and underperform relative to climatology,
independently of region, accumulation time, monsoon season, and ensemble.
Differences between raw ensemble and climatological forecasts are large, and
partly stem from poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. BMA and EMOS
postprocessed forecasts are calibrated, reliable, and strongly improve on the
raw ensembles, but - somewhat disappointingly - typically do not outperform
climatology. Most EPSs exhibit slight improvements over the period 2007-2014,

moderation of positrons provided by the high intensity positron source NEPOMUC.
For brightness enhancement a remoderation unit with a $100\,$nm thin Ni(100)
foil and 9.6% efficiency is applied to reduce the area of the beam spot by a
factor of 60. In this way, defect spectroscopy is enabled with a lateral
resolution of $33\,\mu$m over a large scanning range of $19\times19\,$mm$^{2}$.
Moreover, 2D defect imaging using Doppler broadening spectroscopy (DBS) is
demonstrated to be performed within exceptional short measurement times of less
than two minutes for an area of $1\times1$mm$^{2}$ ($100\times100\,\mu$m$^{2}$)
with a resolution of $250\,\mu$m ($50\,\mu$m). We studied the defect structure
in laser beam welds of the high-strength agehardened Al alloy (AlCu6Mn, EN
AW-2219 T87) by applying (coincident) DBS with unprecedented spatial
resolution. The visualization of the defect distribution revealed a sharp
transition between the raw material and the welded zone as well as a very small
heat affected zone. Vacancy-like defects and Cu rich precipitates are detected
in the as-received material and, to a lesser extent, in the transition zone of
the weld. Most notably, in the center of the weld vacancies without forming
Cu-vacancy complexes, and the dissolution of the Cu atoms in the crystal
lattice, i.e. formation of a supersaturated solution, could be clearly
identified.

natural to investigate further by asking how the signs of the coefficients of a
Brieskorn polynomial change its arc-analytic type.
  The aim of the present paper is to answer this question by giving a complete
classification of Brieskorn polynomials up to the arc-analytic equivalence. The
proof relies on an invariant of this relation whose construction is similar to
the one of Denef-Loeser motivic zeta functions.
  The classification obtained generalizes the one of Koike-Parusi\'nski in the

the three variable case up to the blow-Nash equivalence.

these tails can be generated by the bulk Comptonization (BMC) process with a
free-fall bulk region onto the compact object. We frequently observe a radio
emission (which is generated by a synchrotron-emitting outflowing electrons)
from the XRBs. We aim to study the high energy power-law tail in BMC process by
an outflowing medium. We mainly consider a collimated and conical (of opening
angle $\theta_b$ with axis perpendicular to the accretion disk) outflow for a
BMC process. We simulate the bulk Comptonized spectra by using a Monte Carlo
scheme. Out of two possible conical outflow directions i) along the surface of
the cone, ii) inside the conic region, we find that a) the randomness of
outflow directions increases with $\theta_b$, b) the emergent spectra have
power-law tail (of photon index $\Gamma$ $>$ 2 and with high energy cut-off
$E_{c}$ $>$ 200 keV) only for $\theta_b$ greater than $\sim$30 degree, while
for a collimated or a conical outflow ($\theta_b$ $<$ 30degree) these power-law
tail can be only generated when it is also found in thermal Comptonized spectra
(i.e., at sufficiently high medium temperature). We compare the GRS 1915+105
spectra for two classes $\chi$ and $\gamma$, for this the outflow speed is
highly relativistic and the relevancy of wind parameters suggest that wind must
be occurred at inner region of the accretion disk, so consistent with inner

successfully classified in our experiment and each object was knocked 120 times

method using handcrafted features with a shallow classifier was taken as a

  MIMO Systems","24 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) is a variant of
multi-user MIMO in which the number of antennas at each Base Station (BS) is
very large and typically much larger than the number of users simultaneously
served. Massive MIMO can be implemented with Time Division Duplexing (TDD) or
Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) operation. FDD massive MIMO systems are
particularly desirable due to their implementation in current wireless networks
and their efficiency in situations with symmetric traffic and delay-sensitive
applications. However, implementing FDD massive MIMO systems is known to be
challenging since it imposes a large feedback overhead in the Uplink (UL) to
obtain channel state information for the Downlink (DL). In recent years, a
considerable amount of research is dedicated to developing methods to reduce
the feedback overhead in such systems. In this paper, we use the sparse spatial
scattering properties of the environment to achieve this goal. The idea is to
estimate the support of the continuous, frequency-invariant scattering function
from UL channel observations and use this estimate to obtain the support of the
DL channel vector via appropriate interpolation. We use the resulting support
estimate to design an efficient DL probing and UL feedback scheme in which the
feedback dimension scales proportionally with the sparsity order of DL channel
vectors. Since the sparsity order is much less than the number of BS antennas
in almost all practically relevant scenarios, our method incurs much less
feedback overhead compared with the currently proposed methods in the
literature, such as those based on compressed-sensing. We use numerical
simulations to assess the performance of our probing-feedback algorithm and
compare it with these methods.

phenomena. They model the random motion of particles (diffusion) and
interactions between them (reactions). Such systems can be modelled at multiple
scales with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency. When
representing genuinely multiscale phenomena, fine-scale models can be
prohibitively expensive, whereas coarser models, although cheaper, often lack
sufficient detail to accurately represent the phenomenon at hand. Spatial
hybrid methods couple two or more of these representations in order to improve
efficiency without compromising accuracy.
  In this paper, we present a novel spatial hybrid method, which we call the
auxiliary region method (ARM), which couples PDE and Brownian-based
representations of reaction-diffusion systems. Numerical PDE solutions on one
side of an interface are coupled to Brownian-based dynamics on the other side
using compartment-based ""auxiliary regions"". We demonstrate that the hybrid
method is able to simulate reaction-diffusion dynamics for a number of
different test problems with high accuracy. Further, we undertake error
analysis on the ARM which demonstrates that it is robust to changes in the free
parameters in the model, where previous coupling algorithms are not. In
particular, we envisage that the method will be applicable for a wide range of
spatial multi-scales problems including, filopodial dynamics, intracellular

Minkowski space, irrespectively to any specifics of classical model. For
massive spinning particles in $d=3,4$, the world sheets are shown to be

$\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^D$, $D=[(d-1)/2]$. Proceeding from the fact that
the world lines of irreducible classical spinning particles are cylindrical
curves, while all the lines are gauge equivalent on the same world sheet, we
suggest a method to deduce the classical equations of motion for particles and
also to find their gauge symmetries. In $d=3$ Minkowski space, the spinning
particle path is defined by a single fourth-order differential equation having
two zero-order gauge symmetries. The equation defines particle's path in
Minkowski space, and it does not involve auxiliary variables. A special case is
also considered of cylindric null-curves, which are defined by a different

to irreducible massive spinning particles. For the higher-derivative equation

equivalent second-order formulation involving an auxiliary variable. The

(for example, geographical regions on the Earth's surface, or bandlimited
portions of the entire spectrum). They have been firmly established as a useful
tool for the synthesis and analysis of localized (concentrated or confined)
signals, and for the modeling and inversion of noise-contaminated data that are
only regionally available or only of regional interest. In this paper, we
consider a general abstract setup for inverse problems represented by a linear
and compact operator between Hilbert spaces with a known singular-value
decomposition (svd). In practice, such an svd is often only given for the case
of a global expansion of the data (e.g. on the whole sphere) but not for
regional data distributions. We show that, in either case, Slepian functions
(associated to an arbitrarily prescribed region and the given compact operator)
can be determined and applied to construct a regularization for the ill-posed
regional inverse problem. Moreover, we describe an algorithm for constructing
the Slepian basis via an algebraic eigenvalue problem. The obtained Slepian
functions can be used to derive an svd for the combination of the regionalizing
projection and the compact operator. As a result, standard regularization
techniques relying on a known svd become applicable also to those inverse
problems where the data are regionally given only. In particular, wavelet-based
multiscale techniques can be used. An example for the latter case is elaborated
theoretically and tested on two synthetic numerical examples.

supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems. In large part, these
techniques solve continuous optimization problems. Recently however, discrete
generative deep learning models have been successfully used to efficiently
search high-dimensional discrete spaces. These methods work by representing
discrete objects as sequences, for which powerful sequence-based deep models
can be employed. Unfortunately, these techniques are significantly hindered by
the fact that these generative models often produce invalid sequences. As a
step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent
validator model. Given a partial sequence, our model learns the probability of
that sequence occurring as the beginning of a full valid sequence. Thus this
identifies valid versus invalid sequences and crucially it also provides
insight about how individual sequence elements influence the validity of
discrete objects. To learn this model we propose an approach inspired by
seminal work in Bayesian active learning. On a synthetic dataset, we
demonstrate the ability of our model to distinguish valid and invalid
sequences. We believe this is a key step toward learning generative models that
faithfully produce valid discrete objects.

conditionally independent of each other under CTC loss, so a language model
(LM) can be incorporated conveniently during decoding, retaining the
traditional separation of acoustic and linguistic components in ASR. For fixed
vocabularies, Weighted Finite State Transducers provide a strong baseline for
efficient integration of CTC AMs with n-gram LMs. Character-based neural LMs
provide a straight forward solution for open vocabulary speech recognition and
all-neural models, and can be decoded with beam search. Finally,
sequence-to-sequence models can be used to translate a sequence of individual

single Co atom adsorbed on Cu (100) and contacted by a copper tip is evaluated

The calculations are performed using equilibrium Green's functions evaluated
within density functional theory completed with a Hubbard $U$ term and
spin-orbit interaction, as implemented in the Gollum package. We show that the
contribution to the transmission between electrodes of spin-flip components is
negative and scaling as $\lambda^2/\Gamma^2$ where $\lambda$ is the SOC and
$\Gamma$ the Co atom-electrode coupling. Hence, due to this unfavorable ratio,
SOC effects in transport in this system are small. However, we show that the
spin-flip transmission component can increase by two orders of magnitude
depending on the value of the Hubbard $U$ term. These effects are particularly
important in the contact regime because of the prevalence of $d$-electron
transport, while in the tunneling regime, transport is controlled by the
$sp$-electron transmission and results are less dependent on the values of $U$
and SOC. Using our electronic structure and the elastic transmission
calculations, we discuss the effect of $U$ and SOC on the well-known Kondo
effect of this system.

In particular the photon index hardens with increasing luminosity at
intermediate luminosities between $10^{36}$ $-$ $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This
evolution is stable and repeatedly observed over different outbursts. However,
at the extreme ends of the observed luminosity range, we find that the
correlation breaks down, with a significance level of at least $3.7\sigma$. We
conclude that these changes indicate transitions to different accretion
regimes, which are characterized by different deceleration processes, such as
Coulomb or radiation breaking. We compare our observed luminosity levels of
these transitions to theoretical predications and discuss the variation of
those theoretical luminosity values with fundamental neutron star parameters.
Finally, we present detailed spectroscopy of the unique ""triple peaked""
outburst in 2014/15 which does not fit in the general parameter evolution with
luminosity. The pulse profile on the other hand is consistent with what is
expected at this luminosity level, arguing against a change in accretion
geometry. In summary, GRO J1008-57 is an ideal target to study different

estimators are considered that do not rely on polynomial interpolations of the

estimators. An optimized von Neumann scheme is formulated, which better handles

data of varying quality, and consistency with previously reported time delays
is found. In particular, the size-luminosity relation of the broad-line region
in quasars is recovered with a scatter comparable to that obtained by other
works, yet with fewer assumptions made concerning the process underlying the
variability. The proposed method for time-lag determination is particularly
relevant for irregularly sampled time series, and in cases where the process

p-groups of class 2 and exponent p in time polynomial in the group order. It is
known that this problem can be reduced to solving the alternating matrix space
isometry problem over a finite field in time polynomial in the underlying
vector space size. We propose a venue of attack for the latter problem by
viewing it as a linear algebraic analogue of the graph isomorphism problem.
This viewpoint leads us to explore the possibility of transferring techniques
for graph isomorphism to this long-believed bottleneck case of group
isomorphism.
  In 1970's, Babai, Erd\H{o}s, and Selkow presented the first average-case
efficient graph isomorphism testing algorithm (SIAM J Computing, 1980).
Inspired by that algorithm, we devise an average-case efficient algorithm for
the alternating matrix space isometry problem over a key range of parameters,
in a random model of alternating matrix spaces in vein of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
model of random graphs. For this, we develop a linear algebraic analogue of the
classical individualisation technique, a technique belonging to a set of
combinatorial techniques that has been critical for the progress on the
worst-case time complexity for graph isomorphism, but was missing in the group
isomorphism context. As a consequence of the main algorithm, we establish a
weaker linear algebraic analogue of Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi's classical result
that most graphs have the trivial automorphism group. We finally show that
Luks' dynamic programming technique for graph isomorphism (STOC 1999) can be
adapted to slightly improve the worst-case time complexity of the alternating
matrix space isometry problem in a certain range of parameters.

bright ($L\sim 10^{40}\,{\rm erg\, s^{-1}}$) due to the spindown power and
therefore appears as an ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX). The system evolves
into pulsating ULX (PULX) when the neutron star spins down to a period ($P\sim
1$ s) allowing for accretion onto its surface to commence. Systems with lower
magnetic fields, $B \sim 10^{11}$ G, pass through a long ($10^5\,{\rm yr}$)
super-critical propeller stage with luminosities similar to those of the
ultra-luminous super-soft sources (ULS), $L \lesssim 10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,

about $10\,{\rm ms}$, which is much smaller than the typical period range of
PULX observed to date. Such systems could have a larger population, but their
pulsations would be elusive due to the smaller size of the magnetosphere. Our
results suggest that the ULS and some nonpulsating ULX are rapidly spinning and
highly magnetized young neutron stars at the super-critical propeller stage.

Currently, hand-crafted features are still the mainstream for snow removal,
making significant generalization difficult to achieve. In response, we have

into attributes of translucency and chromatic aberration for accurate
estimation. Moreover, our approach individually estimates residual complements

first factorization analysis of an observable of this type and we show that
with regard to the non-global nature, the rapidity logarithms do not constitute
an essential complication since they can be tied to the jet function, which is
the same as for global observables. As a consequence, the leading non-global
logarithms in narrow jet broadening are encoded in the same overall factor
relevant for the hemisphere soft function and light jet mass.

$\mathbb{R}^d$ under an asymmetric color restriction. Blue points can only
match to red points, while red points can match to points of either color. It
is unknown whether there exists a choice of intensities of the red and blue

Indeed, if the ratio of red to blue intensities is $\rho$ then the intensity of

also establish analogous results for certain multi-color variants. Our proof
uses stable matching on the Poisson-weighted infinite tree (PWIT), which can be
analyzed via differential equations. The PWIT has been used in many settings as
a scaling limit for models involving complete graphs with independent edge

magnetic flux ropes are structures of twisted magnetic field, threaded along an

weather. Here we describe a new methodology for the automated detection of flux
ropes in simulated magnetic fields, based on fieldline helicity. More robust
than previous methods, it also allows the full volume extent of each flux rope
structure to be determined. Our Flux Rope Detection and Organization (FRoDO)
code is publicly available, and measures the magnetic flux and helicity content
of pre-erupting flux ropes over time, as well as detecting eruptions. As a
first demonstration the code is applied to the output from a time-dependent
magnetofrictional model, spanning 1996 June 15 - 2014 February 10. Over this
period, 1561 erupting and 2099 non-erupting magnetic flux ropes are detected,
tracked, and characterized. For this particular model data, erupting flux ropes
have a mean net helicity magnitude of $(2.66 \pm 6.82) \times 10^{43}$ Mx$^2$,
while non-erupting flux ropes have a significantly lower mean of $(4.04 \pm
9.25) \times 10^{42}$ Mx$^2$, although there is overlap between the two
distributions. Similarly, the mean unsigned magnetic flux for erupting flux
ropes is $(4.04 \pm 6.17) \times 10^{21}$ Mx, significantly higher than the
mean value of $(7.05 \pm 16.8) \times 10^{20}$ Mx for non-erupting ropes. These
values for erupting flux ropes are within the broad range expected from
observational and theoretical estimates, although the eruption rate in this
particular model is lower than that of observed coronal mass ejections. In
future the FRoDO code will prove a valuable tool for assessing the performance
of different non-potential coronal simulations and comparing them with

targeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year

dynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery.
At the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100
supernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the
redshifts of 2,566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure
redshifts for targets of various types depends on signal-to-noise, magnitude,
and exposure time, finding that our redshift success rate increases
significantly at a signal-to-noise of 2 to 3 per 1-Angstrom bin. We also find
that the change in signal-to-noise with exposure time closely matches the
Poisson limit for stacked exposures as long as 10 hours. We use these results
to predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES survey, as well as the
potential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as the 4m

a topic of fervent interest in recent years. Herein, we study a family of
nonconvex penalty functions that we call the trimmed Lasso and that offers
exact control over the desired level of sparsity of estimators. We analyze its
structural properties and in doing so show the following:
  1) Drawing parallels between robust statistics and robust optimization, we
show that the trimmed-Lasso-regularized least squares problem can be viewed as
a generalized form of total least squares under a specific model of
uncertainty. In contrast, this same model of uncertainty, viewed instead
through a robust optimization lens, leads to the convex SLOPE (or OWL) penalty.
  2) Further, in relating the trimmed Lasso to commonly used sparsity-inducing
penalty functions, we provide a succinct characterization of the connection
between trimmed-Lasso- like approaches and penalty functions that are
coordinate-wise separable, showing that the trimmed penalties subsume existing
coordinate-wise separable penalties, with strict containment in general.
  3) Finally, we describe a variety of exact and heuristic algorithms, both
existing and new, for trimmed Lasso regularized estimation problems. We include
a comparison between the different approaches and an accompanying
implementation of the algorithms.

dominated by a small number $k$ of frequencies quickly and using a small number
of samples of the signal in time domain (the Sparse FFT problem) has received
significant attention recently. It is known how to approximately compute the
$k$-sparse Fourier transform in $\approx k\log^2 n$ time [Hassanieh et
al'STOC'12], or using the optimal number $O(k\log n)$ of samples [Indyk et
al'FOCS'14] in time domain, or come within $(\log\log n)^{O(1)}$ factors of
both these bounds simultaneously, but no algorithm achieving the optimal
$O(k\log n)$ bound in sublinear time is known.
  In this paper we propose a new technique for analysing noisy hashing schemes
that arise in Sparse FFT, which we refer to as isolation on average. We apply
this technique to two problems in Sparse FFT: estimating the values of a list
of frequencies using few samples and computing Sparse FFT itself, achieving
sample-optimal results in $k\log^{O(1)} n$ time for both. We feel that our
approach will likely be of interest in designing Fourier sampling schemes for

A number of surface features are consistently recovered in all three maps, but
other features seem to evolve over the time span of observations, suggesting
that fast changes can affect the surface of Vega within a few days at most. The
short-term evolution is observed as emergence or disappearance of individual
spots, and may also show up as zonal flows, with low-latitude and high latitude
belts rotating faster than intermediate latitudes. It is tempting to relate the
surface brightness activity to the complex magnetic field topology previously
reconstructed for Vega, although strictly simultaneous brightness and magnetic

vehicles need to have so as to move beyond the traffic light control. We
propose an efficient intersection traffic control scheme without the traffic
lights, that only requires a majority of vehicles on the road to be equipped
with a simple driver assistance system. The algorithm of our scheme is
completely decentralized, and takes into full account the non-linear
interaction between the vehicles at high density. For vehicles approaching the
intersection in different directions, our algorithm imposes simple interactions
between vehicles around the intersection, by defining specific conditions on
the real-time basis, for which the involved vehicles are required to briefly
adjust their dynamics. This leads to a self-organised traffic flow that is
safe, robust, and efficient. We also take into account of the driver comfort
level and study its effect on the control efficiency. The scheme has low
technological barrier, minimal impact on the conventional driving behaviour,
and can coexist with the traffic light control. It also has the advantages of
being easily scalable, and fully compatible with both the conventional road
systems as well as the futuristic scenario in which driverless vehicles
dominate the road. The mathematical formulation of our scheme permits large
scale realistic numerical simulations of busy intersections, allowing a more
complete evaluation of the control performance, instead of just the collision
avoidance at the intersection.

to the g-factor. We calculate the g-factor as a function of the magnetic field
direction, which is sensitive to the interface symmetry. We identify spin-qubit
dephasing sweet spots at certain directions of the magnetic field, where the
g-factor renormalization is zeroed: these include perpendicular to the
interface magnetic field, and also in-plain directions, the latter being
defined by the interface-induced spin-orbit constants. The g-factor dependence
on electric field opens the possibility for fast all-electric manipulation of
an encoded, few electron spin-qubit, without the need of a nanomagnet or a
nuclear spin-background. Our approach of an almost fully analytic theory allows
for a deeper physical understanding of the importance of spin-orbit coupling to
silicon spin qubits.

supersonic turbulence is driven by supernova explosions. This leads to the
production of intermittent, filamentary structures in the ISM gas density,
whilst the associated dynamo action also produces intermittent magnetic fields.
The traditional theory of random functions, restricted to second-order
statistical moments (or power spectra), does not adequately describe such
systems. We apply topological data analysis (TDA), sensitive to all statistical
moments and independent of the assumption of Gaussian statistics, to the gas
density fluctuations in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the
multi-phase ISM. This simulation admits dynamo action, so produces physically
realistic magnetic fields. The topology of the gas distribution, with and
without magnetic fields, is quantified in terms of Betti numbers and
persistence diagrams. Like the more standard correlation analysis, TDA shows
that the ISM gas density is sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields.
However, TDA gives us important additional information that cannot be obtained
from correlation functions. In particular, the Betti numbers per correlation
cell are shown to be physically informative. Magnetic fields make the ISM more
homogeneous, reducing the abundance of both isolated gas clouds and cavities,
with a stronger effect on the cavities. Remarkably, the modification of the gas
distribution by magnetic fields is captured by the Betti numbers even in
regions more than 300 pc from the midplane, where the magnetic field is weaker
and correlation analysis fails to detect any signatures of magnetic effects.

analyze the operation of the sensor and identify the intersecting cross

depending on the orientation of the applied field angle with the magnetization

unwanted direction yielding failures and counting errors in the device. To
overcome this limiting factor, we introduce a specially designed syphon

accelerate neutral particle transport calculations with methods that use

multigrid in energy (MGE) preconditioner. The MG Krylov solver converges more
quickly than Gauss Seidel and enables energy decomposition such that Denovo can
scale to hundreds of thousands of cores. RQI should converge in fewer
iterations than power iteration (PI) for large and challenging problems. RQI
creates shifted systems that would not be tractable without the MG Krylov

reduces iteration count significantly when used with RQI and takes advantage of
the new energy decomposition such that it can scale efficiently. Each
individual method has been described before, but this is the first time they
have been demonstrated to work together effectively.
  The combination of solvers enables the RQI eigenvalue solver to work better
than the other available solvers for large reactors problems on leadership
class machines. Using these methods together, RQI converged in fewer iterations
and in less time than PI for a full pressurized water reactor core. These
solvers also performed better than an Arnoldi eigenvalue solver for a reactor
benchmark problem when energy decomposition is needed. The MG Krylov, MGE

solver set is a strong choice for very large and challenging problems.

theoretical attention. They exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling both in the band
structure (intrinsic) and in the impurity potentials (extrinsic), although the
latter is often neglected. Here we discuss weak localization and
antilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and
massive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both
intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the
complex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar
and spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic
spin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum
relaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the
diffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In
TIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity
spin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak
antilocalization correction. They produce substantial qualitative modifications
to the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly from the conventional HLN formula
traditionally used in experimental fits, which predicts a crossover from weak
localization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit
strength. In contrast, our analysis reveals that topological insulators always
exhibit weak antilocalization. In WSM thin films having intermediate to large
values of the quasiparticle mass extrinsic spin-orbit scattering strongly
affects the boundary of the weak localization to antilocalization transition.
We produce a complete phase diagram for this transition as a function of the
mass and spin-orbit scattering strength. We discuss implications for
experiments and provide a brief comparison with transition metal
dichalcogenides.

approximated by a sum of natural orbital geometric phases with fractional
occupation numbers accounting for the dominant correlation effects. This
reduced formula accurately reproduces the exact polarization in the
Rice-Mele-Hubbard model across the band insulator-Mott insulator transition. A
similar formula based on a one-body reduced Berry curvature accurately predicts
the interaction-induced quenching of Thouless topological charge pumping.

  Correlation Between Data Sets","5 pages; 1 figure. This article is an expanded version of an
  announcement, published in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society,
  64 (2017), 16--18, of an invited lecture given at the 2017 Joint Mathematics
  Meeting","Notices of the American Mathematical Society, 64 (2017), 16--18",,,"stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The difficulties of detecting association, measuring correlation, and
establishing cause and effect have fascinated mankind since time immemorial.
Democritus, the Greek philosopher, underscored well the importance and the
difficulty of proving causality when he wrote, ""I would rather discover one
cause than gain the kingdom of Persia."" To address the difficulties of relating
cause and effect, statisticians have developed many inferential techniques.
Perhaps the most well-known method stems from Karl Pearson's coefficient of
correlation, which Pearson introduced in the late 19th century based on ideas
of Francis Galton.
  I will describe in this lecture the recently-devised distance correlation
coefficient and describe its advantages over the Pearson and other classical
measures of correlation. We will examine an application of the distance
correlation coefficient to data drawn from large astrophysical databases, where
it is desired to classify galaxies according to various types. Further, the
lecture will analyze data arising in the ongoing national discussion of the
relationship between state-by-state homicide rates and the stringency of state
laws governing firearm ownership.
  The lecture will also describe a remarkable singular integral which lies at
the core of the theory of the distance correlation coefficient. We will see
that this singular integral admits generalizations to the truncated Maclaurin
expansions of the cosine function and to the theory of spherical functions on
symmetric cones.

favor with both the academia and industry for years. In this paper, we present
a prototyping photodiode-based VLC system towards large-scale localization.
Specially, we give in-depth analysis of the design constraints and
considerations for large-scale indoor localization research. After that we
identify the key enablers for such systems: 1) distributed architecture, 2)
one-way communication, and 3) random multiple access. Accordingly, we propose
Plugo -- a photodiode-based VLC system conforming to the aforementioned
criteria. We present a compact design of the VLC-compatible LED bulbs featuring
plug-and-go use-cases. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii
Area (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared
optical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by
experiments, and further demonstrate its scalability to large-scale scenarios
through simulations. Finally, preliminary localization experiments are
conducted using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed, achieving
an average accuracy of 0.14 m along with a 90-percentile accuracy of 0.33 m.

high-refractive-index dielectric TiO2 grating with deep subwavelength thickness
on InSb as a tunable coupler for THz surface plasmons. We find a series of
resonances as the grating couples a normally-incident THz wave to standing
surface plasmon waves on both thin and thick InSb layers. In a marked contrast
with previously-explored metallic gratings, we observe the emergence of a much
stronger additional resonance. The mechanism of this giant plasmonic resonance
is well interpreted by the dispersion of surface plasmon excited in the
air\TiO2\InSb trilayer system. We demonstrate that both the frequency and the
intensity of the giant resonance can be tuned by varying dielectric grating
parameters, providing more flexible tunability than metallic gratings. The
phase and amplitude of the normally-incident THz wave are spatially modulated
by the dielectric grating to optimize the surface plasmon excitation. The giant
surface plasmon resonance gives rise to strong enhancement of the electric
field above the grating structure, which can be useful in sensing and
spectroscopy applications.
