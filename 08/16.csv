counterflow of superfluid turbulent helium is studied. \ The counterflow
velocity $V_{ns}^{x}(y)$ along the channel is supposed to have a parabolic
profile in the transverse direction $y$. Such statement corresponds to the
recent numerical simulation by Khomenko et al. [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{91},
180504 (2015)]. The authors reported about a sophisticated behavior of the
vortex line density (VLD) $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$, different from $%
\mathcal{L}\propto V_{ns}^{x}(y)^{2}$, which follows from the naive,
straightforward application of the conventional Vinen theory. It is clear, that
Vinen theory should be refined by taking into account transverse effects and
the way it ought to be done is the subject of active discussion in the
literature. In the work we discuss several possible mechanisms of the
transverse flux of VLD $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$ which should be incorporated
in the standard Vinen equation to describe adequately the inhomogeneous quantum
turbulence (QT). It is shown that the most effective among these mechanisms is
the one that is related to the phase slippage phenomenon. The use of this flux
in the modernized Vinen equation corrects the situation with an unusual
distribution of the vortex line density, and satisfactory describes the
behavior $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r},t)$ both in stationary and nonstationary
situations. The general problem of the phenomenological Vinen theory in the
case of nonuniform and nonstationary quantum turbulence is thoroughly
discussed.

solution converges in $L^1$ to the unique steady state. Important special cases
are the time-fractional and ultraslow diffusion case. We also prove estimates
for the rate of decay. In contrast to the classical (local) case, where the
usual time derivative appears in the Fokker-Planck equation, the obtained decay
rate depends on the entropy, which is related to the integrability of the
initial datum. It seems that higher integrability of the initial datum leads to
better decay rates and that the optimal decay rate is reached, as we show, when
the initial datum belongs to a certain weighted $L^2$ space. We also show how
our estimates can be adapted to the discrete-time case thereby improving known
decay rates from the literature.

allows us to construct lacunary hyperbolic groups with word and conjugacy
problems highly controllable and flexible both in terms of computability and
computational complexity.
  As an application, we show that for any recursively enumerable subset

words over arbitrarily chosen non-empty finite alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, there
exists a lacunary hyperbolic group $G_{\mathcal{L}}$ such that the membership
problem for $ \mathcal{L}$ is `almost' linear time equivalent to the conjugacy
problem in $G_{\mathcal{L}}$. Moreover, for the mentioned group the word and
individual conjugacy problems are decidable in `almost' linear time.
  Another application is the construction of a lacunary hyperbolic group with
`almost' linear time word problem and with all the individual conjugacy
problems being undecidable except the word problem.
  As yet another application of the developed framework, we construct infinite
verbally complete groups and torsion free Tarski monsters, i.e. infinite
torsion-free groups all of whose proper subgroups are cyclic, with `almost'
linear time word and polynomial time conjugacy problems. These groups are
constructed as quotients of arbitrarily given non-elementary torsion-free
hyperbolic groups and are lacunary hyperbolic.

focus of systems biology is to understand these circuits by establishing the
relationship between specific structures and functions. Of special interest are
multifunctional circuits that are capable of performing distinct behaviors
without changing their topology. A particularly simple example of such a system
is the AC-DC circuit. Found in multiple regulatory processes, this circuit
consists of three genes connected in a combination of a toggle switch and a
repressilator. Using dynamical system theory we analyze the available dynamical
regimes to show that the AC-DC can exhibit both oscillations and bistability.
We found that both dynamical regimes can coexist robustly in the same region of
parameter space, generating novel emergent behaviors not available to the
individual subnetwork components. We demonstrate that the AC-DC circuit
provides a mechanism to rapidly switch between oscillations and steady
expression and, in the presence of noise, the multi-functionality of the
circuit offers the possibility to control the coherence of oscillations.
Additionally, we provide evidence that the availability of a bistable
oscillatory regime allows the AC-DC circuit to behave as an excitable system
capable of stochastic pulses and spatial signal propagation. Taken together
these results reveal how a system as simple as the AC-DC circuit can produce
multiple complex dynamical behaviors in the same parameter region and is well
suited for the construction of multifunctional synthetic genetic circuits.
Likewise, the analysis reveals the potential of this circuit to facilitate the

observed objects (e.g. KIC-8462852, J1407 and PDS-110) exhibit unconventional
transit signals, whose appropriate interpretation in terms of a spherical
single body has been challenging, if not impossible. In the aforementioned
examples the presence of a ring-like structure has been proposed for explaining
the unusual data. Thus, in this paper we delve into the dynamics of a tilted
exoring disturbed by a third close companion, and the role that the Lidov-Kozai
mechanism may have to explain irregular and anomalous transit signals of ringed
planets, as well as the ring's early stages. To that end, we performed
numerical simulations and semi-analytical calculations to assess the ring's
dynamical and morphological properties, and their related transit observables.
We found that tilted ringed structures undergo short-term changes in shape and
orientation that are manifested as strong variations of transit depth and
contact times, even between consecutive eclipses. Any detected anomaly in
transit characteristics may lead to a miscalculation of the system's properties
(planetary radius, semi-major axis, stellar density and others). Moreover,
oscillating ring-like structures may account for the strangeness of some
light-curve features in already known and future discovered exoplanets.

of classical fluid transport equations for weakly coupled, magnetized plasmas
is given. In the present work, linear response is addressed. In the
Schr\""odinger representation, projection onto the hydrodynamic subspace leads
to the conventional Braginskii fluid equations, while the orthogonal projection
leads to an alternative derivation of the Braginskii correction equations for
the nonhydrodynamic part of the distribution function f. Although ultimately
mathematically equivalent to Braginskii's calculations, the projection-operator
approach provides a usefully intuitive way of discussing the derivation of
transport equations and interpreting the significance of the various parts of
the perturbed distribution function; it is also technically more concise. A
special case of the Weinhold metric is used to provide a covariant
representation of the formalism; this allows a succinct demonstration of the
Onsager symmetries for classical transport. The Heisenberg representation is
used to derive a generalized Langevin system whose mean recovers the Braginskii
equations but that also includes fluctuating forces. Transport coefficients are
simply related to the two-time correlation functions of those forces, and
physical pictures of the various transport processes are naturally couched in
terms of them. A number of appendices review the traditional Chapman-Enskog
procedure; record results about the linearized Landau collision operator;
discuss the covariant representation of the hydrodynamic projection; provide an
example of the calculation of some transport effects; describe the
decomposition of the stress tensor for magnetized plasma; introduce the linear
eigenmodes of the Braginskii equations; and, with the aid of several examples,
mention some caveats for the use of projection operators.

gamma-rays to perform simultaneous and rapid-response follow-up searches for
fast transient events on millisecond-to-hours timescales. DWF search demands
have a set of constraints that is becoming common amongst large collaborations.
Here, we focus on the rapid optical data component of DWF led by the Dark
Energy Camera (DECam) at CTIO. Each DECam image has 70 total CCDs saved as a
~1.2 gigabyte FITS file. Near real-time data processing and fast transient
candidate identifications -- in minutes for rapid follow-up triggers on other
telescopes -- requires computational power exceeding what is currently
available on-site at CTIO. In this context, data files need to be transmitted
rapidly to a foreign location for supercomputing post-processing, source
finding, visualization and analysis. This step in the search process poses a
major bottleneck, and reducing the data size helps accommodate faster data
transmission. To maximise our gain in transfer time and still achieve our
science goals, we opt for lossy data compression -- keeping in mind that raw
data is archived and can be evaluated at a later time. We evaluate how lossy
JPEG2000 compression affects the process of finding transients, and find only a
negligible effect for compression ratios up to ~25:1. We also find a linear
relation between compression ratio and the mean estimated data transmission
speed-up factor. Adding highly customized compression and decompression steps
to the science pipeline considerably reduces the transmission time --
validating its introduction to the DWF science pipeline and enabling science

magnetic field is important to describe and explain the observed complex
dynamics of solar prominences. Aims. We determine if a close relationship
between plasma and magnetic field parameters measured in a well-observed solar
prominence with high spatial resolution can be found. Methods. We select a
prominence observed on 15 July 2014 from space (IRIS, Hinode, SDO) and from the
ground (THEMIS). We perform a robust co-alignment of the data sets using a 2D
cross-correlation technique. We derive the magnetic field parameters from
spectropolarimetric measurements of the He I D3 line taken by THEMIS. Line
ratios and line-of-sight velocities from the Mg II h and k lines observed by
IRIS are compared with magnetic field strength, inclination and azimuth.
Electron densities are calculated using Hinode/EIS Fe XII line ratios and also
compared with THEMIS and IRIS data. Results. We find Mg II k/h ratios of around
1.4 everywhere, similar to values found previously in prominences. We also find
that the magnetic field is strongest (around 30 G) and predominantly horizontal
in the tornado-like legs of the prominence. The k3 Doppler shift is found to be
between +/- 10 km/s everywhere. Electron densities at a temperature of 1.5e6 K
are found to be around 1e9 /cm3. No significant correlations are found between
the magnetic field parameters, and any of the other plasma parameters inferred
from EUV spectroscopy, which may be explained by the large differences in the
temperatures of the lines used in this study. Conclusions. This is the first
time that a detailed statistical study of plasma and magnetic field parameters
has been carried out at high spatial resolution in a prominence. Our results
provide important constraints on future models of the plasma and magnetic field
in these structures.

these embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron

missions such as GRACE and its successor GRACE-FO, GNSS, and altimetry

interpret measurements, relativistic orbital effects need to be taken into
account. Within the theory of General Relativity, equations of motion for
freely falling test objects, such as satellites orbiting the Earth, are given
by the geodesic equation. We analyze and compare different solution methods in
a spherically symmetric background, i.e. for the Schwarzschild spacetime, as a
test bed. We investigate satellite orbits and use direct numerical orbit
integration as well as the semi-analytical Lie-series approach. The results are
compared to the exact analytical reference solution in terms of elliptic
functions. For a set of exemplary orbits, we determine the respective accuracy
of the different methods. Within the post-Newtonian approximation of General
Relativity, modified orbital equations are obtained by adding relativistic
corrections to the Newtonian equations of motion. We analyze the accuracy of
this approximation with respect to the general relativistic setting. Therefore,
we solve the post-Newtonian equation of motion using the eXtended High
Performance Satellite dynamics Simulator. For corresponding initial conditions,
we compare orbits in the Schwarzschild spacetime to those in its post-Newtonian
approximation. Moreover, we compare the magnitude of relativistic contributions
to several typical perturbations of satellite orbits due to, e.g., solar
radiation pressure, Earth's albedo, and atmospheric drag. This comparison is
done for our test scenarios and for a real GRACE orbit to highlight the
importance of relativistic effects in geodetic space missions.

and the other of hyperbolic type. The hyperbolic ones are always unstable,
while the elliptic ones are stable when sufficiently close, but unstable when
far apart.
  On the sphere of positive curvature, if the masses are different, there is a
unique relative equilibrium (RE) for every angular separation except {\pi}/2.
When the angle is acute, the RE is elliptic, and when it is obtuse the RE can
be either elliptic or linearly unstable. We show using a KAM argument that the
acute ones are almost always nonlinearly stable. If the masses are equal there
are two families of relative equilibria: one where the masses are at equal
angles with the axis of rotation (`isosceles RE') and the other when the two
masses subtend a right angle at the centre of the sphere. The isosceles RE are
elliptic if the angle subtended by the particles is acute and is unstable if it
is obtuse. At {\pi}/2, the two families meet and a pitchfork bifurcation takes
place. Right-angled RE are elliptic away from the bifurcation point.

several gravity-sensitive metal lines between 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.3 $\mu$m in
eight highly-luminous ($L \sim 10 L_*$) nearby galaxies. Thanks to the broad
wavelength coverage of FIRE, we are also able to observe the Ca II triplet
feature, which helps with our analysis. After measuring the equivalent widths
(EWs) of these lines, we notice mild to moderate trends between EW and central
velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), with some species (K I, Na I, Mn I) showing a
positive EW-$\sigma$ correlation and others (Mg I, Ca II, Fe I) a negative one.
To minimize the effects of metallicity, we measure the ratio $R$ = [EW(K I) /
EW(Mg I)], finding a significant systematic increase in this ratio with respect
to $\sigma$. We then probe for variations in the IMF by comparing the measured
line ratios to the values expected in several IMF models. Overall, we find that
low-mass galaxies ($\sigma \sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$) favor a Chabrier IMF, while
high-mass galaxies ($\sigma \sim 350$ km s$^{-1}$) are better described with a
steeper (dwarf-rich) IMF slope. While we note that our galaxy sample is small
and may suffer from selection effects, these initial results are still
promising. A larger sample of galaxies will therefore provide an even clearer
picture of IMF trends in this regime.

Res. 18, 5975 (2018)",,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well established that neural networks with deep architectures perform
better than shallow networks for many tasks in machine learning. In statistical
physics, while there has been recent interest in representing physical data
with generative modelling, the focus has been on shallow neural networks. A
natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over
shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by
using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability
distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep
belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal
spin configurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture
of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the
accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where
these quantities are most difficult to approximate. Interestingly, after
training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially
depends only on the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of the network,
and not on other model details such as network depth or model type. This is
evidence that shallow networks are more efficient than deep networks at
representing physical probability distributions associated with Ising systems
near criticality.

optical spectroscopy. The spectra of this system, which are dominated by the
primary component features, were fitted using NLTE models providing effective

two possible solutions for HS 2231+2441 that provide component's masses: M$_1$

to form a compact hot star, the primary of HS 2231+2441 probably evolved
through the red-giant branch scenario and does not have a helium-burning core,
which is consistent with a low-mass white dwarf. Both solutions are consistent
with a brown dwarf as the secondary.

we investigate electron and proton heating in the outflows of
trans-relativistic reconnection (i.e., $\sigma_w\sim 0.1-1$, where the
magnetization $\sigma_w$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy
density). For both electrons and protons, we find that heating at high
$\beta_{\rm i}$ (here, $\beta_{\rm i}$ is the ratio of proton thermal pressure
to magnetic pressure) is dominated by adiabatic compression ('adiabatic
heating'), while at low $\beta_{\rm i}$ it is accompanied by a genuine increase
in entropy ('irreversible heating'). For our fiducial $\sigma_w=0.1$, the
irreversible heating efficiency at $\beta_{\rm i}\lesssim 1$ is nearly
independent of the electron-to-proton temperature ratio $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}$
(which we vary from $0.1$ up to $1$), and it asymptotes to $\sim 2\%$ of the
inflowing magnetic energy in the low-$\beta_{\rm i}$ limit. Protons are heated
more efficiently than electrons at low and moderate $\beta_{\rm i}$ (by a
factor of $\sim7$), whereas the electron and proton heating efficiencies become
comparable at $\beta_{\rm i}\sim 2$ if $T_{\rm e}/T_{\rm i}=1$, when both
species start already relativistically hot. We find comparable heating
efficiencies between the two species also in the limit of relativistic
reconnection ($\sigma_w\gtrsim 1$). Our results have important implications for
the two-temperature nature of collisionless accretion flows, and may provide

measure their associated geometries. A support vector machine classifier is
employed to identify reliable spiral features, with which we are able to
estimate pitch angles for half of our sample. We use these machine measurements
to calibrate visual estimates of arm tightness, and hence estimate pitch angles
for our entire sample. The properties of spiral arms are compared with respect
to various galaxy properties. The star formation properties of galaxies vary
significantly with arm number, but not pitch angle. We find that galaxies
hosting strong bars have spiral arms substantially ($4-6^\mathrm{o}$) looser
than unbarred galaxies. Accounting for this, spiral arms associated with
many-arm structures are looser (by 2$^\mathrm{o}$) than those in two-arm
galaxies. In contrast to this average trend, galaxies with greater
bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios display both fewer and looser spiral arms.
This effect is primarily driven by the galaxy disc, such that galaxies with
more massive discs contain more spiral arms with tighter pitch angles. This
implies that galaxy central mass concentration is not the dominant cause of
pitch angle and arm number variations between galaxies, which in turn suggests
that not all spiral arms are governed by classical density waves or modal
theories.

show here that these conclusions rely on simplifying assumptions and

transport equation in the relaxon basis, we show how the problem can be reduced

interpreted as a hydrodynamic phenomenon, with the relaxon gas being slowed
down in proximity of a surface by friction effects, similar to the flux of a
viscous fluid in a pipe. As an example, we study a ribbon and a trench of
monolayer molybdenum disulphide, describing the procedure to reconstruct the

stellar population models, even using our newly developed models in the NIR.
The models clearly underestimate the large NaI2.21 values measured for most
early-type galaxies. However, we develop a Na-enhanced version of our newly
developed models in the NIR, which - together with the effect of a bottom-heavy
initial mass function - yield NaI2.21 indices in the range of the observations.
Therefore, we suggest a scenario in which the combined effect of [Na/Fe]
enhancement and a bottom-heavy initial mass function are mainly responsible for
the large NaI2.21 indices observed for most early-type galaxies. To a smaller
extent, also [C/Fe] enhancement might contribute to the large observed NaI2.21
values.

evaluations of new approaches. While industry surveys or industrial case
studies are preferred to evaluate industrial applicability, controlled
experiments with student participants are commonly used to determine
measurements such as effectiveness and efficiency of a proposed approach.
[Objectives] In this paper, we elaborate on the current state of the art of
controlled experiments using student participants. As student participants are
commonly only reluctantly accepted in scientific communities and threats
regarding the generalizability are quite obvious, we want to determine how
widespread controlled experiments with student participants are and in which
settings they are used. [Methods] This paper reports on a systematic mapping
study using high-quality journals and conferences from the software engineering
field as data sources. We scanned all papers published between 2010 and 2014
and investigated all papers reporting student experiments in detail. [Results]
From 2788 papers under investigation 175 report results from controlled
experiments. 109 (62.29%) of these controlled experiments have been conducted
with student participants. Most experiments used undergraduate student
participants, recruited students on a voluntary basis, and set them tasks to
measure their comprehension. However, many experiments lack information
regarding the students' recruitment and other important factors. [Conclusions]
In conclusion, student participation in software engineering experiments can be
seen as a common evaluation approach. In contrast, there seems to be little
knowledge about the threats to validity in student experiments, as major
drivers such as the recruitment are not reported at all.

debated question of whether formamide is mostly formed via gas-phase or grain
surface chemistry. Methods: We used the NOEMA interferometer to image NH$_2$CHO
towards the L1157-B1 blue-shifted shock, a well known interstellar laboratory,
to study how the components of dust mantles and cores released into the gas
phase triggers the formation of formamide. Results: We report the first
spatially resolved image (size $\sim$ 9"", $\sim$ 2300 AU) of formamide emission

blueshifted and have a FWHM $\simeq$ 5 km s$^{-1}$. A column density of $N_{\rm

H-nuclei) of 4 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ are derived. We show a spatial segregation of

a chemical modelling analysis, indicate that the formamide observed in L1157-B1
is formed by gas-phase chemical process, and not on grain surfaces as
previously suggested. Conclusions: The SOLIS interferometric observations of
formamide provide direct evidence that this potentially crucial brick of life
is efficiently formed in the gas-phase around Sun-like protostars.

designing iterative algorithms for many computational tasks. The core idea is
to maintain a distribution over a set of experts and update this distribution
in an online fashion based on the parameters of the underlying optimization
problem. In this report, we study the behavior of a special MWU algorithm used
for generating a global coin flip in the presence of an adversary that tampers
the experts' advice. Specifically, we focus our attention on two adversarial
strategies: (1) non-adaptive, in which the adversary chooses a fixed set of
experts a priori and corrupts their advice in each round; and (2) adaptive, in
which this set is chosen as the rounds of the algorithm progress. We formulate
these adversarial strategies as being greedy in terms of trying to maximize the
share of the corrupted experts in the final weighted advice the MWU computes
and provide the underlying optimization problem that needs to be solved to
achieve this goal. We provide empirical results to show that in the presence of
either of the above adversaries, the MWU algorithm takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$
rounds in expectation to produce the desired output. This result compares well
with the current state of the art of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for the general
Byzantine consensus problem. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of these
adversarial strategies for a general MWU algorithm and provide an outline for
the framework in that setting.

tasks and the unified vision and language modeling. We present the preliminary
work of linking the instance segmentations provided by COCO to the questions

Prandtl number of 0.7 and achieve a $Re_\lambda$ up to 150 during the
self-similar evolution of the mixing layer. It is found that the growth rate of
the mixing layer decreases with increasing density ratio, in agreement with
theoretical models of this phenomenon. Comparison with high-speed data shows
that the reduction of the growth rates with increasing the density ratio has a
weak dependence with the Mach number. In addition, the shifting of the mixing
layer to the low-density stream has been characterized by analyzing one point
statistics within the self-similar interval. This shifting has been quantified,
and related to the growth rate of the mixing layer under the assumption that
the shape of the mean velocity and density profiles do not change with the
density ratio. This leads to a predictive model for the reduction of the growth
rate of the momentum thickness, which agrees reasonably well with the available
data. Finally, the effect of the density ratio on the turbulent structure has
been analyzed using flow visualizations and spectra. It is found that with

probability distributions. A fundamental problem in distribution testing,
testing uniformity over a known domain has been addressed over a significant
line of works, and is by now fully understood.
  The complexity of deciding whether an unknown distribution is uniform over
its unknown (and arbitrary) support, however, is much less clear. Yet, this
task arises as soon as no prior knowledge on the domain is available, or
whenever the samples originate from an unknown and unstructured universe. In
this work, we introduce and study this generalized uniformity testing question,
and establish nearly tight upper and lower bound showing that -- quite
surprisingly -- its sample complexity significantly differs from the
known-domain case. Moreover, our algorithm is intrinsically adaptive, in
contrast to the overwhelming majority of known distribution testing algorithms.

characterize the near-optimizers of the Strichartz estimate, and play a pivotal
part in the global theory of mass-critical NLS. On one hand, the harmonic
analysis is quite subtle in the $L^2$-critical setting due to an enormous group
of symmetries, while on the other hand, the spacetime Fourier analysis employed
by the existing approaches to the constant-coefficient equation are not adapted
to nontranslation-invariant situations, especially with potentials as large as
those considered in this article.
  Using phase space techniques, we reduce to proving certain analogues of
(adjoint) bilinear Fourier restriction estimates. Then we extend Tao's bilinear
restriction estimate for paraboloids to more general Schr\""{o}dinger operators.
As a particular application, the resulting inverse Strichartz theorem and
profile decompositions constitute a key harmonic analysis input for studying
large data solutions to the $L^2$-critical NLS with a harmonic oscillator
potential in dimensions $\ge 2$. This article builds on recent work of Killip,

the complete evaporation of the black hole. This model might be used for the
resolution of the information loss puzzle. However, as we demonstrate, in a
general case the quantum radiation emitted from the black hole interior,
calculated in the given black hole background, is very large. This outburst of
the radiation is exponentially large for models with the redshift function
$\alpha=1$. We show that it can be suppressed by including a non-trivial
redshift function. However, even this suppression is not enough to guarantee
self-consistency of the model. This problem is a manifestation of a general
problem, known as the ""mass inflation"". We briefly comment on possible ways to
overcome this problem in the models of non-singular evaporating black holes.

the Doppler shift due to $E\times B$ rotation) are of potential importance

been shown [J. M. Finn, A. J. Cole, and D. P. Brennan, Phys. Plasmas (Letters),
22:120701, 2015] that the Maxwell torque on the plasma in the presence of an
applied error field is modified significantly for tearing modes having real
frequencies near marginal stability. In addition, it is known [J. M. Finn and
R. A. Gerwin, Phys. Plasmas, 3:2344, 1996] that resistive wall tearing modes
can be destabilized below their no-wall limits by rotation, if the tearing
modes have real frequencies near marginal stability. In this paper we first
derive the tearing mode dispersion relation with pressure gradient, field line
curvature and parallel dynamics in the resistive-inertial (RI) regime,
neglecting the divergence of the $E\times B$ drift and perpendicular
resistivity. The results show that the usual Glasser effect, a toroidal effect
which involves real frequencies, occurs in this simplified model, which ignores
perpendicular resistivity and the divergence of the $E\times B$ drift. We also
find, using a similar simple model, the surprising result that in the
viscoresistive regime with pressure gradient, favorable curvature due to
toroidal effects, and parallel dynamics, a similar Glasser-like effect is
found. We show that in both regimes the existence of tearing modes with complex
frequencies is related to nearby electrostatic resistive interchange modes with
complex frequencies. We discuss the effect on locking to an error field and the
significant lowering of the threshold for destabilization of resistive wall
tearing modes, which can be much more pronounced than the weak effect observed
for RI tearing modes without pressure-curvature drive in Finn and Gerwin, 1996.

At the same time, different implementation approaches provide a wide range of

error-correction performance, high throughput and low power consumption: a
comprehensive study considering all these metrics is currently lacking in

among SCL-based decoders, the partitioned SCL (PSCL) provides the lowest area
occupation and power consumption, whereas fast simplified SCL (Fast-SSCL)
yields the lowest energy consumption. Compared to LDPC decoder architectures,
different SCL implementations occupy up to 17.1x less area, dissipate up to

colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in the state of Iowa, spanning
the years 1989 to 2012. Specifically, we compare model performance using a
newly defined metric -- area between the curves (ABC) -- to assess (a) whether
survival curves can be reasonably predicted for colorectal cancer patients in
the state of Iowa, (b) whether geographical features improve predictive
performance, and (c) whether a simple binary representation or richer, spectral
clustering-based representation perform better. Our findings suggest that
survival curves can be reasonably estimated on average, with predictive
performance deviating at the five-year survival mark. We also find that
geographical features improve predictive performance, and that the best
performance is obtained using richer, spectral analysis-elicited features.

significant attention in the literature. In many practical applications such as
critical infrastructure monitoring and modeling of disease spread, a useful
change propagation model is one where change eventually happens at all sensors,
but where not all sensors witness change at the same time instant. While prior
work considered the case of known change propagation dynamics, this paper
studies a more general setting of unknown change propagation pattern
(trajectory). A Bayesian formulation of the problem in both centralized and
decentralized settings is studied with the goal of detecting the first time
instant at which any sensor witnesses a change. Using the dynamic programming
(DP) framework, the optimal solution structure is derived and in the rare
change regime, several more practical change detection algorithms are proposed.
Under certain conditions, the first-order asymptotic optimality of a proposed
algorithm called multichart test is shown as the false alarm probability
vanishes. To further reduce the computational complexity, change detection
algorithms are proposed based on online estimation of the unknown change
propagation pattern. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed detection
techniques offer near-optimal performance. Further, in the decentralized
setting, it is shown that if an event-triggered sampling scheme called
level-crossing sampling with hysteresis (LCSH) is used for sampling and
transmission of local statistics, the detection performance can be
significantly improved using the same amount of communication resources
compared to the conventional uniform-in-time sampling (US) scheme.

non-trivial algorithm was known for this problem on general graphs, and the
best known result even on graphs of bounded degree was a
$n^{\Omega(1)}$-approximation [Chekuri and Sidiropoulos 2013].
  As an immediate corollary, we also obtain improved approximation algorithms

non-repudiated identity and providing authentication with convenience.
Convenience drives consumers toward biometrics-based access management
solutions. Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be script-injected; however,
biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature and
unique association with users. Biometrics differ from passwords in that
compromised passwords may be reset. Compromised biometrics offer no such
relief. A compromised biometric offers unlimited risk in privacy (anyone can
view the biometric) and authentication (anyone may use the biometric).
Standards such as the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) (IEEE 2410-2016)
provide a detailed mechanism to authenticate biometrics based on pre-enrolled
devices and a previous identity by storing the biometric in encrypted form.
This paper describes a biometric-agnostic approach that addresses the privacy
concerns of biometrics through the implementation of BOPS. Specifically, two
novel concepts are introduced. First, a biometric is applied to a neural
network to create a feature vector. This neural network alone can be used for
one-to-one matching (authentication), but would require a search in linear time
for the one-to-many case (identity lookup). The classifying algorithm described
in this paper addresses this concern by producing normalized floating-point
values for each feature vector. This allows authentication lookup to occur in
up to polynomial time, allowing for search in encrypted biometric databases
with speed, accuracy and privacy.

representations such as distance or kernel matrices. Existing literature
utilizing these constructions cannot, however, benefit from continuous
formulations because the continuum limits of finite networks under this
distance are not well-understood. For example, while there are currently
numerous persistent homology methods on finite networks, it is unclear if these
methods produce well-defined persistence diagrams in the infinite setting. We
resolve this situation by introducing the collection of compact networks that
arises by taking continuum limits of finite networks and developing sampling
results showing that this collection admits well-defined persistence diagrams.
Compared to metric spaces, the isomorphism class of the generalized
Gromov-Hausdorff distance over networks is rather complex, and contains
representatives having different cardinalities and different topologies. We
provide an exact characterization of a suitable notion of isomorphism for
compact networks as well as alternative, stronger characterizations under
additional topological regularity assumptions. Toward data applications, we
describe a unified framework for developing quantitatively stable network

Current model compression methods such as matrix decomposition effectively

excessive execution time of non-tensor layers such as pooling and normalization
without tensor-like trainable parameters. This motivates us to design a novel
acceleration framework: DeepRebirth through ""slimming"" existing consecutive and
parallel non-tensor and tensor layers. The layer slimming is executed at
different substructures: (a) streamline slimming by merging the consecutive
non-tensor and tensor layer vertically; (b) branch slimming by merging
non-tensor and tensor branches horizontally. The proposed optimization
operations significantly accelerate the model execution and also greatly reduce
the run-time memory cost since the slimmed model architecture contains less
hidden layers. To maximally avoid accuracy loss, the parameters in new
generated layers are learned with layer-wise fine-tuning based on both
theoretical analysis and empirical verification. As observed in the experiment,
DeepRebirth achieves more than 3x speed-up and 2.5x run-time memory saving on

Hall-driven nano oscillators with the high quality factor (Q) of high overtone
bulk acoustic wave resonators (HBAR), integrating both reference and tunable
oscillators on the same chip with CMOS. In such magneto acoustic spin Hall
(MASH) oscillators, voltage oscillations across the magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) that arise from a spin-orbit torque (SOT) are shaped by the transmission
response of the HBAR that acts as a multiple peak-bandpass filter and a delay
element due to its large time constant, providing delayed feedback. The
filtered voltage oscillations can be fed back to the MTJ via a) strain, b)
current, or c) magnetic field. We develop a SPICE-based circuit model by
combining experimentally benchmarked models including the stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation for magnetization dynamics and the
Butterworth Van Dyke (BVD) circuit for the HBAR. Using the self-consistent
model, we project up to $\sim$ 50X enhancement in the oscillator linewidth with
Q reaching up to 52825 at 3 GHz, while preserving the tunability by locking the
STNO to the nearest high Q peak of the HBAR. We expect that our results will
inspire MEMS-based solutions to spintronic devices by combining attractive
features of both fields for a variety of applications.

there exists neither partial amplitude death nor local clustering behavior but
oblique line structure which represents directional signal flow on the
spatio-temporal patterns in the unidirectional coupling case. The
unidirectional coupling has the advantage of easily obtaining global amplitude
death in a ring of coupled oscillators with randomly distributed natural
frequency. Finally, we explain the results using the eigenvalue analysis of

(GaSP), in the context of emulation (approximation) of computer models for
which the outcomes are real-valued scalars. The main focus is on estimation of
the GaSP parameters through various generalized maximum likelihood methods,
mostly involving finding posterior modes; this is because full Bayesian
analysis in computer model emulation is typically prohibitively expensive. The
posterior modes that are studied arise from objective priors, such as the
reference prior. These priors have been studied in the literature for the
situation of an isotropic covariance function or under the assumption of
separability in the design of inputs for model runs used in the GaSP
construction. In this paper, we consider more general designs (e.g., a Latin
Hypercube Design) with a class of commonly used anisotropic correlation
functions, which can be written as a product of isotropic correlation
functions, each having an unknown range parameter and a fixed roughness
parameter. We discuss properties of the objective priors and marginal
likelihoods for the parameters of the GaSP and establish the posterior
propriety of the GaSP parameters, but our main focus is to demonstrate that
certain parameterizations result in more robust estimation of the GaSP
parameters than others, and that some parameterizations that are in common use
should clearly be avoided. These results are applicable to many frequently used
covariance functions, e.g., power exponential, Mat{\'e}rn, rational quadratic
and spherical covariance. We also generalize the results to the GaSP model with
a nugget parameter. Both theoretical and numerical evidence is presented
concerning the performance of the studied procedures.

design (OED) of constrained inverse problems. We consider two OED formulations
that allow reducing the experimental costs by minimizing the number of
measurements. The first formulation assumes a fine discretization of the design
parameter space and uses sparsity promoting regularization to obtain an
efficient design. The second formulation parameterizes the design and seeks
optimal placement for these measurements by solving a small-dimensional
optimization problem. We consider both problems in a Bayes risk as well as an
empirical Bayes risk minimization framework. For the unconstrained inverse
state problem, we exploit the closed form solution for the inner problem to
efficiently compute derivatives for the outer OED problem. The empirical
formulation does not require an explicit solution of the inverse problem and
therefore allows to integrate constraints efficiently. A key contribution is an
efficient optimization method for solving the resulting, typically
high-dimensional, bilevel optimization problem using derivative-based methods.
To overcome the lack of non-differentiability in active set methods for
inequality constraints problems, we use a relaxed interior point method. To
address the growing computational complexity of empirical Bayes OED, we
parallelize the computation over the training models. Numerical examples and
illustrations from tomographic reconstruction, for various data sets and under
different constraints, demonstrate the impact of constraints on the optimal
design and highlight the importance of OED for constrained problems.

Chinese characters are composed of graphical components, which carry rich

enhance word representations by character glyphs. The character glyph features
are directly learned from the bitmaps of characters by convolutional

predicting events from irregularly sampled multivariate time series
(longitudinal) data. Imputation methods, which are typically used for
completing the data prior to event prediction, lack a principled mechanism to
account for the uncertainty due to missingness. Alternatively, state-of-the-art
joint modeling techniques can be used for jointly modeling the longitudinal and
event data and compute event probabilities conditioned on the longitudinal
observations. These approaches, however, make strong parametric assumptions and
do not easily scale to multivariate signals with many observations. Our
proposed approach consists of several key innovations. First, we develop a
flexible and scalable joint model based upon sparse multiple-output Gaussian
processes. Unlike state-of-the-art joint models, the proposed model can explain
highly challenging structure including non-Gaussian noise while scaling to
large data. Second, we derive an optimal policy for predicting events using the
distribution of the event occurrence estimated by the joint model. The derived
policy trades-off the cost of a delayed detection versus incorrect assessments
and abstains from making decisions when the estimated event probability does
not satisfy the derived confidence criteria. Experiments on a large dataset
show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques in event prediction.

using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination with machine
learning. First, GGA-PBE and HSE calculations are performed as a reference. We
find this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess
largely distributed band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 to 8 eV. Then,
we apply machine learning methods, including Linear Regression (LR), Random
Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), to build
models for prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is
found to have the best performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE)
less than 0.15 eV for predicted band gaps, VBMs, and CBMs when both PBE results
and elemental information are used as features. Thus, we demonstrate machine
learning models are universally suitable for screening 2D isoelectronic systems

Modeling their internal structure requires knowledge of stable mineral phases,
their properties under compression, and major element abundances. Several
studies of PPv under extreme pressures support the notion that a sequence of
pressure induced dissociation transitions produce the elementary oxides SiO2
and MgO as the ultimate aggregation form at ~3 TPa. However, none of these
studies have addressed the problem of mantle composition, particularly major

critical compositional parameter, the Mg/Si ratio, whose value in the Earth's
mantle is still debated, is a vital ingredient for modeling phase transitions
and internal structure of super-Earth mantles. Specifically, we have identified
new sequences of phase transformations, including new recombination reactions

similarity without explicit common representation. For each semantic space,
modality-specific characteristics within one modality are fully exploited by
recurrent attention network, while the data of another modality is projected
into this space with attention based joint embedding to utilize the learned
attention weights for guiding the fine-grained cross-modal correlation
learning, which can capture the imbalanced and complementary relationships
between different modalities. Finally, the complementarity between the semantic
spaces for different modalities is explored by adaptive fusion of the
modality-specific cross-modal similarities to perform cross-modal retrieval.
Experiments on the widely-used Wikipedia and Pascal Sentence datasets as well
as our constructed large-scale XMediaNet dataset verify the effectiveness of
our proposed approach, outperforming 9 state-of-the-art methods.

consists in finding the minimum rate to compress an arbitrary ergodic source
when one is constrained to use a random Gaussian codebook and minimum
(Euclidean) distance encoding is employed. We extend Lapidoth's analysis in
several directions in this paper. Firstly, we consider refined asymptotics. In
particular, when the source is stationary and memoryless, we establish the
second-order, moderate, and large deviation asymptotics of the problem.
Secondly, by ""random Gaussian codebook"", Lapidoth referred to a collection of
random codewords, each of which is drawn independently and uniformly from the
surface of an $n$-dimensional sphere. To be more precise, we term this as a
spherical codebook. We also consider i.i.d.\ Gaussian codebooks in which each
random codeword is drawn independently from a product Gaussian distribution. We
derive the second-order, moderate, and large deviation asymptotics when i.i.d.\
Gaussian codebooks are employed. In contrast to the recent work on the channel
coding counterpart by Scarlett, Tan and Durisi (2017), the dispersions for
spherical and i.i.d.\ Gaussian codebooks are identical. The ensemble
excess-distortion exponents for both spherical and i.i.d.\ Gaussian codebooks
are established for all rates. Furthermore, we show that the i.i.d.\ Gaussian
codebook has a strictly larger excess-distortion exponent than its spherical
counterpart for any rate greater than the ensemble rate-distortion function
derived by Lapidoth.

calculated values of the large intrachain coupling constant are found to be
consistent with experiment, showing the expected level of variation between

projective measurements are assigned outcomes deterministically and
independently of context. This notion of noncontextuality is not applicable to
experimental measurements because these are never free of noise and thus never
truly projective. For nonprojective measurements, therefore, one must drop the
requirement that an outcome is assigned deterministically in the model and
merely require that it is assigned a distribution over outcomes in a manner
that is context-independent. By demanding context-independence in the
representation of preparations as well, one obtains a generalized principle of
noncontextuality that also supports a quantum no-go theorem. Several recent
works have shown how to derive inequalities on experimental data which, if
violated, demonstrate the impossibility of finding a generalized-noncontextual
model of this data. That is, these inequalities do not presume quantum theory
and, in particular, they make sense without requiring an operational analogue
of the quantum notion of projectiveness. We here describe a technique for
deriving such inequalities starting from arbitrary proofs of the Kochen-Specker
theorem. It extends significantly previous techniques that worked only for
logical proofs, which are based on sets of projective measurements that fail to
admit of any deterministic noncontextual assignment, to the case of statistical
proofs, which are based on sets of projective measurements that do admit of
some deterministic noncontextual assignments, but not enough to explain the
quantum statistics.

of data over the web, such as text, image, audio and video. Most of this data
is high dimensional and sparse, for e.g., the bag-of-words representation used
for representing text. Often, an efficient search for similar data points needs
to be performed in many applications like clustering, nearest neighbour search,
ranking and indexing. Even though there have been significant increases in
computational power, a simple brute-force similarity-search on such datasets is
inefficient and at times impossible. Thus, it is desirable to get a compressed
representation which preserves the similarity between data points. In this
work, we consider the data points as sets and use Jaccard similarity as the
similarity measure. Compression techniques are generally evaluated on the
following parameters --1) Randomness required for compression, 2) Time required
for compression, 3) Dimension of the data after compression, and 4) Space
required to store the compressed data. Ideally, the compressed representation
of the data should be such, that the similarity between each pair of data
points is preserved, while keeping the time and the randomness required for
compression as low as possible.
  We show that the compression technique suggested by Pratap and Kulkarni also
works well for Jaccard similarity. We present a theoretical proof of the same
and complement it with rigorous experimentations on synthetic as well as
real-world datasets. We also compare our results with the state-of-the-art
""min-wise independent permutation"", and show that our compression algorithm
achieves almost equal accuracy while significantly reducing the compression
time and the randomness.

the parallel SGD algorithms run in a heterogeneous computing environment;
low-performance nodes will exert a negative influence on the final result. In
this paper, we propose an algorithm called weighted parallel SGD (WP-SGD).
WP-SGD combines weighted model parameters from different nodes in the system to

family of approximate dual windows of a very simple form, leading to ""almost

High-temperature viscosity measurements were performed at both superliquidus
(up to 1736 K) and subliquidus conditions (1569-1502 K) to constrain the
viscosity variations as a function of crystallinity (from 0 to 28\%) and shear
rate (from 0.1 to 5 s 1). Melt viscosity shows moderate variations (4-16 Pa s)
in the temperature range of 1736-1600 K. Experiments performed below the
liquidus temperature show an increase in viscosity as shear rate decreases from
5 to 0.1 s 1, resulting in a shear thinning behavior, with a decrease in
viscosity of 1 log unit. The low viscosity of the studied composition may
explain the ability of NVP lavas to cover long distances, on the order of
hundreds of kilometers in a turbulent flow regime. Using our experimental data
we estimate that lava flows with thickness of 1, 5, and 10 m are likely to have
velocities of 4.8, 6.5, and 7.2 m/s, respectively, on a 5 degree ground slope.

of them, and these observed at high-energy during the first half of the
observations, do match the prediction of the simulation, assuming a surface
magnetic field in the range 0.4-1 kG. The high-energy component and the thermal
X-ray emission were weaker than expected around the second periastron

Diffuse shock acceleration in the complex geometry of the wind collision zone

diagnostic tools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system.

Associated with rate-induced tipping (where tracking of a branch of quasistatic

phases of the periodic attractor tip and others track the quasistatic

on the infall profile of the gas, however, no method exists, which allows a

This generalized gas equation is the main new contribution of this paper. We
combine these generalized equations with the results of the numerical

the radial velocity: inside the virial radius it is negligible, and inside two
virial radii the effect is below 40%, in agreement the earlier analyses for DM.

time step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative
process, where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that
even if every calculation converged in a single iteration, the resulting
speedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than proposing a fast-converging
numerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we present a
machine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and
accurately estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar
input conditions has been performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart
chemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport modeling example and show
that, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium
calculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the
machine-learning-accelerated chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly
perform all subsequent equilibrium calculations, resulting in speedups of
almost two orders of magnitude. We remark that our new on-demand machine

sequential/parallel evaluations of a computationally expensive function $f$
needs to be done, $y=f(x)$. We remark, that, in contrast to traditional machine
learning algorithms, our on-demand training approach does not require a
statistics-based training phase before the actual simulation of interest

first-order derivatives $\partial f/\partial x$ for later smart predictions.

non-discrete data types in the inherently binary-natured knowledge graphs. In
this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for both
encoding and prediction of non-discrete attribute information in a relational
setting. Specifically, we train a neural network for triplet prediction along
with a separate network for attribute value regression. Via multi-task
learning, we are able to learn representations of entities, relations and
attributes that encode information about both tasks. Moreover, such attributes
are not only central to many predictive tasks as an information source but also
as a prediction target. Therefore, models that are able to encode, incorporate
and predict such information in a relational learning context are highly
attractive as well. We show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art
methods for the tasks of relational triplet classification and attribute value
prediction.

the implementation of radiation-energy calculations from microscopic simulation

ZHAireS. To isolate potential differences in the radio-emission calculation
from differences in the air-shower simulation, the simulations are performed
with equivalent settings, especially the same model for the hadronic
interactions and the description of the atmosphere. Comparing a large set of
simulations with different primary energies and shower directions we observe
differences amounting to a total of only 3.3 %. This corresponds to an
uncertainty of only 1.6 % in the determination of the absolute energy scale and
thus opens the potential of using the radiation energy as an accurate

relatively high mass transfer rate. According to the observed orbital period,
the mass transfer rate, the mass ratio, and the donor star spectral type, the
progenitor of Sco X-1 should be an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including a

difficult or impossible to detect. We aim to determine if the material in the
colliding-wind region contributes substantially to the observed millimetre
fluxes of a colliding-wind binary. We also try to distinguish the synchrotron
emission from the free-free emission. We monitored the massive binary Cyg OB2

of the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM). The data were
collected in 14 separate observing runs (in 2014 and 2016), and provide good
coverage of the orbital period. The observed millimetre fluxes range between
1.1 and 2.3 mJy, and show phase-locked variability, clearly indicating that a
large part of the emission is due to the colliding-wind region. A simple
synchrotron model gives fluxes with the correct order of magnitude, but with a
maximum that is phase-shifted with respect to the observations. Qualitatively
this phase shift can be explained by our neglect of orbital motion on the shape
of the colliding-wind region. A model using only free-free emission results in
only a slightly worse explanation of the observations. Additionally, on the map
of our observations we also detect the O6.5 III star Cyg OB2 #8B, for which we
determine a 3 mm flux of 0.21 +- 0.033 mJy. The question of whether synchrotron
radiation or free-free emission dominates the millimetre fluxes of Cyg OB2 #8A

oscillations in sunspot umbra, across multiple atmospheric heights, for
frequencies up to a few hundred mHz. It is observed that the power spectra
display a power-law dependence over the entire frequency range, with a
significant enhancement around 5.5 mHz found for the chromospheric channels.
The phase-difference spectra reveal a cutoff frequency near 3 mHz, up to which
the oscillations are evanescent, while those with higher frequencies propagate
upwards. The power-law index appears to increase with atmospheric height. Also,
shorter damping lengths are observed for oscillations with higher frequencies
suggesting frequency-dependent damping. Using the relative amplitudes of the

the field equations can be effectively cast into the usual Einstein's with
""apparent"" anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. Solving the corresponding
brane-TOV equations numerically, we study its mass-radius relation. It is known
that the appearance of finite brane tension $\lambda$ reduces the compactness
of the star. The compatibility of the braneworld results with observational
constraints of NS mass and radius can be restored in our model by varying the
EiBI's coupling constant, $\kappa$. We found that within the
astrophysically-accepted range of parameters ($0<\kappa<6\times10^6\text{m}^2$
and $\lambda\gg1~ \text{MeV}^4$) the NS can have mass $\sim2.1~ \text{M}_\odot$
and radius $\sim10$ km.

software-only fallback path to guarantee progress. The design of the fallback
path can have a profound impact on performance. If the fallback path is allowed
to run concurrently with hardware transactions, then hardware transactions must
be instrumented, adding significant overhead. Otherwise, hardware transactions
must wait for any processes on the fallback path, causing concurrency
bottlenecks, or move to the fallback path. We introduce an approach that
combines the best of both worlds. The key idea is to use three execution paths:
an HTM fast path, an HTM middle path, and a software fallback path, such that
the middle path can run concurrently with each of the other two. The fast path
and fallback path do not run concurrently, so the fast path incurs no
instrumentation overhead. Furthermore, fast path transactions can move to the
middle path instead of waiting or moving to the software path. We demonstrate
our approach by producing an accelerated version of the tree update template of
Brown et al., which can be used to implement fast lock-free data structures
based on down-trees. We used the accelerated template to implement two
lock-free trees: a binary search tree (BST), and an (a,b)-tree (a
generalization of a B-tree). Experiments show that, with 72 concurrent
processes, our accelerated (a,b)-tree performs between 4.0x and 4.2x as many
operations per second as an implementation obtained using the original tree
update template.

It is observed that the 1.15:2 precursor ratio gives better phase control but
poor coercivity. On the other hand, 1.05:2 precursor ratio results in
substantially better coercivity values (274kA/m; almost 300% the value reported
for co-precipitated cobalt ferrite by Praveena et al.), but moderate BH product
maximum (2.25 kJ/m3; ~ comparable to many reports on cobalt ferrite
nanoparticles so far). The nanoparticles with best coercivity are annealed at
873K for varying durations (2, 4, 6, 12 hrs). It is observed that the
coercivity drops drastically (almost by 80%) after annealing for 2 hours.
However thereafter coercivity and saturation magnetization improves marginally
with increasing duration of annealing. These studies, along with
thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopic results indicate that a
hydroxide nanophase based flux pinning mechanism at the grain boundary plays an
important role in explaining the observed magnetic property trends. It is
believed that this result will be generically helpful in developing soft
chemically derived ferrites with higher coercivity and moderate (BH)max.
However to develop plausible applications using the reported ferrites that use
nanophase flux pinning, soft materials and device processing methods will need
to be explored.

the same diffusion properties for cosmic rays (CR) throughout the Galaxy. We
explore the possibility that a fraction of this diffuse Galactic emission could
be due to hadronic interactions of CRs self-confined in the region around their
sources. In fact, freshly accelerated CRs that diffuse away from the
acceleration region can trigger the streaming instability able to amplify
magnetic disturbance and to reduce the particle diffusion. When this happen,
CRs are trapped in the near source region for a time longer than expected and
an extended gamma-ray halo is produces around each source. Here we calculate
the contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background due to the overlap along
lines of sight of several of these extended halos. We find that if the density
of neutrals is low, the halos can account for a substantial fraction of the
diffuse emission observed by Fermi-LAT, depending on the orientation of the
line of sight with respect to the direction of the galactic center.

energies of at least several hundreds of TeV. Assuming a hadronic scenario,
dense gas regions can provide rich target material for accelerated particles to
produce VHE $\gamma$-ray emission via proton-proton interactions followed by a
subsequent $\pi^{0}$ decay. Thus, detailed investigations of the interstellar
medium along the line of sight to all of these sources have been performed by
using data from available atomic and molecular hydrogen surveys. The results
point out the existence of dense interstellar gas structures coincident with
the best fit positions of these sources. One can find possible hadronic models

$\gamma$-ray emission from all of these sources, which opens up the possibility

Hot carrier solar cells have been demonstrated in high-bandgap ferroelectric

materials, where the potential efficiency gain is highest. Recently, a high
open-circuit voltage was demonstrated in an illuminated wurtzite InAs nanowire

demonstrated devices, InP heterostructures are used as energy filters in order
to thermoelectrically harvest the energy of hot electrons photogenerated in
InAs absorber segments. The obtained photovoltage depends on the
heterostructure design of the energy filter and is therefore tunable. By using
a high-resistance, thermionic barrier an open-circuit voltage is obtained that
is in excess of the Shockley-Queisser limit. These results provide
generalizable insight into how to realize high voltage hot carrier solar cells

can be seen as a root-firing process which allows the moves $\lambda \to
\lambda + \alpha$ for $\alpha\in \Phi^{+}$ whenever
$\langle\lambda,\alpha^\vee\rangle = 0$, where $\Phi^{+}$ is the set of
positive roots of a root system of Type A and $\lambda$ is a weight of this
root system. We are thus motivated to study the exact same root-firing process
for an arbitrary root system. Actually, this central root-firing process is the
subject of a sequel to this paper. In the present paper, we instead study the
interval root-firing processes determined by $\lambda \to \lambda + \alpha$ for
$\alpha\in \Phi^{+}$ whenever $\langle\lambda,\alpha^\vee\rangle \in
[-k-1,k-1]$ or $\langle\lambda,\alpha^\vee\rangle \in [-k,k-1]$, for any $k

from any initial weight. We also show that there is a natural way to
consistently label the stable points of these interval-firing processes across
all values of $k$ so that the number of weights with given stabilization is a
polynomial in $k$. We conjecture that these Ehrhart-like polynomials have
nonnegative integer coefficients.

case of the elliptic restricted TBP when the motion of the primaries is

the primaries is assumed to be a non-singular point. The rectilinear model has
been proposed as a starting model for studying the dynamics of motion around
highly eccentric binary systems. Broucke (1969) explored the rectilinear
problem and obtained isolated periodic orbits for mass parameter $\mu=0.5$
(equal masses of the primaries). We found that all orbits obtained by Broucke
are linearly unstable. We extend Broucke's computations by using a finer search
for symmetric periodic orbits and computing their linear stability. We found a
large number of periodic orbits, but only eight of them were found to be
linearly stable and are associated with particular mean motion resonances.
These stable orbits are used as generating orbits for continuation with respect
to $\mu$ and $e'<1$. Also, continuation of periodic solutions with respect to
the mass of the small body can be applied by using the general TBP. FLI maps of
dynamical stability show that stable periodic orbits are surrounded in phase
space with regions of regular orbits indicating that systems of very highly
eccentric orbits can be found in stable resonant configurations. As an
application we present a stability study for the planetary system HD7449.

suited to search for such features from multi-TeV mass DM particles. The Dwarf
Spheroidal Galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group are the most common satellites
of the Milky Way and assumed to be gravitationally bound dominantly by DM, with
up to O(10 3 ) times more mass in DM than in visible matter. Over the past
decade, several observational campaigns on dwarf satellite galaxies were
launched by H.E.S.S. amounting to more than 140 hours of exposure in total. The

tools available to neuroscientists, allowing for a more detailed study of the
kind of information represented in patterns of cortical activity. While most
current decoding algorithms focus on estimating a single, most likely stimulus
from the pattern of noisy fMRI responses, the presence of noise causes this
estimate to be uncertain. This uncertainty in stimulus estimates is a
potentially highly relevant aspect of cortical stimulus processing, and
features prominently in Bayesian or probabilistic models of neural coding.
Here, we focus on sensory uncertainty and how best to extract this information
with fMRI. We first demonstrate in simulations that decoding algorithms that
take into account correlated noise between fMRI voxels better recover the
amount of uncertainty (quantified as the width of a probability distribution
over possible stimuli) associated with the decoded estimate. Furthermore, we
show that not all correlated variability should be treated equally, as modeling
tuning-dependent correlations has the greatest impact on decoding performance.
Next, we examine actual noise correlations in human visual cortex, and find
that shared variability in areas V1-V3 depends on the tuning properties of fMRI
voxels. In line with our simulations, accounting for this shared noise between
similarly tuned voxels produces important benefits in decoding. Our findings
underscore the importance of accurate noise models in fMRI decoding approaches,
and suggest a statistically feasible method to incorporate the most relevant
forms of shared noise.

terms of 8 nonperturbative parameters. With 35 experimental results, we fit
these 8 nonperturbative parameters. Annihilation contributions are neglected
due to power suppression in the $m_b\to \infty$ limit, so we include in the fit
the nonperturbative charm penguins, which will play an important role in
understanding the direct CP asymmetries. Charming penguins are also responsible
for the large transverse polarizations of penguin-dominated and
color-suppressed decays. With the best fitted parameters, we calculate all
possible physical observables of 28 decay modes, including branching fractions,
direct CP asymmetries, and the complete set of polarization observables. Most

to manipulate an election on $m$ candidates---under general scoring rules, with
a focus on the Borda protocol. We do so both in the weighted and unweighted
settings. We focus on minimizing the maximum score obtainable by a
non-preferred candidate.
  In the strongest, most general setting, we provide an algorithm for any
scoring rule as described by a vector
$\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m)$: for some $\beta=O(\sqrt{m\log m})$,
it obtains an additive approximation equal to $W\cdot \max_i \lvert
\alpha_{i+\beta}-\alpha_i \rvert$, where $W$ is the sum of voter weights.
  For Borda, both the weighted and unweighted variants are known to be
$NP$-hard. For the unweighted case, our simpler algorithm provides a
randomized, additive $O(k \sqrt{m \log m} )$ approximation; in other words, if
there exists a strategy enabling the preferred candidate to win by an $\Omega(k
\sqrt{m \log m} )$ margin, our method, with high probability, will find a
strategy enabling her to win (albeit with a possibly smaller margin). It thus
provides a somewhat stronger guarantee compared to the previous methods, which
implicitly implied a strategy that provides an $\Omega(m)$-additive
approximation to the maximum score of a non-preferred candidate.
  For the weighted case, our generalized algorithm provides an $O(W \sqrt{m
\log m} )$-additive approximation, where $W$ is the sum of voter weights. This
is a clear advantage over previous methods: some of them do not generalize to
the weighted case, while others---which approximate the number of
manipulators---pose restrictions on the weights of extra manipulators added.
  Our methods are based on carefully rounding an exponentially-large
configuration linear program that is solved by using the ellipsoid method with
an efficient separation oracle.

pair annihilate. The former case has been extensively studied in the literature
by treating the damping as a local effect after integrating out the assumed
close-to-equilibrium mediator field. The same approach does not apply if the
mediator field is stable and freezes out of equilibrium. To account for the

meaningful when we consider full half-oscillations of the field being damped.
The damping rates of the oscillating scalar field and the corresponding heating
rate of the thermal bath in all bulk parameter regions are calculated in both
cases, corroborating previous results in the direct decay case. Using the
obtained results, the time it takes for the amplitude of the scalar field to be

findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above
vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle
of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand,
cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and
the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and
exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on
likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation
between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on
vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.

displacement-interpolation, $M^*$ provides a time-consistent interpolation
between $\mu$ and $\nu$. For particular choices of the initial and terminal

Brownian motion, and the Bass martingale. Furthermore, it yields a natural

heterogeneous surfaces that we cannot directly resolve in the foreseeable
future. It is particularly important for terrestrial planets with diverse
surface compositions like Earth. Although previous work on unmixing the spectra
of Earth from disk-integrated multi-band light curves appeared successful, we
point out a mathematical degeneracy between the surface colors and their
spatial distributions. Nevertheless, useful constraints on the spectral shape
of individual surface types may be obtained from the premise that albedo is
everywhere between 0 and 1. We demonstrate the degeneracy and the possible
constraints using both mock data based on a toy model of Earth, as well as real
observations of Earth. Despite the severe degeneracy, we are still able to
recover an approximate albedo spectrum for an ocean. In general, we find that
surfaces are easier to identify when they cover a large fraction of the planet
and when their spectra approach zero or unity in certain bands.

and can be achieved using model- or optimization-based approaches. The
parameter space is usually the set of monotone, continuous warp maps of a
domain. Infinite-dimensional nature of the parameter space encourages sampling
based approaches, which require a distribution on the set of warp maps.
Moreover, the distribution should also enable sampling in the presence of
important landmark information on the curves which constrain the warp maps. For
alignment of closed and open curves in $\mathbb{R}^d, d=1,2,3$, possibly with
landmark information, we provide a constructive, point-process based definition
of a distribution on the set of warp maps of $[0,1]$ and the unit circle
$\mathbb{S}^1$ that is (1) simple to sample from, and (2) possesses the
desiderata for decomposition of the alignment problem with landmark constraints
into multiple unconstrained ones. For warp maps on $[0,1]$, the distribution is
related to the Dirichlet process. We demonstrate its utility by using it as a
prior distribution on warp maps in a Bayesian model for alignment of two
univariate curves, and as a proposal distribution in a stochastic algorithm
that optimizes a suitable alignment functional for higher-dimensional curves.
Several examples from simulated and real datasets are provided.

elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately,
the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models
statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small
scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo
connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the
""accurate"" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful
treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling
approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional
two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard
$\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies.
Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity
function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model
fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding
group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly
tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the
adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the
cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried
(Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity
galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3$\sigma$ tension with the clustering of luminous
galaxies, thus providing evidence that the ""standard"" halo model needs to be
extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo
model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.

  Methods. We have compared 2274 Ca II IRT spectra of active main-sequence F to
K stars taken by the TIGRE telescope with those of inactive stars of the same
spectral type. After normalizing and applying rotational broadening, we
subtracted the comparison spectra to find the chromospheric excess flux caused
by activity. We obtained the total excess flux, and compared it to established
activity indices derived from the Ca II H & K lines, the spectra of which were
obtained simultaneously to the infrared spectra.
  Results. The excess flux in the Ca II IRT is found to correlate well with
$R_\mathrm{HK}'$ and $R_\mathrm{HK}^{+}$, as well as $S_\mathrm{MWO}$, if the
$B-V$-dependency is taken into account. We find an empirical conversion formula
to calculate the corresponding value of one activity indicator from the
measurement of another, by comparing groups of datapoints of stars with similar

  We first present a simple greedy algorithm for a general cost-minimization

a notion, called smoothness, which is inspired by a similar concept in the
context of algorithmic game theory. The algorithm gives optimal (up to a
constant factor) competitive ratios while applying to different contexts such

non-convex facility location.
  Next, we consider the online $0-1$ covering problems with non-convex

with configuration LPs, we derive a competitive algorithm for these problems.
Our result generalizes the online primal-dual algorithm developed recently by
Azar et al. for convex objectives with monotone gradients to non-convex
objectives. The competitive ratio is now characterized by a new concept, called
local smoothness --- a notion inspired by the smoothness. Our algorithm yields
tight competitive ratio for the objectives such as the sum of $\ell_{k}$-norms

this issue using the strategy of Ishibashi and Wald which finds a unique smooth
solution as the causal evolution of initial data, each possible evolution
corresponding to a positive self-adjoint extension of certain operator in a
Hilbert space on the initial surface. Moreover, solutions obtained this way are
the most general ones satisfying a few physically-sensible requirements. This
procedure is intimately related to the choice of boundary conditions and the
existence of bound states. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the

one-parametric family of distinct boundary conditions ($-3/4$ being the
conformally-coupled case), while for $m_e^2\ell^2\geq 0$ the boundary condition
is unique (only one self-adjoint extension is possible). It is argued that
there is no sensible evolution possible for $m_e^2\ell^2<-1$, and also shown
that in the range $m_e^2\ell^2 \in [-1,-3/4)$ there is a U$(1)$ family of

topic, semantic 3D reconstruction has only recently witnessed an increasing
share of attention from the Computer Vision community. Semantic annotations
allow in fact to enforce strong class-dependent priors, as planarity for ground
and walls, which can be exploited to refine the reconstruction often resulting
in non-trivial performance improvements. State-of-the art methods propose
volumetric approaches to fuse RGB image data with semantic labels; even if
successful, they do not scale well and fail to output high resolution meshes.
In this paper we propose a novel method to refine both the geometry and the
semantic labeling of a given mesh. We refine the mesh geometry by applying a
variational method that optimizes a composite energy made of a state-of-the-art
pairwise photo-metric term and a single-view term that models the semantic
consistency between the labels of the 3D mesh and those of the segmented
images. We also update the semantic labeling through a novel Markov Random
Field (MRF) formulation that, together with the classical data and smoothness
terms, takes into account class-specific priors estimated directly from the
annotated mesh. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art methods that are
typically based on handcrafted or learned priors. We are the first, jointly
with the very recent and seminal work of [M. Blaha et al arXiv:1706.08336,
2017], to propose the use of semantics inside a mesh refinement framework.
Differently from [M. Blaha et al arXiv:1706.08336, 2017], which adopts a more
classical pairwise comparison to estimate the flow of the mesh, we apply a
single-view comparison between the semantically annotated image and the current
3D mesh labels; this improves the robustness in case of noisy segmentations.

  System",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GPUs exploit a high degree of thread-level parallelism to hide long-latency
stalls. Due to the heterogeneous compute requirements of different
applications, there is a growing need to share the GPU across multiple
applications in large-scale computing environments. However, while CPUs offer
relatively seamless multi-application concurrency, and are an excellent fit for
multitasking and for virtualized environments, GPUs currently offer only
primitive support for multi-application concurrency. Much of the problem in a
contemporary GPU lies within the memory system, where multi-application
execution requires virtual memory support to manage the address spaces of each
application and to provide memory protection. In this work, we perform a
detailed analysis of the major problems in state-of-the-art GPU virtual memory
management that hinders multi-application execution. Existing GPUs are designed
to share memory between the CPU and GPU, but do not handle multi-application
support within the GPU well. We find that when multiple applications spatially
share the GPU, there is a significant amount of inter-core thrashing on the
shared TLB within the GPU. The TLB contention is high enough to prevent the GPU
from successfully hiding stall latencies, thus becoming a first-order
performance concern. We introduce MASK, a memory hierarchy design that provides
low-overhead virtual memory support for the concurrent execution of multiple
applications. MASK extends the GPU memory hierarchy to efficiently support
address translation through the use of multi-level TLBs, and uses
translation-aware memory and cache management to maximize throughput in the
presence of inter-application contention.

corresponding ground state is modified and it becomes increasingly difficult to

in [CII] to date, nearly half are either very faint in [CII], or not detected
at all, and fall well below expectations based on locally derived relations
between star formation rate (SFR) and [CII] luminosity. Combining cosmological
zoom simulations of galaxies with SIGAME (SImulator of GAlaxy
Millimeter/submillimeter Emission) we have modeled the multi-phased
interstellar medium (ISM) and its emission in [CII], [OI] and [OIII], from 30
main sequence galaxies at z~6 with star formation rates ~3-23Msun/yr, stellar
masses ~(0.7-8)x10^9Msun, and metallicities ~(0.1-0.4)xZsun. The simulations
are able to reproduce the aforementioned [CII]-faintness at z>5, match two of
the three existing z>~5 detections of [OIII], and are furthermore roughly
consistent with the [OI] and [OIII] luminosity relations with SFR observed for
local starburst galaxies. We find that the [CII] emission is dominated by the
diffuse ionized gas phase and molecular clouds, which on average contribute
~66% and ~27%, respectively. The molecular gas, which constitutes only ~10% of
the total gas mass is thus a more efficient emitter of [CII] than the ionized
gas making up ~85% of the total gas mass. A principal component analysis shows
that the [CII] luminosity correlates with the star formation activity as well
as average metallicity. The low metallicities of our simulations together with
their low molecular gas mass fractions can account for their [CII]-faintness,
and we suggest these factors may also be responsible for the [CII]-faint normal
galaxies observed at these early epochs.

state that has been adapted for use in the stellar evolution code CESAM2k. The
aim is to provide the necessary data and numerical procedures for its
implementation in a stellar code. A technical problem is the discrepancy
between the sets of thermodynamic quantities provided by the SAHA-S equation of
state and those necessary in the CESAM2k computations. Moreover, the
independent variables in a practical equation of state (like SAHA-S) are
temperature and density, whereas for modelling calculations the variables
temperature and pressure are preferable. Specifically for the CESAM2k code,
some additional quantities and their derivatives must be provided. To provide
the bridge between the equation of state and stellar modelling, we prepare
auxiliary tables of the quantities that are demanded in CESAM2k. Then we use
cubic spline interpolation to provide both smoothness and a good approximation
of the necessary derivatives. Using the B-form of spline representation
provides us with an efficient algorithm for three-dimensional interpolation.
The table of B-spline coefficients provided can be directly used during stellar
model calculations together with the module of cubic spline interpolation. This
implementation of the SAHA-S equation of state in the CESAM2k stellar structure
and evolution code has been tested on a solar model evolved to the present. A
comparison with other equations of state is briefly discussed. The choice of a
regular net of mesh points for specific primary quantities in the SAHA-S
equation of state, together with accurate and consistently smooth tabulated
values, provides an effective algorithm of interpolation in modelling
calculations. The proposed module of interpolation procedures can be easily
adopted in other evolution codes.

for the estimation of an unknown state, given an ensemble of $n$ independent
identically prepared systems. For locally quadratic loss functions, the risk of
standard procedures has the usual scaling of $1/n$. However, it has been
noticed that for fidelity based metrics such as the Bures distance, the risk of
conventional (non-adaptive) qubit tomography schemes scales as $1/\sqrt{n}$ for
states close to the boundary of the Bloch sphere. Several proposed estimators
appear to improve this scaling, and our goal is to analyse the problem from the
perspective of the maximum risk over all states.
  We propose qubit estimation strategies based on separate and adaptive
measurements, that achieve $1/n$ scalings for the maximum Bures risk. The
estimator involving local measurements uses a fixed fraction of the available
resource $n$ to estimate the Bloch vector direction; the length of the Bloch
vector is then estimated from the remaining copies by measuring in the
estimator eigenbasis. The estimator based on collective measurements uses local
asymptotic normality techniques which allows us derive upper and lower bounds
to its maximum Bures risk. We also discuss how to construct a minimax optimal
estimator in this setup. Finally, we consider quantum relative entropy and show
that the risk of the estimator based on collective measurements achieves a rate
$O(n^{-1}\log n)$ under this loss function. Furthermore, we show that no
estimator can achieve faster rates, in particular the `standard' rate $1/n$.

interpreted their results as indicating two-band superconductivity in the bulk
of SrTiO3. However: (1) Effective masses determined from tunneling results in
the normal state by Sroubek in 1969 and 1970 are much smaller than those
determined by most other methods. The much smaller masses were attributed to
properties of a surface layer by the present author in 1971; (2) The only other
reports of two-band superconductivity in bulk SrTiO3 can be used to infer much
smaller values of band separations than found by Binnig et al.. In this paper
we give an alternative explanation of the results of Binnig et al. in terms of
superconductivity in a surface layer. We obtain fair fits to the band gaps
versus Fermi energy for the two bands in three samples where two surface
subbands are occupied and to the temperature dependence of the gaps in one
crystal, using a model with three adjustable interaction parameters, an
adjustable energy for the phonons which dominate the pairing, and an adjustable
ratio for the mean-field Tc to the actual Tc. We show results for a combined
fit to the low-temoerature band gaps and to the T-dependence in one crystal.
The phonon energy which gives the best fit is 21 meV. This is probably an
appropriate average over the three longitudinal polar modes and acoustic modes
in the material. A large value of about two is found for the ratio T_(cmf}/Tc,
and we conjecture that this arises because a band with a small Fermi energy not
seen in the tunneling results plays a part in increasing T_{cmf}/Tc.

  Functional Iteration","IEEE TAES, 2018",,,,"cs.SY cs.RO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rigid motion computation or estimation is a cornerstone in numerous fields.
Attitude computation can be achieved by integrating the angular velocity
measured by gyroscopes, the accuracy of which is crucially important for the
dead-reckoning inertial navigation. The state-of-the-art attitude algorithms
have unexceptionally relied on the simplified differential equation of the
rotation vector to obtain the attitude. This paper proposes a Functional
Iteration technique with the Rodrigues vector (named the RodFIter method) to
analytically reconstruct the attitude from gyroscope measurements. The RodFIter
method is provably exact in reconstructing the incremental attitude as long as
the angular velocity is exact. Notably, the Rodrigues vector is analytically
obtained and can be used to update the attitude over the considered time
interval. The proposed method gives birth to an ultimate attitude algorithm
scheme that can be naturally extended to the general rigid motion computation.
It is extensively evaluated under the attitude coning motion and compares
favorably in accuracy with the mainstream attitude algorithms. This work is
believed having eliminated the long-standing theoretical barrier in exact
motion integration from inertial measurements.

synthesize the absolute frequency of a lightwave signal, using integrated
photonics to implement lasers, system interconnects, and nonlinear frequency
comb generation. The laser frequency output of our synthesizer is programmed by
a microwave clock across 4 THz near 1550 nm with 1 Hz resolution and
traceability to the SI second. This is accomplished with a heterogeneously
integrated III/V-Si tunable laser, which is guided by dual
dissipative-Kerr-soliton frequency combs fabricated on silicon chips. Through
out-of-loop measurements of the phase-coherent, microwave-to-optical link, we
verify that the fractional-frequency instability of the integrated photonics
synthesizer matches the $7.0*10^{-13}$ reference-clock instability for a 1
second acquisition, and constrain any synthesis error to $7.7*10^{-15}$ while
stepping the synthesizer across the telecommunication C band. Any application
of an optical frequency source would be enabled by the precision optical

$5\times10^4\,M_\odot<M<5\times10^5\,M_\odot$, with primordial metallicity, is
an optimal case with respect to the fraction of its rest mass emitted in
neutrinos as it collapses to a black hole: lower initial mass objects will be
subject to scattering-induced neutrino trapping and consequently lower
efficiency in this mode of gravitational radiation generation; while higher
masses will not get hot enough to radiate significant neutrino energy before
producing a black hole. The optimal case collapse will radiate several percent
of the star's rest mass in neutrinos and, with an assumed small asymmetry in
temperature at peak neutrino production, produces a characteristic linear
memory gravitational wave burst signature. The timescale for this signature,
depending on redshift, is $\sim1{\rm~s}$ to $10{\rm~s}$, optimal for proposed
gravitational wave observatories like DECIGO. Using the response of that

rotational diffusion that strongly distorts the resulting 2DIR spectra. It

discussed according to the different orderings of the laser-molecule

theories have come from studying geometry emerging from matrix models. In this
thesis, I study the N=1* and N=2* theories from which an elliptic curve is
known to emerge, alongside an elliptic function called the generalized
resolvent into which the physics is encoded. This is indicative of the common
origin of the two theories in N=4 SYM. The N=1* Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model is
intrinsically holomorphic with parameter space corresponding to the upper-half
plane. The Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model 't Hooft coupling S has been previously
shown to be holomorphic on the upper-half plane and quasi-modular with respect
to SL(2,Z). The allowed N=2* coupling is constrained to a Hermitian slice
through the enlarged moduli space of the holomorphic N=1* model. After
explicitly constructing the map from the elliptic curve to the eigenvalue
plane, I argue that the N=1* coupling S encodes data reminiscent of N=2*. A
collection of extrema (saddle-points) of S behave curiously like the quantum
critical points of N=2* theory. For the first critical point, the match is
exact. This collection of points lie on the line of degeneration which behaves
in a sense, like a boundary at infinity. I also show explicitly that the
emergent elliptic curve along with the generalized resolvent allow one to
recover exact eigenvalue densities. At weak coupling, my method reproduces the
inverse square root of N=2* as well as the Wigner semi-circle in N=1*. At
strong coupling in N=1*, I provide encouraging evidence of the parabolic
density arising in the neighborhood of the line of degeneration. To my
knowledge, the parabolic density has only been observed asymptotically. It is
interesting to see evidence that it may be exactly encoded in the other form of
emergent geometry: the elliptic curve with the generalized resolvent.

  hole mimickers",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH) is the gravitational field due to a neutral
point mass, and it turns out that the gravitational mass of a neutral point
mass: $M=0$ (Arnowitt, Deser, Misner, PRL 4, 375, 1960). The same result is
also suggested by Janis, Newman, and Winicour (PRL 20, 878, 1968). In 1969, Bel
gave an explicit proof that for a Schwarzschild BH, $M=0$ (Bel, JMP 10, 1051,
1969). The same result follows from the fact the timelike geodesic of a test
particle would turn null if it would ever arrive at an event horizon (Mitra,
FPL, 2000, 2002). Non-occurrrence of trapped surfaces in continued
gravitational collapse too demands $M=0$ for black hole (Mitra, Pramana, 73,
615, 2009).
  Physically, for a point mass at $R=0$, one expects ${\it Ric} \sim M \delta
(R=0)$ (Narlikar \& Padmanabhan, Found. Phys., 18, 659, 1988). But the black
hole solution is obtained from ${\it Ric} =0$. Again this is the most direct
proof that $M=0$ for a Schwarzschild black hole. Implication of this result is
that the observed massive black hole candidates are non-singular quasi black
holes or black hole mimickers which can possess strong magnetic fields as has
been observed. The echoes from LIGO signals, if true, may be the direct
evidence that the pertinent compact objects are BH mimickers and not true
vacuum BHs.

Despite being a relatively new phenomenon, the Singapore government has
collaborated with different organizations to improve the quality and

spearheading efforts to improve OERs to facilitate greater public access to
educational resources. It will also explore the benefits and potential problems
that MOOCs and OERs face. For example, both MOOCs and OERs are able to lower
the costs of university-level education and increase public access to such
courses. They also provide skills and job training for members of the public as
well as encourage lifelong learning. However, both MOOCs and OERs may not be
sustainable in the long run, as the financial gains of both may not be able to
cover the costs of mounting them. Each system also has its own set of problems.
For example, formal structures to guarantee the quality of MOOCs offered remain
lacking. MOOCs also tend to have low completion rates and there have been
issues regarding plagiarism with the use of MOOCs as learning platforms. OERs
pose challenges to traditional copyright policies while lack of sustainable
funding prevents them from being adopted more widely. Even though both systems
may potentially transform the traditional education system, a deeper
understanding of MOOCs and OERs as well as their implications on learning will
be useful.

employ a new strategy by splitting the variables, and we solve a bi-variate
optimization problem that is quadratic in each of the variables. An alternating
gradient descent algorithm is proposed, and its convergence for any

smaller Hessian, the alternating gradient descent algorithm converges faster
than the gradient descent algorithm (known as the Wirtinger flow algorithm)
applied to the quartic objective without splitting the variables. Numerical
results illustrate that our proposed algorithm needs less iterations than
Wirtinger flow to achieve the same accuracy.

intelligent transportation and vehicle calibration. This paper presents a novel
driving style analysis framework using the primitive driving patterns learned
from naturalistic driving data. In order to achieve this, first, a Bayesian
nonparametric learning method based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is
introduced to extract primitive driving patterns from time series driving data
without prior knowledge of the number of these patterns. In the Bayesian
nonparametric approach, we utilize a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)
instead of learning the unknown number of smooth dynamical modes of HSMM, thus
generating the primitive driving patterns. Each primitive pattern is clustered
and then labeled using behavioral semantics according to drivers' physical and
psychological perception thresholds. For each driver, 75 primitive driving
patterns in car-following scenarios are learned and semantically labeled. In
order to show the HDP-HSMM's utility to learn primitive driving patterns, other
two Bayesian nonparametric approaches, HDP-HMM and sticky HDP-HMM, are
compared. The naturalistic driving data of 18 drivers were collected from the
University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPDM) database. The
individual driving styles are discussed according to distribution
characteristics of the learned primitive driving patterns and also the
difference in driving styles among drivers are evaluated using the
Kullback-Leibler divergence. The experiment results demonstrate that the
proposed primitive pattern-based method can allow one to semantically
understand driver behaviors and driving styles.

  networks: Potential implications for neurodegenerative disease",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oxidative stress is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathic
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease-related dementia,
which are characterized by altered forms of the microtubule-associated protein
(MAP) tau. MAP tau is a key protein in stabilizing the microtubule architecture
that regulates neuron morphology and synaptic strength. The precise role of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tauopathic disease process, however, is
poorly understood. It is known that the production of ROS by mitochondria can
result in ultraweak photon emission (UPE) within cells. One likely absorber of
these photons is the microtubule cytoskeleton, as it forms a vast network
spanning neurons, is highly co-localized with mitochondria, and shows a high
density of aromatic amino acids. Functional microtubule networks may traffic
this ROS-generated endogenous photon energy for cellular signaling, or they may
serve as dissipaters/conduits of such energy. Experimentally, after in vitro
exposure to exogenous photons, microtubules have been shown to reorient and
reorganize in a dose-dependent manner with the greatest effect being observed
around 280 nm, in the tryptophan and tyrosine absorption range. In this paper,
recent modeling efforts based on ambient temperature experiment are presented,
showing that tubulin polymers can feasibly absorb and channel these
photoexcitations via resonance energy transfer, on the order of dendritic
length scales. Since microtubule networks are compromised in tauopathic
diseases, patients with these illnesses would be unable to support effective
channeling of these photons for signaling or dissipation. Consequent emission
surplus due to increased UPE production or decreased ability to absorb and
transfer may lead to increased cellular oxidative damage, thus hastening the
neurodegenerative process.

thousands of meters have been a challenge for many decades. The mobile
application of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) is a promising approach to
measure field soil moisture non-invasively by surveying large regions with a
ground-based vehicle. Recently, concerns have been raised about a potentially
biasing influence of local structures and roads. We employed neutron transport
simulations and dedicated experiments to quantify the influence of different
road types on the CRNS measurement. We found that the presence of roads
introduces a bias in the CRNS estimation of field soil moisture compared to
non-road scenarios. However, this effect becomes insignificant at distances
beyond a few meters from the road. Measurements from the road could
overestimate the field value by up to 40 % depending on road material, width,
and the surrounding field water content. The bias could be successfully removed
with an analytical correction function that accounts for these parameters.
Additionally, an empirical approach is proposed that can be used on-the-fly
without prior knowledge of field soil moisture. Tests at different study sites
demonstrated good agreement between road-effect corrected measurements and
field soil moisture observations. However, if knowledge about the road
characteristics is missing, any measurements on the road could substantially
reduce the accuracy of this method. Our results constitute a practical
advancement of the mobile CRNS methodology, which is important for providing
unbiased estimates of field-scale soil moisture to support applications in
hydrology, remote sensing, and agriculture.

suppress the transmitter (TX) passband leakage signal in radio transceivers
supporting simultaneous transmission and reception. The proposed technique is
based on creating an opposite-phase baseband equivalent replica of the TX
leakage signal in the transceiver digital front-end through adaptive nonlinear
filtering of the known transmit data, to facilitate highly accurate
cancellation under a nonlinear TX power amplifier (PA). The active RF
cancellation is then accomplished by employing an auxiliary transmitter chain,
to generate the actual RF cancellation signal, and combining it with the
received signal at the receiver (RX) low noise amplifier (LNA) input. A
closed-loop parameter learning approach, based on the decorrelation principle,
is also developed to efficiently estimate the coefficients of the nonlinear
cancellation filter in the presence of a nonlinear TX PA with memory, finite
passive isolation, and a nonlinear RX LNA. The performance of the proposed
cancellation technique is evaluated through comprehensive RF measurements
adopting commercial LTE-Advanced transceiver hardware components. The results
show that the proposed technique can provide an additional suppression of up to
54 dB for the TX passband leakage signal at the RX LNA input, even at
considerably high transmit power levels and with wide transmission bandwidths.
Such novel cancellation solution can therefore substantially improve the TX-RX
isolation, hence reducing the requirements on passive isolation and RF
component linearity, as well as increasing the efficiency and flexibility of
the RF spectrum use in the emerging 5G radio networks.
