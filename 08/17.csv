evolution of LW envelopes in degenerate plasmas. The nonlocal nonlinearity in
the NLS equation appears due to the group velocity and multi-plasmon

rise the wave damping in the strong quantum regime where $ \hbar k\sim mv_{F}$
with $\hbar$ denoting the reduced Planck's constant, $m$ the electron mass and
$v_F$ the Fermi velocity, however, the three-plasmon process plays a dominant

five stars denoting a high sense of satisfaction.
  Unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, often the star rating provided by

consider the following review for the Facebook App on Android; ""Awesome App"".
One would reasonably expect the rating for this review to be five stars, but
the actual rating is one star!
  Such inconsistent ratings can lead to a deflated (or inflated) overall
average rating of an app which can affect user downloads, as typically users
look at the average star ratings while making a decision on downloading an app.
Also, the app developers receive a biased feedback about the application that

We manually examined 8600 reviews from 10 popular Android apps and found that
20% of the ratings in our dataset were inconsistent with the review. Further,
we developed three systems; two of which were based on traditional machine

observations (side information) about the label of each node. This paper
studies the effect of the quality and quantity of side information on the phase

through a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability $\alpha$, and
when $\log(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}) =O(\log(n))$, it is shown that side
information has a positive effect on phase transition; the new phase transition
under this condition is characterized. When $\alpha$ is constant or approaches
zero sufficiently slowly, i.e., $\log(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}) = o(\log(n))$,
it is shown that side information does not help exact recovery. When the side
information consists of the label observed through a binary erasure channel

that side information improves exact recovery and the new phase transition is
characterized. If $\log(\epsilon)=o(\log(n))$, then it is shown that side
information is not helpful. The results are then generalized to an arbitrary
side information of finite cardinality. Necessary and sufficient conditions are
derived for exact recovery that are tight, except for one special case under

for complex geologic media. Our approach relies on a deep neural network of the
generative adversarial network (GAN) type. After training using a training
image (TI), our proposed spatial GAN (SGAN) can quickly generate 2D and 3D
unconditional realizations. A key characteristic of our SGAN is that it defines
a (very) low-dimensional parameterization, thereby allowing for efficient
probabilistic inversion using state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods. In addition, available direct conditioning data can be incorporated
within the inversion. Several 2D and 3D categorical TIs are first used to
analyze the performance of our SGAN for unconditional geostatistical
simulation. Training our deep network can take several hours. After training,
realizations containing a few millions of pixels/voxels can be produced in a
matter of seconds. This makes it especially useful for simulating many
thousands of realizations (e.g., for MCMC inversion) as the relative cost of
the training per realization diminishes with the considered number of
realizations. Synthetic inversion case studies involving 2D steady-state flow
and 3D transient hydraulic tomography with and without direct conditioning data
are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN-based inversion.
For the 2D case, the inversion rapidly explores the posterior model
distribution. For the 3D case, the inversion recovers model realizations that
fit the data close to the target level and visually resemble the true model
well.

fix-point formulation of Herbrand equivalence on the (infinite) concrete
lattice defined over the set of all terms constructible from variables,
constants and operators of a program. The present characterization uses an
axiomatic formulation of the notion of Herbrand congruence and defines the
(infinite) concrete lattice of Herbrand congruences. Transfer functions and
non-deterministic assignments are formulated as monotone functions over this
concrete lattice. Herbrand equivalence is defined as the maximum fix point of a
composite transfer function defined over an appropriate product lattice of the
above concrete lattice. A re-formulation of the classical meet-over-all-paths
definition of Herbrand equivalence in the above lattice theoretic framework is
also presented and is proven to be equivalent to the new lattice theoretic
fix-point characterization.

effects on the spectral and dynamical evolution may linger long after the

first time, largely self-consistent end-to-end simulations for the evolution of
a massive star from the pre-main sequence, up to and through core collapse, and
into the remnant phase. We present three models and compare and contrast how
the progenitor mass loss history impacts the dynamics and spectral evolution of

steady mass loss, a model with enhanced mass loss over a period of $\sim$ 5000
years prior to core-collapse, and a model with extreme mass loss over a period
of $\sim$ 500 years prior to core collapse. The models are not meant to address
any particular supernova or supernova remnant, but rather to highlight the
important role that the progenitor evolution plays in the observable qualities
of supernovae and supernova remnants. Through comparisons of these three
different progenitor evolution scenarios, we find that the mass loss in late

We prove a sum-vs-product identity relating the bosonic vs fermionic

respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and similar techniques reach their
participants via peer referral. Under a Markov model for RDS, previous research
has shown that if the typical participant refers too many contacts, then the
variance of common estimators does not decay like $O(n^{-1})$, where $n$ is the
sample size. This implies that confidence intervals will be far wider than
under a typical sampling design. Here we show that generalized least squares
(GLS) can effectively reduce the variance of RDS estimates. In particular, a
theoretical analysis indicates that the variance of the GLS estimator is
$O(n^{-1})$. We then derive two classes of feasible GLS estimators. The first
class is based upon a Degree Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel for the underlying
social network. The second class is based upon a rank-two model. It might be of
independent interest that in both model classes, the theoretical results show
that it is possible to estimate the spectral properties of the population
network from the sampled observations. Simulations on empirical social networks
show that the feasible GLS (fGLS) estimators can have drastically smaller error
and rarely increase the error. A diagnostic plot helps to identify where fGLS
will aid estimation. The fGLS estimators continue to outperform standard
estimators even when they are built from a misspecified model and when there is
preferential recruitment.

using the same error model; we provide such a comparison by determining the
entanglement fidelity of all codes with respect to the bosonic pure-loss

compare achievable communication rates of the combined encoding-error-recovery
channel by calculating the channel's hashing bound for each code. Cat and
binomial codes perform similarly, with binomial codes outperforming cat codes
at small loss rates. Despite not being designed to protect against the
pure-loss channel, GKP codes significantly outperform all other codes for most
values of the loss rate. We show that the performance of GKP and some binomial
codes increases monotonically with increasing average photon number of the
codes. In order to corroborate our numerical evidence of the cat/binomial/GKP
order of performance occurring at small loss rates, we analytically evaluate
the quantum error-correction conditions of those codes. For GKP codes, we find
an essential singularity in the entanglement fidelity in the limit of vanishing
loss rate. In addition to comparing the codes, we draw parallels between
binomial codes and discrete-variable systems. First, we characterize one- and
two-mode binomial as well as multi-qubit permutation-invariant codes in terms
of spin-coherent states. Such a characterization allows us to introduce check
operators and error-correction procedures for binomial codes. Second, we
introduce a generalization of spin-coherent states, extending our
characterization to qudit binomial codes and yielding a new multi-qudit code.

we discuss the implementation of color codes in arrays of Majorana nanowires

braiding operations are replaced by Majorana tracking, an entirely

the color-code stabilizer measurements. This approach minimizes the required
hardware operations for single-qubit Clifford gates. For Clifford completeness,
we combine color codes with surface codes, and use color-to-surface-code
lattice surgery for long-range multi-target CNOT gates which have a time
overhead that grows only logarithmically with the physical distance separating
control and target qubits. With the addition of magic state distillation, our

mediated shock from a stellar wind, and exploit it to calculate the
observational diagnostics of the breakout signal. The model accounts for photon
escape through the finite optical depth wind, and treats the fraction of
downstream photons escaping to infinity as an adiabatic parameter that evolves
in a quasi-steady manner. It is shown that the shock is mediated by radiation
even when a large fraction of the downstream photons escape, owing to
self-generation and adjustment of opacity through accelerated pair creation.
Relativistic breakout occurs at radii at which the total optical depth of the
wind ahead of the shock is $\sim (m_e/m_p)\Gamma_{sh}$, provided that the local
shock Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{sh}$ exceeds unity at this location. Otherwise
the breakout occurs in the Newtonian regime. A relativistic breakout is
expected in a highly energetic spherical explosion ($10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg) of a
Wolf-Rayet star, or in cases where a smaller amount of energy ($\sim 10^{51}$
erg) is deposited by a jet in the outer layers of the star. The properties of
the emission observed in such explosions during the relativistic breakout are
derived. We find that for typical parameters about $10^{48}$ ergs are radiated

a second to an hour. Such a signal may be detectable out to 10-100 Mpc by

tetraquarks in light of the recent discovery of the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by LHCb.
For five excited doubly charm baryons that are predicted to lie below the
$\Lambda_c D$ threshold, we give predictions for their electromagnetic and
strong decays using a previously developed chiral Lagrangian with heavy
quark-diquark symmetry. Based on the mass of the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, the existence
of a doubly heavy bottom $I=0$ tetraquark that is stable to the strong and
electromagnetic decays has been predicted. If the mass of this state is below
10405 MeV, as predicted in some models, we argue using heavy quark-diquark
symmetry that the $J^P=1^+$ $I=1$ doubly bottom tetraquark state will lie just
below the open bottom threshold and likely be a narrow state as well. In this
scenario, we compute strong decay width for this state using a new Lagrangian
for tetraquarks which is related to the singly heavy baryon Lagrangian by heavy
quark-diquark symmetry.

model can be interpreted as one-to-an extensive number of quasiparticles on the
ground state or on the highest excited state when written in terms of dimers.
Included in these exact states is a tower of states spanning energies from the
ground state to the highest excited state. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that exact analytic expressions for a tower of excited states have been
found in non-integrable models. Some of the states of the tower appear to be in
the bulk of the energy spectrum, allowing us to make conjectures on the strong
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We also generalize these exact
states including the tower of states to the generalized integer spin AKLT

of Matrix Factorization (MF) methods for implicit feedback. We highlight two
critical issues of existing works. First, due to the large space of unobserved
feedback, most existing works resort to assign a uniform weight to the missing
data to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption is
invalid in real-world settings. Second, most methods are also designed in an
offline setting and fail to keep up with the dynamic nature of online data. We
address the above two issues in learning MF models from implicit feedback. We
first propose to weight the missing data based on item popularity, which is
more effective and flexible than the uniform-weight assumption. However, such a
non-uniform weighting poses efficiency challenge in learning the model. To
address this, we specifically design a new learning algorithm based on the
element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) technique, for efficiently
optimizing a MF model with variably-weighted missing data. We exploit this
efficiency to then seamlessly devise an incremental update strategy that
instantly refreshes a MF model given new feedback. Through comprehensive
experiments on two public datasets in both offline and online protocols, we
show that our eALS method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art implicit MF
methods. Our implementation is available at

variables, such as user IDs and demographics like genders and occupations. To
apply standard machine learning techniques, these categorical predictors are
always converted to a set of binary features via one-hot encoding, making the
resultant feature vector highly sparse. To learn from such sparse data
effectively, it is crucial to account for the interactions between features.
  Factorization Machines (FMs) are a popular solution for efficiently using the
second-order feature interactions. However, FM models feature interactions in a
linear way, which can be insufficient for capturing the non-linear and complex
inherent structure of real-world data. While deep neural networks have recently
been applied to learn non-linear feature interactions in industry, such as the
Wide&Deep by Google and DeepCross by Microsoft, the deep structure meanwhile
makes them difficult to train.
  In this paper, we propose a novel model Neural Factorization Machine (NFM)
for prediction under sparse settings. NFM seamlessly combines the linearity of
FM in modelling second-order feature interactions and the non-linearity of
neural network in modelling higher-order feature interactions. Conceptually,
NFM is more expressive than FM since FM can be seen as a special case of NFM
without hidden layers. Empirical results on two regression tasks show that with
one hidden layer only, NFM significantly outperforms FM with a 7.3% relative
improvement. Compared to the recent deep learning methods Wide&Deep and
DeepCross, our NFM uses a shallower structure but offers better performance,
being much easier to train and tune in practice.

more information to improve the discrimination ability of the model. But, the
learnable parameter scale is not feasible to estimate the capacity of deep

and hidden layer number are already demonstrated not necessary to effectively
increase the network discrimination ability.

evaluate the capacity of deep neural networks for exploring how to
quantitatively understand the deep learning and the insights behind its super
performance. Specifically, our scheme to retrieve the total valid bits
incorporates the skilled techniques in both training phase and inference phase.
In the network training, we design decimal weight regularization and 8-bit
forward quantization to obtain the integer-oriented network representations.
Moreover, we develop adaptive-bitwidth and non-uniform quantization strategy in
the inference phase to find the neural network capacity, total valid bits. By
allowing zero bitwidth, our adaptive-bitwidth quantization can execute the
model reduction and valid bits finding simultaneously. In our extensive
experiments, we first demonstrate that our total valid bits is a good indicator
of neural network capacity. We also analyze the impact on network capacity from
the network architecture and advanced training skills, such as dropout and
batch normalization.

reference He/O ratio in all SEP events is often inconsistent with the
transport-induced power-law trend of the other elements. In fact, the coronal
He/O actually varies rather widely from one SEP event to another. In the large
Fe-rich SEP events with T = 3 MK, where shock waves, driven out by coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), have reaccelerated residual ions from impulsive suprathermal
events that occur earlier in solar active regions, He/O = 90, a ratio similar
to that in the slow solar wind, which may also originate from active regions.
Ions in the large SEP events with T < 2 MK may be accelerated outside active
regions, and have values of 40 < He/O < 60. Mechanisms that determine coronal
abundances, including variations of He/O, are likely to occur near the base of
the corona (at ~ 1.1 RS) and thus to affect both SEPs (at ~2 - 3 RS) and the
solar wind. Other than He, reference coronal abundances for heavier elements
show little temperature dependence or systematic difference between SEP events;
He, the element with the highest first ionization potential, is unique. The
CME-driven shock waves probe the same regions of space, at ~2 RS near active
regions, which are also likely sources of the slow solar wind, providing
complementary information on conditions in those regions.

studying the set of infinite volume ground states for Kitaev's abelian quantum
double models. We show that states describing a single excitation in the bulk
are infinite volume ground states, that is, local perturbations cannot remove
the charge. The single excitations states, which are inequivalent for distinct
charges, give a complete characterization of the sector theory for the set of
ground states. Furthermore, any pure ground state is equivalent to some single
excitation ground state. We proceed to study the stability of charges that are
classified by certain representations of the algebra of observables. We
introduce a new superselection criterion selecting almost localized and
transportable $*$-endomorphisms with respect to a vacuum state. Equivalence
classes of representations satisfying the superselection criterion form
different charged superselection sectors of the system. We show that if the
vacuum state satisfies certain locality conditions then the superselection
structure will be a braided tensor $C^*$-category.
  Further, this superselection structure is stable up to deformations by a
quasi-local dynamics.
  This result is then applied to show that the anyon structure of the abelian
quantum double models is stable under local perturbations.

shown that the most common family-wise error (FWE) controlling procedures in
imaging, which rely on classical mathematical inequalities or Gaussian random
field theory, yield FWE rates that are far from the nominal level. Depending on
the approach used, the FWER can be exceedingly small or grossly inflated. Given
the widespread use of neuroimaging as a tool for understanding neurological and
psychiatric disorders, it is imperative that reliable multiple testing
procedures are available. To our knowledge, only permutation joint testing
procedures have been shown to reliably control the FWER at the nominal level.
However, these procedures are computationally intensive due to the increasingly
available large sample sizes and dimensionality of the images, and analyses can
take days to complete. Here, we develop a parametric bootstrap joint testing
procedure. The parametric bootstrap procedure works directly with the test
statistics, which leads to much faster estimation of adjusted \emph{p}-values
than resampling-based procedures while reliably controlling the FWER in sample
sizes available in many neuroimaging studies. We demonstrate that the procedure
controls the FWER in finite samples using simulations, and present region- and
voxel-wise analyses to test for sex differences in developmental trajectories

first launch a thermal ""fireball"" via neutrino annihilations, and then launch a

hydrocarbons. The resonances reflect the breakup of quasi-bound electron pairs.
The basic premise of this paper is that there is a direct connection between
the quasi-bound pairs and resonant peaks in the optical absorption that are
associated with doubly occupied sites on the perimeter and inside the perimeter
of the molecule. The optical absorption leading to the high-energy resonance
(approximately 40 eV), calculated from a many-site one-dimensional Hubbard
model, has a peak at U, the electrostatic interaction energy for two electrons
with antiparallel spins on the same carbon atom. In the model, there are also
two satellites whose separation from the main resonance is approximately +/-10
eV suggesting that unresolved satellite structure may be contributing to the
linewidth of the resonant peak. The low energy resonances (approximately 10 eV)
involve carbon atoms located inside the perimeter, a configuration present only
in pyrene and coronene (among the hydrocarbons studied). In the case of pyrene,
which has two carbon atoms inside the perimeter, we employ a two-site Hubbard
model to characterize the absorption leading to the quasi-bound state. A brief
analysis of the double photoionization resonance of the heterocyclic inorganic

ion concentration varies linearly with the difference between the photon energy

the random alignment of particles relative to the magnetic field plays a role,
reducing $\chi_{eff}$ by a factor of 3 in some cases, which is not accounted

approach the particle material susceptibility in the limit of large particle
aspect ratio, instead we find a much smaller particle aspect ratio where

spherically symmetric very dense supershell forms, which might become
gravitationally unstable, fragment, and form stars. In this paper we study
under what conditions can an expanding supershell become gravitationally
unstable and how the feedback of these supershell stars (SSSs) affects its
surroundings. We simulate, by means of a 1-D Eulerian hydrocode, the early
evolution of the primordial cloud after the hypernova explosion, the formation
of SSSs, and the following evolution, once the SSSs start to release energy and
heavy elements into the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that a shell,
enriched with nucleosynthetic products from SSSs, propagates inwards, towards
the center of the primordial cloud. In a time span of a few Myr, this
inward-propagating shell reaches a distance of only a few parsec away from the
center of the primordial cloud. Its density is extremely high and its
temperature very low, thus the conditions for a new episode of star formation
are achieved. We study what fraction of these two distinct populations of stars
can remain bound and survive until the present day. We study also under what
conditions can this process repeat and form multiple stellar populations. We
extensively discuss whether the proposed scenario can help to explain some open

conditions for coexistence of prokaryots and viruses is an interesting problem
in evolutionary biology. In this work, we show an intriguing phase diagram of
the virus extinction probability, which is more complex than that of the
classical predator-prey model. As the CRISPR incorporates genetic material,
viruses are under pressure to evolve to escape the recognition by CRISPR. When
bacteria have a small rate of deleting spacers, a new parameter region in which
bacteria and viruses can coexist arises, and it leads to a more complex
coexistence patten for bacteria and viruses. For example, when the virus
mutation rate is low, the virus extinction probability changes non-montonically
with the bacterial exposure rate. The virus and bacteria co-evolution not only
alters the virus extinction probability, but also changes the bacterial
population structure. Additionally, we show that recombination is a successful
strategy for viruses to escape from CRISPR recognition when viruses have
multiple proto-spacers, providing support for a recombination-mediated escape
mechanism suggested experimentally. Finally, we suggest that the reentrant
phase diagram, in which phages can progress through three phases of extinction
and two phases of abundance at low spacer deletion rates as a function of

transposition Markov chain on the set of permutations where neighboring
elements $i$ and $j$ are placed in order $(i,j)$ with probability $p_{i,j}$.
Our goal is to identify the class of parameter sets ${\bf P} = \{p_{i,j}\}$ for
which this Markov chain is rapidly mixing. Specifically, we consider the open
conjecture of Jim Fill that all monotone, positively biased distributions are
rapidly mixing.
  We resolve Fill's conjecture in the affirmative for distributions arising
from $k$-class particle processes, where the elements are divided into $k$
classes and the probability of exchanging neighboring elements depends on the
particular classes the elements are in. We further require that $k$ is a
constant, and all probabilities between elements in different classes are
bounded away from $1/2$. These particle processes arise in the context of
self-organizing lists and our result also applies beyond permutations to the
setting where all particles in a class are indistinguishable. Additionally we
show that a broader class of distributions based on trees is also rapidly
mixing, which generalizes a class analyzed by Bhakta et. al. (SODA '13). Our
work generalizes recent work by Haddadan and Winkler (STACS '17) studying
3-class particle processes.
  Our proof involves analyzing a generalized biased exclusion process, which is
a nearest-neighbor transposition chain applied to a 2-particle system. Biased
exclusion processes are of independent interest, with applications in
self-assembly. We generalize the results of Greenberg et al. (SODA '09) and
Benjamini et. al (Trans. AMS '05) on biased exclusion processes to allow the
probability of swapping neighboring elements to depend on the entire system, as
long as the minimum bias is bounded away from $1$.

the equilateral triangle is the only regular polygon with this property, all

Hartle-Hawking no boundary proposal, as a sum over real Lorentzian
four-geometries interpolating between an initial three-geometry of zero size,
{\it i.e}, a point, and a final three-geometry. With this definition, we
calculated the no boundary amplitude for a closed universe with a cosmological
constant, assuming cosmological symmetry for the background and including
linear perturbations. We found the opposite semiclassical exponent to that
obtained by Hartle and Hawking for the creation of a de Sitter spacetime ""from

an {\it inverse} Gaussian distribution, meaning they are unsuppressed and out
of control. Recently, Diaz Dorronsoro {\it et al.} followed our methods but
attempted to rescue the no boundary proposal by integrating the lapse over a
different, intrinsically complex contour. Here, we show that, in addition to
the desired Hartle-Hawking saddle point contribution, their contour yields
extra, non-perturbative corrections which again render the perturbations
unsuppressed. We prove there is {\it no} choice of complex contour for the

backreaction in the leading semiclassical approximation, fully nonlinearly for
the lowest tensor harmonic and to second order for all higher modes.

capacity on behalf of a group of distributed energy resources (DERs, e.g.
plug-in electric vehicles) in a power market. Our objective is to maximize the
aggregator's revenue while controlling the risk of penalties due to poor
service delivery. To achieve this goal, we propose data-driven risk-averse
strategies to effectively handle uncertainties in: 1) The DER parameters (e.g.,
load demands and flexibilities) and 2) sub-hourly regulation signals (to the
accuracy of every few seconds). We design both the day-ahead and the hour-ahead
strategies. In the day-ahead model, we develop a two-stage stochastic program
to roughly model the above uncertainties, which achieves computational
efficiency by leveraging novel aggregate models of both DER parameters and
sub-hourly regulation signals. In the hour-ahead model, we formulate a
data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained program to explicitly
model the aforementioned uncertainties. This program can effectively control
the quality of regulation service based on the aggregator's risk aversion.
Furthermore, it learns the distributions of the uncertain parameters from
empirical data so that it outperforms existing techniques, (e.g. robust
optimization or traditional chance-constrained programming) in both modelling
accuracy and cost of robustness. Finally, we derive a conic safe approximation
for it which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Numerical

of Markov random fields that capture key combinatorial structures on graphs,
including proper colorings and independent sets, as well as spin systems from
statistical physics. The learning problem is as follows: for a fixed (and
known) constraint graph $H$ with $q$ colors and an unknown graph $G=(V,E)$ with
$n$ vertices, given uniformly random $H$-colorings of $G$, how many samples are
required to learn the edges of the unknown graph $G$? We give a
characterization of $H$ for which the problem is identifiable for every $G$,
i.e., we can learn $G$ with an infinite number of samples. We also show that
there are identifiable constraint graphs for which one cannot hope to learn
every graph $G$ efficiently.
  We focus particular attention on the case of proper vertex $q$-colorings of
graphs of maximum degree $d$ where intriguing connections to statistical
physics phase transitions appear. We prove that in the tree uniqueness region
(when $q>d$) the problem is identifiable and we can learn $G$ in ${\rm
poly}(d,q) \times O(n^2\log{n})$ time. In contrast for soft-constraint systems,
such as the Ising model, the best possible running time is exponential in $d$.
In the tree non-uniqueness region (when $q\leq d$) we prove that the problem is
not identifiable and thus $G$ cannot be learned. Moreover, when $q<d-\sqrt{d} +
\Theta(1)$ we prove that even learning an equivalent graph (any graph with the
same set of $H$-colorings) is computationally hard---sample complexity is
exponential in $n$ in the worst case. We further explore the connection between
the efficiency/hardness of the structure learning problem and the

we study the data transmission process in complex bufferless networks from the

complex-valued linear system comes from linear dynamical quantum control theory

considered system is transformed into an equivalent real-representation system

Some analysis and design problems including solutions, controllability,
observability, stability, eigenvalue assignment, stabilization, linear
quadratic regulation (LQR), and state observer design are then investigated.
Criterion, conditions, and algorithms are provided in terms of the coefficient

to investigate the so-called antilinear system which is a special case of the

ALICE about this secret image to identify it from a fixed pool of images.
  We measure performance of the human-ALICE team by the number of guesses it
takes the human to correctly identify the secret image after a fixed number of

two versions of ALICE. Our human studies suggest a counterintuitive trend -
that while AI literature shows that one version outperforms the other when
paired with an AI questioner bot, we find that this improvement in AI-AI

a mismatch between benchmarking of AI in isolation and in the context of

preprocessing step for a wide range of hyperspectral applications. However, the
HU research has been constrained a lot by three factors: (a) the number of
hyperspectral images (especially the ones with ground truths) are very limited;
(b) the ground truths of most hyperspectral images are not shared on the web,
which may cause lots of unnecessary troubles for researchers to evaluate their
algorithms; (c) the codes of most state-of-the-art methods are not shared,
which may also delay the testing of new methods.
  Accordingly, this paper deals with the above issues from the following three
perspectives: (1) as a profound contribution, we provide a general labeling
method for the HU. With it, we labeled up to 15 hyperspectral images, providing
18 versions of ground truths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
paper to summarize and share up to 15 hyperspectral images and their 18
versions of ground truths for the HU. Observing that the hyperspectral
classification (HyC) has much more standard datasets (whose ground truths are
generally publicly shared) than the HU, we propose an interesting method to
transform the HyC datasets for the HU research. (2) To further facilitate the
evaluation of HU methods under different conditions, we reviewed and
implemented the algorithm to generate a complex synthetic hyperspectral image.
By tuning the hyper-parameters in the code, we may verify the HU methods from
four perspectives. The code would also be shared on the web. (3) To provide a
standard comparison, we reviewed up to 10 state-of-the-art HU algorithms, then
selected the 5 most benchmark HU algorithms, and compared them on the 15 real
hyperspectral datasets. The experiment results are surely reproducible; the
implemented codes would be shared on the web.

thresholding strategy on the real-value representation instead of directly

determination of the Hubble constant (H0) with an uncertainty level on par with
the cosmic distance ladder method. However, to further investigate the nature
of the dark energy, a H0 estimate down to 1% level is greatly needed. This
requires dozens of strongly lensed quasars that are yet to be delivered by
ongoing and forthcoming all-sky surveys.
  Aims: In this work we aim to determine the spectroscopic redshift of
PSOJ0147, the first strongly lensed quasar candidate found in the Pan-STARRS
survey. The main goal of our work is to derive an accurate redshift estimate of
the background quasar for cosmography.
  Methods: To obtain timely spectroscopically follow-up, we took advantage of
the fast-track service programme that is carried out by the Nordic Optical
Telescope. Using a grism covering 3200 - 9600 A, we identified prominent
emission line features, such as Ly-alpha, N V, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, and [C
III] in the spectra of the background quasar of the PSOJ0147 lens system. This
enables us to determine accurately the redshift of the background quasar.
  Results: The spectrum of the background quasar exhibits prominent absorption
features bluewards of the strong emission lines, such as Ly-alpha, N V, and C
IV. These blue absorption lines indicate that the background source is a broad
absorption line (BAL) quasar. Unfortunately, the BAL features hamper an
accurate determination of redshift using the above-mentioned strong emission
lines. Nevertheless, we are able to determine a redshift of 2.341+/-0.001 from
three of the four lensed quasar images with the clean forbidden line [C III].
In addition, we also derive a maximum outflow velocity of ~ 9800 km/s with the
broad absorption features bluewards of the C IV emission line. This value of
maximum outflow velocity is in good agreement with other BAL quasars.

asynchronous-parallel algorithm called ARock, that takes many well-known
asynchronous algorithms as special cases (gradient descent, proximal gradient,
Douglas Rachford, ADMM, etc.). In asynchronous-parallel algorithms, the
computing nodes simply use the most recent information that they have access
to, instead of waiting for a full update from all nodes in the system. This
means that nodes do not have to waste time waiting for information, which can
be a major bottleneck, especially in distributed systems. When the system has
$p$ nodes, asynchronous algorithms may complete $\Theta(\ln(p))$ more
iterations than synchronous algorithms in a given time period (""more iterations
per second"").
  Although asynchronous algorithms may compute more iterations per second,
there is error associated with using outdated information. How many more
iterations in total are needed to compensate for this error is still an open
question. The main results of this paper aim to answer this question. We prove,
loosely, that as the size of the problem becomes large, the number of
additional iterations that asynchronous algorithms need becomes negligible
compared to the total number (""same quality"" of the iterations). Taking these
facts together, our results provide solid evidence of the potential of
asynchronous algorithms to vastly speed up certain distributed computations.

1/2 and 1 we calculate the relevant cross sections through gravitational
annihilation and give the analytic formulas with full mass-dependent terms. We
find that DM with mass between TeV and $10^{16}$GeV could have the relic
abundance that fits the observation, with small dependence on its spin. We also
discuss the effects of gravitational annihilation from inflatons.
Interestingly, contributions from inflatons could be dominant and have the same
power dependence on Hubble parameter of inflation as that from vacuum
fluctuation. Also, fermion production from inflatons, in comparison to boson,
is suppressed by its mass due to helicity selection.

velocities (maximum $v_{98\%}$) of 500-2600 km/s. These minor-axis outflows are
powered primarily by the central AGN, reach scales of 3-12 kpc, and often fill
the field of view. Including molecular data and Type 2 quasar measurements,
nearby quasars show a wide range in mass outflow rates ($dM/dt = 1$ to $>$1000
M$_\odot$/yr) and momentum boosts [($c$ $dp/dt$)/L$_\mathrm{AGN}$ = 0.01-20].
After extending the mass scale to Seyferts, $dM/dt$ and $dE/dt$ correlate with
black hole mass ($dM/dt \sim M_\mathrm{BH}^{0.7\pm0.3}$ and $dE/dt \sim
M_\mathrm{BH}^{1.3\pm0.5}$). Thus, the most massive black holes in the local

stand-alone mode. In particular, stand-alone DC-MG has many distinct
applications. However, the optimal power flow problem of a stand-alone DC-MG is
inherently non-convex. In this paper, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem of
DC-MG is investigated considering convex relaxation based on second-order cone
programming (SOCP). Mild assumptions are proposed to guarantee the exactness of
relaxation, which only require uniform nodal voltage upper bounds and positive
network loss. Furthermore, it is revealed that the exactness of SOCP relaxation
of DC-MGs does not rely on either topology or operating mode of DC-MGs, and an
optimal solution must be unique if it exists. If line constraints are
considered, the exactness of SOCP relaxation may not hold. In this regard, two
heuristic methods are proposed to give approximate solutions. Simulations are
conducted to confirm the theoretic results.

quadratic competition, which describes the reaction between distant
individuals. This equation arises in evolutionary biological systems, where the
arena for the dynamics is trait space, diffusion accounts for mutations and
individuals with similar traits compete, resulting in partial niche overlap. It
has been found that the (non-cutoff) deterministic system gives rise to a
spatially inhomogeneous state for a certain class of interaction kernels, while
the stochastic system produces an inhomogeneous state for small enough
population densities. Here we study the problem of front propagation in this
system, comparing the stochastic dynamics to the heuristic approximation of
this system by a deterministic system where the linear growth term is cut off
below some critical density. Of particular interest is the nontrivial pattern
left behind the front. For large population density, or small cutoff, there is
a constant velocity wave propagating from the populated region to the
unpopulated region. As in the local Fisher equation, the spreading velocity is
much lower than the Fisher velocity which is the spreading velocity for
infinite population size. The stochastic simulations give approximately the
same spreading velocity as the deterministic simulation with appropriate birth
cutoff. When the population density is small enough, there is a different
mechanism of population spreading. The population is concentrated on clusters
which divide and separate. This mode of spreading has small spreading velocity,
decaying exponentially with the range of the interaction kernel.

can be understood in the framework of a stochastic propagation model, where
viscous fluctuations at different radii induce accretion rate variability that
propagate inwards to the X-ray producing region. The scenario successfully
explains the power spectra, the linear rms-flux relation as well as the
time-lag between different energy photons. The predictions of this model have
been obtained using approximate analytical solutions or empirically motivated
models which take into account the effect of these propagating variability on
the radiative process of complex accretion flows. Here, we study the variation
of the accretion rate due to such viscous fluctuations using a hydro-dynamical
code for the standard geometrically thin, gas pressure dominated $\alpha$-disc
with a zero torque boundary condition. Our results confirm earlier findings
that the time-lag between a perturbation and the resultant inner accretion rate
variation depends on the frequency (or time-period) of the perturbation. Here
we have quantified that the time-lag $t_{lag} \propto f^{-0.54}$, for
time-periods less than the viscous time-scale of the perturbation radius and is
nearly constant otherwise. This, coupled with radiative process would produce
the observed frequency dependent time-lag between different energy bands. We
also confirm that if there are random Gaussian fluctuations of the
$\alpha$-parameter at different radii, the resultant inner accretion rate has a
power spectrum which is a power-law.

by computing the electronic structure, mechanical properties and magnetic
exchange parameters. We find that the martensitic phase of Mn$_{2}$NiGa
gradually de-stabilises with increase in concentration of Fe/Co due to the
weakening of the minority spin hybridisation of Ni and Mn atoms occupying
crystallographically equivalent sites. The interplay between relative
structural stability and the compositional changes are understood from the
variations in the elastic modulii and electronic structures. We find that the
elastic shear modulus C$^{\prime}$ can be considered as a predictor of
composition dependence of martensitic transformation temperature in substituted
Mn$_{2}$NiGa. The magnetic properties of Mn$_{2}$NiGa are found to be greatly
improved by the substitutions due to stronger ferromagnetic interactions in the
compounds. The gradually weaker(stronger) Jahn-Teller distortion (covalent
bonding) in the minority spin densities of states due to substitutions lead to
a half-metallic like gap in these compounds resulting in materials with high
spin-polarisation when the substitutions are complete. The substitutions at the
Ga site result in two new compounds Mn$_{2}$NiFe and Mn$_{2}$NiCo with very
high magnetic moments and Curie temperatures. Thus, our work indicates that
although the substitutions de-stabilise the martensitic phase in Mn$_{2}$NiGa,
new magnetic materials with very good magnetic parameters and potentially

gapped from or crossing right through a dispersive band on two-band (i.e., two

the hopping parameters for generic models with up to third-neighbor hoppings,
we first obtain models having a rigorously flat band isolated from a dispersive
band with a gap, which accommodate both rank-reducing and non-rank-reducing of
the Hamiltonian. The class of models include Tasaki's flat-band models, but the
present model has a nonzero flat-band energy, whose gap from the dispersive
band is controllable as well. We then modify the models by appropriately
changing the second- or third-neighbor hoppings, leading to a new class of
two-dimensional lattices where a (slightly warped) flat band pierces a
dispersive one. As with the known flat-band models, the connectivity condition
is satisfied in the present models, so that we have unusual, unorthogonalizable
Wannier orbitals. We have also shown that the present flat-band model can be
extended to three (or higher) dimensions. Implications on possible high-$T_{C}$
superconductivity are discussed when a repulsive electron-electron interaction
is introduced, where the flat band is envisaged to be utilized as intermediate
states in pair scattering processes.

Under conditions of use, the stability of the aluminium phase-plate, is

Fourier-transformation is observed, when inserting the thin-film into the beam
at the back-focal-plane. This distortion is a negative, spatial-frequency
dependent phase-shift, that is not equal to a focus-change. A phase-shift and
an increase of contrast, is observed for the tested phase-plates. Different
types of self-sustaining metal-films are produced with a technique, invented by
Janbroers et al. All metal-films, produced at room-temperature, exhibit a
polycrystalline structure, while carbon-films are amorphous. However, a high
crystallinity is unfavored, causing distortions in the image and an increase of
electron-scattering in the phase-plate, due to diffraction. Using
cryo-deposition, metal-films are obtained that combine an amorphous structure
with beneficial properties of metals such as lower charging and prolonged
durability. Investigations with TEM, show a great potential of those cryo-films
as material for Zernike phase-plates. Thickness-measurements are successfully
carried out with atomic-force-mycroscopy at step-edges between the thin-film

inner regions of protoplanetary discs, but the source of ubiquitous thermal
processing of their dust aggregate precursors remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate that escape of positrons released in the decay of the short-lived
radionuclide $^{26}$Al leads to a large-scale charging of dense pebble
structures, resulting in neutralisation by lightning discharge and
flash-heating of dust and pebbles. This charging mechanism is similar to a
nuclear battery where a radioactive source charges a capacitor. We show that
the nuclear battery effect operates in circumplanetesimal pebble discs. The
extremely high pebble densities in such discs are consistent with conditions
during chondrule heating inferred from the high abundance of sodium within
chondrules. The sedimented mid-plane layer of the protoplanetary disc may also
be prone to charging by the emission of positrons, if the mass density of small
dust there is at least an order of magnitude above the gas density. Our results
imply that the decay energy of $^{26}$Al can be harvested to drive intense
lightning activity in protoplanetary discs. The total energy stored in positron
emission is comparable to the energy needed to melt all solids in the

We study the
fundamental heavy-hitters problem in this setting. Formally, the data stream
consists of $d$-dimensional items $x_1,\ldots,x_m \in [n]^d$. A $k$-dimensional
subcube $T$ is a subset of distinct coordinates $\{ T_1,\cdots,T_k \} \subseteq
[d]$. A subcube heavy hitter query ${\rm Query}(T,v)$, $v \in [n]^k$, outputs
YES if $f_T(v) \geq \gamma$ and NO if $f_T(v) < \gamma/4$, where $f_T$ is the
ratio of number of stream items whose coordinates $T$ have joint values $v$.
The all subcube heavy hitters query ${\rm AllQuery}(T)$ outputs all joint
values $v$ that return YES to ${\rm Query}(T,v)$. The one dimensional version
of this problem where $d=1$ was heavily studied in data stream theory,
databases, networking and signal processing. The subcube heavy hitters problem
is applicable in all these cases.
  We present a simple reservoir sampling based one-pass streaming algorithm to
solve the subcube heavy hitters problem in $\tilde{O}(kd/\gamma)$ space. This
is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors given the established lower bound. In
the worst case, this is $\Theta(d^2/\gamma)$ which is prohibitive for large
$d$, and our goal is to circumvent this quadratic bottleneck.
  Our main contribution is a model-based approach to the subcube heavy hitters
problem. In particular, we assume that the dimensions are related to each other
via the Naive Bayes model, with or without a latent dimension. Under this
assumption, we present a new two-pass, $\tilde{O}(d/\gamma)$-space algorithm
for our problem, and a fast algorithm for answering ${\rm AllQuery}(T)$ in
$O(k/\gamma^2)$ time. Our work develops the direction of model-based data
stream analysis, with much that remains to be explored.

Galactic bulge fields based on the APOGEE commissioning observations. Both the
existence and the nature of the high-velocity peak are still under debate. Here
we revisit this feature with the latest APOGEE DR13 data. We find that most of
the low latitude bulge fields display a skewed Gaussian distribution with a HV
shoulder. However, only 3 out of 53 fields show distinct high-velocity peaks
around 200 km/s. The velocity distribution can be well described by
Gauss-Hermite polynomials, except the three fields showing clear HV peaks. We
find that the correlation between the skewness parameter ($h_{3}$) and the mean
velocity ($\bar{v}$), instead of a distinctive HV peak, is a strong indicator
of the bar. It was recently suggested that the HV peak is composed of
preferentially young stars. We choose three fields showing clear HV peaks to
test this hypothesis using the metallicity, [$\alpha$/M] and [C/N] as age
proxies. We find that both young and old stars show HV features. The similarity
between the chemical abundances of stars in the HV peaks and the main component
indicates that they are not systematically different in terms of chemical
abundance or age. In contrast, there are clear differences in chemical space
between stars in the Sagittarius dwarf and the bulge stars. The strong HV peaks
off-plane are still to be explained properly, and could be different in nature.

observe strong n-type conduction upon insertion of the h-BN at the Co/BP

the much larger interface dipole at the Co/h-BN interface compared to the Co/BP
interface, which reduces the work function of the Co/h-BN contact. The Co/h-BN
contacts exhibit low contact resistances (~ 4.5 k-ohm), and are Schottky
barrier free. This allows us to probe high electron mobilities (4,200 cm2/Vs)

sequence to avoid loops, as tourists typically would not wish to revisit the

find the highest-scoring sequence that is loop-free? This paper studies this

extensions of the Viterbi algorithm -- and qualitatively summarise their
strengths and weaknesses. Second, we explicate how two ostensibly different

Third, we conduct experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets

momentum distributions , bearing a universal character, results from a general
property of realistic nuclear wave functions, namely their factorization at
short inter-nucleon separations. The factorization of the two-nucleon momentum
distribution allows one to develop the correlated part of the nucleon spectral
function P(k,E) in terms of a convolution integral involving the product of the
many-body, parameter-free relative and c.m. momentum distributions of a given
nucleus. It is shown that: (i) the obtained spectral function perfectly

energy E, it fully reproduces the momentum distributions obtained from
realistic many-body wave functions , (ii) in order to saturate the momentum sum
rule at high values of the momentum (k \simeq 5 fm^{-1}) the spectral function
has to be integrate up to E \simeq 400 MeV. To sum up a realistic,
parameter-free many-body Spectral function has been developed such that : i) a

  OverLapping-Echo Detachment Planar Imaging Based on Deep Residual Network","18 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: An end-to-end deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep
residual network (ResNet) was proposed to efficiently reconstruct reliable T2
mapping from single-shot OverLapping-Echo Detachment (OLED) planar imaging.
Methods: The training dataset was obtained from simulations carried out on
SPROM software developed by our group. The relationship between the original
OLED image containing two echo signals and the corresponded T2 mapping was
learned by ResNet training. After the ResNet was trained, it was applied to
reconstruct the T2 mapping from simulation and in vivo human brain data.
Results: Though the ResNet was trained entirely on simulated data, the trained
network was generalized well to real human brain data. The results from
simulation and in vivo human brain experiments show that the proposed method
significantly outperformed the echo-detachment-based method. Reliable T2
mapping was achieved within tens of milliseconds after the network had been
trained while the echo-detachment-based OLED reconstruction method took
minutes. Conclusion: The proposed method will greatly facilitate real-time
dynamic and quantitative MR imaging via OLED sequence, and ResNet has the
potential to reconstruct images from complex MRI sequence efficiently.

adoption of smart water systems has been hindered by a limited number of proven
case studies, along with a lack of guidance on how smart water systems should
be built. To this end, we review existing solutions, and introduce open
storm---an open-source, end-to-end platform for real-time monitoring and
control of watersheds. Open storm includes (i) a robust hardware stack for
distributed sensing and control in harsh environments (ii) a cloud services
platform that enables system-level supervision and coordination of water
assets, and (iii) a comprehensive, web-based ""how-to"" guide, available on
open-storm.org, that empowers newcomers to develop and deploy their own smart
water networks. We illustrate the capabilities of the open storm platform
through two ongoing deployments: (i) a high-resolution flash-flood monitoring
network that detects and communicates flood hazards at the level of individual
roadways and (ii) a real-time stormwater control network that actively
modulates discharges from stormwater facilities to improve water quality and
reduce stream erosion. Through these case studies, we demonstrate the
real-world potential for smart water systems to enable sustainable management

show that the applied strain alters the quantum phases of electrons passing

energies of electronic transport resonances to shift, which affects the
thermoelectric voltage. These experimental and theoretical studies reveal that
Au atomic junctions can be made to exhibit both positive and negative

equations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations

implemented in PyCosmo. We then compare the predictions and performance of the
code for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological

that we achieve comparable execution times for comparable accuracies. While
PyCosmo does not yet have all the features of other codes, our approach is
complementary to existing cosmological Boltzmann solvers and can be used as an
independent test of their numerical solutions. The symbolic representation of
the Einstein-Boltzmann equation system in PyCosmo provides a convenient
interface for implementing extended cosmological models. We also discuss how

terms of the Hasse diagrams of the lattices of non-crossing partitions $NC(n)$.
In this equivalent description, the number of components of a random meandric
system of order $n$ translates into the distance between two partitions in
$NC(n)$. We focus on a class of couples $(\pi,\rho)\in NC(n)^2$ -- namely the
ones where $\pi$ is conditioned to be an interval partition -- for which it
turns out to be tractable to study distances in the Hasse diagram. As a
consequence, we observe a non-trivial class of meanders (i.e. connected
meandric systems), which we call ""meanders with shallow top"", and which can be
explicitly enumerated. Moreover, the expected number of components for a random
""meandric system with shallow top"", is asymptotically $(9n+28)/27$. Our
calculations concerning expected number of components are related to the idea
of taking the derivative at $t=1$ in a semigroup for the operation $\boxplus$
of free probability (but the underlying considerations are presented in a
self-contained way, and can be followed without assuming a free probability
background).
  Let $c_{n}'$ denote the expected number of components of a general,
unconditioned, meandric system of order $n$. A variation of the methods used in
the shallow-top case allows us to prove that $\mathrm{lim\

argument, one has $\mathrm{lim\ sup}_{n\to\infty}c_{n}'/n\leq0.5$. These bounds
support the conjecture that $c_{n}'$ follows a regime of ""constant times $n$""

nanoscale asperities, which may dynamically appear due to different processes
ongoing in the surface and subsurface layers in the presence of high electric
fields. Thermally activated processes, as well as plastic deformation caused by
tensile stress due to an applied electric field, are usually not accessible by
atomistic simulations because of long time needed for these processes to occur.
On the other hand, finite element methods, able to describe the process of
plastic deformations in materials at realistic stresses, do not include surface
properties. The latter are particularly important for the problems where the
surface plays crucial role in the studied process, as for instance, in case of
plastic deformations at a nanovoid. In the current study by means of molecular
dynamics and finite element simulations we analyse the stress distribution in
single crystal copper containing a nanovoid buried deep under the surface. We
have developed a methodology to incorporate the surface effects into the solid
mechanics framework by utilizing elastic properties of crystals, pre-calculated
using molecular dynamic simulations. The method leads to computationally
efficient stress calculations and can be easily implemented in commercially
available finite element software, making it an attractive analysis tool.

the activity level of BA14 appears to be at least three orders of magnitude
lower than that of 252P, despite its ten times or larger surface area.

writing good and relevant tests remains a quite challenging task. One
well-known problem is that it often is impossible or unrealistic to test for
every outcome, as the input and/or output of a program component can represent
incredbly large, unless infinite domains. A common approach to tackle this
issue it to only test classes of cases, and to assume that those classes cover
all (or at least most) of the cases a component is susceptible to be exposed
to. Unfortunately, those kind of assumptions can prove wrong in many
situations, causing a yet well-tested program to fail upon a particular input.
In this short paper, we propose to leverage formal verification, in particular
model checking techniques, as a way to better identify cases for which the
aforementioned assumptions do not hold, and ultimately strenghten the
confidence one can have in a test suite. The idea is to extract a formal
specification of the data types of a program, in the form of a term rewriting
system, and to check that specification against a set of properties specified
by the programmer. Cases for which tose properties do not hold can then be
identified using model checking, and selected as test cases.

$f:I\to\mathbb{C}$ is entrywise positivity preserving on positive semidefinite
(p.s.d.) matrices $A=(a_{jk})\in I^{N\times N}$, if the entrywise application
$f[A]=(f(a_{jk}))$ of $f$ to $A$ is p.s.d. for all such $A$. Such preservers in
all dimensions have been classified by Schoenberg and Rudin as being absolutely
monotonic [Duke Math. J. 1942, 1959]. In fixed dimension $N$, results akin to
work of Horn and Loewner [Trans. AMS 1969] show the first $N$ nonzero Maclaurin
coefficients of a positivity preserver $f$ are positive; and the last $N$
coefficients are also positive if $I$ is unbounded. However, little was known
about the other coefficients: the only examples to date for unbounded domains
$I$ were absolutely monotonic, so work in all dimensions; and for bounded $I$
examples of non-absolutely monotonic preservers were very few (and recent).
  In this paper, we completely characterize the sign patterns of the Maclaurin
coefficients of positivity preservers in fixed dimension $N$, over bounded and
unbounded domains $I$. In particular, the above Horn-type conditions cannot be
improved upon. This also yields the first polynomials which preserve positivity
on p.s.d. matrices in $I^{N\times N}$ but not in $I^{(N+1)\times (N+1)}$. We
obtain analogous results for real exponents using the
Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula.
  We then go from qualitative bounds, which suffice to understand all possible
sign patterns, to exact quantitative bounds. As an application, we extend our
previous qualitative and quantitative results to understand preservers of total
non-negativity in fixed dimension - including their sign patterns. We deduce
several further applications, including extending a Schur polynomial conjecture
by Cuttler-Greene-Skandera to obtain a novel characterization of weak
majorization for real tuples.

managing that can be solved, dynamic opportunistic exploitation of spectral
bands has been considered, under the name of Cognitive Radio (CR). This
technology allows secondary users to access currently idle spectral bands by
detecting and tracking the spectrum occupancy. The CR application revisits this
traditional task with specific and severe requirements in terms of spectrum
sensing and detection performance, real-time processing, robustness to noise
and more. Unfortunately, conventional methods do not satisfy these demands for
typical signals, that often have very high Nyquist rates.
  Recently, several sampling methods have been proposed that exploit signals' a
priori known structure to sample them below the Nyquist rate. Here, we review
some of these techniques and tie them to the task of spectrum sensing in the
context of CR. We then show how issues related to spectrum sensing can be
tackled in the sub-Nyquist regime. First, to cope with low signal to noise
ratios, we propose to recover second-order statistics from the low rate
samples, rather than the signal itself. In particular, we consider
cyclostationary based detection, and investigate CR networks that perform
collaborative spectrum sensing to overcome channel effects. To enhance the
efficiency of the available spectral bands detection, we present joint spectrum

stationary current with a given flow rate. Due to the fixed flow rate, the
current speed is different in the different sections of the canal, upstream and
downstream. The scattering coefficients (the transmission and reflection
coefficients) are calculated for all possible orientations of incident wave
with respect to the background current (downstream and upstream propagation)
and for all possible regimes of current (subcritical, transcritical, and
supercritical). It is shown that in some cases negative energy waves can appear
in the process of waves scattering. The conditions are found when the
overreflection and over-transmission phenomena occur. In particular, it is
shown that a spontaneous wave generation can arise in a trans-critical
accelerating flow, when the background current enhances due to the canal
narrowing. This resembles a spontaneous wave generation on the horizon of an
evaporating black hole due to the Hawking effect.

in the operation of the solar dynamo, indicate that its speed varies with the
solar cycle, becoming faster during the solar minima and slower during the
solar maxima. To explain this variation of the meridional circulation with the
solar cycle, we construct a theoretical model by coupling the equation of the
meridional circulation (the $\phi$ component of the vorticity equation within
the solar convection zone) with the equations of the flux transport dynamo
model. We consider the back reaction due to the Lorentz force of the
dynamo-generated magnetic fields and study the perturbations produced in the
meridional circulation due to it. This enables us to model the variations of
the meridional circulation without developing a full theory of the meridional
circulation itself. We obtain results which reproduce the observational data of
solar cycle variations of the meridional circulation reasonably well. We get
the best results on assuming the turbulent viscosity acting on the velocity
field to be comparable to the magnetic diffusivity (i.e. on assuming the
magnetic Prandtl number to be close to unity). We have to assume an appropriate
bottom boundary condition to ensure that the Lorentz force cannot drive a flow
in the subadiabatic layers below the bottom of the tachocline. Our results are
sensitive to this bottom boundary condition. We also suggest a hypothesis how
the observed inward flow towards the active regions may be produced.

heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units by sensing the comfort
requirements automatically and scheduling the HVAC operations dynamically.
Traditional building automation systems rely on fairly inaccurate occupancy
sensors and basic predictive control using oversimplified building thermal
response models, all of which prevent such systems from reaching their full
potential. Such limitations can now be avoided due to the recent developments
in embedded system technologies, which provide viable low-cost computing
platforms with powerful processors and sizeable memory storage in a small
footprint. As a result, building automation systems can now efficiently execute
highly-sophisticated computational tasks, such as real-time video processing
and accurate thermal-response simulations. With this in mind, we designed and
implemented an occupancy-predictive HVAC control system in a low-cost yet
powerful embedded system (using Raspberry Pi 3) to demonstrate the following
key features for building automation: (1) real-time occupancy recognition using
video-processing and machine-learning techniques, (2) dynamic analysis and
prediction of occupancy patterns, and (3) model predictive control for HVAC
operations guided by real-time building thermal response simulations (using an
on-board EnergyPlus simulator). We deployed and evaluated our system for
providing automatic HVAC control in the large public indoor space of a mosque,
thereby achieving significant energy savings.

Layered SCHC (LSCHC). LSCHC is a layered context that reduces memory

in detail the statistics of $t_w$ for melting at different energies by
performing a large number of Z-method simulations and applying state-of-the-art

of the distribution function, we show that $t_w$ is actually gamma-distributed

unavoidable truncation of the distribution function due to the limited total

non-trivial task since it requires to tackle challenging issues of the shortage
of annotated data, inability of defining anomaly objects explicitly and the
expensive cost of feature engineering procedure. Unlike existing appoaches
which only partially solve these problems, we develop a unique framework to
cope the problems above simultaneously. Instead of hanlding with ambiguous
definition of anomaly objects, we propose to work with regular patterns whose
unlabeled data is abundant and usually easy to collect in practice. This allows
our system to be trained completely in an unsupervised procedure and liberate
us from the need for costly data annotation. By learning generative model that
capture the normality distribution in data, we can isolate abnormal data points
that result in low normality scores (high abnormality scores). Moreover, by
leverage on the power of generative networks, i.e. energy-based models, we are
also able to learn the feature representation automatically rather than
replying on hand-crafted features that have been dominating anomaly detection
research over many decades. We demonstrate our proposal on the specific

having a self-propulsion foce $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$. Using the
extended MCT and a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we calculate
the effective temperature $T_{eff}$ of the active fluid. The nonequilibrium
nature of the systems is manifested through a time-dependent $T_{eff}$ that
approaches a constant in the long-time limit, which depends on the activity
parameters $f_0$ and $\tau_p$. We find, phenomenologically, that this long-time
limit is captured by the potential energy of a single, trapped active particle
(STAP). Through a scaling analysis close to the MCT glass transition point, we
show that $\tau_\alpha$, the $\alpha$-relaxation time, behaves as
$\tau_\alpha\sim f_0^{-2\gamma}$, where $\gamma=1.74$ is the MCT exponent for
the passive system. $\tau_\alpha$ may increase or decrease as a function of
$\tau_p$ depending on the type of active force correlations, but the behavior
is always governed by the same value of the exponent $\gamma$. Comparison with
numerical solution of the nonequilibrium MCT as well as simulation results give
excellent agreement with the scaling analysis.

defining such patterns are expressed with specific languages, users of these
technologies must understand the underlying expression syntax. To reduce the
complexity of writing CEP rules, some researchers are employing Domain Specific
Modeling Language (DSML) to provide modelling through visual tools. However,
existing approaches are ignoring some user design techniques that facilitate
usability. Thus, resulting tools eventually has become more complexes for

remaining open challenges is to achieve real-time speed on the CPU as well as
maintain high performance, since effective models for face detection tend to be
computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel face
detector, named FaceBoxes, with superior performance on both speed and
accuracy. Specifically, our method has a lightweight yet powerful network
structure that consists of the Rapidly Digested Convolutional Layers (RDCL) and
the Multiple Scale Convolutional Layers (MSCL). The RDCL is designed to enable
FaceBoxes to achieve real-time speed on the CPU. The MSCL aims at enriching the
receptive fields and discretizing anchors over different layers to handle faces
of various scales. Besides, we propose a new anchor densification strategy to
make different types of anchors have the same density on the image, which
significantly improves the recall rate of small faces. As a consequence, the
proposed detector runs at 20 FPS on a single CPU core and 125 FPS using a GPU
for VGA-resolution images. Moreover, the speed of FaceBoxes is invariant to the
number of faces. We comprehensively evaluate this method and present
state-of-the-art detection performance on several face detection benchmark
datasets, including the AFW, PASCAL face, and FDDB. Code is available at

framework to handle different scales of faces well. We tile anchors on a wide
range of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for
detection. Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptive
field and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving the
recall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3)
reducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label.

improved MCMC sampling over the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm on
multi-modal posteriors, including Boltzmann machines and models with
sparsity-inducing priors.

laws in the literature, especially for viscous interactions. We numerically
measure the complex shear modulus $G^*$ of jammed packings for various viscous

flow conditions and in concentration ranges which are found in a large number
of industrial applications. MLVs are typically formed from a lamellar phase and
play an important role in determining the rheological properties of surfactant
solutions. Despite the wide literature on the collective dynamics of flowing
MLVs, investigations on the flow behavior of single MLVs are scarce. In this
work, we investigate a concentrated aqueous solution of linear alkylbenzene
sulfonic acid (HLAS), characterized by MLVs dispersed in an isotropic micellar
phase. Rheological tests show that the HLAS solution is a shear-thinning fluid
with a power law index dependent on the shear rate. Pressure-driven shear flow
of the HLAS solution in glass capillaries is investigated by high-speed video
microscopy and image analysis. The so obtained velocity profiles provide
evidence of a power-law fluid behaviour of the HLAS solution and images show a
flow-focusing effect of the lamellar phase in the central core of the
capillary. The flow behavior of individual MLVs shows analogies with that of
unilamellar vesicles and emulsion droplets. Deformed MLVs exhibit typical
shapes of unilamellar vesicles, such as parachute and bullet-like. Furthermore,
MLV velocity follows the classical Hetsroni theory for droplets provided that
the power law shear dependent viscosity of the HLAS solution is taken into
account. The results of this work are relevant for the processing of
surfactant-based systems in which the final properties depend on flow-induced
morphology, such as cosmetic formulations and food products.

conjecture that a finite simple group $G$ is strongly real (all elements are
conjugate to their inverses by an involution) if and only if it is totally
orthogonal (all Frobenius-Schur indicators are 1), and we are able to show this
holds for all finite simple groups $G$ other than the groups

to compute the asymptotic behavior for the number of involutions in these

core-collapse simulations with approximate neutrino transport for three
non-rotating progenitors (11.2, 15, and 40 Msun) using different nuclear
equations of state (EOSs). We find that the combination of progenitor's higher
compactness at bounce and the use of softer EOS leads to stronger activity of
the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). We confirm previous
predications that the SASI produces characteristic time modulations both in
neutrino and gravitational-wave (GW) signals. By performing a correlation
analysis of the SASI-modulated neutrino and GW signals, we find that the
correlation becomes highest when we take into account the time-delay effect due
to the advection of material from the neutrino sphere to the proto-neutron star
core surface. Our results suggest that the correlation of the neutrino and GW
signals, if detected, would provide a new signature of the vigorous SASI
activity in the supernova core, which can be hardly seen if neutrino-convection
dominates over the SASI.

  https://github.com/kerschke/flacco",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Choosing the best-performing optimizer(s) out of a portfolio of optimization
algorithms is usually a difficult and complex task. It gets even worse, if the
underlying functions are unknown, i.e., so-called Black-Box problems, and
function evaluations are considered to be expensive. In the case of continuous
single-objective optimization problems, Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) -
a sophisticated and effective approach for characterizing the landscapes of
such problems by means of numerical values before actually performing the
optimization task itself - is advantageous. Unfortunately, until now it has
been quite complicated to compute multiple ELA features simultaneously, as the
corresponding code has been - if at all - spread across multiple platforms or
at least across several packages within these platforms.
  This article presents a broad summary of existing ELA approaches and
introduces flacco, an R-package for feature-based landscape analysis of
continuous and constrained optimization problems. Although its functions
neither solve the optimization problem itself nor the related ""Algorithm
Selection Problem (ASP)"", it offers easy access to an essential ingredient of
the ASP by providing a wide collection of ELA features on a single platform -
even within a single package. In addition, flacco provides multiple
visualization techniques, which enhance the understanding of some of these
numerical features, and thereby make certain landscape properties more
comprehensible. On top of that, we will introduce the package's build-in, as
well as web-hosted and hence platform-independent, graphical user interface
(GUI), which facilitates the usage of the package - especially for people who
are not familiar with R - making it a very convenient toolbox when working
towards algorithm selection of continuous single-objective optimization
problems.

effect (QAZE) in open quantum systems (implicitly) assumes the bath
(environment) state returning to its original state after each instantaneous
projective measurement on the system and thus ignores the cross-correlations of
the bath operators between different Zeno intervals. However, this assumption
is not generally true, especially for a bath with a considerably non-negligible
memory effect and for a system repeatedly projected into an initial general
superposition state. We find that in stark contrast to the result of a constant
value found in the traditional approach, the scaled average decay rate in unit
Zeno interval of the survival probability is generally time-dependent or has an
oscillatory behavior. In the case of strong bath correlation, the transition
between the QZE and QAZE depends sensitively on the number of measurements $N$.
For a fixed $N$, a QZE region predicted by the tradition approach may be in
fact already in the QAZE region. We illustrate our findings using an exactly
solvable open qubit system model with a Lorentzian bath spectral density, which
is directly related to realistic circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics
systems. Thus the results and dynamics presented here can be verified by

the precessing magnetization. In an earth-range field, a multi-component
asymmetric magnetic-resonance line with ? 60 Hz width collapses into a single
peak with a width of 22 Hz, whose position is largely independent of the

decreasing its width and removing the important and limiting heading-error

layer by a CdMgTe barrier with a thickness on the order of 10~nm. The exchange
interaction is manifested by the spin splitting of acceptor bound holes in the
effective magnetic field induced by the FM. The exchange splitting is directly
evaluated using spin-flip Raman scattering by analyzing the dependence of the
Stokes shift $\Delta_S$ on the external magnetic field $B$. We show that in
strong magnetic field $\Delta_S$ is a linear function of $B$ with an offset of
$\Delta_{pd} = 50-100~\mu$eV at zero field from the FM induced effective
exchange field. On the other hand, the $s-d$ exchange interaction between

much more challenging than the single-cell case because inter-cell interference
must be considered. Most papers addressing NOMA consider a single cell. We take
a significant step of analyzing NOMA in multi-cell scenarios. We explore the
potential of NOMA networks in achieving optimal resource utilization with
arbitrary topologies. Towards this goal, we investigate a broad class of
problems consisting in optimizing power allocation and user pairing for any
cost function that is monotonically increasing in time-frequency resource
consumption. We propose an algorithm that achieves global optimality for this
problem class. The basic idea is to prove that solving the joint optimization
problem of power allocation, user pair selection, and time-frequency resource
allocation amounts to solving a so-called iterated function without a closed
form. We prove that the algorithm approaches optimality with fast convergence.
Numerically, we evaluate and demonstrate the performance of NOMA for multi-cell
scenarios in terms of resource efficiency and load balancing.

paper by Scoccimarro demonstrated how the standard bispectrum estimator may be
expressed in terms of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to afford an extremely
efficient algorithm, allowing the bispectrum multipoles on all scales and
triangle shapes to be measured in comparable time to those of the power
spectrum. In this paper we present a suite of alternative proxies to measure
the three-point correlation multipoles. In particular, we describe a modal (or
plane wave) decomposition to capture the information in each multipole in a
series of basis coefficients, and also describe three compressed estimators
formed using the skew-spectrum, the line correlation function and the
integrated bispectrum, respectively. As well as each of the estimators offering
a different measurement channel, and thereby a robustness check, it is expected
that some (especially the modal estimator) will offer a vast data compression,

reduce the computational load involved in extracting the available three-point

the Janus ansatz as holographic duals to renormalization group flows in the
boundary conformal field theory. In the former metric, subregion complexity is
computed for a disc and a strip shaped entangling region. For the disc shaped
region, consistent emergence of length scales for flow to the deep infra-red is
established. For strip shaped regions, we find that complexity cannot locate
holographic phase transitions in a sharp domain wall scenario. For smooth
domain walls, we find that the complexity might be an indicator of such phase

across a transition. Finally, the complexity is computed numerically using the

materials) due to lubrication forces can also alter the interpretation of
dynamic surface forces measurements and prevent contact formation between
approaching surfaces. Understanding the role of elastic deformation on the
process of fluid drainage is necessary, and the case where one (or both) of the
interacting materials consists of a rigid substrate with a soft coating is
still limited. We combine lubrication theory and solid linear elasticity to
describe the dynamic of fluid drainage past a compliant stratified boundary.
The analysis presented covers the full range of coating thicknesses, from an
elastic foundation to a half-space for an incomressible coating. We decouple
the individual contributions of the coating thickness and material properties
on the elastic deformation, hydrodynamic forces, and fluid film thickness. We
obtain a simple expression for the shift in contact position during force
measurements that is valid for many experimental conditions. We compare
directly the effect of stratification on the out-of-contact deformation to the
well-known effect of stratification on indentation. We show that corrections
developed for stratification in contact mechanics are not applicable to
elastohydrodynamic deformation. Finally, we provide generalized contour maps
that can be employed directly to estimate the elastic deformation present in
most dynamic surface force measurements.

design models which can successfully learn to recognize and represent musical
structure. A fundamental problem is that structurally related patterns can have
very distinct appearances, because the structural relationships are often based
on transformations of musical material, like chromatic or diatonic
transposition, inversion, retrograde, or rhythm change. In this preliminary
work, we study the potential of two unsupervised learning techniques -
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Gated Autoencoders (GAEs) - to capture
pre-defined transformations from constructed data pairs. We evaluate the models
by using the learned representations as inputs in a discriminative task where
for a given type of transformation (e.g. diatonic transposition), the specific
relation between two musical patterns must be recognized (e.g. an upward
transposition of diatonic steps). Furthermore, we measure the reconstruction
error of models when reconstructing musical transformed patterns. Lastly, we
test the models in an analogy-making task. We find that it is difficult to
learn musical transformations with the RBM and that the GAE is much more
adequate for this task, since it is able to learn representations of specific
transformations that are largely content-invariant. We believe these results
show that models such as GAEs may provide the basis for more encompassing music
analysis systems, by endowing them with a better understanding of the
structures underlying music.

attractive researches. We carried out extensive ab-initio density functional
theory (DFT) simulations to investigate the adsorption of various elements
including nonmetallic, metalloidic and metallic elements on the C3N monolayer.
While pristine C3N acts as a semiconductor with an indirect electronic band
gap; the functionalization with nonmetallic and semimetallic elements leads to
a p-type doping and induces metallic behavior to the monolayer. On the other
hand, metallic adsorption depending on the adatom size and the number of
valence electrons may result in semiconducting, half-metallic or metallic
properties. Whenever metallic foreign atoms conduct metallic characteristics,
they mostly lead to the n-type doping by electron donation to the surface.
Moreover, adsorption of transition metals could enhance the magnetic behavior
of the monolayer due to the contribution of d electronic states. These results
suggest that C3N illustrates viable electronic-magnetic properties which could
be promising for semiconducting, nanosensores and catalytic applications.

local-Universe survey. We constructed a database containing our own custom
Herschel reductions, along with standardised archival observations from GALEX,
SDSS, DSS, 2MASS, WISE, Spitzer, and Planck. Using these data, we performed
consistent aperture-matched photometry, which we combined with external
supplementary photometry from IRAS and Planck. We present our multiwavelength
imagery and photometry across 42 UV-microwave bands for the 875 DustPedia
galaxies. Our aperture-matched photometry, combined with the external
supplementary photometry, represents a total of 21,857 photometric
measurements. A typical DustPedia galaxy has multiwavelength photometry
spanning 25 bands. We also present the Comprehensive & Adaptable Aperture
Photometry Routine (CAAPR), the pipeline we developed to carry out our
aperture-matched photometry. CAAPR is designed to produce consistent photometry
for the enormous range of galaxy and observation types in our data. In
particular, CAAPR is able to determine robust cross-compatible uncertainties,
thanks to a novel method for reliably extrapolating the aperture noise for
observations that cover a very limited amount of background. Our rich database

Our analysis employs recent advances in the interpretation of the venerable

the competition between Grover's abstract algorithm, i.e., a rotation in
Hilbert space, and quantum transport in an actual geometry. The latter is
characterized in terms of the quantum walk dimension $d_{w}^{Q}$ and the
spatial (fractal) dimension $d_{f}$ that is summarized simply by the spectral
dimension of the network. The analysis simultaneously determines the optimal
time for a quantum measurement and the probability for successfully
pin-pointing a marked element in the network. The RG further encompasses an
optimization scheme devised by Tulsi that allows to tune this probability to
certainty, leaving quantum transport as the only limiting process. It considers
entire families of problems to be studied, thereby establishing large
universality classes for quantum search, which we verify with extensive

approximation for the velocity field, whereas the temperature field is
three-dimensional. This approximation allows us to perform simulations for
Ekman numbers down to 1e-8, Prandtl numbers relevant for liquid metals (~0.1)
and Reynolds numbers up to 3e4. Persistent zonal flows composed of multiple
jets form as a result of the mixing of potential vorticity. For the largest
Rayleigh numbers computed, the zonal velocity is larger than the convective
velocity despite the presence of boundary friction. The convective structures
and the zonal jets widen when the thermal forcing increases. Prograde and
retrograde zonal jets are dynamically different: in the prograde jets (which
correspond to weak potential vorticity gradients) the convection transports
heat efficiently and the mean temperature tends to be homogenised; by contrast,
in the cores of the retrograde jets (which correspond to steep gradients of
potential vorticity) the dynamics is dominated by the propagation of Rossby
waves, resulting in the formation of steep mean temperature gradients and the
dominance of conduction in the heat transfer process. Consequently, in
quasi-geostrophic systems, the width of the retrograde zonal jets controls the
efficiency of the heat transfer.

importance in the field of systems biology. Different formalisms and a huge
variety of classical mathematical tools have been used to describe and analyse
such networks. Michael A. Savageau defined a formalism to model
genetic-metabolic networks called S-Systems, [12], [13], [15]. There is a limit
in the number of nodes that can be analysed when these systems are solved using
classical numerical methods such as non-linear dynamic analysis and linear
optimization algorithms. We propose to use toric algebraic geometry to solve
S-systems. In this work we prove that S-systems are toric varieties and that as
a consequence Hilbert basis can be used to solve them. This is achieved by
applying two theorems, proved here, the theorem about Embedding of S-Systems in
toric varieties and the theorem about Toric Resolution on S-Systems. In
addition, we define the realization of minimal phenotypic polytopes, phenotypic
toric ideals and phenotypic toric varieties as a generalization of the
phenotypic polytopes described by M. Savageau, [8], [9], [10]. Also we studied
a synthetic oscillatory network of two genes under diverse environmental
control modes, we reproduce S. Savageau results and additionally we obtain an
invariant sustained oscillatory region. The implications of the results here
presented is that, in principle, they will facilitate solving large scale
genetic-metabolic networks by means of toric algebraic geometry tools as well
as facilitate elucidating their dynamics.

  Evaluation in Predictive Data Mining",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most crucial issues in data mining is to model human behaviour in
order to provide personalisation, adaptation and recommendation. This usually
involves implicit or explicit knowledge, either by observing user interactions,
or by asking users directly. But these sources of information are always
subject to the volatility of human decisions, making utilised data uncertain to
a particular extent. In this contribution, we elaborate on the impact of this
human uncertainty when it comes to comparative assessments of different data
mining approaches. In particular, we reveal two problems: (1) biasing effects
on various metrics of model-based prediction and (2) the propagation of
uncertainty and its thus induced error probabilities for algorithm rankings.
For this purpose, we introduce a probabilistic view and prove the existence of
those problems mathematically, as well as provide possible solution strategies.
We exemplify our theory mainly in the context of recommender systems along with
the metric RMSE as a prominent example of precision quality measures.

  abstract, discussion and corrected typos",,"10.3389/fnins.2018.00210",,"cs.ET cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial neural networks can harness stochasticity in multiple ways to
enable a vast class of computationally powerful models. Electronic
implementation of such stochastic networks is currently limited to addition of
algorithmic noise to digital machines which is inherently inefficient; albeit
recent efforts to harness physical noise in devices for stochasticity have
shown promise. To succeed in fabricating electronic neuromorphic networks we
need experimental evidence of devices with measurable and controllable
stochasticity which is complemented with the development of reliable
statistical models of such observed stochasticity. Current research literature
has sparse evidence of the former and a complete lack of the latter. This
motivates the current article where we demonstrate a stochastic neuron using an
insulator-metal-transition (IMT) device, based on electrically induced
phase-transition, in series with a tunable resistance. We show that an IMT
neuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron
and incorporates all characteristics of a spiking neuron in the device
phenomena. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous stochastic spiking along
with electrically controllable firing probabilities using Vanadium Dioxide
(VO$_2$) based IMT neurons which show a sigmoid-like transfer function. The
stochastic spiking is explained by two noise sources - thermal noise and
threshold fluctuations, which act as precursors of bifurcation. As such, the
IMT neuron is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating
boundary resulting in transfer curves that closely match experiments. As one of
the first comprehensive studies of a stochastic neuron hardware and its
statistical properties, this article would enable efficient implementation of a
large class of neuro-mimetic networks and algorithms.

two-section quantum dash lasers emitting at 1550 nm. Various feedback schemes
were investigated and optimum levels determined for narrowest RF linewidth and
low timing jitter, for single-loop and symmetric dual-loop feedback. Two
symmetric dual-loop configurations, with balanced and unbalanced feedback
ratios, were studied. We demonstrate that unbalanced symmetric dual loop
feedback, with the inner cavity resonant and fine delay tuning of the outer
loop, gives narrowest RF linewidth and reduced timing jitter over a wide range
of delay, unlike single and balanced symmetric dual-loop configurations. This
configuration with feedback lengths 80 and 140 m narrows the RF linewidth by
4-67x and 10-100x, respectively, across the widest delay range, compared to
free-running. For symmetric dual-loop feedback, the influence of different
power split ratios through the feedback loops was determined. Our results show
that symmetric dual-loop feedback is markedly more effective than single-loop
feedback in reducing RF linewidth and timing jitter, and is much less sensitive
to delay phase, making this technique ideal for applications where robustness
and alignment tolerance are essential.

our result is especially relevant for metamaterials research, which draws
directly on the standard relation for the refractive index in terms of
