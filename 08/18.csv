and substantial computation time. We propose a technique to accelerate
architecture selection by learning an auxiliary HyperNet that generates the
weights of a main model conditioned on that model's architecture. By comparing
the relative validation performance of networks with HyperNet-generated
weights, we can effectively search over a wide range of architectures at the
cost of a single training run. To facilitate this search, we develop a flexible
mechanism based on memory read-writes that allows us to define a wide range of
network connectivity patterns, with ResNet, DenseNet, and FractalNet blocks as
special cases. We validate our method (SMASH) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
STL-10, ModelNet10, and Imagenet32x32, achieving competitive performance with
similarly-sized hand-designed networks. Our code is available at

proved that a positive {\em lower} bound on $\kappa_*$, depending on $\Sigma$

paper, we propose a symmetric optical flow method to address the well-known

filtered out during post-processing, we highlight the importance of joint
occlusion reasoning in the optimization and show how to utilize occlusion as an
important cue for estimating optical flow. The key feature of our model is to
fully exploit the symmetry properties that characterize optical flow and
occlusions in the two consecutive images. Specifically through utilizing
forward-backward consistency and occlusion-disocclusion symmetry in the energy,
our model jointly estimates optical flow in both forward and backward
direction, as well as consistent occlusion maps in both views. We demonstrate
significant performance benefits on standard benchmarks, especially from the
occlusion-disocclusion symmetry. On the challenging KITTI dataset we report the

correlated with their ~20 cm flux densities. All HII regions used here,
regardless of physical size or Galactocentric radius, have similar infrared to
radio flux density ratios and similar infrared colors, although the smallest
regions ($r<1\,$pc), have slightly elevated IR to radio ratios. The colors
$\log_{10}(F_{24 micron}/F_{12 micron}) \ge 0$ and $\log_{10}(F_{70

HII regions, independent of size. The infrared colors of ~22$\%$ of HII
regions, spanning a large range of physical sizes, satisfy the IRAS color
criteria of \citet{wood1989} for HII regions, after adjusting the criteria to
the wavelengths used here. Since these color criteria are commonly thought to
select only ultra-compact HII regions, this result indicates that the true
ultra-compact HII region population is uncertain. Comparing with a sample of IR
color indices from star-forming galaxies, HII regions show higher
$\log_{10}(F_{70 micron}/F_{12 micron})$ ratios. We find a weak trend of
decreasing infrared to ~20 cm flux density ratios with increasing $R_{gal}$, in

average densities of planets of similar mass. After gas disk dissipation, fully
formed planets could interact with nearby planetesimals from a remnant
planetesimal disk. These interactions would often lead to planetesimal
accretion due to the relatively high ratio between the planet size and the hill
radius for typical planets. We present calculations using the open-source
stellar evolution toolkit MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics) modified to include the deposition of planetesimals into the H/He
envelopes of sub-Neptunes (~1-20 MEarth). We show that planetesimal accretion
can alter the mass-radius isochrones for these planets. The same initial planet
as a result of the same total accreted planetesimal mass can have up to ~5%
difference in mean densities several Gyr after the last accretion due to
inherent stochasticity of the accretion process. During the phase of rapid
accretion these differences are more dramatic. The additional energy deposition
from the accreted planetesimals increase the ratio between the planet's radius
to that of the core during rapid accretion, which in turn leads to enhanced
loss of atmospheric mass. As a result, the same initial planet can end up with
very different envelope mass fractions. These differences manifest as
differences in mean densities long after accretion stops. These effects are
particularly important for planets initially less massive than ~10 MEarth and
with envelope mass fraction less than ~10%, thought to be the most common type
of planets discovered by Kepler.

unitarity violation in lepton mixing due to significantly large mixing between
active neutrinos and the heavy fermions. In addition to this, such large lepton
mixing also gives rise to potentially large lepton flavor violation, which
allows to constrain the non-unitarity parameters via lepton flavor violating
decays ($l_i \to l_j \gamma$). We make use of these constraints on
non-unitarity parameters and investigate their effects on the determination of
current unknown oscillation parameters at long-baseline experiments. We find
that non-unitarity parameters are sensitive to NO$\nu$A experiment. However, it
is observed that NO$\nu$A experiment is not expected to improve the current
knowledge of non-unitarity parameter $\eta_{21}$. We also find that the
sensitivities to current unknowns are deteriorated significantly in presence of
non-unitary lepton mixing and these sensitivities crucially depend upon the new
CP-violating phase in the non-unitary mixing. Further, we find that the
degeneracy resolution capability of NO$\nu$A experiment is reduced in the
presence of non-unitarity parameters. However, the synergy between the

significant attention due to its remarkable similarity to SN2009ip in both its
pre- and post-explosion behaviour. They seem to belong to a class of events for
which the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion
is still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of
SN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in
the range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,
and half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN
2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3
Msun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at
least 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,
releasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we
propose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at
late epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with
future observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most
likely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.
Considering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
progenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,
similar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time
spectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on
the mass of the H envelope before the explosion. If the star exploded as a
genuine SN, 2015bh would be a remarkable case of a successful explosion after
black-hole formation in a star with a possible minimum mass 35 Msun at the
pre-SN stage.

different conditions, are joined together. In these situations a light cone,
separating regions with macroscopically different properties, emerges from the
junction. In free fermionic systems some observables close to the light cone
follow a universal behavior, known as Tracy-Widom scaling. Universality means
weak dependence on the system's details, so this is the perfect setting where
hydrodynamics could emerge. For the transverse-field Ising chain and the XX

hydrodynamics fails in more general models, whenever a condition is not

system; as material is swept up, a reverse shock forms in the ejecta, reheating
them. This ejecta-driven phase lasts until ten or more times the ejected mass
is swept up, and the remnant approaches the Sedov or self-similar evolutionary
phase. The evolution up to this time is approximately adiabatic. Eventually, as
the blast wave slows, the remnant age approaches the cooling time for immediate
post-shock gas, and the shock becomes radiative and highly compressive.
Eventually the shock speed drops below the local ISM sound speed and the
remnant dissipates. I then review the various processes by which remnants
radiate. At early times, during the adiabatic phases, thermal X-rays and
nonthermal radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission dominate, while optical
emission is faint and confined to a few strong lines of hydrogen and perhaps
helium. Once the shock is radiative, prominent optical and infrared emission is
produced. Young remnants are profoundly affected by interaction with often
anisotropic CSM, while even mature remnants can still show evidence of ejecta.

heated very close to the footpoint of the jets, particularly DG Tau jets.
Previous models attribute the strong heating to shocks in the jets. However,
the mechanism that localizes the heating at the footpoint remains puzzling. We
presented a different model of such X-ray jets, in which the disk atmosphere is
magnetically heated. Our disk corona model is based on the so-called nanoflare
model for the solar corona. We show that the magnetic heating near the disks
can result in the formation of a hot corona with a temperature of > 10^6 K even
if the average field strength in the disk is moderately weak, > 1 G. We
determine the density and the temperature at the jet base by considering the
energy balance between the heating and cooling. We derive the scaling relations
of the mass loss rate and terminal velocity of jets. Our model is applied to
the DG Tau jets. The observed temperature and estimated mass loss rate are
consistent with the prediction of our model in the case of the disk magnetic
field strength of ~20 G and the heating region of < 0.1 au. The derived scaling
relation of the temperature of X-ray jets could be a useful tool to estimate
the magnetic field strength. We also found that the jet X-ray can have a

distinct core (KDC) formed in a binary high resolution 1:1 spiral galaxy merger
simulation. The runtime of the simulation is pushed up to 10Gyr to follow the
complete evolution of various physical properties. To investigate the origin of
the KDC, the stellar component residing within the KDC is dissected, revealing
that the rotational signal is purely generated by stars that belong to the KDC
for at least 0.5Gyr and are newly formed during the merging process. Following
the orientation of the total stellar angular momentum of the KDC, we show that
it performs a motion comparable to the precession of a gyroscope in a
gravitational potential. We draw the conclusion that the motion of the KDC is a
superposition of an intrinsic rotation and a global precession that gets
gradually damped over cosmic time. Finally, the stability of the KDC over the
complete runtime of the simulation is investigated by tracing the evolution of
the widely used $\lambda_{R}$ parameter and the misalignment angle
distribution. We find that the KDC is stable for about 3Gyr after the merger

  4.2","A&A, 611, A65 (2018)","10.1051/0004-6361/201731824",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Planet formation by pebble accretion is an alternative to
planetesimal-driven core accretion. In this scenario, planets grow by accreting
cm-to-m-sized pebbles instead of km-sized planetesimals. One of the main
differences with planetesimal-driven core accretion is the increased thermal
ablation experienced by pebbles. This provides early enrichment to the planet's
envelope, which changes the process of core growth.
  Aims: We aim to predict core masses and envelope compositions of planets that
form by pebble accretion and compare mass deposition of pebbles to
planetesimals.
  Methods: We model the early growth of a proto-planet by calculating the
structure of its envelope, taking into account the fate of impacting pebbles or
planetesimals. The region where high-Z material can exist in vapor form is
determined by the vapor pressure. We include enrichment effects by locally
modifying the mean molecular weight.
  Results: In the pebble case, three phases of core growth can be identified.
In the first phase, pebbles impact the core without significant ablation.
During the second phase, ablation becomes increasingly severe. A layer of
high-Z vapor starts to form around the core that absorbs a small fraction of
the ablated mass. The rest either rains out to the core or mixes outwards
instead, slowing core growth. In the third phase, the vapor inner region
expands outwards, absorbing an increasing fraction of the ablated material as
vapor. Rainout ends before the core mass reaches 0.6 M_Earth, terminating
direct core growth. In the case of icy H2O pebbles, this happens before 0.1
M_Earth.
  Conclusions: Our results indicate that pebble accretion can directly form
rocky cores up to only 0.6 M_Earth, and is unable to form similarly sized icy
cores. Subsequent core growth can proceed indirectly when the planet cools,
provided it is able to retain its high-Z material.

the scale of spontaneous SUSY breaking triggered by Polonyi chiral superfield.
The vector supermultiplet generically enters the action non-minimally, via an
arbitrary real function. This functon is chosen to generate the inflaton scalar
potential of the Starobinsky model. Our supergravity model can be reformulated
as an abelian supersymmetric gauge theory with the vector gauge superfield
coupled to two (Higgs and Polonyi) chiral superfields interacting with
supergravity, where the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. We find
that Polonyi and gravitino particles are efficiently produced during inflation.
After inflation, perturbative decay of inflaton also produces Polonyi particles
that rapidly decay into gravitinos. As a result, a coherent picture of
inflation and dark matter emerges, where the abundance of produced gravitinos
after inflation fits the CMB constraints as a Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM)
candidate. Our scenario avoids the notorous gravitino and Polonyi problems with
the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and DM overproduction.

a non-degenerate companion star. Some SN Ia progenitor models suggest the
existence of circumstellar (CS) environments in which strong outflows create
low density cavities of different radii. Matter deposited at the edges of the
cavities, should be at distances at which photoionisation due to early
ultraviolet (UV) radiation of SNe Ia causes detectable changes to the
observable Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption lines. To study possible narrow
absorption lines from such material, we obtained a time-series of
high-resolution spectra of SN 2017cbv at phases between $-14.8$ and $+83$ days
with respect to $B$-band maximum, covering the time at which photoionisation is
predicted to occur. Both narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K are detected in all
spectra, with no measurable changes between the epochs. We use photoionisation
models to rule out the presence of Na I and Ca II gas clouds along the
line-of-sight of SN 2017cbv between $\sim8\times10^{16}$--$2\times10^{19}$~cm

mass of a homogenous spherical CS gas shell with radius $R$ must be limited to
$M^{\rm CSM}_{\rm HI}<3\times10^{-4}\times(R/10^{17}[{\rm cm}])^2$ M$_{\odot}$.
The bounds point to progenitor models that deposit little gas in their CS

issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data, and
the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based)

arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We
also discuss how data-driven spatial coordinates can be extracted in ways
invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data

by examining possible power-law decay of their radial correlation function. We
apply the analysis to enstrophy, dissipation, and velocity gradient invariants
$Q$ and $R$ and their joint spatial distibutions, using data from a direct
numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence at ${\rm Re}_\lambda \approx 430$.
While no fractal scaling is found in the inertial range using box-counting in
the finite Reynolds number flow considered here, power-law scaling in the
inertial range is found in the radial correlation functions. Thus a geometric
characterization in terms of these sets' correlation dimension is possible.
Strong dependence on the enstrophy and dissipation threshold is found,
consistent with multifractal behavior. Nevertheless the lack of scaling of the
box-counting analysis precludes direct quantitative comparisons with earlier
work based on the multifractal formalism. Surprising trends, such as a lower
correlation dimension for strong dissipation events compared to strong
enstrophy events, are observed and interpreted in terms of spatial coherence of
vortices in the flow. We show that sets defined by joint conditions on strain

correlation functions, providing further characterization of the complex

the orbital magnetoresistance, including its angle dependence. We show that the
origin of XMR in LaSb lies in its high mobility with diminishing Hall effect,
where the high mobility leads to a strong magnetic field dependence of the
longitudinal magnetoconductance. Unlike a one-band material, when a system has
two or more bands (Fermi pockets) with electron and hole carriers, the added
conductance arising from the Hall effect is reduced, hence revealing the latent
XMR enabled by the longitudinal magnetoconductance. With diminishing Hall
effect, the magnetoresistivity is simply the inverse of the longitudinal
magnetoconductivity, enabling the differentiation of the electron and hole
contributions to the XMR, which varies with the strength and orientation of the
magnetic field. This work demonstrates a convenient way to separate the
dynamics of the charge carriers and to uncover the origin of XMR in multi-band

human resources. For instance, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) has more
than 7,000 staff and supports 30,000 direct jobs for more than 60 million

beneficially for several purposes, even in sensitive areas like airports. Among
the considered applications are those that suggest using UAVs to enhance safety
of on-ground airplanes; for instance, by collecting (once the aircraft has

of the Aircraft Data Networks - ADN) or by examining the state of airplane
structure. In this paper, our proposal is to use UAVs, under the control of the

our proposal is to make airport management systems more efficient for

plasma manipulation and diagnostics. Due to the complexity of the governing
equations, approximate models are often necessary to describe wave dynamics. In
this dissertation, waves are treated as geometric objects of a variational
theory rather than formal solutions of specific PDEs. This approach simplifies
calculations, highlights the underlying wave symmetries, and leads to improved
modeling of wave dynamics. This thesis presents two breakthroughs that were
obtained in the general theory of waves. The first main contribution is an
extension and reformulation of geometrical optics (GO) as a first-principle
Lagrangian theory that correctly describes polarization effects, such as
polarization precession and the polarization-driven bending of ray
trajectories, which appear as leading-order corrections to GO. The theory was
applied to several systems of interest, such as relativistic spin-1/2 particles
and radio-frequency waves in magnetized plasma. The second main contribution of
this thesis is the development of a phase-space method to study basic
properties of nonlinear wave--wave interactions. Specifically, I show that
waves propagating in modulated media, both classical and quantum, can
experience time-averaged refraction caused by effective ponderomotive forces on
wave rays. This phenomenon is analogous to the ponderomotive effect encountered
by charged particles in high-frequency electromagnetic fields. I also show that
phase-space methods can be useful to study problems in the field of wave
turbulence, such as the nonlinear interaction of high-frequency waves with
large-scale structures. Overall, the results obtained can serve as a basis for
future studies on more complex nonlinear wave--wave interactions, such as
modulational instabilities in general wave ensembles or wave turbulence.

today's data-intensive distributed applications and wide-area data replication
services. Doing so necessitates effectively utilizing available network
bandwidth and resources, yet in practice transfers seldom reach the levels of
utilization they potentially could. Tuning protocol parameters such as
pipelining, parallelism, and concurrency can significantly increase utilization
and performance, however determining the best settings for these parameters is
a difficult problem, as network conditions can vary greatly between sites and
over time. Nevertheless, it is an important problem, since poor tuning can
cause either under- or over-utilization of network resources and thus degrade
transfer performance. In this paper, we present three algorithms for
application-level tuning of different protocol parameters for maximizing
transfer throughput in wide-area networks. Our algorithms dynamically tune the
number of parallel data streams per file (for large file optimization), the
level of control channel pipelining (for small file optimization), and the
number of concurrent file transfers to increase I/O throughput (a technique
useful for all types of files). The proposed heuristic algorithms improve the
transfer throughput up to 10x compared to the baseline and 7x compared to the

unit-cell parameters with pressure has indicated an anisotropic compression.
The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state is obtained from the
experiments. From the evolution of microscopic structural parameters like bond
distances and coordination polyhedra of cerium and scandium, the macroscopic
behavior of CeScO3 under compression has been explained and reasoned for its
large pressure stability. The reported results are discussed in comparison with
high-pressure results from other perovskites.

with the amplitude of the incident radiation, as is the case of absorption, or
may be nonlinear. The latter category includes a diverse set of phenomena such
as second harmonic generation (SHG), shift current, sum frequency generation,
and excited state absorption, among others. Despite decades of research into
nonlinear response theory, and the occasional discovery of materials with large
nonlinear responses, there has been no systematic investigation into the
maximum amount of nonlinear optical response attainable in solid-state

functions of materials, which controls the SHG and shift current responses. We
show that this bound depends on the band gap, band width, and geometrical

condensation of molecules to form molecular solids, and that strongly coupled
systems generally have larger responses than weakly coupled or isolated ones.
As a proof of principle, we perform first-principles calculations of the

mixture of Laplace densities with a possibly unbounded set of locations: the
rate of convergence for the Bayes' density estimator corresponding to a

well-behaved---that they do not, for example, cause harm to humans or act in a
racist or sexist way---is therefore not a hypothetical problem to be dealt with
in the future, but a pressing one that we address here. We propose a new
framework for designing machine learning algorithms that simplifies the problem
of specifying and regulating undesirable behaviors. To show the viability of
this new framework, we use it to create new machine learning algorithms that
preclude the sexist and harmful behaviors exhibited by standard machine
learning algorithms in our experiments. Our framework for designing machine

motivated by providing tamper resilience in applications where a cryptographic
secret is stored in a tamperable storage device and the protection goal is to
ensure that the adversary cannot benefit from their tamperings with the device.
In this paper we consider non-malleable codes for protection of secure
communication against active physical layer adversaries. We define a class of
functions that closely model tampering of communication by adversaries who can
eavesdrop on a constant fraction of the transmitted codeword, and use this
information to select a vector of tampering functions that will be applied to a
second constant fraction of codeword components (possibly overlapping with the

provides new analysis for an existing construction in the new setting. The
second construction uses a new approach that results in an explicit

evaluate the proposed approach in two scenarios, adapting a clean acoustic

word error rate of up to 44% over the original source model without the need
for transcribed data in the target domain. Moreover, we show that increasing
the amount of unlabeled data results in additional model robustness, which is

a non-convex orthogonal polyhedron having reflex edges in just two directions
(as opposed to three, in the general case) by placing the minimum number of
edge guards on reflex edges only.
  We show that $$\left\lfloor \frac{r-g}{2} \right\rfloor +1$$ reflex edge
guards are sufficient, where $r$ is the number of reflex edges and $g$ is the
polyhedron's genus. This bound is tight for $g=0$. We thereby generalize a
classic planar Art Gallery theorem of O'Rourke, which states that the same
upper bound holds for vertex guards in an orthogonal polygon with $r$ reflex
vertices and $g$ holes.
  Then we give a similar upper bound in terms of $m$, the total number of edges
in the polyhedron. We prove that $$\left\lfloor \frac{m-4}{8} \right\rfloor

was $\lfloor 11m/72+g/6\rfloor-1$ edge guards (not necessarily reflex).

factor is set to a certain value. We utilize appropriate zero padding to make
the dimension of the output the same as the input. It has been proven that the
expansion of receptive field can boost the CNN performance in image

WedgeTail regards forwarding devices as points within a geometric space and
stores the path packets take when traversing the network as trajectories. To be
efficient, it prioritizes forwarding devices before inspection using an
unsupervised trajectory-based sampling mechanism. For each of the forwarding
device, WedgeTail computes the expected and actual trajectories of packets and
`hunts' for any forwarding device not processing packets as expected. Compared
to related work, WedgeTail is also capable of distinguishing between malicious
actions such as packet drop and generation. Moreover, WedgeTail employs a
radically different methodology that enables detecting threats autonomously. In
fact, it has no reliance on pre-defined rules by an administrator and may be
easily imported to protect SDN networks with different setups, forwarding
devices, and controllers. We have evaluated WedgeTail in simulated
environments, and it has been capable of detecting and responding to all
implanted malicious forwarding devices within a reasonable time-frame. We
report on the design, implementation, and evaluation of WedgeTail in this

an even coexistence of opinions, but eventually reaches consensus by
finite-size fluctuations. The approach to coexistence is monotonic for $1/2 < p
< 0.8$, while for $0.8 \le p \le 1$ there are damped oscillations around the
coexistence value. The final approach to coexistence is approximately a power
law $t^{-b(p)}$ in both regimes, where $b$ increases with $p$. Also, $\tau$
increases respect to the voter model, although it still scales linearly with
$N$. The $p=1$ case is special, with a relaxation to coexistence that scales as
$t^{-2.73}$ and a consensus time that scales as $\tau \sim N^\beta$, with
$\beta \simeq 1.45$.

fundamental problem for geographic networks: can a given geographic network be
drawn without crossings? We focus on the seemingly simple setting where each
region is a vertical segment, and one wants to connect pairs of segments with a
path that lies inside the convex hull of the two segments. We prove that when
paths must be drawn as straight line segments, it is NP-complete to determine
if a crossing-free solution exists, even if all vertical segments have unit

that can have any shape, we show that the problem is polynomial under certain

recently for pure linear models and fully nonparametric models, little
attention has been paid on distributed optimization for semi-paramemetric
models with multiple-level structures (e.g. sparsity, linearity and
nonlinearity). To address these issues, the current paper proposes a new
communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm for partially sparse
linear models with an increasing number of features. The proposed method is
based on the classical divide and conquer strategy for handing big data and
each sub-method defined on each subsample consists of a debiased estimation of
the double-regularized least squares approach. With the proposed method, we
theoretically prove that our global parametric estimator can achieve optimal
parametric rate in our semi-parametric model given an appropriate partition on
the total data. Specially, the choice of data partition relies on the
underlying smoothness of the nonparametric component, but it is adaptive to the
sparsity parameter. Even under the non-distributed setting, we develop a new
and easily-read proof for optimal estimation of the parametric error in high
dimensional partial linear model. Finally, several simulated experiments are
implemented to indicate comparable empirical performance of our debiased
technique under the distributed setting.

There are Fermi arcs as a direct consequence of the folding of a ring shaped

decomposition of the kinetic energy into the sum of the square of the Weyl
state, the coupling to the local magnetic field and the Rashba interaction. The
Weyl fermions break the time and reflection symmetries present in the kinetic
energy, thus allowing for the onset of a weak three-dimensional magnetic field

attractive, thus suggesting the onset of a superconducting condensate of zero

the lossy source coding problem with side information available at the encoder
and one of the two decoders, which we term as the Kaspi problem (Kaspi, 1994),
and the multiple description coding problem with one semi-deterministic
distortion measure, which we refer to as the Fu-Yeung problem (Fu and Yeung,
2002). For the Kaspi problem, we first present the properties of optimal test
channels. Subsequently, we generalize the notion of the distortion-tilted
information density for the lossy source coding problem to the Kaspi problem
and prove a non-asymptotic converse bound using the properties of optimal test
channels and the well-defined distortion-tilted information density. Finally,
for discrete memoryless sources, we derive refined asymptotics which includes
the second-order, large and moderate deviations asymptotics. In the converse
proof of second-order asymptotics, we apply the Berry-Esseen theorem to the
derived non-asymptotic converse bound. The achievability proof follows by first
proving a type-covering lemma tailored to the Kaspi problem, then properly
Taylor expanding the well-defined distortion-tilted information densities and
finally applying the Berry-Esseen theorem. We then generalize the methods used
in the Kaspi problem to the Fu-Yeung problem. As a result, we obtain the
properties of optimal test channels for the minimum sum-rate function, a
non-asymptotic converse bound and refined asymptotics for discrete memoryless
sources. Since the successive refinement problem is a special case of the
Fu-Yeung problem, as a by-product, we obtain a non-asymptotic converse bound
for the successive refinement problem, which is a strict generalization of the
non-asymptotic converse bound for successively refinable sources (Zhou, Tan and
Motani, 2017).

class I masers from the same transition. These characteristics combined the
with physical separation from the strong central thermal emission suggests that
the methanol emission is a maser. This emission is a factor of $\sim90$ more

disease is of significant interest. Such signatures are often used to predict
clinical outcomes in new patients and aid clinical decision-making. However,
recent studies have shown that gene signatures are often not replicable. This
occurrence has practical implications regarding the generalizability and
clinical applicability of such signatures. To improve replicability, we
introduce a novel approach to select gene signatures from multiple datasets
whose effects are consistently non-zero and account for between-study
heterogeneity. We build our model upon some rank-based quantities, facilitating
integration over different genomic datasets. A high dimensional penalized
Generalized Linear Mixed Model (pGLMM) is used to select gene signatures and
address data heterogeneity. We compare our method to some commonly used
strategies that select gene signatures ignoring between-study heterogeneity. We
provide asymptotic results justifying the performance of our method and
demonstrate its advantage in the presence of heterogeneity through thorough
simulation studies. Lastly, we motivate our method through a case study
subtyping pancreatic cancer patients from four gene expression studies.

across disjoint camera views, which is a challenging problem in multimedia
analysis, multimedia editing and content-based media retrieval communities. The
major challenge lies in how to preserve similarity of the same person across
video footages with large appearance variations, while discriminating different
individuals. To address this problem, conventional methods usually consider the
pairwise similarity between persons by only measuring the point to point (P2P)
distance. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning technique to model a
novel set to set (S2S) distance, in which the underline objective focuses on
preserving the compactness of intra-class samples for each camera view, while
maximizing the margin between the intra-class set and inter-class set. The S2S
distance metric is consisted of three terms, namely the class-identity term,
the relative distance term and the regularization term. The class-identity term
keeps the intra-class samples within each camera view gathering together, the
relative distance term maximizes the distance between the intra-class class set
and inter-class set across different camera views, and the regularization term
smoothness the parameters of deep convolutional neural network (CNN). As a
result, the final learned deep model can effectively find out the matched
target to the probe object among various candidates in the video gallery by
learning discriminative and stable feature representations. Using the CUHK01,
CUHK03, PRID2011 and Market1501 benchmark datasets, we extensively conducted
comparative evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of our method over the

celestial bodies, which can cause these orbits to slowly expand or contract

and radar astrometry for 600 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of
detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 247 NEAs with
measured drift rates, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky

Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two
independent population-based tests that verify the measurement of Yarkovsky
orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky
effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter. Second, we
find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample
is 2.34, which, accounting for bias and sampling uncertainty, implies an actual
ratio of $2.7^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$. This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of
occurring due to chance or statistical noise. The observed ratio of retrograde
to prograde rotators is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical
predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the
sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. We
also examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital
energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%. We interpret this
efficiency in terms of NEA spin and thermal properties.

extrinsic calibration of a 3D LiDAR and a panoramic camera with a normally
printed chessboard. The proposed method is based on the 3D corner estimation of
the chessboard from the sparse point cloud generated by one frame scan of the
LiDAR. To estimate the corners, we formulate a full-scale model of the
chessboard and fit it to the segmented 3D points of the chessboard. The model
is fitted by optimizing the cost function under constraints of correlation
between the reflectance intensity of laser and the color of the chessboard's
patterns. Powell's method is introduced for resolving the discontinuity problem
in optimization. The corners of the fitted model are considered as the 3D
corners of the chessboard. Once the corners of the chessboard in the 3D point
cloud are estimated, the extrinsic calibration of the two sensors is converted
to a 3D-2D matching problem. The corresponding 3D-2D points are used to
calculate the absolute pose of the two sensors with Unified Perspective-n-Point
(UPnP). Further, the calculated parameters are regarded as initial values and
are refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The performance of the
proposed corner detection method from the 3D point cloud is evaluated using
simulations. The results of experiments, conducted on a Velodyne HDL-32e LiDAR
and a Ladybug3 camera under the proposed re-projection error metric,
qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the
final extrinsic calibration parameters.

large-scale high-quality test collection of tweets that supports multiple
information retrieval (IR) tasks without running a shared-task campaign. The
adopted approach (demonstrated over Arabic tweets) designs the collection
around significant (i.e., popular) events, which enables the development of
topics that represent frequent information needs of Twitter users for which
rich content exists. That inherently facilitates the support of multiple tasks
that generally revolve around events, namely event detection, ad-hoc search,
timeline generation, and real-time summarization. The key highlights of the
approach include diversifying the judgment pool via interactive search and
multiple manually-crafted queries per topic, collecting high-quality
annotations via crowd-workers for relevancy and in-house annotators for
novelty, filtering out low-agreement topics and inaccessible tweets, and
providing multiple subsets of the collection for better availability. Applying
our methodology on Arabic tweets resulted in EveTAR , the first
freely-available tweet test collection for multiple IR tasks. EveTAR includes a
crawl of 355M Arabic tweets and covers 50 significant events for which about
62K tweets were judged with substantial average inter-annotator agreement
(Kappa value of 0.71). We demonstrate the usability of EveTAR by evaluating
existing algorithms in the respective tasks. Results indicate that the new

path-consistency (PC) has received a great deal of attention. However,
enforcing PC is computationally expensive and sometimes even unnecessary.
Directional path-consistency (DPC) is a weaker notion of PC that considers a
given variable ordering and can thus be enforced more efficiently than PC. This
paper shows that DPC (the DPC enforcing algorithm of Dechter and Pearl) decides
the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of a constraint language if it is
complete and has the variable elimination property (VEP). However, we also show
that no complete VEP constraint language can have a domain with more than 2
values. We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC*, and
show that the CSP of a constraint language can be decided by DPC* if it is
closed under a majority operation. In fact, DPC* is sufficient for guaranteeing
backtrack-free search for such constraint networks. Examples of majority-closed
constraint classes include the classes of connected row-convex (CRC)
constraints and tree-preserving constraints, which have found applications in
various domains, such as scene labeling, temporal reasoning, geometric

the polarized neutron scattering data. From an analysis of the temperature

nonlinear shock structure and electron pre-acceleration for various
orientations of the large-scale magnetic field with respect to the simulation
plane while keeping it at $90^\circ$ to the shock normal. Ion reflection off
the shock leads to the formation of magnetic filaments in the shock ramp,
resulting from Weibel-type instabilities, and electrostatic Buneman modes in
the shock foot. In all cases under study, the latter provides first-stage
electron energization through the shock-surfing acceleration (SSA) mechanism.
The subsequent energization strongly depends on the field orientation and
proceeds through adiabatic or second-order Fermi acceleration processes for
configurations with the out-of-plane and in-plane field components,
respectively. For strictly out-of-plane field the fraction of supra-thermal
electrons is much higher than for other configurations, because only in this
case the Buneman modes are fully captured by the 2D simulation grid. Shocks in
plasma with moderate $\beta_{\rm p}$ provide more efficient pre-acceleration.
The relevance of our results to the physics of fully three-dimensional systems

challenging task due to its inherent problems like complex character shapes,
low resolution, background noise, etc. Available OCR systems often fail to
retrieve such information in scene/video frames. Keyword spotting, an
alternative way to retrieve information, performs efficient text searching in
such scenarios. However, current word spotting techniques in scene/video images
are script-specific and they are mainly developed for Latin script. This paper
presents a novel word spotting framework using dynamic shape coding for text
retrieval in natural scene image and video frames. The framework is designed to
search query keyword from multiple scripts with the help of on-the-fly
script-wise keyword generation for the corresponding script. We have used a
two-stage word spotting approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect the
translated keyword in a given text line by identifying the script of the line.
A novel unsupervised dynamic shape coding based scheme has been used to group
similar shape characters to avoid confusion and to improve text alignment.
Next, the hypotheses locations are verified to improve retrieval performance.
To evaluate the proposed system for searching keyword from natural scene image
and video frames, we have considered two popular Indic scripts such as Bangla
(Bengali) and Devanagari along with English. Inspired by the zone-wise
recognition approach in Indic scripts[1], zone-wise text information has been
used to improve the traditional word spotting performance in Indic scripts. For
our experiment, a dataset consisting of images of different scenes and video
frames of English, Bangla and Devanagari scripts were considered. The results
obtained showed the effectiveness of our proposed word spotting approach.

a nested expectation problem, with an outer expectation with respect to one

Carlo (MLMC) method (Giles 2008) in which the number of inner samples for $Y$
increases geometrically with level, so that the accuracy of estimating the
inner conditional expectation improves and the cost also increases with level.
We construct an antithetic MLMC estimator and provide sufficient assumptions on
a decision model under which the antithetic property of the estimator is well
exploited, and consequently a root-mean-square accuracy of $\varepsilon$ can be
achieved at a cost of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. Numerical results confirm the
considerable computational savings compared to the standard, nested Monte Carlo
method for some simple testcases and a more realistic medical application.

for the S=1/2 effective Hamiltonian consisting of two kinds of Heisenberg

from the all-in/all-out type chiral magnets, which possess four quasiacoustic

novel interpretation which resolves the old 'energetic vs. dynamic' controversy
regarding the physical origin of dislocation patterns. We demonstrate the
robustness of the developed patterning scenario by considering the simplest
possible case (plane strain, single slip) yet implementing the dynamics of the
dislocation density evolution in two very different manners, namely (i) a
hydrodynamic formulation which considers transport equations that are
continuous in space and time while assuming a linear stress dependency of
dislocation motion, and (ii) a stochastic cellular automaton implementation
which assumes spatially and temporally discrete transport of discrete 'packets'
of dislocation density which move according to an extremal dynamics. Despite
the huge differences between both kinds of models, we find that the emergent
patterns are mutually consistent and in agreement with the prediction of a
linear stability analysis of the continuum model. We also show how different
types of initial conditions lead to different intermediate evolution scenarios
which, however, do not affect the properties of the fully developed patterns.

based on the assumption that their photometric and spectroscopic properties are
invariant with redshift. However, this fundamental assumption needs to be
tested with observations of high-z SNe Ia. To date, the majority of SNe Ia
observed at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.0) are faint, and the
resultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios
that impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases
however, the Universe offers a helping hand: to date a few SNe Ia have been
observed that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and
galaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper we present
long-slit spectroscopy of the lensed SNe Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a
redshift of z=0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ~55 by a galaxy located
at z=0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple weeks to a
couple months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of
well-observed, nearby SNe Ia, finding that SN 2016geu's properties are
commensurate with those of SNe Ia in the local universe. Based primarily on the
velocity and strength of the Si II 6355 absorption feature, we find that SN
2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity gradient and
""core-normal"" SN Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their
pseudo-equivalent widths) argue against SN 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined,
cool or shallow-silicon SN Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of
SN 2016geu imply that it is a normal SN Ia, and when taking previous results by

the observational properties of SNe Ia up to z~0.4. [Abridged]

quantitatively correct. To this end we focus on two representative examples of

Gaussian---both expected to be encountered when using the qubit for nano-scale
nuclear resonance imaging. We have found that, in contrast to Lorentz spectrum,
for which the corrections to the standard spectroscopic formulas can easily be
made negligible, the spectra with finite range are more challenging to
reconstruct accurately. For Gaussian line-shape of environmental spectral
density, direct application of the standard dynamical decoupling based
spectroscopy leads to erroneous attribution of long-tail behavior to the
reconstructed spectrum. Fortunately, artifacts such as this, can be completely
avoided with the simple extension to standard reconstruction method.

master equations with a finite time full counting statistics. Our formulation
of the FDCN generalizes previous zero-frequency expressions and can be viewed
as an application of MacDonald's formula for electron transport to heat
transfer. As a demonstration, we consider the paradigmatic example of quantum
heat transfer in the context of a non-equilibrium spin-boson model. We adopt a
recently developed polaron-transformed Redfield equation which allows us to
accurately investigate heat transfer with arbitrary system-reservoir coupling
strength, arbitrary values of spin bias as well as temperature differences. We
observe maximal values of FDCN in moderate coupling regimes, similar to the
zero-frequency cases. We find the FDCN with varying coupling strengths or bias
displays a universal Lorentzian-shape scaling form in the weak coupling regime,
and a white noise spectrum emerges with zero bias in the strong coupling regime
due to a distinctive spin dynamics. We also find the bias can suppress the FDCN
in the strong coupling regime, in contrast to its zero-frequency counterpart
which is insensitive to bias changes. Furthermore, we utilize the Saito-Utsumi
relation as a benchmark to validate our theory and study the impact of
temperature differences at finite frequencies. Together, our results provide

of scalar measures (e.g., the $A$-optimality, $D$-optimality, and
$E$-optimality) of the Bayesian mean square error matrix as the design criteria
subject to power-constraint on the input. Instead to solve the optimization
problem directly, we propose a two-step procedure. In the first step, by making
suitable assumptions on the unknown input, we construct a quadratic map
(transformation) of the input such that the transformed input design problems
are convex, the number of optimization variables is independent of the number
of input data, and their global minima can be found efficiently by applying
well-developed convex optimization software packages. In the second step, we
derive the expression of the optimal input based on the global minima found in
the first step by solving the inverse image of the quadratic map. In addition,
we derive analytic results for some special types of fixed kernels, which
provide insights on the input design and also its dependence on the kernel

joint estimation of a 3D map from lidar data and images, based on a 3D mesh,
and its texturing. Indeed, even if most surveying vehicles for mapping are
endowed by cameras and lidar, existing mapping algorithms usually rely on
either images or lidar data; moreover both image-based and lidar-based systems
often represent the map as a point cloud, while a continuous textured mesh
representation would be useful for visualization and navigation purposes. In
the proposed framework, we join the accuracy of the 3D lidar data, and the
dense information and appearance carried by the images, in estimating a
visibility consistent map upon the lidar measurements, and refining it
photometrically through the acquired images. We evaluate the proposed framework
against the KITTI dataset and we show the performance improvement with respect
to two state of the art urban mapping algorithms, and two widely used surface
reconstruction algorithms in Computer Graphics.

document image would enable text-line segmentation. In particular, identifying
the separators in handwritten text could be a thrilling exercise. Obviously it
would be challenging to perform this in the compressed version of a document
image and that is the proposed objective in this research. Such an effort would
prevent the computational burden of decompressing a document for text-line
segmentation. Since document images are generally compressed using run length
encoding (RLE) technique as per the CCITT standards, the first column in the
RLE will be a white column. The value (depth) in the white column is very low
when a particular line is a text line and the depth could be larger at the
point of text line separation. A longer consecutive sequence of such larger
depth should indicate the gap between the text lines, which provides the
separator region. In case of over separation and under separation issues,
corrective actions such as deletion and insertion are suggested respectively.
An extensive experimentation is conducted on the compressed images of the
benchmark datasets of ICDAR13 and Alireza et al [17] to demonstrate the
efficacy.

modeling the object state directly in the space of the rigid body motion group

reason, we propose and investigate two state space models for moving object
tracking: (i) a direct product SE(2)xR3 and (ii) a direct product of the two
rigid body motion groups SE(2)xSE(2). The first term within these two state
space constructions describes the current pose of the rigid body, while the
second one employs its second order dynamics, i.e., the velocities. By this, we
gain the flexibility of tracking omnidirectional motion in the vein of a
constant velocity model, but also accounting for the dynamics in the rotation
component. Since the SE(2) group is a matrix Lie group, we solve this problem
by using the extended Kalman filter on matrix Lie groups and provide a detailed
derivation of the proposed filters. We analyze the performance of the filters
on a large number of synthetic trajectories and compare them with (i) the
extended Kalman filter based constant velocity and turn rate model and (ii) the
linear Kalman filter based constant velocity model. The results show that the

that proceed via a barrier can only take place through tunneling. The reaction
H + H$_2$O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O + OH is such a case with a gas-phase
barrier of $\sim$26.5 kJ/mol. Still the reaction is known to be involved in
water formation on interstellar grains. Here, we investigate the influence of a
water ice surface and of bulk ice on the reaction rate constant. Rate constants
are calculated using instanton theory down to 74 K. The ice is taken into
account via multiscale modeling, describing the reactants and the direct
surrounding at the quantum mechanical level with density functional theory
(DFT), while the rest of the ice is modeled on the molecular mechanical level
with a force field. We find that H$_2$O$_2$ binding energies cannot be captured
by a single value, but rather depend on the number of hydrogen bonds with
surface molecules. In highly amorphous surroundings the binding site can block
the routes of attack and impede the reaction. Furthermore, the activation
energies do not correlate with the binding energies of the same sites. The
unimolecular rate constants related to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism
increase as the activation energy decreases. Thus, we provide a lower limit for
the rate constant and argue that rate constants can have values up to two order
of magnitude larger than this limit.

a surface are not available in the literature. All surface calculations were
done using a QM/MM framework (BHLYP/TIP3P) after a thorough benchmark of
different density functionals and basis sets to highly accurate correlation
methods. Reaction rate constants are obtained using instanton theory which
takes atom tunneling into account inherently, with constants down to 110 K for
the Eley-Rideal mechanism and down to 60 K for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
mechanism. We found that the reaction is nearly temperature independent below
80 K. We give kinetic isotope effects for all possible deuteration patterns for
both reaction mechanisms. For the implementation in astrochemical networks, we

  walled carbon nanotubes",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we have examined how the multi-vacancy defects induced in the
horizontal direction change the energetics and the electronic structure of
semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs). The electronic
structure of SWCNTs is computed for each deformed configuration by means of
real space, Order(N) Tight Binding Molecular Dynamic (O(N) TBMD) simulations.
Energy band gap is obtained in real space through the behavior of electronic
density of states (eDOS) near the Fermi level. Vacancies can effectively change
the energetics and hence the electronic structure of SWCNTs. In this study, we
choose three different kinds of semiconducting zigzag SWCNTs and determine the
band gap modifications. We have selected (12,0), (13,0) and (14,0) zigzag
SWCNTs according to n (mod 3) = 0, n (mod 3) = 1 and n (mod 3) = 2
classification. (12,0) SWCNT is metallic in its pristine state. The application
of vacancies opens the electronic band gap and it goes up to 0.13 eV for a di-
vacancy defected tube. On the other hand (13,0) and (14,0) SWCNTs are
semiconductors with energy band gap values of 0.44 eV and 0.55 eV in their
pristine state, respectively. Their energy band gap values decrease to 0.07 eV
and 0.09 eV when mono-vacancy defects are induced in their horizontal
directions. Then the di-vacancy defects open the band gap again. So in both
cases, the semiconducting-metallic - semiconducting transitions occur. It is
also shown that the band gap modification exhibits irreversible
characteristics, which means that band gap values of the nanotubes do not reach
their pristine values with increasing number of vacancies.

made the Standard BBN a parameter-free theory. Although, there is a good

elements deduced from observations and calculated in primordial
nucleosynthesis, there remains a yet-unexplained discrepancy of $^7$Li

primordial abundances depend on the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates and on
three additional parameters, the number of light neutrino flavours, the neutron
lifetime and the baryon-to-photon ratio in the universe. The effect of the
modification of thirty-five reaction rates on light element abundance yields in

arising in many scientific areas. The modularity function $Q$ is an established
measure quantifying the quality of a community, being identified as a set of
nodes having high modularity. In our terminology, a set of nodes with positive
modularity is called a \textit{module} and a set that maximizes $Q$ is thus
called \textit{leading module}. Finding a leading module in a network is an
important task, however the dimension of real-world problems makes the
maximization of $Q$ unfeasible. This poses the need of approximation techniques
which are typically based on a linear relaxation of $Q$, induced by the
spectrum of the modularity matrix $M$. In this work we propose a nonlinear
relaxation which is instead based on the spectrum of a nonlinear modularity
operator $\mathcal M$. We show that extremal eigenvalues of $\mathcal M$
provide an exact relaxation of the modularity measure $Q$, however at the price
of being more challenging to be computed than those of $M$. Thus we extend the
work made on nonlinear Laplacians, by proposing a computational scheme, named
\textit{generalized RatioDCA}, to address such extremal eigenvalues. We show
monotonic ascent and convergence of the method. We finally apply the new method
to several synthetic and real-world data sets, showing both effectiveness of

energetic particles (EPs) when the EP drive exceeds other dampings. A TAE
benchmark case, which was proposed by the International Tokamak Physics
Activity (ITPA) group, is studied in this work. Numerical calculations of
linear growth of TAEs driven by EPs in a circular-shaped, large aspect ratio

particle-in-cell (PIC) representation of EPs with the 3D MHD representation of
the bulk plasma through moment closure for the momentum conservation equation.
Both the excitation of TAEs and their transition to energetic particle modes
(EPMs) have been observed. The influence of EP density, temperature, density
gradient and position of the maximum relative density gradient, on the
frequency and the growth rate of TAEs are obtained, which are consistent with
those from eigen-analysis calculations and gyrokinetic simulations for an
initial Maxwellian distribution of EPs. The relative pressure gradient of EP at
the radial location of TAE gap, which represents the drive strength of EPs, can
strongly affect the growth rate of TAEs. When the density and temperature of EP
distribution are above certain threshold, the transition from TAE to EPM occurs
and the mode structure changes.

significantly smaller than the magnitude of the original frequency and exhibits
a power-law relationship between original and decreased frequencies. The

been shown to outperform standard, unidirectional, recurrent neural network

indicates that future word context information beyond the word history can be
useful. However, bi-RNNLMs pose a number of challenges as they make use of the
complete previous and future word context information. This impacts both
training efficiency and their use within a lattice rescoring framework. In this
paper these issues are addressed by proposing a novel neural network structure,
succeeding word RNNLMs (su-RNNLMs). Instead of using a recurrent unit to
capture the complete future word contexts, a feedforward unit is used to model
a finite number of succeeding, future, words. This model can be trained much
more efficiently than bi-RNNLMs and can also be used for lattice rescoring.
Experimental results on a meeting transcription task (AMI) show the proposed
model consistently outperformed uni-RNNLMs and yield only a slight degradation
compared to bi-RNNLMs in N-best rescoring. Additionally, performance
improvements can be obtained using lattice rescoring and subsequent confusion

techniques. However, most of deep learning based salient object detection
methods are black-box in nature and lacking in interpretability. This paper
proposes the first self-explanatory saliency detection network that explicitly
exploits low- and high-level features for salient object detection. We
demonstrate that such supportive clues not only significantly enhances
performance of salient object detection but also gives better justified
detection results. More specifically, we develop a multi-stage saliency encoder
to extract multi-scale features which contain both low- and high-level saliency
context. Dense short- and long-range connections are introduced to reuse these
features iteratively. Benefiting from the direct access to low- and high-level
features, the proposed saliency encoder can not only model the object context
but also preserve the boundary. Furthermore, a self-explanatory generator is
proposed to interpret how the proposed saliency encoder or other deep saliency
models making decisions. The generator simulates the absence of interesting
features by preventing these features from contributing to the saliency
classifier and estimates the corresponding saliency prediction without these
features. A comparison function, saliency explanation, is defined to measure
the prediction changes between deep saliency models and corresponding
generator. Through visualizing the differences, we can interpret the capability
of different deep neural networks based saliency detection models and
demonstrate that our proposed model indeed uses more reasonable structure for
salient object detection. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmark

allowing NWs with a thin diameter (45 nm) and an untapered morphology to be
realized. This result is in contrast to the commonly observed thick, inversely
tapered shape of SAG NWs. We quantify the flux dependence of radial
vapour-solid (VS) growth and build a model that takes into account diffusion on
the NW sidewalls to explain the observed VS growth rates. Combining this model
for the radial VS growth with an existing model for the droplet dynamics at the
NW top, we achieve full understanding of the diameter of NWs over their entire

conclude that only the combination of droplet dynamics and VS growth results in
an untapered morphology. This result enables NW shape engineering and has
important implications for doping of NWs.

proved to be highly effective in unsupervised settings. However, when it comes

enhance such capacity of RBMs by introducing nonnegativity into the model
weights, resulting in a variant called nonnegative restricted Boltzmann machine
(NRBM). The NRBM produces not only controllable decomposition of data into
interpretable parts but also offers a way to estimate the intrinsic nonlinear
dimensionality of data, and helps to stabilize linear predictive models. We
demonstrate the capacity of our model on applications such as handwritten digit
recognition, face recognition, document classification and patient readmission
prognosis. The decomposition quality on images is comparable with or better
than what produced by the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and the
thematic features uncovered from text are qualitatively interpretable in a
similar manner to that of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The stability
performance of feature selection on medical data is better than RBM and
competitive with NMF. The learned features, when used for classification, are
more discriminative than those discovered by both NMF and LDA and comparable

matter is presented. Each model contains two parameters which characterize the
repulsive and attractive interactions between nucleons. These parameters are
fixed in order to reproduce the known properties of the nuclear ground state.
Both models predict a first-order liquid-gas phase transition and a very
similar behavior in the vicinity of the critical point. Critical exponents of
the quantum van der Waals model are studied both analytically and numerically.
There are important differences in the behavior of the thermodynamical
functions of the considered models at large values of the nucleon number
density. At the same time both models fall into the universality class of
mean-field theory.

standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, the transitions between different

different modes of JAM are compared; cascade-,hadronic mean field-, and a new
mode with modified equations of state, with a first order phase transition
(1.O.P.T.) and with a crossover transition. The standard hadronic mean field
suppresses $v_2$, while the inclusion of the effects of a 1.O.P.T. (and also of
a crossover transition) does enhance $v_2$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}<30$ GeV. The
enhancement or suppression of the scaled energy flow, dubbed ""elliptic flow""is
understood as being due to out of plane- flow, i.e. $v_2<0$, dubbed out of
plane - ""squeeze-out"", which occurs predominantly in the early, compression
stage. Subsequently, the in-plane flow dominates, in the expansion stage, $v_2
> 0$. The directed flow, dubbed ""bounce- off"", is an independent measure of the
pressure, which quickly builds up the transverse momentum transfer in the
reaction plane. When the spectator matter leaves the participant fireball
region, where the highest compression occurs, a hard expansion leads to larger
$v_2$. A combined analysis of the three transverse flow coefficients, radial
$v_0$-, directed $v_1$- and elliptic $v_2$- flow, in the beam energy range of
$3\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq10$ GeV, distinguishes the different compression and
expansion scenarios: a characteristic dependence on the early stage equation of

radial flow and the simultaneous collapse of the directed flow of nucleons

approach to make progress on the complexity of rectangular matrix
multiplication as well, by developing a framework to analyze powers of tensors
in an asymmetric way. By applying this methodology to the fourth power of the
Coppersmith-Winograd tensor, we succeed in improving the complexity of
rectangular matrix multiplication. Let $\alpha$ denote the maximum value such
that the product of an $n\times n^\alpha$ matrix by an $n^\alpha\times n$

improves the previous lower bound $\alpha>0.30298$ obtained five years ago by
Le Gall (FOCS'12) from the analysis of the second power of the

researchers have to exhaustively explore all existing transfer learning

Meanwhile, it is widely accepted in educational psychology that human beings
improve transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer through
meta-cognitive reflection on inductive transfer learning practices. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel transfer learning framework known as Learning to
Transfer (L2T) to automatically determine what and how to transfer are the best

nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond. Inspired by avian magnetoreception
models, we consider the feasibility of utilizing quantum coherence phenomena to
measure weak static magnetic fields. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers are
regarded as the ideal platform to study quantum sciences as a result of its
long coherence time up to a millisecond timescale. In high-purity diamond,
hyperfine interaction with 13C nuclear spins dominates the decoherence process.
In this paper, we numerically simulate the decoherence process between 0 and +1
of the individual NV color center spin in 13C nuclear baths with various of
magnitudes of external magnetic fields. By applying Hahn echo into the system,
we obtain the coherence of NV color center spin as a function of total
evolution time and magnetic field. Furthermore we obtain the high-accuracy
relationship between the three decoherence-characteristic timescales, i.e. T_W,
T_R, T_2, and magnetic field B. And we draw a conclusion that T_R has the
highest sensitivity about magnetic field among the three time-scales. Thus, for
a certain NV color center, T_R can be the scale for the magnitude of magnetic
field, or rather, the component along the NV electronic spin axis. When
measuring an unknown magnetic field, we adjust the NV axis to three mutually
orthogonal directions respectively. By this means, we obtain the three
components of the magnetic field and thus the magnitude and direction of the
actual magnetic field. The accuracy could reach 60 nT/Hz^{1/2},and could be
greatly improved by using an ensemble of NV color centers or diamond crystals
purified with 12C atoms.

with the Fermi surface only comprising M-centered electron pockets. Here by

  This does not seem to follow from the reflection method that Scheven used for
harmonic maps with free boundary (i.e., the case $p=2$): the reflected equation
can be interpreted as a $p$-harmonic map equation into a manifold, but the

  Instead, we follow the spirit of the last-named author's recent work on free

This leads to growth estimates, which, in the critical regime $p=n$, imply
H\""older regularity of solutions. In the supercritical regime, $p < n$, we
combine the growth estimate with the geometric reflection argument: the
reflected equation is super-critical, but, under the assumption of growth
estimates, solutions are regular.
  In the case $p<n$, for stationary $p$-harmonic maps with free boundary, as a
consequence of a monotonicity formula we obtain partial regularity up to the

supernova remnants (SNRs) after an NSM takes place within a few kilo-parsec

show that if NSMs are the primary source of UHCRs, future experiments using

asymmetrical rings from notched nozzles using direct numerical simulations.
Three types of nozzle are used: i) V-notched; ii) A-notched and iii)W-notched
nozzles. The results show that a distinct main vortex ring is formed following
the shape of nozzle exit at initial formation time. However entrainment from
the surrounding ambient fluid through the trough locations creates pairs of
streamwise structure after the piston stops. This structure connects to the
leading vortex ring at the trough position and propagates toward the nozzle's
centerline. The special topology of the leading ring is augmented by the
circumferential flow, which is split into smaller portions around the
circumference. This flow drives the evolution of the ring at the later stage;
excite instability growth during the flow evolution. The streamwise vortex
tubes finally collide at the centerline of the nozzle and induce vortex
reconnection at the end of the formation. This formation process is consistent
in all examined cases, which suggests that it might be applicable for more
complex nozzle cases.

mathematical functions formed by the composition of statements following one
after the other. Each such statement is in itself a partial function, which
allows only inputs satisfying a particular Boolean condition to carry forward
the execution and hence, the composition of such functions (as a result of
sequential execution of the statements) strengthens the valid set of input
state variables for the program to complete its execution and halt succesfully.
With this thought in mind, this paper tries to study a particular class of
partial functions, which tend to preserve the truth of two given Boolean
conditions whenever the state variables satisfying one are mapped through such
functions into a domain of state variables satisfying the other. The existence
of such maps allows us to study isomorphism between different programs, based
not only on their structural characteristics (e.g. the kind of programming
constructs used and the overall input-output transformation), but also the
nature of computation performed on seemingly different inputs. Consequently, we
can now relate programs which perform a given type of computation, like a loop
counting down indefinitely, without caring about the input sets they work on
individually or the set of statements each program contains.

to bypass the high production costs and incompleteness of spectroscopic
redshift samples. Training-based photo-z methods require the preparation of a
high-quality list of spectroscopic redshifts, which needs to be constantly
updated. The photo-z training, validation, and estimation must be performed in
a consistent and reproducible way in order to accomplish the scientific
requirements. To meet this purpose, we developed an integrated web-based data
interface that not only provides the framework to carry out the above steps in
a systematic way, enabling the ease testing and comparison of different
algorithms, but also addresses the processing requirements by parallelizing the
calculation in a transparent way for the user. This framework called the

Portal can provide a reliable environment to access vast data sets, provide

obtains a random scalar reward for each arm it selects, in the proposed
problem, the learner obtains a random reward vector, where each component of
the reward vector corresponds to one of the objectives and the distribution of
the reward depends on the context that is provided to the learner at the
beginning of each round. We call this problem contextual multi-armed bandit
with a dominant objective (CMAB-DO). In CMAB-DO, the goal of the learner is to
maximize its total reward in the non-dominant objective while ensuring that it
maximizes its total reward in the dominant objective. In this case, the optimal
arm given a context is the one that maximizes the expected reward in the
non-dominant objective among all arms that maximize the expected reward in the
dominant objective. First, we show that the optimal arm lies in the Pareto
front. Then, we propose the multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit
algorithm (MOC-MAB), and define two performance measures: the 2-dimensional
(2D) regret and the Pareto regret. We show that both the 2D regret and the
Pareto regret of MOC-MAB are sublinear in the number of rounds. We also compare
the performance of the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods

a wide range of real-world applications that involve multiple and possibly

they may communicate their interactions with the user to guess the identity of
the requested file. We show that for linear schemes, the information-theoretic

$1-\frac{M+T-1}{N}$, if the servers share common randomness (unavailable at the

frequent intra-operatively performed material readjustments especially in
complex surgical cases. Our approach is able to fit a selection of common
implant models on the surgeon's desired position in a 3D computer model. This
happens with respect to the surrounding anatomical structures, always including
the possibility of adjusting both the direction and the position of the used
osteosynthesis material. By using the proposed software, surgeons are able to
pre-plan the out coming implant in its form and morphology with the aid of a
computer-visualized model within a few minutes. Further, the resulting model
can be stored in STL file format, the commonly used format for 3D printing.
Using this technology, surgeons are able to print the virtual generated
implant, or create an individually designed bending tool. This method leads to
adapted osteosynthesis materials according to the surrounding anatomy and
requires further a minimum amount of money and time.

properties, is its applicability in large-scale sample-based portfolio
optimization. If the negative return of an investment portfolio is a
differentiable convex function, the portfolio optimization with the EVaR
results in a differentiable convex program whose number of variables and
constraints is independent of the sample size, which is not the case for the
VaR and CVaR. This enables us to design an efficient algorithm using
differentiable convex optimization. Our extensive numerical study shows the
high efficiency of the algorithm in large scales, compared to the existing

portfolio optimization approach is also compared with that of CVaR-based
portfolio optimization. This comparison shows that the EVaR approach generally

Schwarzschild black hole, we calculate the energy required to duplicate
information in the BTZ black hole under the assumption of absorbing boundary
condition and its dual solution of the black string, respectively, in order to
justify the validity of the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics. For the
BTZ black hole, the required energy for the duplication of information can be
made fairly small, whereas for the black string it exceeds the total mass of
the black string, although they are related to each other under the dual
transformation. So, the duplication of information might be possible in the BTZ
black hole in contrast to the case of the black string, so that the no-cloning
theorem could be violated for the former case. To save the duplication of
information for the BTZ black hole, we perform an improved gedanken experiment
by using the local thermodynamic quantities near the horizon rather than those
defined at infinity, and show that the no-cloning theorem could be made valid
even in the BTZ black hole. We also discuss how this local treatment for the
no-cloning theorem can be applied to the black string as well as the
Schwarzschild black hole innocuously.

physical interaction length scales of the problem. We demonstrate the

angular momentum in a magnetic crystal could play an important role in the
angular momentum balance in the Einstein-de Haas effect. This proposition is
quite natural and understandable, however the idea of phonon spin seems
ambiguous in the literature. In 1988 McLellan presented phonon angular momentum
states for circular and elliptical polarizations of phonons that represent
orbital angular momentum and also pointed out analogy to isotropic quantum
harmonic oscillator. In view of its fundamental importance we investigate this
issue and conclude that phonon spin hypothesis is physically untenable, and the
phonon angular momentum has to be interpreted as orbital. The photon-phonon
analogy is also misleading. It is argued that Cosserat elastic medium having
internal torque may have lattice excitations different from phonons having spin
one or spin two that we term as Cosseratons. In addition a new source of
angular momentum balance originationg from anomalous electron magnetic moment
is suggested.

  Computing","Accepted in the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Low Power
  Electronics and Design",,,,"cs.NE cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have found widespread applications in tasks
such as pattern recognition and image classification. However, hardware
implementations of ANNs using conventional binary arithmetic units are
computationally expensive, energy-intensive and have large area overheads.
Stochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm which replaces these
conventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for
fault-tolerant applications. Spintronic devices, such as Magnetic Tunnel
Junctions (MTJs), are capable of replacing CMOS in memory and logic circuits.
In this work, we propose an energy-efficient use of MTJs, which exhibit
probabilistic switching behavior, as Stochastic Number Generators (SNGs), which
forms the basis of our NN implementation in the SC domain. Further, error
resilient target applications of NNs allow us to introduce Approximate
Computing, a framework wherein accuracy of computations is traded-off for
substantial reductions in power consumption. We propose approximating the
synaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by
properties of our MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. We design an algorithm
that can perform such approximations within a given error tolerance in a
single-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem
formulation. We then use this algorithm and develop a heuristic approach for
approximating multi-layer NNs. To give a perspective of the effectiveness of
our approach, a 43% reduction in power consumption was obtained with less than
1% accuracy loss on a standard classification problem, with 26% being brought
about by the proposed algorithm.
