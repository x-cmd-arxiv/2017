gravitational and electromagnetic field -- $geons$ -- was conjectured more than
half a century ago. If one insists on exact stationarity, topologically trivial
configurations in electro-vacuum are ruled out by no-go theorems for solitons.
But stationary, asymptotically flat geons found a realization in scalar-vacuum,
where everywhere non-singular, localized field lumps exist, known as (scalar)
boson stars. Similar geons have subsequently been found in Einstein-Dirac
theory and, more recently, in Einstein-Proca theory. We identify the common
conditions that allow these solutions, which may also exist for other spin
fields. Moreover, we present a comparison of spherically symmetric geons for
the spin $0,1/2$ and $1$, emphasising the mathematical similarities and
clarifying the physical differences, particularly between the bosonic and
fermonic cases. We clarify that for the fermionic case, Pauli's exclusion
principle prevents a continuous family of solutions for a fixed field mass;
rather only a discrete set exists, in contrast with the bosonic case.

consider a model with an additional vector-like $5+\bar{5}$ pair of $SU(5)$.
Within this model we first identify its parameter space that is consistent with
the current discrepancy and show that this implies the lighter chargino mass in
the range of $700-1200$ GeV. We examine how it is affected by constraints from
electroweak sparticle search at the LHC based on 13 TeV search with 36.1
${fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. We show that null trilepton signal searches
coming from chargino-neutralino pair production significantly constrains the
allowed parameter space except when the chargino-neutralino mass difference is
relatively small, below about 10 GeV. Next we consider the expected impact of
the New Muon $g-2$ experiment at Fermilab with its projected sensitivity reach
of $7\,\sigma$ and, assuming it confirms the current discrepancy, show that the
remaining parameter space of the considered model will be in strong tension

to study such setups systematically, we first express the Cram\'er-Rao lower
bound (CRLB) on the position error for unknown orientation and evaluate its
distribution within a square room of variable size, using 15 x 10cm anchor
coils and a commercial NFC antenna at the agent. Thereby, we find cm-accuracy
being achievable in a room of 10 x 10 x 3 meters with 12 flat wall-mounted

achieving such estimation performance is, however, difficult because of the
non-convex 5D likelihood function. To that end, we propose a fast and accurate
weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm which is insensitive to initialization.
This is enabled by effectively eliminating the orientation nuisance parameter
in a rigorous fashion and scaling the individual anchor observations, leading
to a smoothed 3D cost function. Using WLS estimates to initialize a
maximum-likelihood (ML) solver yields accuracy near the theoretical limit in up

is used to test the possibility that some fraction of the DM is composed of

low-energy window onto the high-energy physics of inflation through the
interplay between the vacuum misalignment production of axions and isocurvature
perturbations. We perform the first systematic investigation into the parameter
space of ULA isocurvature, using an accurate isocurvature transfer function at
all $m_{a}$ values. We precisely identify a ""window of co-existence"" for
$10^{-25}\text{ eV}\leq m_a\leq10^{-24}\text{ eV}$ where the data allow,
simultaneously, a $\sim10\%$ contribution of ULAs to the DM, and $\sim 1\%$
contributions of isocurvature and tensors to the CMB power. ULAs in this window
(and \textit{all} lighter ULAs) are shown to be consistent with a large
inflationary Hubble parameter, $H_I\sim 10^{14}\text{ GeV}$. The window of
co-existence will be fully probed by proposed CMB-S4 observations with
increased accuracy in the high-$\ell$ lensing power and low-$\ell$ $E$ and

we present an empirical procedure for combining interplanetary solar wind
measurements and a modeled energy equation including Coulomb relaxation to
solve for the typical outer boundary of this zone of preferential heating.
Applied to two decades of observations by the Wind spacecraft, our results are
consistent with preferential heating being active in a zone extending from the
transition region in the lower corona to an outer boundary 20-40 solar radii
from the Sun, producing a steady state super-mass-proportional
$\alpha$-to-proton temperature ratio of $5.2-5.3$. Preferential ion heating
continues far beyond the transition region and is important for the evolution
of both the outer corona and the solar wind. The outer boundary of this zone is
well below the orbits of spacecraft at 1 AU and even closer missions such as
Helios and MESSENGER, meaning it is likely that no existing mission has
directly observed intense preferential heating, just residual signatures. We
predict that {Parker Solar Probe} will be the first spacecraft with a perihelia
sufficiently close to the Sun to pass through the outer boundary, enter the
zone of preferential heating, and directly observe the physical mechanism in

basic primitive for both channel simulation and lossy compression. Applied to

proto- cols of optimal rate in the asymptotic i.i.d. limit. Finally, appealing
to the notion of channel duality recently detailed by us in [IEEE Trans. Info.

the time delay/advance experienced by a particle during scattering. Demanding
the absence of a time advance leads to constraints on the cubic vertices
present in the theory. We find that, in theories with massive spin-2 particles,
requiring no time advance means that either: (i) the cubic vertices must appear
as a particular linear combination of the Einstein-Hilbert cubic vertex and an
$h_{\mu\nu}^3$ potential term or (ii) new degrees of freedom or strong coupling
must enter at parametrically the mass of the massive spin-2 field. These
conclusions have implications for a variety of situations. Applied to theories
of large-$N$ QCD, this indicates that any spectrum with an isolated massive
spin-2 at the bottom must have these particular cubic self-couplings. Applied
to de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity, the constraint is in accord with
and generalizes previous results obtained from a shockwave calculation: of the
two free dimensionless parameters in the theory there is a one parameter line
consistent with a subluminal phase shift.

optimization, we compute bounds on the central charge as a function of the

additional assumptions, these bounds numerically reproduce the conformal
collider bounds and give a general lower bound on the central charge. We also
study the effect of gaps in the scalar, spin-2, and spin-4 spectra on the
central charge bound. We find general upper bounds on these gaps as well as
tighter restrictions on the stress-tensor 3-point function coefficients for
theories with moderate gaps. When the gap for the leading scalar or spin-2

isothermal, dead zone ought to saturate, with the libration region becoming
both symmetrical and of a uniform vortensity, leading to fast inward migration
driven by the Lindblad torques alone. However, in such a low viscosity
situation, the material on librating streamlines essentially preserves its
vortensity. If there is relative radial motion between the disc gas and the
planet, the librating streamlines will no longer be symmetrical. Hence, if the
gas is torqued by a large scale magnetic field so that it undergoes a net
inflow or outflow past the planet, driving evolution of the vortensity and
inducing asymmetry of the corotation region, the corotation torque can grow,
leading to a positive torque. In this paper we treat this effect by applying a
symmetry argument to the previously studied case of a migrating planet in an
inviscid disc. Our results show that the corotation torque due to a laminar
Hall-induced magnetic field in a dead zone behaves quite differently from that
studied previously for a viscous disc. Furthermore, the magnetic field induced

electrons is one of the most fundamental processes measured in pump/probe
experiments, but its interpretation remains under debate. We show how several
common assumptions about non-equilibrium relaxation that are pervasive in the

non-equilibrium relaxation is more complex than previously thought, but it
yields to recently developed theoretical methods in non-equilibrium theory. In
this work, we show how one can use many-body theory to properly interpret and
analyze these complex systems. We focus much of the discussion on implications

Reasoning on the basic concept of quantum mechanics, we find that in such a
picture an important term has been overlooked: the intrinsic quantum
information encoded in the coherence of pure states. To fill this gap we are
led to define a quantity, that we call coherent entropy, which is necessary to
account for the ""missing"" information and for re-establishing its conservation.
Interestingly, the coherent entropy is found to be equal to the information
conveyed in the future by quantum states. The perspective outlined in this

frequency combs has opened up new avenues to metrology and spectroscopy. The
ability to generate a series of frequency spikes with precisely controlled
separation permits a fast, highly accurate sampling of the material response.
Recently, pairs of frequency combs with slightly different repetition rates
have been utilized to down-convert material susceptibilities from the optical
to microwave regime where they can be recorded in real time. We show how this
one-dimensional dual comb technique can be extended to multiple dimensions by
using several combs. We demonstrate how nonlinear susceptibilities can be
quickly acquired using this technique. In a second class of techniques,
sequences of ultrafast mode locked laser pulses are used to recover pathways of
interactions contributing to nonlinear susceptibilities by using a
photo-acoustic modulation varying along the sequences. We show that these
techniques can be viewed as a time-domain analogue of the multiple frequency
comb scheme. %We compare the two techniques: in both, an optical high frequency
is mapped into a low frequency modulation of the signal that can be detected in

function based on the Anderson Weiss theory, from where parameters related to

characterizing the atmospheric properties on close-in transiting planets.
Recent observations have revealed a remarkable diversity in exoplanet spectra,
which show absorption signatures of Na, K and $\mathrm{H_2O}$, in some cases
partially or fully attenuated by atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols (clouds and
hazes) themselves have been detected in the transmission spectra of several
planets thanks to wavelength-dependent slopes caused by the particles'
scattering properties. Aims: We present an optical 550 - 960 nm transmission
spectrum of the extremely irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-103b, one of the hottest
(2500 K) and most massive (1.5 $M_J$) planets yet to be studied with this
technique. WASP-103b orbits its star at a separation of less than 1.2 times the
Roche limit and is predicted to be strongly tidally distorted. Methods: We have
used Gemini/GMOS to obtain multi-object spectroscopy hroughout three transits
of WASP-103b. We used relative spectrophotometry and bin sizes between 20 and 2
nm to infer the planet's transmission spectrum. Results: We find that WASP-103b
shows increased absorption in the cores of the alkali (Na, K) line features. We
do not confirm the presence of any strong scattering slope as previously
suggested, pointing towards a clear atmosphere for the highly irradiated,
massive exoplanet WASP-103b. We constrain the upper boundary of any potential
cloud deck to reside at pressure levels above 0.01 bar. This finding is in line
with previous studies on cloud occurrence on exoplanets which find that clouds
dominate the transmission spectra of cool, low surface gravity planets while
hot, high surface gravity planets are either cloud-free, or possess clouds
located below the altitudes probed by transmission spectra.

adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker
aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network by choosing to compromise
one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. To counter such attacks, an IoBT
defender attempts to reestablish the IoBT connectivity by either deploying new
IoBT nodes or by changing the roles of existing nodes. This problem is
formulated as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that extends
classical connectivity games and that explicitly takes into account the
characteristics and requirements of the IoBT network. In particular, the
defender's payoff captures the IoBT latency as well as the sum of weights of
disconnected nodes at each stage of the game. Due to the dependence of the
attacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network
state, the feedback Stackelberg solution (FSE) is used to solve the IoBT
connectivity game. Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will
remain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically.
Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when
the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 62% compared to a baseline scenario
in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 57% compared to
a baseline equal probability policy.

Taylor states compress and heat. The theoretically predicted MHD and double
adiabatic equations of state are compared to experimental measurements. We find
that the MHD equation of state is inconsistent with our data.

persist intermediate checkpoint states and final processing results. In Spark,
immutable data are used for storing data updates in each iteration, making it
inefficient for long running, iterative workloads. A non-deterministic garbage
collector further worsens this problem. Sparkle is a library that optimizes
memory usage in Spark. It exploits large shared memory to achieve better data
shuffling and intermediate storage. Sparkle replaces the current TCP/IP-based
shuffle with a shared memory approach and proposes an off-heap memory store for
efficient updates. We performed a series of experiments on scale-out clusters
and scale-up machines. The optimized shuffle engine leveraging shared memory
provides 1.3x to 6x faster performance relative to Vanilla Spark. The off-heap
memory store along with the shared-memory shuffle engine provides more than 20x
performance increase on a probabilistic graph processing workload that uses a
large-scale real-world hyperlink graph. While Sparkle benefits at most from
running on large memory machines, it also achieves 1.6x to 5x performance
improvements over scale out cluster with equivalent hardware setting.

high-resolution spectroscopy. We aim to derive new constraints on the spectral
type, effective temperature, and luminosity of HD106906b and also to provide a
high S/N template spectrum for future characterization of extrasolar planets.
We obtained 1.1-2.5 $\mu$m integral field spectroscopy with the VLT/SINFONI
instrument with a spectral resolution of R~2000-4000. New estimates of the
parameters of HD 106906b are derived by analyzing spectral features, comparing
the extracted spectra to spectral catalogs of other low-mass objects, and
fitting with theoretical isochrones. We identify several spectral absorption
lines that are consistent with a low mass for HD 106906b. We derive a new
spectral type of L1.5$\pm$1.0, one subclass earlier than previous estimates.
Through comparison with other young low-mass objects, this translates to a
luminosity of log($L/L_\odot$)=$-3.65\pm0.08$ and an effective temperature of
Teff=$1820\pm240$ K. Our new mass estimates range between $M=11.9^{+1.7}_{-0.8}
M_{\rm Jup}$ (hot start) and $M=14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.5} M_{\rm Jup}$ (cold start).
These limits take into account a possibly finite formation time, i.e., HD
106906b is allowed to be 0--3 Myr younger than its host star. We exclude
accretion onto HD 106906b at rates $\dot{M}>4.8\times10^{-10} M_{\rm

Brackett-$\gamma$) emission. This is indicative of little or no circumplanetary
gas. With our new observations, HD 106906b is the planetary-mass object with
one of the highest S/N spectra yet. We make the spectrum available for future

of 150 $\mu$Jy. These fields represent a S/N-limited sample of AzTEC / ASTE
sources with 1.1 mm S/N$\geq$4 over an area of 0.72 square degrees. Given
ALMA's fine resolution and the exceptional spectroscopic and multiwavelength
photometric data available in COSMOS, this survey allows us unprecedented power
in identifying submillimeter galaxy counterparts and determining their
redshifts through spectroscopic or photometric means. In addition to 30 sources
with prior spectroscopic redshifts, we identified redshifts for 113 galaxies
through photometric methods and an additional nine sources with lower limits,
which allowed a statistically robust determination of the redshift
distribution. We have resolved 33 AzTEC sources into multi-component systems
and our redshifts suggest that nine are likely to be physically associated. Our
overall redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim$2.0 with a high redshift tail
skewing the median redshift to $\tilde{z}$=2.48$\pm$0.05. We find that brighter
millimeter sources are preferentially found at higher redshifts. Our faintest
sources, with S$_{1.25 \rm mm}$<1.25 mJy, have a median redshift of

consistent with several previous submillimeter galaxy surveys, and moreover,
support the conclusion that the submillimeter galaxy redshift distribution is

stabilized, frictional particulate suspensions in a viscous liquid, toward
development of a constitutive model for steady shear flows at arbitrary stress.
These suspensions undergo increasingly strong continuous shear thickening (CST)
as solid volume fraction $\phi$ increases above a critical volume fraction, and
discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is observed for a range of $\phi$. When
studied at controlled stress, the DST behavior is associated with non-monotonic
flow curves of the steady-state stress as a function of shear rate. Recent
studies have related shear thickening to a transition between mostly lubricated
to predominantly frictional contacts with the increase in stress. In this
study, the behavior is simulated over a wide range of the dimensionless
parameters $(\phi,\tilde{\sigma}$, and $\mu)$, with $\tilde{\sigma} =
\sigma/\sigma_0$ the dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$ the coefficient of
interparticle friction: the dimensional stress is $\sigma$, and $\sigma_0
\propto F_0/ a^2$, where $F_0$ is the magnitude of repulsive force at contact
and $a$ is the particle radius. The data have been used to populate the model
of the lubricated-to-frictional rheology of Wyart and Cates [Phys. Rev.
Lett.{\bf 112}, 098302 (2014)], which is based on the concept of two viscosity
divergences or \textquotedblleft jamming\textquotedblright\ points at volume
fraction $\phi_{\rm J}^0 = \phi_{\rm rcp}$ (random close packing) for the
low-stress lubricated state, and at $\phi_{\rm J} (\mu) < \phi_{\rm J}^0$ for
any nonzero $\mu$ in the frictional state; a generalization provides the normal
stress response as well as the shear stress. A flow state map of this material
is developed based on the simulation results.

data points based on their characteristics. Many clustering algorithms work by
approximating the minimization of an objective function, namely the sum of
within-the-cluster distances between points. The straightforward approach
involves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the
clusters. This approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum,
however the number of possible assignments scales quickly with the number of
data points and becomes computationally intractable even for very small
datasets. In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found
using popular local-search based heuristic approaches such as k-means and
hierarchical clustering. Due to their greedy nature, such techniques do not
guarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to sub-optimal
clustering assignments. Other classes of global-search based techniques, such
as simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms may offer better
quality results but can be too time consuming to implement. In this work, we
describe how quantum annealing can be used to carry out clustering. We map the
clustering objective to a quadratic binary optimization (QUBO) problem and
discuss two clustering algorithms which are then implemented on
commercially-available quantum annealing hardware, as well as on a purely
classical solver ""qbsolv."" The first algorithm assigns N data points to K
clusters, and the second one can be used to perform binary clustering in a
hierarchical manner. We present our results in the form of benchmarks against
well-known k-means clustering and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of

collision occurs in arbitrarily small time. Moreover, at the collision time the
$H^s$-norm of the solution becomes arbitrarily large when $5/4<s<3/2$, thus

characterizing materials with both surface and bulk conduction, such as
three-dimensional topological insulators. The transport geometry for this new
resistance measurement configuration consists of one current lead as a closed
loop that fully encloses the other current lead on the surface, and two voltage
leads that are both placed outside the loop. We show that in the limit where
the transport is dominated by the surface conductivity of the material, the
four-terminal resistance measured from such a transport geometry is
proportional to $\sigma_b/\sigma_s^2$, where $\sigma_b$ and $\sigma_s$ are the
bulk and surface conductivities of the material, respectively. We call this new
type of measurement \textit{inverted resistance measurement}, as the resistance
scales inversely with the bulk resistivity. We discuss possible implementations
of this new method by performing numerical calculations on different geometries
and introduce strategies to extract the bulk and surface conductivities. We
also demonstrate inverted resistance measurements on SmB$_6$, a topological
Kondo insulator, using both single-sided and coaxially-aligned double-sided
Corbino disk transport geometries. Using this new method, we are able to
measure the bulk conductivity, even at low temperatures, where the bulk
conduction is much smaller than the surface conduction in this material.

gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although differential expression of
miRNAs have been implicated in many diseases (including cancers), the
underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Because each miRNA can target
multiple genes, miRNAs may potentially have functional implications for the
overall behavior of entire pathways. Here we investigate the functional
consequences of miRNA dysregulation through an integrative analysis of miRNA
and mRNA expression data using a novel approach that incorporates pathway
information a priori. By searching for miRNA-pathway associations that differ
between healthy and tumor tissue, we identify specific relationships at the
systems-level which are disrupted in cancer. Our approach is motivated by the
hypothesis that if a miRNA and pathway are associated, then the expression of
the miRNA and the collective behavior of the genes in a pathway will be
correlated. As such, we first obtain an expression-based summary of pathway
activity using Isomap, a dimension reduction method which can articulate
nonlinear structure in high-dimensional data. We then search for miRNAs that
exhibit differential correlations with the pathway summary between phenotypes
as a means of finding aberrant miRNA-pathway coregulation in tumors. We apply
our method to cancer data using gene and miRNA expression datasets from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compare ${\sim}10^5$ miRNA-pathway relationships
between healthy and tumor samples from four tissues (breast, prostate, lung,

from measurements, without any spectral information beside an upper bound on
the measure of the whole support set in the frequency domain. Determining the
number of measurements necessary and sufficient for reconstruction has been an
open problem, and usually partially blind sensing is performed, assuming to
have some partial spectral information available a priori. In this paper, the
minimum number of measurements that guarantees perfect recovery in the absence
of measurement error, and robust recovery in the presence of measurement error,
is determined in a completely blind setting. Results show that a factor of two
in the measurement rate is the price pay for blindness, compared to
reconstruction with full spectral knowledge. The minimum number of measurements
is also related to the fractal (Minkowski-Bouligand) dimension of a discrete
approximating set, defined in terms of the Kolmogorov $\epsilon$-entropy. These
results are analogous to a deterministic coding theorem, where an operational
quantity defined in terms of minimum measurement rate is shown to be equal to
an information-theoretic one. A comparison with parallel results in compressed

physical explanation for the origin of suprathermal electron distribution
function in a highly collisional plasma. This process involves a newly
discovered electrostatic bremsstrahlung emission that is effective in a plasma
in which binary collisions are present. The steady-state electron velocity
distribution function dictated by such a process corresponds to a Maxwellian
core plus a quasi-inverse power-law tail, which is a feature commonly observed
in many space plasma environment. In order to demonstrate this, the system of
self-consistent particle- and wave- kinetic equations are numerically solved
with an initially Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and Langmuir wave
spectral intensity, which is a state that does not reflect the presence of
electrostatic bremsstrahlung process, and hence not in force balance. The
electrostatic bremsstrahlung term subsequently drives the system to a new
force-balanced steady state. After a long integration period it is demonstrated
the initial Langmuir fluctuation spectrum is modified, which in turn distorts
the initial Maxwellian electron distribution into a velocity distribution that
resembles the said core-suprathermal velocity distribution. Such a mechanism
may thus be operative at the coronal source region, which is characterized by
high collisionality.

the random localization of native defects in the diamond sample. Here we

processes $\pi K^*\to \rho K$ and $\rho K^*\to \pi K$, which are crucial in the
determination of the abundances of $K^*$ and $K$ in heavy ion collisions.
Improving previous calculations, we have considered several mechanisms which
were missing, such as the exchange of axial and vector resonances ($K_1(1270)$,
$K^*_2(1430)$, $h_1(1170)$, etc...) and also other processes such as $\pi
K^*\to \omega K, \phi K$ and $\omega K^*,\,\phi K^*\to \pi K$. We find that
some of these mechanisms give important contributions to the cross section. Our

important than its absorption.

$q_T$ dependencies were observed for several angular distribution coefficients,
$A_i$, including $A_0 - A_4$. Significant $y$ dependencies were also found for
the coefficients $A_1$, $A_3$ and $A_4$, while $A_0$ and $A_2$ exhibit very
weak rapidity dependence. Using an intuitive geometric picture we show that the
$q_T$ and $y$ dependencies of the angular distributions coefficients can be
well described.

this Laurent polynomial ring can be generated as an edge ring for some graph.
The combinatorial structure of the graph has been successfully applied to
identify and classify many important commutative algebraic properties of the
corresponding edge ring. In this paper, we classify Serre's $R_1$ condition for
all quadratic-monomial generated subrings of $k[x_1^{\pm 1},\dots,x_n^{\pm

edge ring is not Cohen-Macaulay. This paper extends the work of Hibi and Ohsugi
from the setting subrings of polynomial rings to subrings of Laurent polynomial
rings.

any unsorted array) the records matching specified attributes, as in SQL SELECT
queries, but where the database and the query are encrypted. Secure search has
been the leading example for practical applications of Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE) starting in Gentry's seminal work; however, to the best of our
knowledge all state-of-the-art secure search algorithms to date are realized by
a polynomial of degree $\Omega(m)$ for $m$ the number of records, which is
typically too slow in practice even for moderate size $m$.
  In this work we present the first algorithm for secure search that is
realized by a polynomial of degree polynomial in $\log m$. We implemented our
algorithm in an open source library based on HELib implementation for the
Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanthan's FHE scheme, and ran experiments on Amazon's
EC2 cloud. Our experiments show that we can retrieve the first match in a
database of millions of entries in less than an hour using a single machine;
the time reduced almost linearly with the number of machines.
  Our result utilizes a new paradigm of employing coresets and sketches, which
are modern data summarization techniques common in computational geometry and
machine learning, for efficiency enhancement for homomorphic encryption. As a
central tool we design a novel sketch that returns the first positive entry in
a (not necessarily sparse) array; this sketch may be of independent interest.

  Representation Learning","Ph.D. thesis",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of deep learning in computer vision is rooted in the ability of
deep networks to scale up model complexity as demanded by challenging visual
tasks. As complexity is increased, so is the need for large amounts of labeled
data to train the model. This is associated with a costly human annotation
effort. To address this concern, with the long-term goal of leveraging the
abundance of cheap unlabeled data, we explore methods of unsupervised
""pre-training."" In particular, we propose to use self-supervised automatic
image colorization.
  We show that traditional methods for unsupervised learning, such as
layer-wise clustering or autoencoders, remain inferior to supervised
pre-training. In search for an alternative, we develop a fully automatic image
colorization method. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art in revitalizing old
black-and-white photography, without requiring human effort or expertise.
Additionally, it gives us a method for self-supervised representation learning.
In order for the model to appropriately re-color a grayscale object, it must
first be able to identify it. This ability, learned entirely self-supervised,
can be used to improve other visual tasks, such as classification and semantic
segmentation. As a future direction for self-supervision, we investigate if
multiple proxy tasks can be combined to improve generalization. This turns out
to be a challenging open problem. We hope that our contributions to this
endeavor will provide a foundation for future efforts in making
self-supervision compete with supervised pre-training.

the most well-known examples in turbulent flows, knowledge of the logarithmic
mean velocity profile (MVP), so called the log law of the wall, plays an
important role everywhere turbulent flow meets the solid wall, such as fluids
in any kind of channels, skin friction of all types of transportations, the
atmospheric wind on a planetary ground, and the oceanic current on the seabed.
However, the mechanism of how this log-law MVP is formed under the multiscale
nature of turbulent shears remains one of the greatest interests of turbulence
puzzles. To untangle the multiscale coupling of turbulent shear stresses, we
explore for a known fundamental tool in physics. Here we present how to
reproduce the log-law MVP with the even harmonic modes of fixed-end standing
waves. We find that when these harmonic waves of same magnitude are considered
as the multiscale turbulent shear stresses, the wave envelope of their
superposition simulates the mean shear stress profile of the wall-bounded flow.
It implies that the log-law MVP is not expectedly related to the turbulent
scales in the inertial subrange associated with the Kolmogorov energy cascade,
revealing the dissipative nature of all scales involved. The MVP with reduced
harmonic modes also shows promising connection to the understanding of flow
transition to turbulence. The finding here suggests the simple harmonic waves
as good agents to help unravel the complex turbulent dynamics in wall-bounded
flow.

Observations were calibrated by accounting for the effects of antenna beam

phenomenological models for the global $21$ cm signal. For tanh-based
representations of the ionization history during the epoch of reionization, we
rule out, at $\geq2\sigma$ significance, models with duration of up to $\Delta
z = 1$ at $z\approx8.5$ and higher than $\Delta z = 0.4$ across most of the
observed redshift range under the usual assumption that the $21$ cm spin
temperature is much larger than the temperature of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) during reionization. We also investigate a `cold' IGM scenario
that assumes perfect Ly$\alpha$ coupling of the $21$ cm spin temperature to the
temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), but that the IGM is not heated
by early stars or stellar remants. Under this assumption, we reject tanh-based
reionization models of duration $\Delta z \lesssim 2$ over most of the observed
redshift range. Finally, we explore and reject a broad range of Gaussian models
for the $21$ cm absorption feature expected in the First Light era. As an

manifolds that describe trajectories through a high-dimensional state space
that enable situation-specific predictions from the same neural network. With
the proposed approach, we can segment games into sequences of situations that
are learnt in an unsupervised way, and learn conceptors that are useful for the
prediction of the near future of the respective situation.

(MDN) approach. This model is not only capable of predicting a basketball
trajectory based on real data, but it also can generate new trajectory samples.
It is an excellent application to help coaches and players decide when and
where to shoot. Its structure is particularly suitable for dealing with time
series problems. BLSTM receives forward and backward information at the same
time, while stacking multiple BLSTMs further increases the learning ability of
the model. Combined with BLSTMs, MDN is used to generate a multi-modal
distribution of outputs. Thus, the proposed model can, in principle, represent
arbitrary conditional probability distributions of output variables. We tested
our model with two experiments on three-pointer datasets from NBA SportVu data.
In the hit-or-miss classification experiment, the proposed model outperformed
other models in terms of the convergence speed and accuracy. In the trajectory
generation experiment, eight model-generated trajectories at a given time
closely matched real trajectories.

imitates visual sequences without additional supervision. As a result, our
model can be applied at several semantic levels and does not require any domain
knowledge or handcrafted features. We achieve this by formulating visual
forecasting as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, and directly
imitate the dynamics in natural sequences from their raw pixel values. The key
challenge is the high-dimensional and continuous state-action space that
prohibits the application of previous IRL algorithms. We address this
computational bottleneck by extending recent progress in model-free imitation
with trainable deep feature representations, which (1) bypasses the exhaustive
state-action pair visits in dynamic programming by using a dual formulation and
(2) avoids explicit state sampling at gradient computation using a deep feature
reparametrization. This allows us to apply IRL at scale and directly imitate
the dynamics in high-dimensional continuous visual sequences from the raw pixel
values. We evaluate our approach at three different level-of-abstraction, from
low level pixels to higher level semantics: future frame generation, action
anticipation, visual story forecasting. At all levels, our approach outperforms
existing methods.

maximum likelihood estimation requires a stronger signal-to-noise model
identifiability condition compared to its least squares counterpart. Finally,
since there are three different asymptotic regimes that depend on the behavior
of the norm difference of the model parameters before and after the change
point, which cannot be realistically assumed to be known, we develop a novel
data driven adaptive procedure that provides valid confidence intervals for the
common break, without requiring a priori knowledge of the asymptotic regime the
problem falls in.

huge training data and model parameters which are too big to fit into the

commodity hardware to attain significant speedup and obtain better results
making it quite economical as compared to farm of GPUs and supercomputers. We
have proposed a new algorithm for training of deep networks for the case when
the network is partitioned across the machines (Model Parallelism) along with
detailed cost analysis and proof of convergence of the same. We have developed
implementations for Fully-Connected Feedforward Networks, Convolutional Neural

recurrent neural network to model lyric, and then establishes correlation via a

arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous

between two points $x,y$ within a (not necessarily simply-connected) planar
domain $\Omega$, is to define a non-negative distance function $d(x,y)$ on
$\Omega\times\Omega$ such that following the (descending) gradient of this
distance function traces such a path. This presents two equally important
challenges: A mathematical challenge -- to define $d$ such that $d(x,y)$ has a
single minimum for any fixed $y$ (and this is when $x=y$), since a local
minimum is in effect a ""dead end"", A computational challenge -- to define $d$
such that it may be computed efficiently. In this paper, given a description of
$\Omega$, we show how to assign coordinates to each point of $\Omega$ and
define a family of distance functions between points using these coordinates,
such that both the mathematical and the computational challenges are met. This
is done using the concepts of \emph{harmonic measure} and
\emph{$f$-divergences}.
  In practice, path planning is done on a discrete network defined on a finite
set of \emph{sites} sampled from $\Omega$, so any method that works well on the
continuous domain must be adapted so that it still works well on the discrete
domain. Given a set of sites sampled from $\Omega$, we show how to define a
network connecting these sites such that a \emph{greedy routing} algorithm
(which is the discrete equivalent of continuous gradient descent) based on the
distance function mentioned above is guaranteed to generate a path in the
network between any two such sites. In many cases, this network is close to a
(desirable) planar graph, especially if the set of sites is dense.

$\gamma^2 $Velorum (WR 11) with a high-energy $\gamma$-ray source observed by
\textit{Fermi}-LAT contrast the so-far exclusive role of $\eta$ Carinae as the
hitherto only detected $\gamma$-ray emitter in the source class of
particle-accelerating colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems. We offer support to
this claim of association by providing dedicated model predictions for the
nonthermal photon emission spectrum of $\gamma^2$ Velorum.
  We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic modeling (MHD) to investigate
the structure and conditions of the wind-collision region (WCR) of $\gamma^2$
Velorum including the important effect of radiative braking in the stellar
winds. A transport equation is then solved throughout the computational domain
to study the propagation of relativistic electrons and protons. The resulting
distributions of particles are subsequently used to compute nonthermal photon
emission components.
  In agreement with observation in X-ray spectroscopy, our simulations yield a
large shock-cone opening angle. We find the nonthermal $\gamma$-ray emission of
$\gamma^2$ Velorum to be of hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation
fields in the binary system which inhibit the acceleration of electrons to
energies sufficiently high for efficient inverse Compton radiation. We also
discuss the strong dependence of a hadronic $\gamma$-ray component on the
energy-dependent diffusion used in the simulations. Of two mass-loss rates for
the WR star found in literature, only the higher one is able to accommodate the
observed $\gamma$-ray spectrum with reasonable values for important simulation
parameters such as the injection ratio of high-energy particles within the WCR.

in the case of strong coupling and/or strong measurement drive, owing to the
so-called Purcell effect. A recent proposal by virtue of longitudinal coupling
suggests a new scheme to realize fast, high-fidelity, and {\it ideal QND}
readout of qubit state. The aim of the present work is twofold: (i) In parallel
to what has been done in the past years for the dispersive readout, we carry
out the gradual partial-collapse theory for this recent scheme, in terms of
both the quantum trajectory equation and quantum Bayesian approaches. The
partial-collapse weak measurement theory is useful for such as the
measurement-based feedback control and other quantum applications. (ii) In the
physical aspect, we construct the joint qubit-plus-cavity entangled state under
continuous measurement and present a comprehensive analysis for the quantum
efficiency,qubit-state purity, and signal-to-noise ratio in the output
currents. The combination of the joint state and the quantum Bayesian rule
provides a generalized scheme of cavity reset associated with the longitudinal
coupling, which can restore the qubit to a quantum pure state from entanglement
with the cavity states, and thus benefits the successive partial-collapse
measurements after qubit rotations.

We investigate here for the first time a new synchronization regime in TWTs
based on SWSs operating near a third order degeneracy condition in their
dispersion. This special three-eigenmode synchronization is associated with a
stationary inflection point (SIP) that is manifested by the coalescence of
three Floquet-Bloch eigenmodes in the SWS. We demonstrate the special features
of ""cold"" (without electron beam) periodic SWSs with SIP modeled as coupled
transmission lines (CTLs) and investigate resonances of SWSs of finite length.
We also show that by tuning parameters of a periodic SWS one can achieve an SIP
with nearly ideal flat dispersion relationship with zero group velocity or a
slightly slanted one with a very small (positive or negative) group velocity
leading to different operating schemes. When the SIP structure is synchronized
with the electron beam potential benefits for amplification include (i) gain
enhancement, (ii) gain-bandwidth product improvement, and (iii) higher power
efficiency, when compared to conventional Pierce-like TWTs. The proposed theory
paves the way for a new approach for potential improvements in gain, power
efficiency and gain-bandwidth product in high power microwave amplifiers.
