  Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a power allocation strategy for the adaptive
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) index modulation (IM) in
cooperative networks. The allocation strategy is based on the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and aims at maximizing the average network
capacity according to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). As the
transmit power at source and relay is constrained separately, we can thus
formulate an optimization problem by allocating power to active subcarriers.
Compared to the conventional uniform power allocation strategy, the proposed
dynamic strategy can lead to a higher average network capacity, especially in
the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The analysis is also verified by
numerical results produced by Monte Carlo simulations. By applying the proposed
power allocation strategy, the efficiency of adaptive OFDM IM can be enhanced
in practice, which paves the way for its implementation in the future,
especially for cell-edge communications.

higher-order processes with at least two phonons being involved. At second
order, coupling with the entire phonon spectrum induces a response that may

into distinct blocks originate in many scientific areas. A pertinent example is
the interactions between financial assets and selected macroeconomic

shortcoming of this approach is that it ignores potential influences from other
related components (e.g. Gross Domestic Product) that may exert influence on
the system's dynamics and structure and thus produces incorrect results. To
mitigate this issue, we consider a multi-block linear dynamical system with
Granger-causal ordering between blocks, wherein the blocks' temporal dynamics
are described by vector autoregressive processes and are influenced by blocks
higher in the system hierarchy. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for
the posited model for Gaussian data in the high-dimensional setting based on
appropriate regularization schemes for the parameters of the block components.
To optimize the underlying non-convex likelihood function, we develop an
iterative algorithm with convergence guarantees. We establish theoretical
properties of the maximum likelihood estimates, leveraging the decomposability
of the regularizers and a careful analysis of the iterates. Finally, we develop
testing procedures for the null hypothesis of whether a block ""Granger-causes""

novel and efficient method to estimate the probability distribution of the
wetting saturation field under uncertain rock properties in highly
heterogeneous porous systems, where streamline patterns are dominated by
permeability heterogeneity, and for slow displacement processes (viscosity
ratio close to unity). Our method, referred to as the frozen streamline
distribution method (FROST), is based on a physical understanding of the
stochastic problem. Indeed, we identify key random fields that guide the
wetting saturation variability, namely fluid particle times of flight and
injection times. By comparing saturation statistics against full-physics Monte
Carlo simulations, we illustrate how this simple, yet accurate FROST method
performs under the preliminary approximation of frozen streamlines. Further, we
inspect the performance of an accelerated FROST variant that relies on a
simplification about injection time statistics. Finally, we introduce how
quantiles of saturation can be efficiently computed within the FROST framework,
hence leading to robust uncertainty assessment.

that the joint net electricity consumption cost is allocated to the

The allocations also satisfy the standalone cost principle and promote PV solar

properties of semiconductors, like carrier mobilities, (magneto-)transport
properties, or band extrema characteristics yielding carrier densities and
density of states. Currently, these masses are usually calculated using
finite-difference estimation of density functional theory (DFT) electronic band
curvatures. However, finite differences require an additional convergence study
and are prone to numerical noise. Moreover, the concept of effective mass
breaks down at degenerate band extrema. We assess the former limitation by
developing a method that allows to obtain the Hessian of DFT bands directly,
using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Then, we solve the latter
issue by adapting the concept of `transport equivalent effective mass' to the
$\vec{k} \cdot \hat{\vec{p}}$ framework. The numerical noise inherent to
finite-difference methods is thus eliminated, along with the associated
convergence study. The resulting method is therefore more general, more robust
and simpler to use, which makes it especially appropriate for high-throughput
computing. After validating the developed techniques, we apply them to the
study of silicon, graphane, and arsenic. The formalism is implemented into the
ABINIT software and supports the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, the
projector augmented-wave method, and the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. The
derived expressions also apply to the ultrasoft pseudopotential method.

considering a mixture of Gaussian distributions with ordered means in a way

does BINT look like across the three arcs -- logic, typed $\lambda$-calculi,
and category theory -- of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence?
Categorically, BINT can be seen as a mixing of two worlds: the first being
intuitionistic logic (IL), which is modeled by a cartesian closed category, and
the second being the dual to intuitionistic logic called cointuitionistic logic
(coIL), which is modeled by a cocartesian coclosed category. Crolard showed
that combining these two categories into the same category results in it
degenerating to a poset. However, this degeneration does not occur when both
logics are linear. We propose that IL and coIL need to be separated, and then
mixed in a controlled way using the modalities from linear logic. This
separation can be ultimately achieved by an adjoint formalization of
bi-intuitionistic logic. This formalization consists of three worlds instead of
two: the first is intuitionistic logic, the second is linear bi-intuitionistic
(Bi-ILL), and the third is cointuitionistic logic. They are then related via
two adjunctions. The adjunction between IL and ILL is known as a
Linear/Non-linear model (LNL model) of ILL, and is due to Benton. However, the
dual to LNL models which would amount to the adjunction between coILL and coIL
has yet to appear in the literature. In this paper we fill this gap by studying
the dual to LNL models which we call dual LNL models. We show that dual LNL
models correspond to dual linear categories, the dual to Bierman's linear
categories proposed by Bellin. Then we give the definition of bi-LNL models by
combining our model with LNL models to obtain a new model of bi-intuitionistic
logic. Finally, we give a corresponding sequent calculus, natural deduction,
and term assignment for dual LNL models.

complicates the task of network verification. Previous work showed that the

  We describe a new algorithm for conservatively checking isolation properties

in the size of the network, albeit being exponential in the maximal number of

  Our algorithm is sound, i.e., it can never miss a violation of safety but may

interpretation by (1) abstracting away the order of packet processing and the
number of times each packet arrives, (2) abstracting away correlations between
states of different middleboxes and channel contents, and (3) representing
middlebox states by their effect on each packet separately, rather than taking
into account the entire state space. We show that the abstractions do not lose
precision when middleboxes may reset in any state. This is encouraging since
many real middleboxes reset, e.g., after some session timeout is reached or due

dimensions: the collection of personal data, the inference of new information,
the exchange of information to third parties, and the risk-utility trade-off
posed by the features of the system. Altogether, 113 Brazilian individuals
answered a survey about such dimensions. Although their perceptions seem to be

that IoT users can be classified into unconcerned, fundamentalists and

and complex challenge in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hyperpolarisation offers enormous gains in signal
and spatial resolution which may ultimately lead to the development of
molecular MRI and NMR. At present, techniques used to polarise nuclear spins
generally require low temperatures and/or high magnetic fields, radio-frequency
control fields, or the introduction of catalysts or free-radical mediators. The
emergence of room temperature solid-state spin qubits has opened exciting new
pathways to circumvent these requirements to achieve direct nuclear spin
hyperpolarisation using quantum control. Employing a novel cross-relaxation
induced polarisation (CRIP) protocol using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centre in diamond, we demonstrate the first external nuclear spin
hyperpolarisation achieved by a quantum probe, in this case of $^1$H molecular
spins in poly(methyl methacrylate). In doing so, we show that a single qubit is
capable of increasing the thermal polarisation of $\sim 10^6$ nuclear spins by
six orders of magnitude, equivalent to an applied magnetic field of $10^5$\,T.
The technique can also be tuned to multiple spin species, which we demonstrate
using both \C{13} and $^1$H nuclear spin ensembles. Our results are analysed
and interpreted via a detailed theoretical treatment, which is also used to
describe how the system can be scaled up to a universal quantum
hyperpolarisation platform for the production of macroscopic quantities of
contrast agents at high polarisation levels for clinical applications. These
results represent a new paradigm for nuclear spin hyperpolarisation for
molecular imaging and spectroscopy, and beyond into areas such as materials
science and quantum information processing.

tracer reconstruction is presented, including error analysis. The method works
by correlating the largest principal components of a matrix representation of

was measured and used to quantify the lifetime of each principal component. The
method was tested on the 500 K isentropic surface with stratospheric ozone
concentration measurements from the Polar Aerosol and Ozone Measurement (POAM)
III satellite instrument during October and November 1998 and compared with the
older proxy tracer method which works by correlating measurements with a single
other tracer or proxy. Using a 60 day integration time and five (5) principal
components, cross validation of globally reconstructed ozone and comparison
with ozone sondes returned root-mean-square errors of 0.16 ppmv and 0.36 ppmv,
respectively. This compares favourably with the classic proxy tracer method in
which a passive tracer equivalent latitude field was used for the proxy and
which returned RMS errors of 0.22 ppmv and 0.59 ppmv for cross-validation and
sonde validation respectively. The method seems especially effective for
shorter lived tracers and was far more accurate than the classic method at
predicting ozone concentration in the Southern hemisphere over the same time
period. It is also more effective when reconstruction is performed over the
entire Earth rather than a single hemisphere allowing for seamless
reconstruction of global fields.

simulate the formation of BH-binaries in GCs through exchange interactions

Additionally, we consider the impact of the BH population on the rate of
compact binaries undergoing gravitational wave driven mergers. The
characteristics of the BH-LMXB population and binary properties are sensitive
to the GCs structural parameters as well as its unobservable BH population. We
find that GCs retaining $\sim 1000$ BHs produce a galactic population of $\sim
150$ ejected BH-LMXBs whereas GCs retaining only $\sim20$ BHs produce zero
ejected BH-LMXBs. Moreover, we explore the possibility that some of the
presently known BH-LMXBs might have originated in GCs and identify five

  algorithm to Solve Inventory Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The beer game is a widely used in-class game that is played in supply chain
management classes to demonstrate the bullwhip effect. The game is a
decentralized, multi-agent, cooperative problem that can be modeled as a serial
supply chain network in which agents cooperatively attempt to minimize the
total cost of the network even though each agent can only observe its own local
information. Each agent chooses order quantities to replenish its stock. Under
some conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is known to be optimal.
However, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents (stages) may act
irrationally (as they do in the beer game), there is no known optimal policy
for an agent wishing to act optimally.
  We propose a machine learning algorithm, based on deep Q-networks, to
optimize the replenishment decisions at a given stage. When playing alongside
agents who follow a base-stock policy, our algorithm obtains near-optimal order
quantities. It performs much better than a base-stock policy when the other
agents use a more realistic model of human ordering behavior. Unlike most other
algorithms in the literature, our algorithm does not have any limits on the
beer game parameter values. Like any deep learning algorithm, training the
algorithm can be computationally intensive, but this can be performed ahead of
time; the algorithm executes in real time when the game is played. Moreover, we
propose a transfer learning approach so that the training performed for one
agent and one set of cost coefficients can be adapted quickly for other agents
and costs. Our algorithm can be extended to other decentralized multi-agent
cooperative games with partially observed information, which is a common type
of situation in real-world supply chain problems.

calculate the matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-beta decay. Studies
within other models indicate that a good description of neutron-proton pairing
is essential for accurate calculations of those matrix elements. The usual
interacting boson model is based only on like-particle pairs, however, and the
extent to which it captures neutron-proton pairing is not clear.
  Purpose: To determine whether neutron-proton pairing should be explicitly
included as neutron-proton bosons in IBM calculations of neutrinoless
double-beta decay matrix elements.
  Method: An isospin-invariant version of the nucleon-pair shell model is
applied to carry out shell-model calculations in a large space and in a
collective subspace, and to define effective operators in the latter. A
democratic mapping is then used to define corresponding boson operators for the
IBM, with and without an isoscalar neutron-proton pair boson.
  Results: IBM calculations with and without the isoscalar boson are carried
out for nuclei near the beginning of the $pf$ shell, with a realistic
shell-model Hamiltonian and neutrinoless double-beta-decay operator as the
starting point. Energy spectra and double-beta matrix elements are compared to
those obtained in the underlying shell model.
  Conclusions: The isoscalar boson does not improve energy spectra but does
improve double-beta matrix elements. To be useful at the level of precision we
need, the mapping procedure must be further developed to better determine the
dependence of the boson Hamiltonian and decay operator on particle number and
isospin. But the benefits provided by the isoscalar boson suggest that through
an appropriate combination of mappings and fitting, it would make IBM matrix
elements more accurate for the heavier nuclei used in experiments.

problem in the current approach to storing network data. Simply stated, network
data is not tamper-evident. In other words, if some links or nodes were

administrator to detect such changes. While, in the current age of social media

limits on the signal strength of four-top production at the LHC. Surprisingly,
we find that the constraining power of four-top production on the $qqtt$ type
of operators is already competitive with the measurements of top-pair
production, even though the precision level of the latter is more than two
orders of magnitude better. This is explained by the enhanced sensitivity of
the four-top cross section to $qqtt$ operators, due to multiple insertion of
operators in the squared amplitude, and to the large threshold energy of
four-top production. We point out that even though the dominant contribution
beyond the standard model comes from the $\mathcal{O}(C^4/\Lambda^8)$ terms,
the effective field theory expansion remains valid for a wide range of
underlying theories. Considering the possible improvements of this measurement
with higher integrated luminosity, we believe that this process will become
even more crucial for probing and testing the standard model deviations in the
top-quark sector, and will eventually provide valuable information about the
top-quark properties, leading to significant improvements in precision top

We
consider a complementary problem that has a much sparser literature: anomaly
description. Interpretation of anomalies is crucial for practitioners for
sense-making, troubleshooting, and planning actions. To this end, we present a
new approach called x-PACS (for eXplaining Patterns of Anomalies with
Characterizing Subspaces), which ""reverse-engineers"" the known anomalies by
identifying (1) the groups (or patterns) that they form, and (2) the
characterizing subspace and feature rules that separate each anomalous pattern
from normal instances. Explaining anomalies in groups not only saves analyst
time and gives insight into various types of anomalies, but also draws
attention to potentially critical, repeating anomalies.
  In developing x-PACS, we first construct a desiderata for the anomaly
description problem. From a descriptive data mining perspective, our method
exhibits five desired properties in our desiderata. Namely, it can unearth
anomalous patterns (i) of multiple different types, (ii) hidden in arbitrary
subspaces of a high dimensional space, (iii) interpretable by the analysts,
(iv) different from normal patterns of the data, and finally (v) succinct,
providing the shortest data description. Furthermore, x-PACS is highly
parallelizable and scales linearly in terms of data size.
  No existing work on anomaly description satisfies all of these properties
simultaneously. While not our primary goal, the anomalous patterns we find
serve as interpretable ""signatures"" and can be used for detection. We show the
effectiveness of x-PACS in explanation as well as detection on real-world

which a number of cuboid-shaped items must be put into a bin one by one
orthogonally. The objective is to find a way to place these items that can
minimize the surface area of the bin. This problem is based on the fact that
there is no fixed-sized bin in many real business scenarios and the cost of a
bin is proportional to its surface area. Our research shows that this problem
is NP-hard. Based on previous research on 3D BPP, the surface area is
determined by the sequence, spatial locations and orientations of items. Among
these factors, the sequence of items plays a key role in minimizing the surface
area. Inspired by recent achievements of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
techniques, especially Pointer Network, on combinatorial optimization problems
such as TSP, a DRL-based method is applied to optimize the sequence of items to
be packed into the bin. Numerical results show that the method proposed in this

signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis
of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward ""unmixing"" have been
developed, under the name of ""leakage correction"". One recent noteworthy
approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which
forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero.
One goal is to show that Colclough's method produces false human connectomes
under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new
solution, that appropriately ""unmixes"" the inverse solution signals, based on
innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate
autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations.
Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and
orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the ""unmixing"" matrix, which
is then finally used to ""unmix"" the inverse solution signals. It is shown that
under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes,
even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.

We ask the following weak recovery question: what is the minimum number of
measurements $n$ needed to produce an estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol

x$? We consider the case of Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol a_i$. We prove that -
in the high-dimensional limit - a sharp phase transition takes place, and we
locate the threshold in the regime of vanishingly small noise. For $n\le
d-o(d)$ no estimator can do significantly better than random and achieve a
strictly positive correlation. For $n\ge d+o(d)$ a simple spectral estimator
achieves a positive correlation. Surprisingly, numerical simulations with the
same spectral estimator demonstrate promising performance with realistic
sensing matrices. Spectral methods are used to initialize non-convex
optimization algorithms in phase retrieval, and our approach can boost the
performance in this setting as well.
  Our impossibility result is based on classical information-theory arguments.
The spectral algorithm computes the leading eigenvector of a weighted empirical
covariance matrix. We obtain a sharp characterization of the spectral
properties of this random matrix using tools from free probability and
generalizing a recent result by Lu and Li. Both the upper and lower bound
generalize beyond phase retrieval to measurements $y_i$ produced according to a
generalized linear model. As a byproduct of our analysis, we compare the

are uniformly distributed in a large area such that the channel matrix can be
considered as sparse. Based on this phenomenon, RRHs only need to detect the
relatively strong signals from nearby users and ignore the weak signals from
far users, which is helpful to develop low-complexity detection algorithms
without causing much performance loss. However, before detection, RRHs require
to obtain the realtime user activity information by the dynamic grant
procedure, which causes the enormous latency. To address this issue, in this
paper, we consider a grant-free C-RAN system and propose a low-complexity
Bernoulli-Gaussian message passing (BGMP) algorithm based on the sparsified
channel, which jointly detects the user activity and signal. Since active users
are assumed to transmit Gaussian signals at any time, the user activity can be
regarded as a Bernoulli variable and the signals from all users obey a
Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. In the BGMP, the detection functions for
signals are designed with respect to the Bernoulli-Gaussian variable. Numerical
results demonstrate the robustness and effectivity of the BGMP. That is, for
different sparsified channels, the BGMP can approach the mean-square error
(MSE) of the genie-aided sparse minimum mean-square error (GA-SMMSE) which
exactly knows the user activity information. Meanwhile, the fast convergence
and strong recovery capability for user activity of the BGMP are also verified.

translation-and-modulation operators, respectively. They have been extensively
studied. However, dilation-and-modulation systems have not, and they cannot be
derived from wavelet or Gabor systems. In this paper, we investigate a class of
dilation-and-modulation systems in the causal signal space $L^{2}(\Bbb R_{+})$.
$L^{2}(\Bbb R_{+})$ can be identified a subspace of $L^{2}(\Bbb R)$ consisting
of all $L^{2}(\Bbb R)$-functions supported on $\Bbb R_{+}$, and is unclosed
under the Fourier transform. So the Fourier transform method does not work in
$L^{2}(\Bbb R_{+})$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of
$\Theta_{a}$-transform in $L^{2}(\Bbb R_{+})$, using $\Theta_{a}$-transform we
characterize dilation-and-modulation frames and dual frames in $L^{2}(\Bbb
R_{+})$; and present an explicit expression of all duals with the same
structure for a general dilation-and-modulation frame for $L^{2}(\Bbb R_{+})$.
Interestingly, we prove that an arbitrary frame of this form is always
nonredundant whenever the number of the generators is $1$, and is always
redundant whenever it is greater than $1$. Some examples are also provided to
illustrate the generality of our results.

two applications. The first one is the circular Couette flow between rotating

and methods for identifying powerful vertices, while related work for edges is
much lesser, especially for weighted networks, due to the computational
challenge. In this paper, we propose to use the well-known Kirchhoff index as
the measure of edge centrality in weighted networks, called $\theta$-Kirchhoff
edge centrality. The Kirchhoff index of a network is defined as the sum of
effective resistances over all vertex pairs. The centrality of an edge $e$ is
reflected in the increase of Kirchhoff index of the network when the edge $e$
is partially deactivated, characterized by a parameter $\theta$. We define two
equivalent measures for $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality. Both are global
metrics and have a better discriminating power than commonly used measures,
based on local or partial structural information of networks, e.g. edge
betweenness and spanning edge centrality.
  Despite the strong advantages of Kirchhoff index as a centrality measure and
its wide applications, computing the exact value of Kirchhoff edge centrality
for each edge in a graph is computationally demanding. To solve this problem,
for each of the $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality metrics, we present an
efficient algorithm to compute its $\epsilon$-approximation for all the $m$
edges in nearly linear time in $m$. The proposed $\theta$-Kirchhoff edge
centrality is the first global metric of edge importance that can be provably
approximated in nearly-linear time. Moreover, according to the
$\theta$-Kirchhoff edge centrality, we present a $\theta$-Kirchhoff vertex
centrality measure, as well as a fast algorithm that can compute
$\epsilon$-approximate Kirchhoff vertex centrality for all the $n$ vertices in
nearly linear time in $m$.

monitor an area of interest, in order to diagnose on real time its state. Each
sensor node forwards information about relevant features towards the sink where
the data is processed. Nevertheless, energy conservation is a key issue in the
design of such networks and once a sensor exhausts its resources, it will be
dropped from the network. This will lead to broken links and data loss. It is
therefore important to keep the network running for as long as possible by
preserving the energy held by the nodes. Indeed, saving the quality of service
(QoS) of a wireless sensor network for a long period is very important in order
to ensure accurate data. Then, the area diagnosing will be more accurate. From
another side, packet transmission is the phase that consumes the highest amount
of energy comparing to other activities in the network. Therefore, we can see
that the network topology has an important impact on energy efficiency, and
thus on data and diagnosis accuracies. In this paper, we study and compare four
network topologies: distributed, hierarchical, centralized, and decentralized
topology and show their impact on the resulting estimation of diagnostics. We
have used six diagnostic algorithms, to evaluate both prognostic and health
management with the variation of type of topology in WSN.

the procedure for the concept of self-training for sequential classification of

samples to increase the classification accuracy and the deletion of
non-informative samples to be memory- and runtime-efficient. Moreover, we
update the parameters in the incremental IVM model without re-training from

sets. The performance of the IVM in comparison to support vector machines (SVM)
is evaluated in terms of accuracy and experiments are conducted to assess the
potential of the probabilistic outputs of the IVM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the IVM and SVM perform similar in terms of classification
accuracy. However, the number of import vectors is significantly lower when
compared to the number of support vectors and thus, the computation time during
classification can be decreased. Moreover, the probabilities provided by IVM
are more reliable, when compared to the probabilistic information, derived from
an SVM's output. In addition, the proposed self-training strategy can increase
the classification accuracy. Overall, the IVM and the its incremental version
is worthwhile for the classification of hyperspectral data.

to be a promising mass proxy with low intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\ln L|M}$ of
only $\sim 10-20$ per cent for all relations. At fixed overdensity radius, the
intercept increases with wavelength, consistent with an old stellar population.
The scatter and slope are consistent across all wavelengths, suggesting that
cluster colour is not a function of mass. Comparing colour with indicators of
the level of disturbance in the cluster, we find a narrower variety in the
cluster colours of 'disturbed' clusters than of 'undisturbed' clusters. This
trend is more pronounced with indicators sensitive to the initial stages of a
cluster merger, e.g. the Dressler Schectman statistic. We interpret this as
possible evidence that the total cluster star formation rate is 'standardised'
in mergers, perhaps through a process such as a system-wide shock in the
intracluster medium.

power element in a finite field by applying certain bounds on incomplete
character sums.
  Precisely, let $h=\lfloor q^{\delta}\rfloor>1$ and $d\mid q^h-1$. Let $r$ be
a prime divisor of $q-1$ such that the largest prime power part of $q-1$ has
the form $r^s$. Then there is a constant $0<\epsilon<1$ such that for a ratio
at least $ {q^{-\epsilon h}}$ of $\alpha\in \mathbb{F}_{q^{h}}
\backslash\mathbb{F}_{q}$, the set $S=\{ \alpha-x^t, x\in\mathbb{F}_{q}\}$ of
cardinality $1+\frac {q-1} {M(h)}$ contains a non-d-th power in
$\mathbb{F}_{q^{\lfloor q^\delta\rfloor}}$, where $t$ is the largest power of
$r$ such that $t<\sqrt{q}/h$ and $M(h)$ is defined as $$M(h)=\max_{r \mid
(q-1)} r^{\min\{v_r(q-1), \lfloor\log_r{q}/2-\log_r h\rfloor\}}.$$ Here $r$
runs thourgh prime divisors and $v_r(x)$ is the $r$-adic oder of $x$. For odd
$q$, the choice of $\delta=\frac 12-d, d=o(1)>0$ shows that there exists an
explicit subset of cardinality $q^{1-d}=O(\log^{2+\epsilon'}(q^h))$ containing
a non-quadratic element in the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^h}$. On the other hand, the
choice of $h=2$ shows that for any odd prime power $q$, there is an explicit
subset of cardinality $1+\frac {q-1}{M(2)}$ containing a non-quadratic element
in $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. This improves a $q-1$ construction by Coulter and Kosick
\cite{CK} since $\lfloor \log_2{(q-1)}\rfloor\leq M(2) < \sqrt{q}$.
  In addition, we obtain a similar construction for small sets containing a
primitive element. The construction works well provided $\phi(q^h-1)$ is very
small, where $\phi$ is the Euler's totient function.

computational challenges of this model are in two folds. On one hand, the

convex and strongly convex objectives. For general convex objectives, the
uniformly average iterates generated by \textsf{SPDPEG} converge in expectation

functions --- that is, functions $f:2^E\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that
$f(\emptyset)=1$, where $E$ is a finite set. Binary functions have previously
been shown to admit families of transforms that generalise duality, including a
trinity transform, and families of associated minor operations that generalise
deletion and contraction, with both these families parameterised by the complex
numbers. Binary function representations exist for graphs (via the indicator
functions of their cutset spaces) and indeed arbitrary matroids (as shown by
the author previously). In this paper, we characterise degenerate elements ---
analogues of loops and coloops --- in binary functions, with respect to any
pair of minor operations from our complex-parameterised family. We then apply
this to study the relationship between binary functions and Tutte's alternating
dimaps, which also support a trinity transform and three associated minor
operations. It is shown that only the simplest alternating dimaps have binary
representations of the form we consider, which seems to be the most direct type
of representation. The question of whether there exist other, more
sophisticated types of binary function representations for alternating dimaps
is left open.

theory generalized to non-equilibrium situations. Here we examine the validity
of such an approach within the attractive Hubbard model for which the dynamics
of pairing and charge-density wave orders is computed using the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock approximation (TDHF). Our calculations reveal that the
`linear-response assumption' is justified for small to moderate non-equilibrium
situations (i.e., pump pulses) when the symmetry of the pump-induced state
differs from that of the external field. This is the case, when we consider the
pairing response in a charge-ordered state or the charge-order response in a
superconducting state. The situation is very different when the non-equilibrium
state and the external probe field have the same symmetry. In this case, we
observe significant changes of the response in magnitude but also due to mode
coupling when moving away from an equilibrium state, indicating the failure of
the linear-response assumption.
