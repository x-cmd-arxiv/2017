voice quality of speech as experienced by human beings. The predictions of
those objective measures should come as close as possible to subjective quality
scores as obtained in subjective listening tests. Wavenet is a deep neural
network originally developed as a deep generative model of raw audio
wave-forms. Wavenet architecture is based on dilated causal convolutions, which
exhibit very large receptive fields. In this short paper we suggest using the
Wavenet architecture, in particular its large receptive filed in order to learn
PESQ algorithm. By doing so we can use it as a differentiable loss function for
speech enhancement.

non-contact force on a remote object. By suitably designing the wave field,
remote tweezers are produced that stably levitate particles in the air without
any mechanical contact forces. Recent works have revealed that holographic
traps can levitate particles even with a single-sided wave source. However, the
levitatable objects in the previous studies were limited to particles smaller
than the wavelength, or flat parts placed near a rigid wall. Here, we achieve a
stable levitation of a macroscopic rigid body by a holographic design of
acoustic field without any dynamic control. The levitator models the acoustic
radiation force and torque applied to a rigid body by discretising the body's
surface, as well as the acoustic wave sources, and optimizes the acoustic field
on the body surface to achieve the Lyapunov stability so that the field can
properly respond to the fluctuation of the body position and rotation. In an
experiment, a 40 kHz (8.5 mm wavelength) ultrasonic phased array levitated a
polystyrene sphere and a regular octahedron with a size of ~50 mm located 200
mm away from acoustic elements in the air. This method not only expands the
variety of levitatable objects but also contributes to microscopic contexts,
such as in-vivo micromachines, since shorter-wavelength ultrasound than the
size of target objects can be used to achieve higher controllability and
stability.

aspects of structural stability of 3D Filippov systems. We introduce a notion
of semi-local structural stability which detects when a piecewise smooth vector
field is robust around the whole switching manifold and we give a complete
characterization of such systems. In particular, we present some methods in the
qualitative theory of piecewise smooth vector fields, emphasizing a geometrical
analysis of the foliations generated by their orbits. Such approach displays
surprisingly a rich dynamical behaviour that has been studied in details in
this work.
  It is worth to say that this subject has not been treated recently from a
non-local point of view, and we hope that the approach adopted in this work
contributes to the understanding of the structural stability for
piecewise-smooth vector fields in its most global sense.

Evidence is presented that the correct inflected form of an expanded
abbreviation can in many cases be deduced solely from the morphosyntactic tags
of the context. The prediction model is a deep bidirectional LSTM network with
tag embedding. The training and evaluation data are gathered by finding the
words which could have been abbreviated and using their corresponding
morphosyntactic tags as the labels, while the tags of the context words are
used as the input features for classification. The network is trained on over
10 million words from the Polish Sejm Corpus and achieves 74.2% prediction
accuracy on a smaller, but more general National Corpus of Polish. The analysis
of errors suggests that performance in this task may improve if some prior
knowledge about the abbreviated word is incorporated into the model.

experimental investigations. This paper aims at a systematic study in the
following aspects of Floquet systems: (i) A systematic formulation of
topological invariants of Floquet systems based on the cooperation of topology
and symmetries. Topological invariants are constructed for the ten symmetry
classes in all spatial dimensions, for both homogeneous Floquet systems
(Floquet topological insulators and superconductors) and Floquet topological
defects. Meanwhile, useful representative Dirac Hamiltonians for all the
symmetry classes are obtained and studied. (ii) A general theory of Floquet
topological defects, based on the proposed topological invariants. (iii) Models
and proposals of Floquet topological defects in low dimensions. Among other
defect modes, we investigate Floquet Majorana zero modes and Majorana Pi modes
in vortices of topologically trivial superconductors under a periodic drive. In
addition, we clarified several notable issues about Floquet topological
invariants. Among other issues, we prove the equivalence between the
effective-Hamiltonian-based band topological invariants and the
frequency-domain band topological invariants.

States providing excellent opportunities for diagnostics of the Sun's corona.
The Sun's coronal structure is notoriously difficult to observe except during
solar eclipses; thus theoretical models must be relied upon for inferring the
underlying magnetic structure of the Sun's outer atmosphere. These models are
necessary for understanding the role of magnetic fields in the heating of the
corona to a million degrees and generation of severe space weather. Here we
present a methodology for predicting the structure of the coronal field based
on long-term surface flux transport simulations whose output is utilized to
extrapolate the coronal magnetic field structures. This prescription was
applied to the 21 August 2017 solar eclipse. Post-eclipse analysis shows good
agreement between model simulated and observed coronal structures and their
locations on the limb. We demonstrate that slow changes in the Sun's surface
magnetic field distribution driven by long-term flux emergence and evolution
govern large-scale coronal structures with a (plausibly cycle-phase dependent)
dynamical memory timescale on the order of few solar rotations -- opening up
the possibility of large-scale, global corona predictions at least a month in
advance.

  Vocabulary Language Models","Accepted for publication at INTERSPEECH'17",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training large vocabulary Neural Network Language Models (NNLMs) is a
difficult task due to the explicit requirement of the output layer
normalization, which typically involves the evaluation of the full softmax
function over the complete vocabulary. This paper proposes a Batch Noise
Contrastive Estimation (B-NCE) approach to alleviate this problem. This is
achieved by reducing the vocabulary, at each time step, to the target words in
the batch and then replacing the softmax by the noise contrastive estimation
approach, where these words play the role of targets and noise samples at the
same time. In doing so, the proposed approach can be fully formulated and
implemented using optimal dense matrix operations. Applying B-NCE to train
different NNLMs on the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) and the One
Billion Word Benchmark (OBWB) shows a significant reduction of the training
time with no noticeable degradation of the models performance. This paper also
presents a new baseline comparative study of different standard NNLMs on the
large OBWB on a single Titan-X GPU.

method for modeling evolving clusters in large scale social media data. With
the RCRP, one can allow both the number of clusters and the cluster parameters

been limited due to the non-conjugacy between the cluster evolutionary priors
and the Multinomial likelihood. This non-conjugacy makes inference di cult and
restricts the scalability of models which use the RCRP, leading to the RCRP
being applied only in simple problems, such as those that can be approximated
by a single Gaussian emission. In this paper, we provide a novel solution for
the non-conjugacy issues for the RCRP and an example of how to leverage our
solution for one speci c problem - the social event discovery problem. By
utilizing Sequential Monte Carlo methods in inference, our approach can be
massively paralleled and is highly scalable, to the extent it can work on tens

problem, Lidov (1962) and, independently, Kozai (1962) discovered coupled
oscillations of eccentricity and inclination (the KL-cycles). Their classical
studies were based on an integrable model of the secular evolution, obtained by
double averaging of the disturbing function approximated with its first
non-trivial term. This was the quadrupole term in the series expansion with
respect to the ratio of the semimajor axis of the disturbed body to that of the
disturbing body. If the next (octupole) term is kept in the expression for the
disturbing function, long-term modulation of the KL-cycles can established
(Ford et al., 2000, Naoz et al., 2011, Katz et al., 2011). Specifically, flips
between the prograde and retrograde orbits become possible. Since such flips
are observed only when the perturber has a non-zero eccentricity, the term
""Eccentric Kozai-Lidov Effect"" (or EKL-effect) was proposed by Lithwick and
Naoz (2011) to specify such behaviour. We demonstrate that the EKL-effect can
be interpreted as a resonance phenomenon. To this end, we write down the
equations of motion in terms of ""action-angle"" variables emerging in the
integrable Kozai-Lidov model. It turns out that for some initial values the
resonance is degenerate and the usual ""pendulum"" approximation is insufficient
to describe the evolution of the resonance phase. Analysis of the related
bifurcations allows us to estimate the typical time between the successive
flips for different parts of the phase space.

theory is formulated within the $\varphi^4$ lattice model in a $d$-dimensional
block geometry with periodic boundary conditions. We derive the finite-size
scaling functions $F^{\text ex}$ and $X$ of the excess free energy density and
of the thermodynamic Casimir force, respectively, for $1\leq n \leq \infty$,
$2<d<4$. Applications are given for $ L_\parallel^{d-1} \times L$ slab
geometries with a finite aspect ratio $\rho=L/L_\parallel$ as well as for the
film limit $\rho \to 0$ at fixed $L$. For $n=1$ and $\rho=0$ the
low-temperature limits of $F^{\text ex}$ and $X$ vanish whereas they are finite
for $n\geq 2$ and $\rho = 0$ due to the effect of the Goldstone modes. For
$n=1$ and $\rho>0$ we find a finite low-temperature limit of $F^{\text ex}$
which deviates from that of the the Ising model. We attribute this deviation to
the nonuniversal difference between the $\varphi^4$ model with continuous
variables $\varphi$ and the Ising model with discrete spin variables $s=\pm1$.
For $n\geq 2$ and $\rho>0$, a logarithmic divergence of $F^{\text ex}$ in the
low-temperature limit is predicted, in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo
(MC) data for the $d=3$ $XY$ model. For $2\leq n \leq \infty$ and $0\leq
\rho<\rho_0=0.8567$ the Goldstone modes generate a negative (attractive)
low-temperature Casimir force that vanishes for $\rho = \rho_0$ and becomes
positive (repulsive) for $\rho > \rho_0$. Our predictions are compared with MC
data for Ising, $XY$, and Heisenberg models in slab geometries with
$0.01\leq\rho\leq1$. Good overall agreement is found.

renewables, purposeful manipulation of meter readings, and the need for
wide-area situational awareness, call for fast, accurate, and robust power
system state estimation. The least-absolute-value (LAV) estimator is known for
its robustness relative to the weighted least-squares (WLS) one. However, due
to nonconvexity and nonsmoothness, existing LAV solvers based on linear
programming are typically slow, hence inadequate for real-time system
monitoring. This paper develops two novel algorithms for efficient LAV
estimation, which draw from recent advances in composite optimization. The
first is a deterministic linear proximal scheme that handles a sequence of
convex quadratic problems, each efficiently solvable either via off-the-shelf
algorithms or through the alternating direction method of multipliers.
Leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to power networks, the second
scheme is stochastic, and updates only \emph{a few} entries of the complex
voltage state vector per iteration. In particular, when voltage magnitude and
(re)active power flow measurements are used only, this number reduces to one or
two, \emph{regardless of} the number of buses in the network. This
computational complexity evidently scales well to large-size power systems.
Furthermore, by carefully \emph{mini-batching} the voltage and power flow
measurements, accelerated implementation of the stochastic iterations becomes
possible. The developed algorithms are numerically evaluated using a variety of
benchmark power networks. Simulated tests corroborate that improved robustness
can be attained at comparable or markedly reduced computation times for medium-
or large-size networks relative to the ""workhorse"" WLS-based Gauss-Newton
iterations.

predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions
(RACs) that encode relationships between the heuristic atomic properties (e.g.,
size, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the
starting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs
to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set,
we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other
presently-available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean
unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as
low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs
on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15-20x
higher errors from feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural
information. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate
filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random
forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4-5x
smaller than RAC-155 produce sub- to 1-kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good
transferability to metal-ligand bond length prediction (0.004-5 {\AA} MUE) and
redox potential on a smaller data set (0.2-0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature

from short-term measurements (e.g., up to a few hours). The model is trained
and tested with data collected from people exposed to two types of cognitive
tasks (Stroop Colour Word Test, Mental Computation test) with sessions of

quantum correlations are characterized by means of measurement induced
disturbance (MID) with simultaneous quadrature measurements. In a scenario
where homodyne conditional measurements are available we show that the MID
provides an easy way to select optimal phases to obtain information of the
maximal correlations in the channels. The quantum correlations of these
entangled states with channel losses are quantitatively characterized with the
quantum discord (QD) with a displaced qubit projector. We observe that as
scattering increases, QD decreases monotonically. At the same time for the
state $|\psi\rangle_{\text{dp}}$, QD is more resistant to high phase
fluctuations when the average photon number $n_0$ is bigger than zero, but if
phase fluctuations are low, QD is more resistant if $n_0=0$. For the dp model
with scattering, we obtain an analytical expression of the QD as a function of
the observable quadrature variance in a local sub-system. This relation allows
us to have a way to obtain the degree of QD in the channel by just measuring a
local property observable such as the quadrature variance. For the other model

important result that allows to identify quantum processing capabilities in

Tunability of the wavelengths is achieved by altering the grating depth of the

intensity $f$ goes forward and backward, a main characteristic of a first-order
phase transition, in contrast to a second-order phase transition in the

master equation, we reduce the problem to finding the zero-energy trajectories

exponentially on the associated action and the number of particles $N$. Within
the hysteresis region, we find that the actions along the optimal forward
switching path from ordered phase (OP) to disordered phase (DP) and its
backward path, show distinct variation trends with $f$, and intersect at
$f=f_c$ that determines the coexisting line of OP and DP. This results in a
nonmonotonic dependence of the mean switching time between two symmetric OPs on

investigate the bipartite entanglement properties in AJL's algorithm for

control qubit. Furthermore, we use the Peres entanglement criterion to study
the entanglement features of the state before measurements present in the
re-described algorithm for all bipartitions. We show that the state is a
product state relative to the bipartition between the first work qubit and the
others. And it has no entanglement between the control qubit and work ones. We
also prove a sufficient and necessary condition for its entanglement between
the second (third) work qubit and the others. Moreover, we discuss the relation
between its bipartite entanglement and elementary crossings in the three-strand
braid group. We find that braids whose trace closures are topologically
identical may have different entanglement properties in AJL's algorithm.

numerical methods to solve linear systems, particularly in a parallel

theory assume a symmetric positive definite operator. This paper presents a new
variation on classical AMG for nonsymmetric matrices (denoted lAIR), based on a
local approximation to the ideal restriction operator, coupled with
F-relaxation. A new block decomposition of the AMG error-propagation operator
is used for a spectral analysis of convergence, and the efficacy of the
algorithm is demonstrated on systems arising from the discrete form of the
advection-diffusion-reaction equation. lAIR is shown to be a robust solver for
various discretizations of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation, including
time-dependent and steady-state, from purely advective to purely diffusive.
Convergence is robust for discretizations on unstructured meshes and using
higher-order finite elements, and is particularly effective on upwind
discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. Although the implementation used here
is not parallel, each part of the algorithm is highly parallelizable, avoiding
common multigrid adjustments for strong advection such as line-relaxation and
K- or W-cycles that can be effective in serial, but suffer from high
communication costs in parallel, limiting their scalability.

continuum light in data from the Kepler mission. The Kepler star in question,
KIC 3542116, is of spectral type F2V and is quite bright at K_p = 10. The
transits have a distinct asymmetric shape with a steeper ingress and slower
egress that can be ascribed to objects with a trailing dust tail passing over
the stellar disk. There are three deeper transits with depths of ~0.1% that
last for about a day, and three that are several times more shallow and of
shorter duration. The transits were found via an exhaustive visual search of
the entire Kepler photometric data set, which we describe in some detail. We
review the methods we use to validate the Kepler data showing the comet
transits, and rule out instrumental artefacts as sources of the signals. We fit
the transits with a simple dust-tail model, and find that a transverse comet
speed of ~35-50 km/s and a minimum amount of dust present in the tail of ~10^16
g are required to explain the larger transits. For a dust replenishment time of
~10 days, and a comet lifetime of only ~300 days, this implies a total cometary
mass of > 3 x 10^17 g, or about the mass of Halley's comet. We also discuss the
number of comets and orbital geometry that would be necessary to explain the
six transits detected over the four years of Kepler prime-field observations.

can be expressed as an analytic index dim(ker(D)) -dim(ker(D^*)) of a
differential complex D:E -> F. In the discrete, a complex D can be called
elliptic if a McKean-Singer spectral symmetry applies as this implies
str(exp(-t D^2)) is t-independent. In that case, the analytic index of D is the
sum of (-1)^k b_k(D), where b_k(D) is the k'th Betti number, which by Hodge is
the nullity of the (k+1)'th block of the Hodge operator L=D^2. It can also be
written as a topological index summing K(v) over the set of zero-dimensional
simplices in G and where K is an Euler type curvature defined by G and D. This
can be interpreted as a Atiyah-Singer type correspondence between analytic and
topological index. Examples are the de Rham differential complex for the Euler
characteristic X(G) or the connection differential complex for Wu
characteristic w_k(G). Given an endomorphism T of an elliptic complex, the
Lefschetz number X(T,G,D) is defined as the super trace of T acting on
cohomology defined by E. It is equal to the sum i(v) over V which are contained
in fixed simplices of T, and i is a Brouwer type index. This Atiyah-Bott result
generalizes the Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem for an endomorphism of
the simplicial complex G. In both the static and dynamic setting, the proof is
done by heat deforming the Koopman operator U(T) to get the cohomological
picture str(exp(-t D^2) U(T)) in the limit t to infinity and then use Hodge,
and then by applying a discrete gradient flow to the simplex data defining the
valuation to push str(U(T)) to V, getting curvature K(v) or the Brouwer type
index i(v).

of symmetric functions. Using this, we reduce to a finite dimensional-problem,
which we solve. For the second step we introduce a finite-dimensional analogue
of the affine Grassmannians of $SL_n$, which we conjecture to be precisely the
reduced subscheme of a finite-dimensional Grassmannian consisting of subspaces
invariant under a nilpotent operator.

ultrahigh-dimensional linear models. Correlation-based variable screening, in
which one leverages marginal correlations for removal of irrelevant variables
from the model prior to statistical inference, can be used to overcome this
challenge. Prior works on correlation-based variable screening either impose
statistical priors on the linear model or assume specific post-screening
inference methods. This paper first extends the analysis of correlation-based
variable screening to arbitrary linear models and post-screening inference
techniques. In particular, (i) it shows that a condition---termed the screening
condition---is sufficient for successful correlation-based screening of linear
models, and (ii) it provides insights into the dependence of marginal
correlation-based screening on different problem parameters. Numerical
experiments confirm that these insights are not mere artifacts of analysis;
rather, they are reflective of the challenges associated with marginal
correlation-based variable screening. Second, the paper explicitly derives the
screening condition for arbitrary (random or deterministic) linear models and,
in the process, it establishes that---under appropriate conditions---it is
possible to reduce the dimension of an ultrahigh-dimensional, arbitrary linear
model to almost the sample size even when the number of active variables scales
almost linearly with the sample size. Third, it specializes the screening
condition to sub-Gaussian linear models and contrasts the final results to
those existing in the literature. This specialization formally validates the
claim that the main result of this paper generalizes existing ones on
correlation-based screening.

sliding-window decoding algorithm, in which only binary and/or erasure messages
are processed and exchanged between processing units. The error floor can be
predicted by a genie-aided lower bound, while the waterfall performance can be
analyzed by the density evolution method. To evaluate the error floor of the
constructed BMST-BCH codes at a very low bit error rate (BER) region, we
propose a fast simulation approach. Numerical results show that, at a target
BER of $10^{-15}$, the hard-decision decoding of the BMST-BCH codes with
overhead $25\%$ can achieve a net coding gain (NCG) of $10.55$ dB. Furthermore,
the soft-decision decoding can yield an NCG of $10.74$ dB. The construction of
BMST-BCH codes is flexible to trade off latency against performance at all
overheads of interest and may find applications in optical transport networks
as an attractive~candidate.

to new subtle effects that could hitherto be ignored: the PSF of a galaxy is no
longer uniquely defined and spatial variations in the colours of galaxies
result in biases in the inferred lensing signal. Taking Euclid as a reference,
we show that this colourgradient bias (CG bias) can be quantified with high
accuracy using available multi-colour Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In
particular we study how noise in the HST observations might impact such
measurements and find this to be negligible. We determine the CG bias using HST
observations in the F606W and F814W filters and observe a correlation with the
colour, in line with expectations, whereas the dependence with redshift is
weak. The biases for individual galaxies are generally well below 1%, which may
be reduced further using morphological information from the Euclid data. Our
results demonstrate that CG bias should not be ignored, but it is possible to
determine its amplitude with sufficient precision, so that it will not
significantly bias the weak lensing measurements using Euclid data.

high-purity germanium detectors operating in the Boulby Underground Laboratory,
located 1.1 km underground in the north-east of England, UK. BUGS utilises
three types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput
radioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search
experiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to
low-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode
Germanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of
small samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast
screening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to
characterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample
geometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing
effects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific
activities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which
have uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser
materials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases, sensitivity is
demonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228
Ra, 0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90%
confidence level. These meet the requirements of most screening campaigns
presently under way for rare-event search experiments, such as the LUX-ZEPLIN
(LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector
to probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the
presence of radioisotopes associated with neutron production; this is of
particular relevance in experiments sensitive to nuclear recoils.

$\lambda > \lambda_c$, and a $J=2$ impurity for $\lambda < -\lambda_c$. They
all correspond to a Fermi liquid but with very different quasiparticle phase
shifts and different physical properties. The crossover between these regimes
is controlled by an emergent scale, the orbital Kondo temperature, $\lambda_c

implies that oxides with strong electronic correlations are more prone to the
effects of the spin-orbit coupling.

virtual explosion world-wide. It is all based on the observation that
fundamental quantum phenomena on the individual particle or system-level lead
to completely novel ways of encoding, processing and transmitting information.
Quantum mechanics, a child of the first third of the 20th century, has found
numerous realizations and technical applications, much more than was thought at
the beginning. Decades later, it became possible to do experiments with
individual quantum particles and quantum systems. This was due to technological
progress, and for light in particular, the development of the laser. Hitherto,
nearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields have been
performed with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems. We suggest that
this limitation is again mainly a technological one, because it is very
difficult to create, manipulate and measure more complex quantum systems. Here,
we provide a specific overview of some recent developments with
higher-dimensional quantum systems. We mainly focus on Orbital Angular Momentum
(OAM) states of photons and possible applications in quantum information
protocols. Such states form discrete higher-dimensional quantum systems, also
called qudits. Specifically, we will first address the question what kind of
new fundamental properties exist and the quantum information applications which
are opened up by such novel systems. Then we give an overview of recent
developments in the field by discussing several notable experiments over the
past 2-3 years. Finally, we conclude with several important open questions
which will be interesting for investigations in the future.

demonstrate that the frequency of a single photon can be converted

optomechanical interactions with two nondegenerate mechanical modes. Based on
such nonreciprocity, two different single-photon circulators are proposed in
the T-shaped waveguides consisting of three semi-infinite CRWs, which are
coupled in pairwise by optomechanical interactions. One circulator is proposed
by using two nondegenerate mechanical modes and the other one is proposed by
using three nondegenerate mechanical modes. Nonreciprocal single-photon
frequency conversion is induced by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, and the
optimal conditions for nonreciprocal frequency conversion are obtained. These
proposals can be used to realize nonreciprocal frequency conversion of single
photons in any two distinctive waveguides with different frequencies and they
can allow for dynamic control of the direction of frequency conversion by
tuning the phases of external driving lasers, which may have versatile
applications in hybrid quantum networks.

this film, allowing for flexibility of design based on an appropriate

mesh-refinement code {\sc FLASH}, which can be used to calculate the gas
self-gravity, and also the angle-averaged local optical depth, for treating
ambient diffuse radiation. The algorithm communicates to the different
processors only those parts of the tree that are needed to perform the tree
walk locally. The advantage of this approach is a relatively low memory
requirement, important in particular for the optical depth calculation, which
needs to process information from many different directions. This feature also
enables a general tree-based radiation transport algorithm that will be
described in a subsequent paper, and delivers excellent scaling up to at least
1500 cores. Boundary conditions for gravity can be either isolated or periodic,
and they can be specified in each direction independently, using a newly
developed generalisation of the Ewald method. The gravity calculation can be
accelerated with the {\em adaptive block update} technique by partially
re-using the solution from the previous time-step. Comparison with the {\sc
Flash} internal multi-grid gravity solver shows that tree based methods provide
a competitive alternative, particularly for problems with isolated or mixed
boundary conditions. We evaluate several multipole acceptance criteria (MACs)
and identify a relatively simple APE MAC which provides high accuracy at low
computational cost. The optical depth estimates are found to agree very well
with those of the {\sc RADMC-3D} radiation transport code, with the tree solver
being much faster. Our algorithm is available in the standard release of the
{\sc FLASH} code in version 4.0 and later.

membership inference attacks on aggregate location time-series. We introduce a
game-based definition of the adversarial task, and cast it as a classification

target user is part of the aggregates.
  We empirically evaluate the power of these attacks on both raw and
differentially private aggregates using two mobility datasets. We find that
membership inference is a serious privacy threat, and show how its
effectiveness depends on the adversary's prior knowledge, the characteristics
of the underlying location data, as well as the number of users and the
timeframe on which aggregation is performed. Although differentially private
mechanisms can indeed reduce the extent of the attacks, they also yield a
significant loss in utility. Moreover, a strategic adversary mimicking the
behavior of the defense mechanism can greatly limit the protection they
provide. Overall, our work presents a novel methodology geared to evaluate
membership inference on aggregate location data in real-world settings and can
be used by providers to assess the quality of privacy protection before data

astrophysics, driving angular momentum transport and mass accretion in a wide
variety of cosmic objects. Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental
efforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which
sets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,
especially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers
typical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of
planets and liquid metals in laboratory. Using direct numerical simulations, in
this paper we investigate the nonlinear development and saturation properties
of the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) -- a relative of the
standard MRI -- in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow at very low magnetic
Prandtl number (correspondingly at low magnetic Reynolds number) relevant to
liquid metals. For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is
kept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser
number, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special
role in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the
nonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly
nonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,
to strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal
and axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they
differ qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases
nearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in
nature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases
moderately with the Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller
than that of the axisymmetric ones.

theory and practice use reduction rules to obtain a much smaller problem
instance called a kernel. The kernel can then be solved quickly using exact or
heuristic algorithms---or by repeatedly kernelizing recursively in the
branch-and-reduce paradigm. It is of critical importance for these algorithms
that kernelization is fast and returns a small kernel. Current algorithms are
either slow but produce a small kernel, or fast and give a large kernel. We
attempt to accomplish both of these goals simultaneously, by giving an
efficient parallel kernelization algorithm based on graph partitioning and
parallel bipartite maximum matching. We combine our parallelization techniques
with two techniques to accelerate kernelization further: dependency checking
that prunes reductions that cannot be applied, and reduction tracking that
allows us to stop kernelization when reductions become less fruitful. Our
algorithm produces kernels that are orders of magnitude smaller than the
fastest kernelization methods, while having a similar execution time.
Furthermore, our algorithm is able to compute kernels with size comparable to
the smallest known kernels, but up to two orders of magnitude faster than
previously possible. Finally, we show that our kernelization algorithm can be
used to accelerate existing state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms, allowing us
to find larger independent sets faster on large real-world networks and

system that relates neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal is
unknown.
  New Method: We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the
following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying
hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a
Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the
predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI)
system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD response, rather
than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This
allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a
flexible way, and simultaneously gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the
GP.
  Results: Results on simulated data show that the proposed model is able to
discriminate between active and non-active voxels also when the GP prior
deviates from the true hemodynamics. Our model finds time varying dynamics when
applied to real fMRI data.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The proposed model is better at detecting
activity in simulated data than standard models, without inflating the false
positive rate. When applied to real fMRI data, our GP model in several cases
finds brain activity where previously proposed LTI models does not.
  Conclusions: We have proposed a new non-linear model for the hemodynamics in
task fMRI, that is able to detect active voxels, and gives the opportunity to
ask new kinds of questions related to hemodynamics.

in $\gamma$-ray the source exhibited spectral variability characterized by the

has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern

signals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their
ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We
suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field
imaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV
magnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical
analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural
magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an

technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal
reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.
Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single

for detecting small quality changes in univariate and multivariate processes.
Many papers on economic design of these control charts use the formula proposed
by Lorenzen and Vance (1986) [Lorenzen, T. J., & Vance, L. C. (1986). The
economic design of control charts: A unified approach. Technometrics, 28(1),
3-10, DOI: 10.2307/1269598]. This paper shows that this formula is not correct
for memory-type control charts and its values can significantly deviate from
the original values even if the ARL values used in this formula are accurately
computed. Consequently, the use of this formula can result in charts that are
not economically optimal. The formula is corrected for memory-type control
charts, but unfortunately the modified formula is not a helpful tool from a
computational perspective. We show that simulation-based optimization is a
possible alternative method.

derived using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) and the cluster variational

equation, where the maximum masses over $2M_\odot$ are obtained on the basis of
the terrestrial data. Neutron-star radii $R$ at a typical mass $1.5M_\odot$ are
predicted to be $12.3\!\sim\!13.0$ km. The uncertainty of calculated radii is
mainly from the ratio of 3- and 4-pomeron coupling constants, which cannot be
fixed by any terrestrial experiment. Though values of $R(1.5M_\odot)$ are not
influenced by hyperon-mixing effects, finely-observed values for them indicate
degrees of EoS softening by hyperon mixing in the region of
$M\!\sim\!2M_\odot$. If $R(1.5M_\odot)$ is less than about 12.4 km, the
softening of EoS by hyperon mixing has to be weak. Useful information can be
expected by the space mission NICER offering precise measurements for
neutron-star radii within $\pm 5\%$.

useful service for deriving the internal structure of giant planets in the
Solar system. In this paper, I apply both the ToF and the CMS method to compare
results for polytropic Jupiter and for the physical equation of state
H/He-REOS.3 based models. An accuracy in the computed values of J2 and J4 of
0.1% is found to be sufficient in order to obtain the core mass safely within
0.5 Mearth numerical accuracy and the atmospheric metallicity within about
0.0004. ToF to 4th order provides that accuracy, while ToF to 3rd order does
not for J4. Furthermore, I find that the assumption of rigid rotation yields J6
and J8 values in agreement with the current Juno estimates, and that higher
order terms (J10 to J18) deviate by about 10% from predictions by polytropic

quality, polymer flexibility, and cosolute-network interactions. In particular,
we find a novel `cosolute-induced' collapsed state, where strongly attractive
cosolutes bridge network monomers albeit the latter interact mutually
repulsive. Finally, the cosolutes' global partitioning `landscape', computed as
a function of solvent quality and cosolute-network interactions, exhibits very
different topologies depending on polymer flexibility. The simulation results

virial radius using a large sample of halos drawn from Illustris, along with a
set of zoom simulations (MUGS). Using these, we make a systematic exploration
of the shape profile beyond R$_{vir}$. In the mean sphericity profile of
Illustris halos we identify a dip close to the virial radius, which is robust
across a broad range of masses and infall rates. The inner edge of this feature
may be related to the virial radius and the outer edge with the splashback
radius. Due to the high halo-to-halo variation this result is visible only on
average. However, in four individual halos in the MUGS sample, a decrease in
the sphericity and a subsequent recovery is evident close to the splashback
radius. We find that this feature persists for several Gyr, growing with the
halo. This feature appears at the interface between the spherical halo density
distribution and the filamentary structure in the environment. The shape
feature is strongest when there is a high rate of infall, implying that the
effect is due to the mixing of accreting and virializing material. The
filamentary velocity field becomes rapidly mixed in the halo region inside the
virial radius, with the area between this and the splashback radius serving as
the transition region. We also identify a long-lasting and smoothly evolving
splashback region in the radial density gradient in many of the MUGS halos.

field, in the sense that it extremizes the total kinetic energy in the domain
under free variations of the velocity field, constrained only by tangential
velocity and vorticity boundary conditions and conservation of total fluid
helicity and entropy. This is analogous to Woltjer-Taylor relaxation of plasma
magnetic field to a stationary state. However, unlike the magnetic field case,
attempting to derive slow, quasi-relaxed dynamics from Hamilton's action
principle, with constant total fluid helicity as a constraint, fails to agree,
in the static limit, with the nonlinear Beltrami solution of the Euler
equations. Nevertheless, an action principle that gives a quasi-relaxed

proportional to the local temperature gradient. The same is expected to hold
for the macroscopic drift behavior of a diffusive cluster or molecule
physisorbed on a solid surface. The question we explore here is whether that is
still valid on a 2D membrane such as graphene at short sheet length. By means
of a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics study of a test system -- a gold
nanocluster adsorbed on free-standing graphene clamped between two temperatures
$\Delta T$ apart -- we find a phoretic force which for submicron sheet lengths
is parallel to, but basically independent of, the local gradient magnitude.
This identifies a thermophoretic regime that is ballistic rather than
diffusive, persisting up to and beyond a hundred nanometer sheet length.
Analysis shows that the phoretic force is due to the flexural phonons, whose
flow is known to be ballistic and distance-independent up to relatively long
mean-free paths. Yet, ordinary harmonic phonons should only carry crystal
momentum and, while impinging on the cluster, should not be able to impress
real momentum. We show that graphene, and other membrane-like monolayers,
support a specific anharmonic connection between the flexural corrugation and
longitudinal phonons whose fast escape leaves behind a 2D-projected mass
density increase endowing the flexural phonons, as they move with their group
velocity, with real momentum, part of which is transmitted to the adsorbate
through scattering. The resulting distance-independent ballistic thermophoretic
force is not unlikely to possess practical applications.

a subverted one which allows to leak private information while generating
output indistinguishable from the honest output. Bellare, Paterson, and Rogaway
provided at CRYPTO'14 a formal security model to capture this kind of attacks
and constructed practically implementable ASAs against a large class of
symmetric encryption schemes. At CCS'15, Ateniese, Magri, and Venturi extended
this model to allow the attackers to work in a fully-adaptive and continuous
fashion and proposed subversion attacks against digital signature schemes. Both
papers also showed the impossibility of ASAs in cases where the cryptographic
tools are deterministic. Also at CCS'15, Bellare, Jaeger, and Kane strengthened
the original model and proposed a universal ASA against sufficiently random
encryption schemes. In this paper we analyze ASAs from the perspective of
steganography - the well known concept of hiding the presence of secret
messages in legal communications. While a close connection between ASAs and
steganography is known, this lacks a rigorous treatment. We consider the common
computational model for secret-key steganography and prove that successful ASAs
correspond to secure stegosystems on certain channels and vice versa. This

most extreme radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) population, dominate the
census of the gamma-ray sky, and a significant correlation was found between
radio and gamma-ray emission in the 0.1-100 GeV energy range. However, the
possible connection between radio and very high energy (VHE, E>0.1 TeV)
emission still remains elusive, owing to the lack of a homogeneous coverage of
the VHE sky. The main goal of this work is to quantify and assess the
significance of a possible connection between the radio emission on parsec
scale measured by the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and GeV-TeV
gamma-ray emission in blazars, which is a central issue for understanding the
blazar physics and the emission processes. We investigate the radio VLBI and
high energy gamma-ray emission by using two large and unbiased AGN samples
extracted from the first and second Fermi-LAT catalogs of hard gamma-ray
sources detected above 10 GeV (1FHL) and 50 GeV (2FHL). For comparison, we
perform the same correlation analysis by using the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energy
flux provided by the third Fermi-LAT source catalog. We find that the
correlation strength and significance depend on the gamma-ray energy range with
a different behavior among the blazar sub-classes. Overall, the radio and
gamma-ray emission above 10 GeV turns out to be uncorrelated for the full
samples and for all of the blazar sub-classes with the exception of high
synchrotron peaked (HSP) objects, which show a strong and significant
correlation. On the contrary, when 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energies are
considered, a strong and significant correlation is found for the full blazar
sample as well as for all of the blazar sub-classes. We interpret and explain
this correlation behavior within the framework of the blazar spectral energy
distribution properties.

director fluctuations are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. The
constitutive relations for the hydrodynamic currents are derived using a
standard procedure based on non-negativity of the entropy production. The
continuity equations are then linearized and solved to calculate the

fluctuations are coupled to the director fluctuations, and are both
propagative. The propagative nature of the fluctuations suppress the
anticipated hydrodynamic long-time tails in the single-particle autocorrelation
functions. The fluctuations in the isotropic phase are however diffusive,
leading to $t^{-d/2}$ long-time tails in $d$ spatial dimensions. The Frank
elastic constant measured using the time-correlation functions are in good

  2019) lmcs:5656","10.23638/LMCS-15(3:8)2019",,"cs.FL cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let $b$ be an integer strictly greater than $1$. Each set of nonnegative
integers is represented in base $b$ by a language over $\{0, 1, \dots, b -
1\}$. The set is said to be $b$-recognisable if it is represented by a regular
language. It is known that ultimately periodic sets are $b$-recognisable, for
every base $b$, and Cobham's theorem implies the converse: no other set is
$b$-recognisable in every base $b$.
  We consider the following decision problem: let $S$ be a set of nonnegative
integers that is $b$-recognisable, given as a finite automaton over $\{0,1,
\dots, b - 1\}$, is $S$ periodic? Honkala showed in 1986 that this problem is
decidable. Later on, Leroux used in 2005 the convention to write number
representations with the least significant digit first (LSDF), and designed a
quadratic algorithm to solve a more general problem.
  We use here LSDF convention as well and give a structural description of the
minimal automata that accept periodic sets. Then, we show that it can be
verified in linear time if a minimal automaton meets this description. In
general, this yields a $O(b \log(n))$ procedure to decide whether an automaton
with $n$ states accepts an ultimately periodic set of nonnegative integers.

Agents
can either endorse or oppose a claim made in a piece of news, which itself may
be either true or false. Agents base their decision on a private signal and
their neighbors' past actions. Given these inputs, agents follow strategies
derived via multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and receive utility from
acting in accordance with the veracity of claims. Our framework yields
strategies with agent utility close to a theoretical, Bayes optimal benchmark,
while remaining flexible to model re-specification. Optimized strategies allow
agents to correctly identify most false claims, when all agents receive
unbiased private signals. However, an adversary's attempt to spread fake news
by targeting a subset of agents with a biased private signal can be successful.
Even more so when the adversary has information about agents' network position
or private signal. When agents are aware of the presence of an adversary they
re-optimize their strategies in the training stage and the adversary's attack
is less effective. Hence, exposing agents to the possibility of fake news can
be an effective way to curtail the spread of fake news in social networks. Our
results also highlight that information about the users' private beliefs and
their social network structure can be extremely valuable to adversaries and
should be well protected.

$D(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n})$ could not be welded isotopic to a classical link

investigate the performance of DMDs under conditions associated with space
deployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration
and mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD
under cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the
long-term reflectance of a bare device have also been investigated. The results
of the radiation testing demonstrate that DMDs in orbit would experience
negligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden, we predict
SEU rate of 5.6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock
testing was performed according to the NASA General Environmental Verification
Standard (GEVS), no mirrors failed in the devices tested. The results of low
temperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected by the thermal load and
operate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity of a
bare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient
conditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs
off state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000/:1 when illuminated
with an f/4 optical beam. Overall, DMDs are extremely robust and promise to
provide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in
space as remotely programmable slit masks for MOS design.

However, one problem with many studies is that they are small -restricted to a

with the OA citation advantage, the OA prevalence as well as the differences

accelerator. GRAPHR follows the principle of near-data processing and explores
the opportunity of performing massive parallel analog operations with low
hardware and energy cost. The analog computation is suit- able for graph
processing because: 1) The algorithms are iterative and could inherently
tolerate the imprecision; 2) Both probability calculation (e.g., PageRank and
Collaborative Filtering) and typical graph algorithms involving integers (e.g.,
BFS/SSSP) are resilient to errors. The key insight of GRAPHR is that if a
vertex program of a graph algorithm can be expressed in sparse matrix vector
multiplication (SpMV), it can be efficiently performed by ReRAM crossbar. We
show that this assumption is generally true for a large set of graph
algorithms. GRAPHR is a novel accelerator architecture consisting of two
components: memory ReRAM and graph engine (GE). The core graph computations are
performed in sparse matrix format in GEs (ReRAM crossbars). The
vector/matrix-based graph computation is not new, but ReRAM offers the unique
opportunity to realize the massive parallelism with unprecedented energy
efficiency and low hardware cost. With small subgraphs processed by GEs, the
gain of performing parallel operations overshadows the wastes due to sparsity.
The experiment results show that GRAPHR achieves a 16.01x (up to 132.67x)
speedup and a 33.82x energy saving on geometric mean compared to a CPU baseline
system. Com- pared to GPU, GRAPHR achieves 1.69x to 2.19x speedup and consumes
4.77x to 8.91x less energy. GRAPHR gains a speedup of 1.16x to 4.12x, and is
3.67x to 10.96x more energy efficiency compared to PIM-based architecture.

period that equals one optical cycle at operational wavelength. Using nominal
input delays of 600 to 900 fs and scanning the separation around each delay in
1 fs steps, we map the evolution of the material de-coherence and extract a
coherence time. Moreover we notice a unique phenomenon, which can not be
observed in single dot systems, that the temporal position of the output probe
pulse also oscillates with the same periodicity but with a quarter cycle delay
relative to the intensity variations. This delay is the time domain
manifestation of coupling between the real and imaginary parts of the complex

  without Lie transforms","33 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gyrokinetic theory is a basis for treating magnetised plasma dynamics slower
than particle gyrofrequencies where the scale of the background is larger than
relevant gyroradii. The energy of field perturbations can be comparable to the
thermal energy but smaller than the energy of the background magnetic field.
Properly applied, it is a low-frequency gauge transform rather than a treatment
of particle orbits, and more a representation in terms of gyrocenters rather
than particles than an approximation. By making all transformations and
approximations in the field/particle Lagrangian one preserves exact energetic
consistency so that time symmetry ensures energy conservation and spatial
axisymmetry ensures toroidal angular momentum conservation. This method draws
on earlier experience with drift kinetic models while showing the independence
of gyrokinetic representation from particularities of Lie transforms or
specific ordering limits, and that the essentials of low-frequency
magnetohydrodynamics, including the equilibrium, are recovered. It gives a
useful basis for total-f electromagnetic gyrokinetic computation. Various
versions of the representation based upon choice of parallel velocity space
coordinate are illustrated.

partial-duplex relaying mode encompasses half-duplex and full-duplex as
particular cases. By viewing the partial-duplex relay as a bandwidth-preserving
Linear Periodic Time-Varying system, an analysis of the spectral efficiency in
the presence of self-interference is developed. In contrast with previous
works, self-interference is regarded as a useful information-bearing component
rather than simply assimilated to noise. This approach reveals that previous
results regarding the impact of self-interference on (full-duplex) relay
performance are overly pessimistic. Based on a frequency-domain interpretation
of the effect of self-interference, a number of suboptimal decoding
architectures at the destination node are also discussed. It is found that the
partial-duplex relaying mode may provide an attractive tradeoff between
spectral efficiency and receiver complexity.

Within this model, a long GRB is produced by the core-collapse of a metal-poor,
rapidly rotating, massive star. The detection of some long GRBs in metal-rich
environments, and more fundamentally the three examples of long GRBs (GRB
060505, GRB 060614 and GRB 111005A) with no coincident SN detection down to
very deep limits is in strong contention with theoretical expectations. In this
paper we present MUSE observations of the host galaxy of GRB 111005A, which is
the most recent and compelling example yet of a SN-less, long GRB. At
z=0.01326, GRB 111005A is the third closest GRB ever detected, and second
closest long duration GRB, enabling the nearby environment to be studied at a
resolution of 270 pc. From the analysis of the MUSE data cube, we find GRB
111005A to have occurred within a metal-rich environment with little signs of
ongoing star formation. Spectral analysis at the position of the GRB indicates
the presence of an old stellar population (tau > 10 Myr), which limits the mass
of the GRB progenitor to M_ZAMS<15 Msolar, in direct conflict with the
collapsar model. Our deep limits on the presence of any SN emission combined
with the environmental conditions at the position of GRB 111005A necessitate
the exploration of a novel long GRB formation mechanism that is unrelated to
massive stars.

systems introduced previously [V. Dohm, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110}, 107207

is formulated within the $\varphi^4$ model with lattice anisotropy in a
$d$-dimensional block geometry with periodic boundary conditions. It describes
the crossover from low- to high-temperature fluctuations including
Goldstone-dominated and critical fluctuations for $1\leq n \leq \infty$ in
$2<d<4$ dimensions. An exact representation is derived for the large-distance
behavior of the bulk correlation function of anisotropic systems in terms of
the principal correlation lengths and an anisotropy matrix ${\bf \bar A}$. This
includes the long-ranged correlations with an anisotropic algebraic decay at
low temperatures due to the Goldstone modes for $n>1$. We calculate the
finite-size scaling functions of the excess free energy and thermodynamic
Casimir force. Exact results are derived in the large-$n$ limit. Applications
are given for $L_\parallel^{d-1} \times L$ slab geometries with a finite aspect
ratio $\rho=L/L_\parallel$ as well as for the film limit $\rho \to 0$. For
weakly anisotropic systems two-scale-factor universality is replaced by
multiparameter universality. This implies a substantial reduction of the
predictive power of bulk and finite-size theory for anisotropic systems as
compared to isotropic systems. The validity of multiparameter universality is
confirmed analytically for a nontrivial example of the $d=2,n=1$ universality
class. Anisotropy-dependent minima of the Casimir force scaling function are
found below $T_c$. Both the sign and magnitude of the Casimir amplitude in the
Goldstone and critical regimes are affected by the lattice anisotropy.
Quantitative predictions are made that can be tested by Monte Carlo

algorithms. Much of the research on this topic has focused on coloring with
$\Delta+1$ colors, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree. Using $\Delta+1$
colors may be unsatisfactory in sparse graphs, where not all nodes have such a
high degree; it would be more desirable to use a number of colors that improves
with sparsity. A standard measure that captures sparsity is arboricity, which
is the smallest number of forests into which the edges of the graph can be
partitioned.
  We present simple randomized distributed algorithms that, with high
probability, color any $n$-node $\alpha$-arboricity graph:
  - using $(2+\varepsilon)\cdot \alpha$ colors, for constant $\varepsilon>0$,
in $O(\log n)$ rounds, if $\alpha=\tilde{\Omega}(\log n)$, or
  - using $O(\alpha \log \alpha )$ colors, in $O(\log n)$ rounds, or
  - using $O(\alpha)$ colors, in $O(\log n \cdot \min\{\log\log n,\; \log
\alpha\})$ rounds.
  These algorithms are nearly-optimal, as it is known by results of Linial
[FOCS'87] and Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08] that coloring with $\Theta(\alpha)$
colors, or even poly$(\alpha)$ colors, requires $\Omega(\log_{\alpha} n)$
rounds. The previously best-known $O(\log n)$-time result was a deterministic
algorithm due to Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08], which uses $\Theta(\alpha ^2)$
colors. Barenboim and Elkin stated improving this number of colors as an open

the pressure at which condensation occurs is closer to saturation compared to

menisci which are pinned near the open ends. Using macroscopic arguments we
derive a modified Kelvin equation for the pressure, $p_{cc}(L;H)$, at which
condensation occurs and show that the two menisci are characterised by an edge
contact angle $\theta_e$ which is always larger than the equilibrium contact
angle $\theta$, only equal to it in the limit of macroscopic $H$. For walls
which are completely wet ($\theta=0$) the edge contact angle depends only on
the aspect ratio of the capillary and is well described by $\theta_e\approx
\sqrt{\pi L/2H}$ for large $H$. Similar results apply for condensation in
cylindrical pores of finite length. We have tested these predictions against
numerical results obtained using a microscopic density functional model where
the presence of an edge contact angle characterising the shape of the menisci
is clearly visible from the density profiles. Below the wetting temperature

Two-delta analytic QCD (2$\delta$anQCD), and Three-delta lattice-motivated
analytic QCD in the three-loop and four-loop MOM scheme (3l3$\delta$anQCD,
4l3$\delta$anQCD). These couplings do not have unphysical (Landau)
singularities, and have finite values when the transferred momentum goes to
zero, which allows us to explore the infrared regime. With the exception of
APT, these theories at high momenta practically coincide with the underlying
perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the same scheme. We apply them in order to verify
the Bjorken sum rule within the range of energies available in the data
collected by the experimental JLAB collaboration, i.e., $0.05 GeV^2 <Q^2< 3
GeV^2$ and compare the results with those obtained by using the perturbative
QCD coupling. The results of the new frameworks with respective couplings
(2$\delta$ and 3$\delta$) are in good agreement with the experimental data for
$0.5 GeV^2<Q^2<3 GeV^2$ already when only one higher-twist term is used. In the
low-$Q^2$ regime ($Q^2 \lesssim 1 GeV^2$) we use $\chi$PT-motivated expression
or an expression motivated by the light-front holography (LFH) QCD used earlier
in the literature.

software implementation of a direct algorithm for solving shifted linear
systems $(A - \sigma I)X = B$ with large number of complex shifts $\sigma$ and
multiple right-hand sides. Such problems often appear e.g. in control theory
when evaluating the transfer function, or as a part of an algorithm performing
interpolatory model reduction, as well as when computing pseudospectra and
structured pseudospectra, or solving large linear systems of ordinary
differential equations. The proposed algorithm first jointly reduces the
general full $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and the $n\times m$ full right-hand side
matrix $B$ to the controller Hessenberg canonical form that facilitates
efficient solution: $A$ is transformed to a so-called $m$-Hessenberg form and
$B$ is made upper-triangular. This is implemented as blocked highly parallel
CPU--GPU hybrid algorithm; individual blocks are reduced by the CPU, and the
necessary updates of the rest of the matrix are split among the cores of the
CPU and the GPU. To enhance parallelization, the reduction and the updates are
overlapped. In the next phase, the reduced $m$-Hessenberg--triangular systems
are solved entirely on the GPU, with shifts divided into batches. The benefits
of such load distribution are demonstrated by numerical experiments. In
particular, we show that our proposed implementation provides an excellent
basis for efficient implementations of computational methods in systems and
control theory, from evaluation of transfer function to the interpolatory model
reduction.

complicated by intense foregrounds such as galactic synchrotron and
extragalactic radio galaxies. The 21cm-Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter(LAE)
cross-correlation is one of the tools available to reduce the foreground
effects because the foreground emission from such radio sources is
statistically independent of LAE distribution. LAE surveys during the EoR at
redshifts $z=6.6$ and $7.3$ are ongoing by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC).
Additionally, Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) will provide precise redshift
information of the LAEs discovered by the HSC survey. In this paper, we
investigate the detectability of the 21cm signal with the 21cm-LAE
cross-correlation by using our improved reionization simulations. We also focus
on the error budget and evaluate it quantitatively in order to consider a
strategy to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we explore an
expansion of the LAE survey to suggest optimal survey parameters and show a
potential to measure a characteristic size of ionized bubbles via the turnover
scale of the cross-power spectrum. As a result, we find that the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) has ability to detect the cross-power spectrum signal on
large scales by combining LAE Deep field survey of HSC. We also show that the
sensitivity is improved dramatically at small scales by adding redshift
information from the PFS measurements. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) has a
potential to measure the turnover scale with an accuracy of
$6\times10^{-3}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$.

(QDs) system coupled to one-dimensional surface plasmonic waveguide are
investigated theoretically via the real-space approach. We mainly focus on the
coupling effects of the two QDs on the transmission properties of a single
incident plasmon. We demonstrated that switching of a single plasmon can be
achieved by controlling the interparticle distance, the interparticle coupling
strength, and the QD-waveguide coupling strength, as well as spectral detuning.
We also showed that the coupling between the continuum excitations and the
discrete excitations results in the Fano-type transmission spectrum. The
transport properties of a single plasmon interacting with such a two direct
coupled QDs system could find the applications in the design of plasmonic
nanodevices, such as single photon switching and nanomirrors, and in quantum
information processing.

plasmons in such a hybrid molecules leads to appealing, tunable optical
