series, and spatial fields, but they are computationally infeasible for large
datasets. Focusing on the typical setting of modeling data as a GP plus an
additive noise term, we propose a generalization of the Vecchia (1988) approach
as a framework for GP approximations. We show that our general Vecchia approach
contains many popular existing GP approximations as special cases, allowing for
comparisons among the different methods within a unified framework.
Representing the models by directed acyclic graphs, we determine the sparsity
of the matrices necessary for inference, which leads to new insights regarding
the computational properties. Based on these results, we propose a novel sparse
general Vecchia approximation, which ensures computational feasibility for
large spatial datasets but can lead to considerable improvements in
approximation accuracy over Vecchia's original approach. We provide several
theoretical results and conduct numerical comparisons. We conclude with
guidelines for the use of Vecchia approximations in spatial statistics.

semi-rational solutions consisting of rogue waves, breathers and solitons are
generated. These semi-rational solutions are given in terms of determinants

parametric conditions, we derive general rogue wave solutions expressed in

describe interactions of several fundamental rogue waves, which would generate
interesting curvy wave patterns. The higher order rogue waves originate from a

complex tasks that cannot be achieved by a single bacterium. Quorum sensing is
used to measure the local bacteria population density, and it controls
cooperation by ensuring that a bacterium only commits the resources for
cooperation when it expects its neighbors to reciprocate. This paper proposes a
simple model for sharing a resource in a bacterial environment, where knowledge
of the population influences each bacterium's behavior. Game theory is used to
model the behavioral dynamics, where the net payoff (i.e., utility) for each
bacterium is a function of its current behavior and that of the other bacteria.
The game is first evaluated with perfect knowledge of the population. Then, the
unreliability of diffusion introduces uncertainty in the local population
estimate and changes the perceived payoffs. The results demonstrate the
sensitivity to the system parameters and how population uncertainty can
overcome a lack of explicit coordination.

They allow the increase of spectral efficiency by using multi-level modulation

theories in a non-dynamic background $n$-dimensional anti de Sitter space.
These finite transverse energy solutions are maximally symmetric
$p$-dimensional topological defects where $n=(p+1)+l$. The radius of curvature
of anti de Sitter space provides an extra length scale that allows us to study
the equations of motion in a limit where the masses of the Higgs field and the
massive vector bosons are both vanishing. We call this the double BPS limit. In
anti de Sitter space, the equations of motion depend on both $p$ and $l$. The
exact analytical solutions are expressed in terms of standard special
functions. The known exact analytical solutions are for kink-like defects
($p=0,1,2,\dotsc;\, l=1$), vortex-like defects ($p=1,2,3;\, l=2$), and the
'tHooft-Polyakov monopole ($p=0;\, l=3$). A bonus is that the double BPS limit
automatically gives a maximally symmetric classical glueball type solution. In
certain cases where we did not find an analytic solution, we present numerical
solutions to the equations of motion. The asymptotically exponentially
increasing volume with distance of anti de Sitter space imposes different
constraints than those found in the study of defects in Minkowski space.

present in an isolated quantum statistical system. These are states of the form
$|\Psi\rangle=e^{-{\beta H \over 2}} U e^{{\beta H \over 2}} |\Psi_0\rangle$,
where $U$ is a unitary made out of simple operators and $|\Psi_0\rangle$ is a
typical equilibrium pure state with sharply peaked energy. We argue that in a
system with a holographic dual these states have a natural interpretation as an
AdS black hole with transient excitations behind the horizon. We explore the
interpretation of these states as pure states undergoing a time-dependent
spontaneous fluctuation out of equilibrium. While these states are atypical and
the microscopic phases of the wavefunction are correlated with the matrix
elements of simple operators, the states are partly disguised as equilibrium
states due to cancellations between contributions from different coarse-grained
energy bins. These cancellations are guaranteed by the KMS condition of the
underlying equilibrium state $|\Psi_0\rangle$. However, in correlators which
include the Hamiltonian $H$ these cancellations are spoiled and the
non-equilibrium nature of the state $|\Psi\rangle$ can be detected. We discuss
connections with the proposal that local observables behind the horizon are
realized as state-dependent operators. The states studied in this paper may be
useful for implementing an analogue of the ""traversable wormhole"" protocol for
a 1-sided black hole, which could potentially allow us to extract the
excitation from behind the horizon. We include some pedagogical background

magnetic anisotropy of the Co layer can be independently manipulated to any

general setting allows for anisotropic media $M$ and can further model local
`attenuation' effects -- both highly relevant in practical imaging problems
such as SPECT tomography. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian inference
approach based on standard Gaussian process priors for $f$. The posterior
reconstruction of $f$ corresponds to a Tikhonov regulariser with a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space norm penalty that does not require the calculation of the
singular value decomposition of the forward operator $I_a$. We prove
Bernstein-von Mises theorems that entail that posterior-based inferences such

large family of semi-parametric aspects of $f$. In particular we derive the
asymptotic distribution of smooth linear functionals of the Tikhonov
regulariser, which is shown to attain the semi-parametric Cram\'er-Rao
information bound. The proofs rely on an invertibility result for the `Fisher
information' operator $I_a^*I_a$ between suitable function spaces, a result of
independent interest that relies on techniques from microlocal analysis. We
illustrate the performance of the proposed method via simulations in various

must also be used to determine several exchange couplings, including the weak

coefficient, related to the probability of photons to survive while traversing
a layer of material. From the point of view of particles doing the absorption,
however, the elementary interaction of the particle with the photon is best
described by the corresponding cross section. We revisit curvature radiation in
order to find the absorption cross section for this process, making use of the
Einstein coefficients and their relations with spontaneous and stimulated
emission and true absorption. We derive the cross section as a function of the
emission angle psi (i.e. the angle between the instantaneous velocity vector
and the direction of the photon), and the cross section integrated over angles.
Both are positive, contrary to the synchrotron case for which the cross section
can be negative for large psi. Therefore, it is impossible to have curvature
radiation masers. This has important consequences on sources of very large
brightness temperatures that require a coherent emission process, such as
pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts.

their ages. In this study, we analyse the result of 12 years of high resolution
spectroscopy within the central arcsecond of the Galactic Center (GC). By
co-adding between 55 and 105 hours of spectra we have obtained high signal to
noise H- and K-band spectra of eight stars orbiting the central supermassive
black hole. Using deep H-band spectra, we show that these stars must be high
surface gravity (dwarf) stars. We compare these deep spectra to detailed model
atmospheres and stellar evolution models to infer the stellar parameters. Our
analysis reveals an effective temperature of 21000-28500 K, a rotational
velocity of 60-170 km/s, and a surface gravity of 4.1-4.2. These parameters
imply a spectral type of B0-B3V for these stars. The inferred masses lie within
8-14 Msun. We derive an age of 6.6^{+3.4}{-4.7} Myr for the star S2, which is
compatible with the age of the clockwise rotating young stellar disk in the GC.
We estimate the age of all other studied S-stars to be less than 15 Myr, which
are compatible with the age of S2 within the uncertainties. The relatively low
ages for these S-stars favor a scenario in which the stars formed in a local
disk rather than the field-binary-disruption scenario throughout a longer

Among them, both UDO-NE and UDO-SW appear to show a loop or stream structure
around the main body of NGC 1068, providing evidence for the physical
connection to NGC 1068. We consider that UDO-SE may be a tidal dwarf galaxy. We

factor of 3 to 5 than those of the three UDOs. This object may belong to a
class of low surface brightness galaxy. Since this object is located along the

to the past interaction event that formed the loop by UDO-NE and UDO-SW, thus
implying the physical connection to NGC 1068. Another newly-discovered feature
is an asymmetric outer one-arm structure emanated from the western edge of the

Pan-STARRS $g,r,$ and $i$, we demonstrate that we are able to measure reliably
the metallicities of individual stars to $\sim 0.2$ dex, and hence additionally
obtain good photometric distance estimates. This survey thus permits the

vary significantly with vertical height above the disk. As traced in

identical to the core, implying that the ejection of the low-mass stars

studying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these
problems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond
pulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating
accretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while
force-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting
gas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,
highly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic
simulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric
general-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the
interaction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind
can lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This
transition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power
can greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion
rate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream.
More generally, our simulations produce for the first time the four possible
accretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed
magnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto
the stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material enters through the
light cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d)
almost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the
pulsar wind.

electron temperatures, and optical depths of galaxy clusters obtainable with
upcoming multi-frequency measurements of the kinematic, thermal, and
relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. The forecasted constraints are compared
for different measurement configurations with frequency bands between 90 GHz

emission from dusty star forming galaxies, and by using X-ray temperature
priors from eROSITA. Cluster constraints are forecast for several model cluster
masses. A sensitivity optimization for seven frequency bands is presented for a
CCAT-prime first light instrument and a next generation instrument that takes
advantage of the large optical throughput of CCAT-prime. We find that
CCAT-prime observations are expected to enable measurement and separation of
the SZ effects to characterize the velocity, temperature, and optical depth of
individual massive clusters ($\sim10^{15}\,M_\odot$). Submillimeter
measurements are shown to play an important role in separating these components

similar optical throughput for each detector array, we develop a rule of thumb
for the number of detector arrays desired at each frequency to optimize

have magnetic cycles, just like our Sun. An investigation of the relation
between their cycle length and rotation period can shed light on the dynamo
mechanisms operating in these stars. Previous works on this relation suggested
that the stars could be separated into active and inactive branches, with the
Sun falling between them. In this work, we determined short magnetic activity
cycles for 6 active solar-type stars observed by the Kepler telescope. The
method adopted here estimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of
the transitlight curves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless
model transit from the light curve, and then integrating over all the residuals
during the transit. The presence of long term periodicity is estimated from the
analysis of a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the complete time series. Finally, we
investigate the rotation-cycle period relation for the stars analysed here and
find that some active stars do not follow the behaviour proposed earlier,
falling in the inactive branch. In addition, we also notice a considerable
spread from other stars in the literature in the active/inactive branches.

  Science, workshop on ""MeerKAT Science: On the Pathway to the SKA"", held in
  Stellenbosch 25-27 May 2016. Comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The SKA era is set to revolutionize our understanding of neutral hydrogen
(HI) in individual galaxies out to redshifts of z~0.8; and in the z > 6
intergalactic medium through the detection and imaging of cosmic reionization.
Direct HI number density constraints will, nonetheless, remain relatively weak
out to cosmic noon (z~2) - the epoch of peak star formation and black hole
accretion - and beyond. However, as was demonstrated from the 1990s with
molecular line observations, this can be overcome by utilising the natural
amplification afforded by strong gravitational lensing, which results in an
effective increase in integration time by the square of the total magnification
(\mu^2) for an unresolved source. Here we outline how a dedicated lensed HI
survey will leverage MeerKAT's high sensitivity, frequency coverage, large
instantaneous bandwidth, and high dynamic range imaging to enable a lasting
legacy of high-redshift HI emission detections well into the SKA era. This
survey will not only provide high-impact, rapid-turnaround MeerKAT science
commissioning results, but also unveil Milky Way-like systems towards cosmic
noon which is not possible with any other SKA precursors/pathfinders. An
ambitious lensed HI survey will therefore make a significant impact from
MeerKAT commissioning all the way through to the full SKA era, and provide a
more complete picture of the HI history of the Universe.

integrations towards the young protocluster, USS1558$-$003 at $z=2.53$ with the
Subaru Telescope. This system is composed of four dense groups with massive
local overdensities, traced by 107 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) with stellar
masses and dust-corrected star formation rates down to $1\times10^8$ M$_\odot$
and 3 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, respectively. We have investigated the environmental
dependence of various physical properties within the protocluster by comparing
distributions of HAEs in higher and lower densities with a standard
Kolmogorov--Smirnov test. At 97\% confidence level, we find enhanced star
formation across the star-forming main sequence of HAEs living in the most
extreme `supergroup', corresponding to the top quartile of overdensities.
Furthermore, we derive distribution functions of H$\alpha$ luminosity and
stellar mass in group and intergroup regions, approximately corresponding to 30
times and 8 times higher densities than the general field. As a consequence, we
identify by 0.7 and 0.9 dex higher cutoffs in H$\alpha$ luminosity and stellar
mass functions in the dense groups, respectively. On the other hand, HAEs in
the intergroup environment of the protocluster show similar distribution
functions to those of field galaxies despite residing in significant
overdensities. In the early phase of cluster formation, as inferred from our
results, the densest parts in the protocluster have had an accelerated
formation of massive galaxies. We expect that these eventually grow and
transform into early-type galaxies at the bright end of the red sequence as
seen in present-day rich clusters of galaxies.

massive than about nine solar masses, in which they develop complex,
multi-component atmospheres. Bright spots have been detected in the atmosphere
of red supergiants using interferometric imaging. Above the photosphere of a
red supergiant, the molecular outer atmosphere extends up to about two stellar
radii. Furthermore, the hot chromosphere (5,000 to 8,000 kelvin) and cool gas
(less than 3,500 kelvin) of a red supergiant coexist at about three stellar
radii. The dynamics of such complex atmospheres has been probed by ultraviolet
and optical spectroscopy. The most direct approach, however, is to measure the
velocity of gas at each position over the image of stars as in observations of
the Sun. Here we report the mapping of the velocity field over the surface and
atmosphere of the nearby red supergiant Antares. The two-dimensional velocity
field map obtained from our near-infrared spectro-interferometric imaging
reveals vigorous upwelling and downdrafting motions of several huge gas clumps
at velocities ranging from about -20 to +20 kilometres per second in the
atmosphere, which extends out to about 1.7 stellar radii. Convection alone
cannot explain the observed turbulent motions and atmospheric extension,
suggesting that an unidentified process is operating in the extended
atmosphere.

attacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used
to construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered

carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an
adversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically
deanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We
collect a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is
the largest dataset of web traffic ever used for website fingerprinting, and
find that the performance achieved by our deep learning approaches is
comparable to known methods which include various research efforts spanning
over multiple years. The obtained success rate exceeds 96% for a closed world

consequences on the performance of modern wireless networks. To increase the
efficacy and stealthiness of such threats, a number of extremely challenging,

thoroughly addressed many single-layer attacks, the problem of detecting and
mitigating cross-layer attacks still remains unsolved. For this reason, in this
paper we propose a novel framework to analyze and address cross-layer attacks

mitigation component. The attack detection component is based on a Bayesian
learning detection scheme that constructs a model of observed evidence to
identify stealthy attack activities. The mitigation component comprises a
scheme that achieves the desired trade-off between security and performance. We
specialize and evaluate the proposed framework by considering a specific

manipulation. Simulations and experimental results obtained with a test-bed

nematic phase (Nx). The role and quantitative contribution of each mechanism to
enantiotopic discrimination in the NX phase are presented and compared with the
case of the conventional chiral nematic phase (N*). It is found that polar
ordering is essential for the appearance of enantiotopic discrimination in
small rigid solutes dissolved in the Nx phase and that such discrimination is
restricted to solutes belonging to the point group symmetries $C_s$ and
$C_{2v}$.

base station antennas are evenly distributed to $n$ admissable locations
throughout the cell.
  First, we show that a reliable (per-user) rate of $O(\log n)$ is achievable
through optimal locational optimization of base station antennas. We also prove
that an $O(\log n)$ rate is the best possible. Therefore, in contrast to a
centralized or circular deployment, where the achievable rate is at most a
constant, the rate with a general deployment can grow logarithmically with $n$,
resulting in a certain form of ""macromultiplexing gain.""
  Second, using tools from high-resolution quantization theory, we derive an
accurate formula for the best achievable rate given any $n$ and any user
density function. According to our formula, the dependence of the optimal rate
on the user density function $f$ is curiously only through the differential
entropy of $f$. In fact, the optimal rate decreases linearly with the
differential entropy, and the worst-case scenario is a uniform user density.
Numerical simulations confirm our analytical findings.

exploited in thermal management applications. Recent studies have shown
stretched polymers can achieve high thermal conductivity. However, the
transport mechanisms of heat in thermally conductive polymers have yet to be
elucidated. Here we report a method for scalable fabrication of polyethylene
films with a high thermal conductivity of 62 W/m-K. The achieved thermal
conductivity is over two orders-of-magnitude greater than that of typical
polymers (~0.1 W/m-K), and exceeds those of many metals and ceramics used as
traditional heat conductors. Careful structural studies are carried out and
reveal that the film consists of nanofibers with crystalline and amorphous
regions. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we reveal the importance of the
amorphous morphology in achieving such high thermal conductivity, rather than
simply from enhancements in the degree of crystallinity and crystallite
alignment. The amorphous phase reaches a remarkably high thermal conductivity
of ~16 W/m-K. Even still, we identify that the presence of this amorphous phase
is the dominant factor as the film thermal conductivity is still much lower
than the predicted values for bulk single-crystal polyethylene (237 K/m-K).
This work lays the foundation for the rational design and synthesis of
thermally conductive polymers, and opens up new opportunities for advanced heat
management, particularly when flexible, lightweight, chemically inert and

We find that GeSe exhibits a markedly anisotropic electronic transport, with
maximum conductance along the armchair direction. Density functional theory

zigzag direction than the armchair direction; this mass anisotropy explains the
observed anisotropic conductance. The crystallographic orientation of GeSe is

supported by calculated Raman tensors for the orthorhombic structure. Novel

on occasion so that the error rate on non-refused predictions does not exceed

transceivers exchange confidential messages via a wireless powered untrusted
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay in the presence of an external jammer. We take
into account both friendly jamming (FJ) and Gaussian noise jamming (GNJ)
scenarios. Based on the time switching (TS) architecture at the relay, the data
transmission is done in three phases. In the first phase, both the
energy-starved nodes, the untrustworthy relay and the jammer, are charged by
non-information radio frequency (RF) signals from the sources. In the second
phase, the two sources send their information signals and concurrently, the
jammer transmits artificial noise to confuse the curious relay. Finally, the
third phase is dedicated to forward a scaled version of the received signal
from the relay to the sources. For the proposed secure transmission schemes, we
derive new closed-form lower-bound expressions for the ergodic secrecy sum rate
(ESSR) in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We further analyze the
asymptotic ESSR to determine the key parameters; the high SNR slope and the
high SNR power offset of the jamming based scenarios. To highlight the
performance advantage of the proposed FJ, we also examine the scenario of
without jamming (WoJ). Finally, numerical examples and discussions are provided
to acquire some engineering insights, and to demonstrate the impacts of
different system parameters on the secrecy performance of the considered
communication scenarios. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed FJ
significantly outperforms the traditional one-way communication and the
Constellation rotation approach, as well as our proposed benchmarks, the
two-way WoJ and GNJ scenarios.

should work together to build effective IoT data analytics in order to overcome
their respective weaknesses and use their specific strengths. Specifically, we
collected raw data locally and extracted features by applying data fusion

study of arrangements of pseudocircles was initiated by Gr\""unbaum, who defined
them as collections of simple closed curves that pairwise intersect in exactly
two crossings. Gr\""unbaum conjectured that the number of triangular cells $p_3$
in digon-free arrangements of $n$ pairwise intersecting pseudocircles is at
least $2n-4$. We present examples to disprove this conjecture. With a recursive
construction based on an example with $12$ pseudocircles and $16$ triangles we
obtain a family with $p_3(\mathcal{A})/n \to 16/11 = 1.\overline{45}$. We
expect that the lower bound $p_3(\mathcal{A}) \geq 4n/3$ is tight for
infinitely many simple arrangements. It may however be true that all digon-free
arrangements of $n$ pairwise intersecting circles have at least $2n-4$
triangles.
  For pairwise intersecting arrangements with digons we have a lower bound of
$p_3 \geq 2n/3$, and conjecture that $p_3 \geq n-1$.
  Concerning the maximum number of triangles in pairwise intersecting
arrangements of pseudocircles, we show that $p_3 \le 2n^2/3 +O(n)$. This is
essentially best possible because there are families of pairwise intersecting
arrangements of $n$ pseudocircles with $p_3/n^2 \to 2/3$.
  The paper contains many drawings of arrangements of pseudocircles and a good
fraction of these drawings was produced automatically from the combinatorial

compare their transport properties with those of similar structures grown on
LSAT [(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3]. On DyScO3, planar defects normal to the
quantum wells lead to a strong in-plane anisotropy in the transport properties.
This allows for quantifying the role of defects in transport. In particular, we
investigate differences in the longitudinal and Hall scattering rates, which is
a non-Fermi liquid phenomenon known as lifetime separation. The residuals in
both the longitudinal resistance and Hall angle were found to depend on the
relative orientations of the transport direction to the planar defects. The
Hall angle exhibited a robust T2 temperature dependence along all directions,
whereas no simple power law could describe the temperature dependence of the
longitudinal resistances. Remarkably, the degree of the carrier lifetime
separation, as manifested in the distinctly different temperature dependences
and diverging residuals near a critical quantum well thickness, was completely
insensitive to disorder. The results allow for a clear distinction between
disorder-induced contributions to the transport and intrinsic, non-Fermi liquid

realized as {\it coideal subalgebras} of the function algebra
$\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{G})$ attached to the compact quantum group.
  We classify the embeddable ergodic actions of the compact quantum group
$O_{-1}(2)$, basing our analysis on the bijective correspondence between all
ergodic actions of the classical group $O(2)$ and those of its quantum twist
resulting from the monoidal equivalence between their respective tensor
categories of unitary representations.
  In the last section we give counterexamples showing that in general we cannot
expect a bijective correspondence between embeddable ergodic actions of two
monoidally equivalent compact quantum groups.

coordinated over wireless networks to achieve safety and efficiency. These
wireless networks, however, are inherently unreliable due to shadow fading
induced by the physical motion of the machinery. To assure both safety and
efficiency, this paper proposes a state-dependent channel model that captures
the interaction between the physical and communication systems. By adopting
this channel model, sufficient conditions on the maximum allowable transmission
interval are then derived to ensure stochastic safety for a nonlinear physical
system controlled over a state-dependent wireless fading channel. Under these
sufficient conditions, the safety and efficiency co-design problem is
formulated as a constrained cooperative game, whose equilibria represent
optimal control and transmission power policies that minimize a discounted
joint-cost in an infinite horizon. This paper shows that the equilibria of the
constrained game are solutions to a non-convex generalized geometric program,
which are approximated by solving two convex programs. The optimality gap is
quantified as a function of the size of the approximation region in convex
programs, and asymptotically converges to zero by adopting a branch-bound
algorithm. Simulation results of a networked robotic arm and a forklift truck
are presented to verify the proposed co-design method.

traditionally considered in automata theory, to the so-called basic and
h-proper languages, which are (implicitly) used by categorial grammars, the
original tool for the description of lexicalized syntax. The basic and h-proper
languages allow us to stress several nice properties of h-lexicalized
restarting automata, and they are suitable for modeling the analysis by
reduction and, subsequently, for the development of categories of a lexicalized
syntax. Based on the fact that a two-way deterministic monotone restarting
automaton can be transformed into an equivalent deterministic monotone
RL-automaton in (Marcus) contextual form, we obtain a transformation from
monotone RLWW-automata that recognize the class CFL of context-free languages
as their input languages to deterministic monotone h-RLWW-automata that
recognize CFL through their h-proper languages. Through this transformation we
obtain automata with the complete correctness preserving property and an
infinite hierarchy within CFL, based on the size of the read/write window.
Additionally, we consider h-RLWW-automata that are allowed to perform multiple
rewrite steps per cycle, and we establish another infinite hierarchy above CFL
that is based on the number of rewrite steps that may be executed within a
cycle. The corresponding separation results and their proofs illustrate the
transparency of h-RLWW-automata that work with the (complete or cyclic)

superposition of left chiral (LC) and right chiral (RC) states. LC $\nu_e$'s
interact mainly by the standard $V - A$, while RC ones are only detected by the
exotic $V + A$ and $S_R, P_R, T_R$ interactions. One assumes that the spin
polarization vector of the initial $\nu_e$'s is turned aside from the $\nu_e$
momentum, and due to this the non-vanishing transversal component of the
$\nu_e$ spin polarization appears. We compute the differential cross section as
a function of the recoil electron azimuthal angle and scattered electron
energy, and show how the interference terms between standard $V-A$ and exotic
$S_R, P_R, T_R$ couplings depend on the various angular correlations among the
transversal $\nu_e$ spin polarization, the polarization of the electron target,
the incoming neutrino momentum and the outgoing electron momentum in the limit

electrons azimuthal asymmetry and the asymmetry axis location of outgoing
electrons depend on the azimuthal angle of the transversal component of the
$\nu_e$ spin polarization, both for the time reversal symmetry conservation

angle distribution of the recoil electrons are also sensitive to the
interference terms between $V - A$ and $S_R, P_R, T_R$ couplings, proportional
to the T-even and T-odd angular correlations. Our model-independent analysis is

non-Gaussianity in late-time correlators of primordial curvature perturbations.
The shape and amplitude of this signal depend on the mass and spin of the extra
particles. Constraints on this distinct form of primordial non-Gaussianity,
therefore, provide a wealth of information on the particle content during
inflation. We investigate the potential of upcoming galaxy surveys in
constraining such a signature through its impact on the observed galaxy power
spectrum. Primordial non-Gaussianity of various shapes induces a
scale-dependent bias on tracers of large-scale structure, such as galaxies.
Using this signature we obtain constraints on massive particles during
inflation, which can have non-zero spins. In particular, we show that the
prospects for constraining particles with spins 0 and 1 are promising, while
constraining particles with spin 2 from power spectrum alone seems challenging.
We show that the multi-tracer technique can significantly improve the
constraints from the power spectrum by at least an order of magnitude.
Furthermore, we analyze the effect of non-linearities due to gravitational
evolution on the forecasted constraints on the masses of the extra particles
and the amplitudes of the imprinted non-Gaussian signal. We find that
gravitational evolution affects the constraints by less than a factor of 2.

first, I constructed modified numerical algorithms based on tensor networks to
simulate systems of anyons in low dimensions, and second, I used those methods
to study the topological phases the anyons form when they braid around one
another. In the first phase of my thesis, I extended the anyonic tensor network
algorithms, by incorporating U(1) symmetry to give a modified ansatz,
Anyon-U(1) tensor networks, which are capable of simulating anyonic systems at
any rational filling fraction. In the second phase, I used the numerical
methods to study some models of non-Abelian anyons that naturally allows for
exchange of anyons. I proposed a lattice model of anyons, which I dubbed
anyonic Hubbard model, which is a pair of coupled chains of anyons (or simply
called anyonic ladder). Each site of the ladder can either host a single
anyonic charge, or it can be empty. The anyons are able to move around,
interact with one another, and exchange positions with other anyons, when
vacancies exist. Exchange of anyons is a non-trivial process which may
influence the formation of different kinds of new phases of matter. I studied
this model using the two prominent species of anyons: Fibonacci and Ising
anyons, and made a number of interesting discoveries about their phase
diagrams. I identified new phases of matter arising from both the interaction
between these anyons and their exchange braid statistics.

system, where a UAV is dispatched to disseminate a common file to a number of
geographically distributed ground terminals (GTs). Our objective is to design
the UAV trajectory to minimize its mission completion time, while ensuring that
each GT is able to successfully recover the file with a high probability
required. We consider the use of practical random linear network coding (RLNC)
for UAV multicasting, so that each GT is able to recover the file as long as it
receives a sufficiently large number of coded packets. However, the formulated
UAV trajectory optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be directly
solved. To tackle this issue, we first derive an analytical lower bound for the
success probability of each GT's file recovery. Based on this result, we then
reformulate the problem into a more tractable form, where the UAV trajectory
only needs to be designed to meet a set of constraints each on the minimum
connection time with a GT, during which their distance is below a designed
threshold. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory only needs to constitute
connected line segments, thus it can be obtained by determining first the
optimal set of waypoints and then UAV speed along the lines connecting the
waypoints. We propose practical schemes for the waypoints design based on a
novel concept of virtual base station (VBS) placement and by applying convex
optimization techniques. Furthermore, for given set of waypoints, we obtain the
optimal UAV speed over the resulting path efficiently by solving a linear
programming (LP) problem. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled
multicasting with optimized trajectory design achieves significant performance
gains as compared to benchmark schemes.

C-DIIS) method developed by Pulay is an efficient and the most widely used
scheme in quantum chemistry to accelerate the convergence of self consistent
field (SCF) iterations in Hartree-Fock theory and Kohn-Sham density functional
theory. The C-DIIS method requires the explicit storage of the density matrix,
the Fock matrix and the commutator matrix. Hence the method can only be used
for systems with a relatively small basis set, such as the Gaussian basis set.
We develop a new method that enables the C-DIIS method to be efficiently
employed in electronic structure calculations with a large basis set such as
planewaves for the first time. The key ingredient is the projection of both the
density matrix and the commutator matrix to an auxiliary matrix called the
gauge-fixing matrix. The resulting projected commutator-DIIS method (PC-DIIS)
only operates on matrices of the same dimension as the that consists of
Kohn-Sham orbitals. The cost of the method is comparable to that of standard
charge mixing schemes used in large basis set calculations. The PC-DIIS method
is gauge-invariant, which guarantees that its performance is invariant with
respect to any unitary transformation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. We demonstrate
that the PC-DIIS method can be viewed as an extension of an iterative
eigensolver for nonlinear problems. We use the PC-DIIS method for accelerating
Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations with hybrid
exchange-correlation functionals, and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to the commonly used nested two-level SCF iteration procedure.

V$_{\texttt{Se}}$ and Se$_{i}$ have the lowest formation energy. We also find
that in contrast to the Se$_{i}$ case exhibiting spin degeneracy in the defect
states, the large spin-orbit splitting up to 152 meV is observed in the defect
states of the V$_{\texttt{Se}}$. Our analyses of orbital contributions to the
defect states show that the large spin splitting is originated from the strong
hybridization between Pt-$d_{x{^2}+y{^2}}+d_{xy}$ and Se-$p_{x}+p_{y}$

investigated in the context of the quantum first passage problem. This dynamics
considers the time evolution of a system subjected to a sequence of selective
projective measurements made at small but finite intervals of time. This means
that one has a sequence of steps, with each step consisting of a unitary
transformation followed by a projection. The dynamics is non-unitary and, in
recent work, it has been shown that it can be effectively described by two
different non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we explore this connection by
considering the problem of detecting a free quantum particle moving on a
one-dimensional lattice, where the detector is placed at the origin and the
particle is initially located at some specified lattice point. We find that
results for distribution times for the first detection probability, obtained

(PoA), defined as the worst ratio of the objective function value of an
equilibrium --- solution of the game --- and that of an optimal outcome. Given
the tremendous impact of tools from mathematical programming in the design of
algorithms and the similarity of the price of anarchy and different measures
such as the approximation and competitive ratios, it is intriguing to develop a
duality-based method to characterize the efficiency of games.
  In the paper, we present an approach based on linear programming duality to
study the efficiency of games. We show that the approach provides a general
recipe to analyze the efficiency of games and also to derive concepts leading
to improvements. The approach is particularly appropriate to bound the PoA.
Specifically, in our approach the dual programs naturally lead to competitive
PoA bounds that are (almost) optimal for several classes of games. The approach
indeed captures the smoothness framework and also some current non-smooth
techniques/concepts. We show the applicability to the wide variety of games and
environments, from congestion games to Bayesian welfare, from full-information
settings to incomplete-information ones.

the graviton mass $m_g<10^{-29}$ eV was obtained (PRD 9,1119, 1974). Recently,
it has been shown that one can obtain closed bound orbits for Yukawa potential

optimal solution to the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Meanwhile, convex

blend two keypads with different digit orderings in such a way, that the user
who is close to the device is seeing one keypad to enter her PIN, while the
attacker who is looking at the device from a bigger distance is seeing only the
other keypad. The user's keypad is shuffled in every authentication attempt

  To reason about the security of IllusionPIN, we developed an algorithm which
is based on human visual perception and estimates the minimum distance from
which an observer is unable to interpret the keypad of the user. We tested our
estimations with 84 simulated shoulder-surfing attacks from 21 different
people. None of the attacks was successful against our estimations. In
addition, we estimated the minimum distance from which a camera is unable to
capture the visual information from the keypad of the user. Based on our

this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1)
reduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint; and 3) lower
the number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is
achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but
effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method
directly applies to modern CNN architectures, introduces minimum overhead to
the training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators
for the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming, which takes
wide and large networks as input models, but during training insignificant
channels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and
compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models,
including VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification
datasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20x
reduction in model size and a 5x reduction in computing operations.

long-standing open problem, known as Tsirelson's problem. Following recent
progress by Slofstra [arXiv:1606.03140 (2016), arXiv:1703.08618 (2017)] only
two instances of the problem remain open. One of them is the question of
whether the set of finite-dimensional quantum correlations is strictly
contained in the set of infinite-dimensional ones (i.e. whether $\mathcal C_{q}
\neq \mathcal C_{qs}$). The usual formulation of the question assumes finite
question and answer sets. In this work, we show that, when one allows for
either infinite answer sets (and finite question sets) or infinite question
sets (and finite answer sets), there exist correlations that are achievable
using an infinite-dimensional quantum strategy, but not a finite-dimensional
one. For the former case, our proof exploits a recent result [Nat. Comm. 8,

of arbitrary local dimension $d$, using question sets of size 3 and 4 and

bipartite entangled states of any local dimension d, using question sets of
size $O(d)$, and answer sets of size 4 and 3 respectively.

rely on approximate graph matching algorithms, which are inevitably slow and

in this work, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to compute the
embedding, i.e., a numeric vector, based on the control flow graph of each
binary function, then the similarity detection can be done efficiently by
measuring the distance between the embeddings for two functions. We implement a
prototype called Gemini. Our extensive evaluation shows that Gemini outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches by large margins with respect to similarity
detection accuracy. Further, Gemini can speed up prior art's embedding
generation time by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude and reduce the required training
time from more than 1 week down to 30 minutes to 10 hours. Our real world case
studies demonstrate that Gemini can identify significantly more vulnerable

($\mu_E\sim0.65$) whilst in M31 the shapes of the classical and ultrafaint
dSphs are very similar. The M31 dSphs are preferentially radially aligned with
a dispersion of $\sim45\deg$. This signal is driven by the ultrafaint
population whilst the classical M31 dSphs are consistent with a random
orientation. We compare our results to the Aquarius mock stellar catalogues of
Lowing et al. and find the subhalo radial alignment distribution matches the
Local Group dSphs results, whilst the Aquarius intrinsic ellipticities are
significantly smaller than the data ($\Delta\langle E\rangle\approx0.4$). We
provide evidence that the major axes of the Milky Way satellites lie within a
preferential plane with normal vector pointing towards $(\ell,b)=(127,5)\deg$.
We associate this preferred direction with the Vast Polar Orbital structure
although their respective great circles are offset by $\sim30\deg$. No signal
in the alignments of the major axes is found in M31, suggesting that the Great
Plane of Satellites is formed from recent accretion or chance alignment.
Finally, we provide predictions for the discrepancy between the velocity
dispersion versus scale radius distributions for the Milky Way and M31
populations and demonstrate that the projection effect from viewing similar
populations from two different locations does not account for the discrepancy
which is probably caused by increased tidal disruption in M31.

an optically thick equatorial medium whose true geometry still defy observers.
Aims: In this paper, we aim to explore the optical, scattering-induced,
polarization emerging from clumpy and warped dusty tori to check whether they
can fit with the unified model predictions. Methods: We run polarized radiative
transfer simulations in a set of warped and non warped clumpy tori to explore
the differences induced by distorted dust distributions. We then include warped
tori in a more complex model representative of an AGN to check, using
polarimetry and imaging methods, if warps can reproduce the expected
polarization dichotomy between Seyfert-1 and Seyfert-2 AGN. Results: The main
results from our simulations highlight that isolated warped structures imprint
the polarization degree and angle with distinctive signatures at Seyfert-1
orientations. Included in an AGN model, the signatures of warps are easily (but
not always) washed out by multiple scattering in a clumpy environment. Imaging
polarimetry may help to detect warped tori but we prove that warps can exist in
AGN circumnuclear regions without contradicting observations. Conclusions: Two
warped tori with a non significant difference in geometry in terms of
photometry or spectroscopy can have totally different signatures in
polarimetry. Testing the geometry of any alternative model to the usual dusty
torus using polarized radiative transfer is a necessary approach to verify or
reject a hypothesis.

Experiments are focused on samples near the critical composition $x_c\sim
0.045$ where competition and switching between charge order and
superconductivity is established. We show that charge order as a function of
pressure in $\mathrm{Ir_{0.95}Pt_{0.05}Te_{2}}$ is preempted - and hence
triggered - by a structural transition. Charge ordering appears uniaxially
along the short crystallographic (1,0,1) domain axis with a
$\mathrm{(\frac{1}{5},0,\frac{1}{5})}$ modulation. Based on these results we
draw a charge-order phase diagram and discuss the relation between stripe
ordering and superconductivity.

first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. For both
stackings of the 5d-Fe bilayer on Rh(001) we observe a transition from an
antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange interaction upon
5d band filling. In the sandwich structure 5d/Fe/Rh(001) the nearest neighbor
exchange is significantly reduced. For FeIr bilayers on Rh(001) we consider
spin spiral states in order to determine exchange constants beyond nearest
neighbors. By including spin-orbit coupling we obtain the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI). The magnetic interactions in Fe/Ir/Rh(001) are similar to
those of Fe/Ir(001) for which an atomic scale spin lattice has been predicted.
However, small deviations between both systems remain due to the different
lattice constants and the Rh vs. Ir surface layers. This leads to slightly
different exchange constants and DMI and the easy magnetization direction
switches from out-of-plane for Fe/Ir(001) to in-plane for Fe/Ir/Rh(001).
Therefore a fine tuning of magnetic interactions is possible by using single 5d
transition-metal layers which may allow to tailor antiferromagnetic skyrmions
in this type of ultrathin films. In the sandwich structure Ir/Fe/Rh(001) we
find a strong exchange frustration due to strong hybridization of the Fe layer
with both Ir and Rh which drastically reduces the nearest-neighbor exchange.
The energy contribution from the DMI becomes extremely large and DMI beyond
nearest neighbors cannot be neglected. We attribute the large DMI to the low
coordination of the Ir layer at the surface. We demonstrate that higher- order
exchange interactions are significant in both systems which may be crucial for
the magnetic ground state.

of genotypic fitness landscapes that aim to capture generic features of
epistatic interactions in multilocus systems. Genotypes are represented as
sequences of $L$ binary loci. The fitness assigned to a genotype is a sum of
contributions, each of which is a random function defined on a subset of $k \le
L$ loci. These subsets or neighborhoods determine the genetic interactions of
the model. Whereas earlier work on the NK model suggested that most of its
properties are robust with regard to the choice of neighborhoods, recent work
has revealed an important and sometimes counter-intuitive influence of the
interaction structure on the properties of NK fitness landscapes. Here we
review these developments and present new results concerning the number of
local fitness maxima and the statistics of selectively accessible (that is,
fitness-monotonic) mutational pathways. In particular, we develop a unified
framework for computing the exponential growth rate of the expected number of
local fitness maxima as a function of $L$, and identify two different
universality classes of interaction structures that display different
asymptotics of this quantity for large $k$. Moreover, we show that the
probability that the fitness landscape can be traversed along an accessible
path decreases exponentially in $L$ for a large class of interaction structures
that we characterize as locally bounded. Finally, we discuss the impact of the
NK interaction structures on the dynamics of evolution using adaptive walk
models.

which make no contributions to local temperature due to the absence of phonon
interactions, result in the concave temperature profile and over-cooling
effect. For the anharmonic model, thanks to the phonon-phonon interactions, the
localized modes are excited and make considerable contributions to interfacial
temperature, which is clearly shown by examining the temperature accumulation
function. When anharmonicity is considerably large, the negative temperature
gradient is absent since the localized phonon modes are fully mixed. The
presence of localized modes are evidently demonstrated by the inverse
participation ratio and normal mode analysis for the isolated harmonic model.

by providing hints regarding what to do next. However, engineering such
next-step hints manually or via an expert model becomes infeasible if the space
of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to
infer next-step hints automatically, relying on past students' data. In
particular, the Hint Factory (Barnes & Stamper, 2008) recommends edits that are
most likely to guide students from their current state towards a correct
solution, based on what successful students in the past have done in the same
situation. Still, the Hint Factory relies on student data being available for
any state a student might visit while solving the task, which is not the case
for some learning tasks, such as open-ended programming tasks. In this
contribution we provide a mathematical framework for edit-based hint policies
and, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints in
vast and sparsely populated state spaces. In particular, we extend the Hint
Factory by considering data of past students in all states which are similar to
the student's current state and creating hints approximating the weighted
average of all these reference states. Because the space of possible weighted
averages is continuous, we call this approach the Continuous Hint Factory. In
our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the Continuous Hint Factory
can predict more accurately what capable students would do compared to existing
prediction schemes on two learning tasks, especially in an open-ended
programming task, and that the Continuous Hint Factory is comparable to
existing hint policies at reproducing tutor hints on a simple UML diagram task.

significant contribution of the surface energy, as measured by the
$\textit{surface tension}$. The predictions for the combined potential- and

$n$-dimensional manifold, let $\Omega=({\Omega}\_{ij}={\Omega}\_{ji})$ be a
perturbation of the non-degenerate metric
$\omega=({\omega}\_{ij}={\omega}\_{ji})$ with $det(\omega)\neq 0$ and call
${\omega}^{-1}=({\omega}^{ij}={\omega}^{ji})$ the inverse matrix appearing in
the Dalembertian operator $\Box = {\omega}^{ij}d\_{ij}$. The first idea is to
introduce the linear transformation
${\bar{\Omega}}\_{ij}={\Omega}\_{ij}-\frac{1}{2}{\omega}\_{ij}tr(\Omega)$ where
$tr(\Omega)={\omega}^{ij}{\Omega}\_{ij}$ is the {\it trace} of $\Omega$, which
is invertible when $n\geq 3$. The second important idea is to notice that the
composite second order linearized Einstein operator $\bar{\Omega} \rightarrow

but striking paper is to revisit these two results in the light of the {\it
differential duality} existing in Algebraic Analysis, namely a mixture of
differential geometry and homological agebra, providing therefore a totally
different interpretation. In particular, we prove that the above operator
$\bar{\Omega} \rightarrow E$ is nothing else than the formal adjoint of the
Ricci operator $\Omega \rightarrow R$ and that the map $\Omega \rightarrow
\bar{\Omega}$ is just the formal adjoint (transposed) of the defining tensor
map $R \rightarrow E$. Accordingly, the Cauchy operator (stress equations) can
be directly parametrized by the formal adjoint of the Ricci operator and the
Einstein operator is no longer needed.

most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions
without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent
years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the
massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG
signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between
EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only
consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between
adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In
this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent
neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by
effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG
streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically
neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2D
mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the
subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a

plethora of experimental results in a variety of systems, which designates that
cell populations are heterogeneous systems in the sense that properties such as
size, shape, and DNA/RNA content are unevenly distributed amongst their
individuals. In order to address the implications of heterogeneity, we utilize
the so-called cell population balance (CPB) models. Here, we solve numerically
multivariable CPB models to study the effect of heterogeneity on populations
carrying the toggle switch network, which features nonlinear behavior at the
single-cell level. In order to answer whether this nonlinear behavior is
inherited to the heterogeneous population level, we perform bifurcation
analysis on the steady-state solutions of the CPB model. We show that
bistability is present at the population level with the pertinent bistability
region shrinking when the impact of heterogeneity is enhanced.

directed graph such that the sum of interaction costs over all pairs of arcs on
the path is minimized. We derive several semidefinite programming relaxations
for the quadratic shortest path problem with a matrix variable of order $m+1$,
where $m$ is the number of arcs in the graph. We use the alternating direction
method of multipliers to solve the semidefinite programming relaxations.
Numerical results show that our bounds are currently the strongest bounds for
the quadratic shortest path problem.
  We also present computational results on solving the quadratic shortest path
problem using a branch and bound algorithm. Our algorithm computes a
semidefinite programming bound in each node of the search tree, and solves

possible to obtain an exact mapping, providing an expression of the fermionic
interaction potential in terms of half-integer powers of the Laplacian. An
analogous mapping can be applied to the kinetic term of the bosonized theory. A
diagrammatic representation of the theories obtained by dimensional mismatch is
presented, and consequences and applications of the established duality are

Especially large differences between negatively and positively charged quantum
dots become evident. We present a visualisation of energetic shifts and state
mixtures due to changes in size, in-plane asymmetry and aspect ratio. Thereby
we provide a better understanding of the experimentally hard to access question
of quantum dot geometry effects in general. Our findings show a new method to
determine the in-plane asymmetry from photoluminescense excitation spectra.
Furthermore, we supply basic knowledge for tailoring the strength of certain

Forager bees direct their nestmates to profitable resources via a complex motor
display. Essentially, the dance encodes the polar coordinates to the resource
in the field. Unemployed foragers follow the dancer's movements and then search
for the advertised spots in the field. Throughout the last decades, biologists
have employed different techniques to measure key characteristics of the waggle
dance and decode the information it conveys. Early techniques involved the use
of protractors and stopwatches to measure the dance orientation and duration
directly from the observation hive. Recent approaches employ digital video
recordings and manual measurements on screen. However, manual approaches are
very time-consuming. Most studies, therefore, regard only small numbers of
animals in short periods of time. We have developed a system capable of
automatically detecting, decoding and mapping communication dances in
real-time. In this paper, we describe our recording setup, the image processing
steps performed for dance detection and decoding and an algorithm to map dances
to the field. The proposed system performs with a detection accuracy of
90.07\%. The decoded waggle orientation has an average error of -2.92{\deg}
($\pm$ 7.37{\deg} ), well within the range of human error. To evaluate and
exemplify the system's performance, a group of bees was trained to an
artificial feeder, and all dances in the colony were automatically detected,
decoded and mapped. The system presented here is the first of this kind made
publicly available, including source code and hardware specifications. We hope
this will foster quantitative analyses of the honey bee waggle dance.

molecular observations toward the position of the Red MSX source
G052.9221-00.4892, using ASTE in the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=3-2, and HCO+ J=4-3
lines. We also present radio continuum observations at 6 GHz carried out with
the JVLA interferometer. Combining these observations with public infrared data
allowed us to inquire about the nature of the source. The analysis of the
molecular observations reveals the presence of a kinetic temperature and H2
column density gradients across the molecular clump in which the source is
embedded, with the hotter and less dense gas in the inner region. The 12CO
J=3-2 emission shows evidence of misaligned massive molecular outflows, with
the blue lobe in positional coincidence with a jet-like feature seen at 8 um.
The radio continuum emission shows a slightly elongated compact radio source in
positional coincidence with the Red MSX source. The polar-like morphology of
this compact radio source perfectly matches the hourglass-like morphology
exhibited by the source in the Ks-band. The axes of symmetry of the radio
source and the near-IR nebula are perfectly aligned. Based on the
multiwavelength analysis, we suggest that the analyzed source could be
transiting a HC HII region phase, in which the young central star emits winds
and ionizing radiation through the poles. By the other hand, according to a
comparison between the Br-gamma and the radio flux density, the source would be
in a more evolved evolutionary stage of an optically thin UC HII region in
photoionization equilibrium. If this is the case, from the radio continuum
emission, we can conjecture upon the spectral type of its exciting star which
would be a B0.5V.

Two of
them are empty clathrate hydrates and three of them represent hydrogen ordered
counterparts of previously known disordered ice phases. Here, we report on
hydrogen ordering in ice VI samples upon cooling at pressures up to 1.8 GPa.
Using calorimetry, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and
powder X-ray diffraction we provide evidence for the existence of a second
hydrogen ordered phase related to ice VI, that we call ice {\beta}-XV. This
phase is more ordered than ice XV by 14% and directly transforms to ice XV
above 103K and to ice VI above 129K. That is, upon heating an
order->order->disorder transition is experienced. The new phase is thus
thermodynamically more stable than ice XV requiring a new stability region in
the phase diagram of water. Raman spectroscopy indicates ice XV and ice
{\beta}-XV to be different in terms of symmetry and space group. The activation
energies for dielectric relaxation are 45 kJ mol-1 in ice {\beta}-XV compared
to 18 kJ mol-1 in ice XV. Powder X-ray data show the oxygen network to be the
one of ice VI. The ordering of hydrogen atoms induces a significant peak shift
to lower d-spacings at d=0.265 nm in ice {\beta}-XV, whereas for ice XV shifts
to higher d-spacings are found. This present work represents a unique
experimental realization of a second electric ordering in an ice phase.

large-scale software projects. A typical VCS repository of a large project can
contain various intertwined branches consisting of a large number of commits.
If some kind of unwanted behaviour (e.g. a bug in the code) is found in the
project, it is desirable to find the commit that introduced it. Such commit is
called a regression point. There are two main issues regarding the regression
points. First, detecting whether the project after a certain commit is correct
can be very expensive as it may include large-scale testing and/or some other
forms of verification. It is thus desirable to minimise the number of such
queries. Second, there can be several regression points preceding the actual
commit; perhaps a bug was introduced in a certain commit, inadvertently fixed
several commits later, and then reintroduced in a yet later commit. In order to
fix the actual commit it is usually desirable to find the latest regression
point.
  The currently used distributed VCS contain methods for regression
identification, see e.g. the git bisect tool. In this paper, we present a new
regression identification algorithm that outperforms the current tools by
decreasing the number of validity queries. At the same time, our algorithm
tends to find the latest regression points which is a feature that is missing
in the state-of-the-art algorithms. The paper provides an experimental
evaluation of the proposed algorithm and compares it to the state-of-the-art

estimators based on sparsely connected deep neural networks with ReLU

minimax rates of convergence (up to $\log n$-factors) under a general
composition assumption on the regression function. The framework includes many
well-studied structural constraints such as (generalized) additive models.
While there is a lot of flexibility in the network architecture, the tuning
parameter is the sparsity of the network. Specifically, we consider large
networks with number of potential network parameters exceeding the sample size.
The analysis gives some insights into why multilayer feedforward neural
networks perform well in practice. Interestingly, for ReLU activation function
the depth (number of layers) of the neural network architectures plays an
important role and our theory suggests that for nonparametric regression,
scaling the network depth with the sample size is natural. It is also shown

Lys residue by Ala and a sodium cation. The combination of gas-phase
vibrational spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled ions with molecular
simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT) allows for detailed

helical structures, as the mobile positive charge strongly interacts with the
peptide backbone and disrupts secondary structure formation. Interestingly, the
global minimum structure from simulation is not present in the experiment. We
interpret that this is due to high barriers involved in re-arranging the
peptide-cation interaction that ultimately result in kinetically trapped

computation complexity of a coded caching scheme. So we prefer to construct a
caching scheme that decreases the order of $F$ for practical implementations.
  In this paper, we construct four classes of new schemes where two classes can
significantly reduce the value of $F$ by increasing a little $R$ comparing with
the well known scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, and $F$ in the other
two classes grows sub-exponentially with $K$ by sacrificing more $R$. It is
worth noting that a tradeoff between $R$ and $F$, which is a hot topic in the

learning infeasible due to their need on prior of test distribution. Therefore,
how to address the agnostic selection bias for robust model learning is of
paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. In this
paper, under the assumption that causal relationships among variables are
robust across domains, we incorporate causal technique into predictive modeling
and propose a novel Causally Regularized Logistic Regression (CRLR) algorithm
by jointly optimize global confounder balancing and weighted logistic
regression. Global confounder balancing helps to identify causal features,
whose causal effect on outcome are stable across domains, then performing
logistic regression on those causal features constructs a robust predictive
model against the agnostic bias. To validate the effectiveness of our CRLR

$N$-body simulations of two isolated Milky Way-like galaxy models. The models
differ by their disc-to-halo mass ratios, and hence by their susceptibility to
the formation of a bar and spiral structure. Seeded from shot noise in the
particle distribution, bending waves rapidly form in both models and persist
for many billions of years. Waves at intermediate radii manifest as corrugated
structures in vertical position and velocity that are tightly wound,
morphologically leading, and dominated by the $m=1$ azimuthal Fourier
component. A spectral analysis of the waves suggests they are a superposition
of modes from two continuous branches in the Galactocentric radius-rotational
frequency plane. The lower-frequency branch is dominant and is responsible for
the corrugated, leading, and warped structure. Over time, power in this branch
migrates outward, lending credence to an inside-out formation scenario for the
warp. Our power spectra qualitatively agree with results from linear
perturbation theory and a WKB analysis, both of which include self-gravity.
Thus, we conclude that the waves in our simulations are self-gravitating and
not purely kinematic. These waves are reminiscent of the wave-like pattern
recently found in Galactic star counts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
smoothly transition to a warp near the disc's edge. Velocity measurements from
\textit{Gaia} data will be instrumental in testing the true wave nature of the
corrugations. We also compile a list of ""minimum requirements"" needed to
observe bending waves in external galaxies.

that whenever a statement $\varphi(a)$ in the first-order language of set

proper inner model $W\subsetneq V$. A stronger principle, the ground-model
reflection principle, asserts that any such $\varphi(a)$ true in $V$ is also
true in some non-trivial ground model of the universe with respect to set
forcing. These principles each express a form of width reflection in contrast
to the usual height reflection of the L\'evy-Montague reflection theorem. They
are each equiconsistent with ZFC and indeed $\Pi_2$-conservative over ZFC,
being forceable by class forcing while preserving any desired rank-initial
segment of the universe. Furthermore, the inner-model reflection principle is a
consequence of the existence of sufficient large cardinals, and lightface
formulations of the reflection principles follow from the maximality principle
MP and from the inner-model hypothesis IMH. We also consider some questions
concerning the expressibility of the principles.

the hypergraph of critical pairs, so that the dimension of $P$ is exactly equal
to the chromatic number of $H$. The edges of $H$ have variable sizes, but it is
of interest to consider the graph $G$ formed by the edges of $H$ that have
size~2. The chromatic number of $G$ is less than or equal to the dimension of
$P$ and the difference between the two values can be arbitrarily large.
Nevertheless, there are important instances where the two parameters are the
same, and we study one of these in this paper. Our focus is on a family
$\{S_n^k:n\ge 3, k\ge 0\}$ of height two posets called crowns. We show that the
chromatic number of the graph $G_n^k$ of critical pairs of the crown $S_n^k$ is

the stronger result: The independence number of $G_n^k$ is $(k+1)(k+2)/2$. We
obtain this theorem as part of a comprehensive analysis of independent sets in

disordered dipolar couplings. This setting is relevant for modeling the
decoherence dynamics of the rotational excitations of polar molecules confined
to deep optical lattices, where disorder arises from the random filling of
lattice sites with occupation probability $p$. We show that the decoherence
dynamics exhibits a phase transition at a critical filling $p_c\simeq 0.15$.
For $p<p_c$ the dynamics is disorder-dominated and the Ramsey interference
signal decays on a timescale $T_2 \propto p^{-3/2}$. For $p>p_c$ the dipolar
interactions dominate the disorder, and the system behaves as a collective
spin-ordered phase, representing synchronization of the two-level systems and
persistent Ramsey oscillations with divergent $T_2$ for large systems. For a
finite number of two-level systems, $N$, the spin-ordered phase at $p> p_c$
undergoes a crossover to a collective spin-squeezed state on a timescale
$\tau_{\rm sq} \propto \sqrt{N}$. We develop a self-consistent mean-field
theory that is capable of capturing the synchronization transition at $p_c$,
and provide an intuitive theoretical picture that describes the phase
transition in the long-time dynamics. We also show that the decoherence
dynamics appear to be ergodic in the vicinity of $p_c$, the long-time behaviour
being well described by the predictions of equilibrium thermodynamics. The
results are supported by the results of exact diagonalization studies of small

the Thomas-Fermi approximation and a scalar field solution of the Klein-Gordon
equation. We also used the zero disk approximation galaxy model where
photometric data is not considered, only the scalar field dark matter model
contribution to rotation curve is taken into account. From the best-fitting
analysis of the galaxy catalog we use, we found the range of values of the
fitting parameters: the length scale and the central density. The worst fitting
results (values of $\chi^2_{red}$ much greater than 1, on the average) were for
the Thomas-Fermi models, i.e., the scalar field dark matter is better than the
Thomas-Fermi approximation model to fit the rotation curves of the analysed
galaxies. To complete our analysis we compute from the fitting parameters the
mass of the scalar field models and two astrophysical quantities of interest,
the dynamical dark matter mass within 300 pc and the characteristic central
surface density of the dark matter models. We found that the value of the
central mass within 300 pc is in agreement with previous reported results, that
this mass is $\approx 10^{7}$ $M_\odot/$pc$^2$, independent of the dark matter
model. And, on the contrary, the value of the characteristic central surface

derivation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation from the path integral for quantum
general relativity by way of boundary variations. One feature of this approach
is that it does not require an explicit 3+1 splitting of spacetime in the bulk.
For spacetimes with a spatial boundary, we show that the dependence of the
transition amplitudes on spatial boundary conditions is determined by a
Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the spatial boundary surface. We find that
variations in the induced metric at the spatial boundary can be used to
describe time evolution---time evolution in quantum general relativity is
therefore governed by boundary conditions on the gravitational field at the
spatial boundary. We then briefly describe a formalism for computing the
dependence of transition amplitudes on spatial boundary conditions. Finally, we
argue that for nonsmooth boundaries, meaningful transition amplitudes must
depend on boundary conditions at the joint surfaces.

cluster RXC J1053.7+5453 ($z=0.0704$), which contains a radio relic. The radio
relic is located at the distance of $\sim 540$ kpc from the X-ray peak toward
the west. We measured the temperature of this cluster for the first time. The
resultant temperature in the center is $ \sim 1.3$ keV, which is lower than the
value expected from the X-ray luminosity - temperature and the velocity
dispersion - temperature relation. Though we did not find a significant
temperature jump at the outer edge of the relic, our results suggest that the
temperature decreases outward across the relic. Assuming the existence of the
shock at the relic, its Mach number becomes $M \simeq 1.4 $. A possible spatial
variation of Mach number along the relic is suggested. Additionally, a sharp
surface brightness edge is found at the distance of $\sim 160$ kpc from the
X-ray peak toward the west in the Chandra image. We performed X-ray spectral
and surface brightness analyses around the edge with Suzaku and Chandra data,
respectively. The obtained surface brightness and temperature profiles suggest
that this edge is not a shock but likely a cold front. Alternatively, it cannot
be ruled out that thermal pressure is really discontinuous across the edge. In
this case, if the pressure across the surface brightness edge is in
equilibrium, other forms of pressure sources, such as cosmic-rays, are
necessary. We searched for the non-thermal inverse Compton component in the
relic region. Assuming the photon index $ \Gamma = 2.0$, the resultant upper
limit of the flux is $1.9 \times 10^{-14} {\rm erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2}}$ for
$4.50 \times 10^{-3} {\rm \ deg^{2}}$ area in the 0.3-10 keV band, which
implies that the lower limit of magnetic field strength becomes $ 0.7 {\rm \

evolution scenario in light of the recent LIGO/Virgo DNS detection (GW170817).
The observationally estimated Galactic DNS merger rate of $R_{\rm
MW}=21^{+28}_{-14}$ Myr$^{-1}$, based on 3 Galactic DNS systems, fully supports
our standard input physics model with $R_{\rm MW} =24$ Myr$^{-1}$. This
estimate for the Galaxy translates in a non-trivial way (due to cosmological
evolution of progenitor stars in chemically evolving Universe) into a local
($z\approx0$) DNS merger rate density of $R_{\rm local}=48$
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which {\em is not} consistent with the current LIGO/Virgo
DNS merger rate estimate ($1540^{+3200}_{-1220}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Within
our study of the parameter space we find solutions that allow for DNS merger
rates as high as $R_{\rm local} \approx 600^{+600}_{-300}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$
which are thus consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate. However, our
corresponding BH-BH merger rates for the models with high DNS merger rates
exceed the current LIGO/Virgo estimate of local BH-BH merger rate ($12$-$213$
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Apart from being particularly sensitive to the common
envelope treatment, DNS merger rates are rather robust against variations of
several of the key factors probed in our study (e.g. mass transfer, angular
momentum loss, natal kicks). This might suggest that either common envelope
development/survival works differently for DNS ($\sim$ 10-20 Msun stars) than
for BH-BH ($\sim$ 40-100 Msun stars) progenitors, or high BH natal kicks are
needed to meet observational constraints for both types of binaries. Note that
our conclusion is based on a limited number of (21) evolutionary models and is
valid only within this particular DNS and BH-BH isolated binary formation
scenario.

function (PDF) of quantities of interest (QoIs) of power grid systems subject
to uncertain power generation and load fluctuations. In our approach,
generation and load fluctuations are modeled by means of autocorrelated-in-time
random processes, which are approximated in terms of a finite set of random
parameters by means of Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve approximations. The map from random
parameters to QoIs is approximated by means of Hermite polynomial expansions.
We propose a new approach based on compressive sensing to estimate the
coefficients in the Hermite expansions from a small number of realizations
(sampling points). Linear transforms identified by iterative rotations are
introduced to improve the sparsity of the Hermite representations, exploiting
the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the map. As such, the proposed
approach significantly reduces the required number of sampling points to
achieve a given accuracy compared to the standard least squares method. The
proposed approach is employed to estimate the PDF of relative angular
velocities and bus voltages of systems of classical machines driven by
autocorrelated random generation. More accurate PDF estimates, as measured by
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are achieved using fewer realizations than
required by basic Monte Carlo sampling.

savings with respect to the communication cost incurred in data shuffling. This

lower speed as compared to intra-rack data transfer, we present a scheme termed

inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN). We derive a lower bound on
the mutual information of a system using adaptive equalization, showing that
the channel estimation error determines the equalizer's performance. We develop
an adaptive equalization scheme which uses the statistics of the NLIN to obtain
optimal detection, based on Kalman filtering and maximum likelihood sequence
estimation (MLSE). This scheme outperforms commonly used equalizers and
significantly increases performance.
