representation for spacetime image analysis. It is designed to combine the
benefits of the multilayer architecture of ConvNets and a more controlled
approach to spacetime analysis. A distinguishing aspect of the approach is that
unlike most contemporary convolutional networks no learning is involved;
rather, all design decisions are specified analytically with theoretical
motivations. This approach makes it possible to understand what information is
being extracted at each stage and layer of processing as well as to minimize
heuristic choices in design. Another key aspect of the network is its recurrent
nature, whereby the output of each layer of processing feeds back to the input.
To keep the network size manageable across layers, a novel cross-channel
feature pooling is proposed. The multilayer architecture that results
systematically reveals hierarchical image structure in terms of multiscale,
multiorientation properties of visual spacetime. To illustrate its utility, the
network has been applied to the task of dynamic texture recognition. Empirical
evaluation on multiple standard datasets shows that it sets a new
state-of-the-art.

measured by two-step time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy.
Oscillator strengths of 57 lines from these highly excited upper levels were
derived using a hollow cathode discharge lamp and a Fourier transform
spectrometer. In addition, Hartree--Fock calculations where both the main
relativistic and core-polarisation effects were taken into account were carried
out for both low- and high-excitation levels. There is a good agreement for
most of the lines between our calculated branching fractions and the
measurements of Lawler and Dakin (1989) in the region 9000-45000 cm$^{-1}$ for
low excitation levels and with our measurements for high excitation levels in
the region 23500-63100 cm$^{-1}$. This, in turn, allowed us to combine the
calculated branching fractions with the available experimental lifetimes to
determine semi-empirical oscillator strengths for a set of 380 E1 transitions
in \ion{Sc}{ii}. These oscillator strengths include the weak lines that were
used previously to derive the solar abundance of scandium. The solar abundance
of scandium is now estimated to $\log~\epsilon_\odot = 3.04\pm0.13$ using these
semi-empirical oscillator strengths to shift the values determined by Scott et

ability to prevent abuse is constrained by the security practices of their own

operate under restricted privileges and providers retain more control over
configurations. We present the first empirical analysis of the distribution of
web security features and software patching practices in shared hosting
providers, the influence of providers on these security practices, and their
impact on web compromise rates. We construct provider-level features on the
global market for shared hosting -- containing 1,259 providers -- by gathering
indicators from 442,684 domains. Exploratory factor analysis of 15 indicators
identifies four main latent factors that capture security efforts: content
security, webmaster security, web infrastructure security and web application
security. We confirm, via a fixed-effect regression model, that providers exert
significant influence over the latter two factors, which are both related to
the software stack in their hosting environment. Finally, by means of GLM
regression analysis of these factors on phishing and malware abuse, we show
that the four security and software patching factors explain between 10\% and
19\% of the variance in abuse at providers, after controlling for size. For
web-application security for instance, we found that when a provider moves from
the bottom 10\% to the best-performing 10\%, it would experience 4 times fewer
phishing incidents. We show that providers have influence over patch
levels--even higher in the stack, where CMSes can run as client-side
software--and that this influence is tied to a substantial reduction in abuse
levels.

constraint solves this problem. We show that this is not the case and that
geometric information is an ambiguous cue. There are two sources for this
ambiguity. The first is that, within the space of 3D face shapes, there are
flexibility modes that remain when some parts of the face are fixed. The second
occurs only under perspective projection and is a result of perspective
transformation as camera distance varies. Two different faces, when viewed at
different distances, can give rise to the same 2D geometry. To demonstrate
these ambiguities, we develop new algorithms for fitting a 3D morphable model

2$, with i.i.d.\ random charges attached to its constituent monomers. Each
self-intersection of the polymer chain contributes an energy to the interaction
Hamiltonian that is equal to the product of the charges of the two monomers
that meet. The joint probability distribution for the polymer chain and the
charges is given by the Gibbs distribution associated with the interaction
Hamiltonian. The object of interest is the \emph{annealed free energy} per
monomer in the limit as the length $n$ of the polymer chain tends to infinity.
We show that there is a critical curve in the parameter plane spanned by the
charge bias and the inverse temperature separating an \emph{extended phase}
from a \emph{collapsed phase}. We derive the scaling of the critical curve for
small and for large charge bias and the scaling of the annealed free energy for
small inverse temperature, which are both anomalous. We show that in a subset
of the collapsed phase the polymer chain is \emph{subdiffusive}, namely, on
scale $(n/\log n)^{1/(d+2)}$ it moves like a Brownian motion conditioned to
stay inside a ball with a deterministic radius and a randomly shifted center.
We expect this scaling to hold throughout the collapsed phase. We further
expect that in the extended phase the polymer chain scales like a weakly
self-avoiding walk. Proofs are based on a detailed analysis for simple random
walk of the downward large deviations of the self-intersection local time and
the upward large deviations of the range. Part of our scaling results are
rough, and we formulate conjectures under which they can be sharpened. The
existence of the free energy remains an open problem, which we are able to
settle in a subset of the collapsed phase for a subclass of charge
distributions.

to an empirically-estimated background distribution, yielding a false alarm
probability or p-value. The reliability of this background estimate is limited
by the number of background samples and by the fact that GW detectors cannot be
shielded from signals, making it impossible to identify a pure background data
set. Different strategies have been proposed: in one method, all samples,
including potential signals, are included in the background estimation, whereas
in another method, coincidence removal is performed in order to exclude
possible signals from the estimated background. Here we report on a mock data
challenge, performed prior to the first detections of GW signals by Advanced
LIGO, to compare these two methods. The all-samples method is found to be
self-consistent in terms of the rate of false positive detection claims, but
its p-value estimates are systematically conservative and subject to higher
variance. Conversely, the coincidence-removal method yields a mean-unbiased

quantitative account of actual causation that is generally applicable to
discrete dynamical systems. We present a formal framework to evaluate these
causal requirements that is based on system interventions and partitions, and
considers all counterfactuals of a state transition. This framework is used to
provide a complete causal account of the transition by identifying and
quantifying the strength of all actual causes and effects linking the two
consecutive system states. Finally, we examine several exemplary cases and
paradoxes of causation and show that they can be illuminated by the proposed

targets for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave triggers, which
holds enormous promise of rich science. However, hunting for electromagnetic
counterparts of gravitational wave events is a non-trivial task due to the
sheer size of the error regions, which could span hundreds of square degrees.
The Zwicky Transient facility (ZTF), scheduled to begin operation in 2017, is
designed to cover such large sky-localization areas. In this work, we present
the strategies of efficiently tiling the sky to facilitate the observation of
the gravitational wave error regions using ZTF. To do this we used simulations
consisting of 475 binary neutron star coalescences detected using a mix of two-
and three-detector networks. Our studies reveal that, using two overlapping
sets of ZTF tiles and a (modified) ranked-tiling algorithm, we can cover the
gravitational-wave sky-localization regions with half as many pointings as a
simple contour-covering algorithm. We then incorporated the ranked-tiling
strategy to study our ability to observe the counterparts. This requires
optimization of observation depth and localization area coverage. Our results
show that observation in r-band with ~600 seconds of integration time per
pointing seems to be optimum for typical assumed brightnesses of
electromagnetic counterparts, if we plan to spend equal amount of time per

quantity but more with the quality and completeness of the data. In many
disciplines, data are collected from heterogeneous sources, resulting in
multi-view or multi-modal datasets. The missing data problem has been
challenging to address in multi-view data analysis. Especially, when certain
samples miss an entire view of data, it creates the missing view problem.
Classic multiple imputations or matrix completion methods are hardly effective
here when no information can be based on in the specific view to impute data
for such samples. The commonly-used simple method of removing samples with a
missing view can dramatically reduce sample size, thus diminishing the
statistical power of a subsequent analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for view imputation via generative adversarial networks (GANs), which
we name by VIGAN. This approach first treats each view as a separate domain and
identifies domain-to-domain mappings via a GAN using randomly-sampled data from
each view, and then employs a multi-modal denoising autoencoder (DAE) to
reconstruct the missing view from the GAN outputs based on paired data across
the views. Then, by optimizing the GAN and DAE jointly, our model enables the
knowledge integration for domain mappings and view correspondences to
effectively recover the missing view. Empirical results on benchmark datasets
validate the VIGAN approach by comparing against the state of the art. The
evaluation of VIGAN in a genetic study of substance use disorders further
proves the effectiveness and usability of this approach in life science.

schemes are widely used to filter environmental noise from signals, but their
performance is limited by the spectral properties of the signal and noise at

complementary technique without the same limitations. To date, however, they
have failed to correct the dominant noise type in many quantum sensors, which
couples to each qubit in a sensor in the same way as the signal. Here we show
how quantum error correction can correct for such noise, which dynamical

are typically computationally expensive to train, requiring weeks of
computation on many GPUs; as a result, many users outsource the training
procedure to the cloud or rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned
for a specific task. In this paper we show that outsourced training introduces
new security risks: an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a
backdoored neural network, or a \emph{BadNet}) that has state-of-the-art
performance on the user's training and validation samples, but behaves badly on
specific attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of BadNets in
a toy example, by creating a backdoored handwritten digit classifier. Next, we
demonstrate backdoors in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street
sign classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special
sticker is added to the stop sign; we then show in addition that the backdoor
in our US street sign detector can persist even if the network is later
retrained for another task and cause a drop in accuracy of {25}\% on average

artificial supervision signal based on counting visual primitives. This
supervision signal is obtained from an equivariance relation, which does not
require any manual annotation. We relate transformations of images to
transformations of the representations. More specifically, we look for the
representation that satisfies such relation rather than the transformations
that match a given representation. In this paper, we use two image
transformations in the context of counting: scaling and tiling. The first
transformation exploits the fact that the number of visual primitives should be
invariant to scale. The second transformation allows us to equate the total
number of visual primitives in each tile to that in the whole image. These two
transformations are combined in one constraint and used to train a neural
network with a contrastive loss. The proposed task produces representations
that perform on par or exceed the state of the art in transfer learning
benchmarks.

source separation task. Most dictionary-based source separation algorithms rely
on iterative update rules during the run time, which becomes computationally
costly especially when we employ an overcomplete dictionary and sparse encoding
that tend to give better separation results. To avoid such cost we propose a
bitwise scheme on hashed spectra that leads to an efficient posterior
probability calculation. For each source, the algorithm uses a partial rank
order metric to extract robust features that form a binarized dictionary of
hashed spectra. Then, for a mixture spectrum, its hash code is compared with
each source's hashed dictionary in one pass. This simple voting-based
dictionary search allows a fast and iteration-free estimation of ratio masking
at each bin of a signal spectrogram. We verify that the proposed BitWise Source
Separation (BWSS) algorithm produces sensible source separation results for the
single-channel speech denoising task, with 6-8 dB mean SDR. To our knowledge,
this is the first dictionary based algorithm for this task that is completely

many-body state and to realize new phases which are not accessible in static
systems. For example, exposing materials to intense laser pulses enables to
provoke metal-insulator transitions, control the magnetic order and induce
transient superconducting behaviour well above the static transition
temperature. However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often
difficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body
dynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been
performed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,
theoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and
new theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations. Here,
we perform an experimental quantum simulation in a periodically modulated
hexagonal lattice and show that anti-ferromagnetic correlations in a fermionic
many-body system can be reduced or enhanced or even switched to ferromagnetic
correlations. We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the
description of the many-body system by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a
renormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing the results to
measurements in an equivalent static lattice. For near-resonant driving, the
enhancement and sign reversal of correlations is explained by a microscopic
model, in which the particle tunnelling and magnetic exchange energies can be
controlled independently. In combination with the observed sufficiently long
lifetime of correlations, Floquet engineering thus constitutes an alternative
route to experimentally investigate unconventional pairing in strongly
correlated systems.

transition of a quantum anomalous Hall system has been proposed as a venue to
realize a topological superconductor (TSC) with chiral Majorana edge modes
(CMEMs). A recent experiment [Science 357, 294 (2017)] claimed to have observed
such CMEMs in the form of a half-integer quantized conductance plateau in the
two-terminal transport measurement of a quantum anomalous Hall-superconductor
junction. Although the presence of a superconducting proximity effect
generically splits the quantum Hall transition into two phase transitions with
a gapped TSC in between, in this Rapid Communication we propose that a nearly
flat conductance plateau, similar to that expected from CMEMs, can also arise
from the percolation of quantum Hall edges well before the onset of the TSC or
at temperatures much above the TSC gap. Our Rapid Communication, therefore,
suggests that, in order to confirm the TSC, it is necessary to supplement the
observation of the half-quantized conductance plateau with a hard
superconducting gap (which is unlikely for a disordered system) from the
conductance measurements or the heat transport measurement of the transport
gap. Alternatively, the half-quantized thermal conductance would also serve as
a smoking-gun signature of the TSC.

important step towards sampling from the joint posterior probability function
of these quantities, which, assuming Gaussianity of the CMB fields and lensing
potential, contains all available cosmological information and would yield
theoretically optimal constraints. Attaining such optimal constraints will be
crucial for next-generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4, where limits on $r$ could
be improved by factors of a few over currently used sub-optimal quadratic
estimators. The maximization procedure described here depends on a newly
developed lensing algorithm, which we term \textsc{LenseFlow}, and which lenses
a map by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This description
has conceptual advantages, such as allowing us to give a simple
non-perturbative proof that the lensing determinant is equal to unity in the
weak-lensing regime. The algorithm itself maintains this property even on
pixelized maps, which is crucial for our purposes and unique to
\textsc{LenseFlow} as compared to other lensing algorithms we have tested. It
also has other useful properties such as that it can be trivially inverted
(i.e. delensing) for the same computational cost as the forward operation, and
can be used to compute lensing adjoint, Jacobian, and Hessian operators. We
test and validate the maximization procedure on flat-sky simulations covering
up to 600\,deg$^2$ with non-uniform noise and masking.

bars, and study the dependence of the occurrence of bars as a function of
surface brightness, we use the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset to construct a large
volume-limited sample of galaxies, and segregate the galaxies as low and high
surface brightness in terms of their central surface brightness. We find that
the fraction of low surface brightness galaxies hosting strong bars is
systematically lower than the one found for high surface brightness galaxies.
The dependence of the bar fraction on the central surface brightness is mostly
driven by a correlation of the surface brightness with the spin and the
gas-richness of the galaxies, showing only a minor dependence on the surface
brightness. We also find that the length of the bars shows a strong dependence
on the surface brightness, and although some of this dependence is attributed
to the gas content, even at fixed gas-to-stellar mass ratio, high surface
brightness galaxies host longer bars than their low surface brightness
counterparts, which we attribute to an anticorrelation of the surface
brightness with the spin.

their environment. Determining this entropy production requires detailed
information about the system's internal states and dynamics. However, in most
practical scenarios, only a part of a complex experimental system is accessible
to an external observer. In order to address this challenge, two notions of
partial entropy production have been introduced in the literature as a way to
assign an entropy production to an observed subsystem: one due to Shiraishi and
Sagawa [Phys. Rev. E 91, 012130 (2015)] and another due to Polettini and
Esposito [arXiv:1703.05715 (2017)]. We show that although both of these schemes
provide a lower bound on the total entropy production, the latter -- which
utilizes an effective thermodynamics description-- gives a better estimate of
the total dissipation. Using this effective thermodynamic framework, we
establish a partitioning of the total entropy production into two contributions
that individually verify integral fluctuation theorems: an observable partial
entropy production and a hidden entropy production assigned to the unobserved
subsystem. Our results offer broad implications for both theoretical and
empirical systems when only partial information is available.

a dynamic range of 4.2 pc to 28 au for a period of $3.5\times 10^5$ yr,
including magnetic fields and both radiative and outflow feedback from the
protostars. At the end of the simulation, the star formation efficiency is 4.3
per cent and the star formation rate per free fall time is $\epsilon_{\rm
ff}\simeq 0.04$, within the range of observed values (Krumholz et al. 2012a).
The total stellar mass increases as $\sim\,t^2$, whereas the number of
protostars increases as $\sim\,t^{1.5}$. We find that the density profile
around most of the simulated protostars is $\sim\,\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$, as
predicted by Murray & Chang (2015). At the end of the simulation, the
protostellar mass function approaches the Chabrier (2005) stellar initial mass
function. We infer that the time to form a star of median mass $0.2\,M_\odot$
is about $1.4\times 10^5$~yr from the median mass accretion rate. We find good
agreement among the protostellar luminosities observed in the large sample of
Dunham et al. (2013), our simulation, and a theoretical estimate, and conclude
that the classical protostellar luminosity problem Kenyon et al. (1990) is
resolved. The multiplicity of the stellar systems in the simulation agrees to
within a factor 2 of observations of Class I young stellar objects; most of the
simulated multiple systems are unbound. Bipolar protostellar outflows are
launched using a sub-grid model, and extend up to 1 pc from their host star.
The mass-velocity relation of the simulated outflows is consistent with both
observation and theory.

longer than previous to launch a timing attack. In this paper, we propose a

the photosphere, chromosphere and transition region partially ionized. Our
simulations reveal that the interactions between ionized particles and neutral
particles have important consequences for the magneto-thermodynamics of these
modeled layers: 1) ambipolar diffusion increases the temperature in the
chromosphere; 2) sporadically the horizontal magnetic field in the photosphere
is diffused into the chromosphere due to the large ambipolar diffusion; 3)
ambipolar diffusion concentrates electrical currents leading to more violent
jets and reconnection processes, resulting in 3a) the formation of longer and
faster spicules, 3b) heating of plasma during the spicule evolution, and 3c)
decoupling of the plasma and magnetic field in spicules. Our results indicate
that ambipolar diffusion is a critical ingredient for understanding the
magneto-thermo-dynamic properties in the chromosphere and transition region.
The numerical simulations have been made publicly available, similar to
previous Bifrost simulations. This will allow the community to study realistic
numerical simulations with a wider range of magnetic field configurations and

partitioned into $k$ ""clusters,"" and edges between vertices in the same cluster
and different clusters are included with constant probability $p$ and $q$,
respectively (where $0 \le q < p \le 1$). We give an efficient spectral
algorithm that recovers the clusters with high probability, provided that the
sizes of any two clusters are either very close or separated by $\geq
\Omega(\sqrt n)$. We also discuss a generalization of planted partition in
which the algorithm's input is not a random graph, but a random real symmetric
matrix with independent above-diagonal entries.
  Our algorithm is an adaptation of a previous algorithm for the uniform case,
i.e., when all clusters are size $n / k \geq \Omega(\sqrt n)$. The original
algorithm recovers the clusters one by one via iterated projection: it
constructs the orthogonal projection operator onto the dominant $k$-dimensional
eigenspace of the random graph's adjacency matrix, uses it to recover one of
the clusters, then deletes it and recurses on the remaining vertices. We show
herein that a similar algorithm works in the nonuniform case.

we show that the coupling of a quantum system to the standard model of a
thermal environment, a bath of harmonic oscillators, can be decomposed into a
""cascade"" made up of the quasi-continuum coupling structures of Fermi's golden
rule. This clarifies the connection between the physics of the golden rule and
that of a thermal bath, and provides a non-rigorous but physically intuitive
derivation of the Markovian master equation directly from the former. The exact
solution to the Hamiltonian of the golden rule, known as the Bixon-Jortner
model, generalized for an asymmetric spectrum, provides a window on how the
evolution induced by the bath deviates from the master equation as one moves
outside the Markovian regime. Our analysis also reveals the relationship
between the oscillator bath and the ""random matrix model"" (RMT) of a thermal
bath. We show that the cascade structure is the one essential difference
between the two models, and the lack of it prevents the RMT from generating
transition rates that are independent of the initial state of the system. We
suggest that the cascade structure is one of the generic elements of

method of maximal unitarity cuts. For the simpler generalized cuts, whose
corresponding contact terms tend to be the most complicated, we derive a set of
formulas relating the contact contributions to the violations of the dual
Jacobi identities in the relevant gauge-theory amplitudes. For more complex
generalized unitarity cuts, which tend to have simpler contact terms associated
with them, we use the method of maximal cuts more directly. The five-loop
four-point integrand is a crucial ingredient towards future studies of
ultraviolet properties of N=8 supergravity at five loops and beyond. We also
present a nontrivial check of the consistency of the integrand, based on modern
approaches for integrating over the loop momenta in the ultraviolet region.

metrics to assess the quality of community structure in a complex network.
However the resolution limit problem associated with modularity limits its
applicability to networks with community sizes smaller than a certain scale. In
the past various attempts have been made to solve this problem. More recently a
new metric, modularity density, was introduced for the quality of community
structure in networks in order to solve some of the known problems with
modularity, particularly the resolution limit problem. Modularity density
resolves some communities which are otherwise undetectable using modularity.
However, we find that it does not solve the resolution limit problem completely
by investigating some cases where it fails to detect expected community
structures. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of this metric and
show that it further reduces the resolution limit problem, effectively
eliminating the problem in a wide range of networks.

are thought to be ubiquitous in the ISM, but it is difficult to study them in

problem in this research field. In this challenge, we propose a model-based
vehicle localization method, which builds a kernel at each patch of the 3D
deformable vehicle model and associates them with constraints in 3D space. The
proposed method utilizes shape fitness evaluation besides color information to
track vehicle objects robustly and efficiently. To build 3D car models in a
fully unsupervised manner, we also implement evolutionary camera
self-calibration from tracking of walking humans to automatically compute
camera parameters. Additionally, the segmented foreground masks which are
crucial to 3D modeling and camera self-calibration are adaptively refined by
multiple-kernel feedback from tracking. For object detection/classification,
the state-of-the-art single shot multibox detector (SSD) is adopted to train
and test on the NVIDIA AI City Dataset. To improve the accuracy on categories
with only few objects, like bus, bicycle and motorcycle, we also employ the
pretrained model from YOLO9000 with multi-scale testing. We combine the results
from SSD and YOLO9000 based on ensemble learning. Experiments show that our
proposed tracking system outperforms both state-of-the-art of tracking by
segmentation and tracking by detection.

computational cost of deep neural networks (DNNs) via \emph{anytime}

losses jointly in an \emph{adaptive} weighted sum, where the weights are
inversely proportional to average of each loss. Intuitively, this balances the
losses to have the same scale. We demonstrate theoretical considerations that
motivate this approach from multiple viewpoints, including connecting it to
optimizing the geometric mean of the expectation of each loss, an objective
that ignores the scale of losses. Experimentally, the adaptive weights induce
more competitive anytime predictions on multiple recognition data-sets and
models than non-adaptive approaches including weighing all losses equally. In
particular, anytime neural networks (ANNs) can achieve the same accuracy faster
using adaptive weights on a small network than using static constant weights on

sequence of exponentially deepening ANNscan achieve near-optimal anytime
results at any budget, at the cost of a const fraction of extra computation.

case of a truncated partial wave set, another invariance exists, originating
from the replacement of the roots of partial wave amplitudes with their complex
conjugate values. This discrete ambiguity is also known as the
Omelaenko-Gersten-type ambiguity. In this paper, we show that for scalar
particles, discrete ambiguities are just a subset of continuum ambiguities with
a specific phase and thus mix partial waves, as the continuum ambiguity does.

partially avoided within a population, there may be an overall enhancement of
cooperation. One example of such screening mechanism occurs in the presence of
risk-averse agents (loners, L) that are neutral towards others, i.e., both L
and its opponent, whatever its strategy, receive the same payoff. Their
presence in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game sustains the coexistence of
cooperators and defectors far beyond the level attained in their absence.
Another screening mechanism is a heterogeneous landscape obtained, for example,
by site diluting the lattice. In this case, cooperation is enhanced with some
fraction of such inactive, interaction-averse sites. By considering the
interplay of both mechanisms, we show that there is an explosive increase in
the range of densities, just above the percolation threshold, where neutrality
is prevented and loners become extinct, the behavior reverting to the pure PD
game. Interestingly, this occurs despite defectors being usually abundant in

based on the explicit bounds on the nonlinear terms that hold within the

scales linearly with the system size, and the general framework can naturally

or $> c$, speeds is proposed. The information is encoded as phase modulation of
an electromagnetic wave of constant intensity, i.e. fluctuations in the rate of
energy transport plays no role in the communication, and no energy is
transported at speed $>$ c. Of course, such a constant wave can ultimately last
only the duration of its enveloping wave packet. However, as a unique feature
of this paper, we assume the source is sufficiently steady to be capable of
emitting wave packets, or pulses, of size much larger than the separation
between sender and receiver. Therefore, if a pre-existing and enduring wave
envelope already connects the two sides, the subluminal nature of the
envelope's group velocity will no longer slow down the communication, which is
now limited by the speed at which information encoded as phase modulation
propagates through the plasma, i.e. the phase velocity $v_p > c$. The method
involves no sharp structure in either time or frequency. As a working example,
we considered two spaceships separated by 1 lt-s in the local hot bubble.
Provided the bandwidth of the extra Fourier modes generated by the phase
modulation is much smaller than the carrier wave frequency, the radio
communication of a message, encoded as a specific alignment between the carrier
wave phase and the anomalous (modulated) phase, can take place at a speed in
excess of light by a few parts in 10$^{11}$ at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz, and higher

predominantly LaO / TiO$_2$ interfacial junction in both cases. Ab initio
simulations suggest that the interfaces can be stabilized by trapping extra
oxygen (in LaO / TiO$_2$) and forming oxygen vacancies (in FeO$_2$ / SrO),
which points to different growth kinetics in each case and may explain the
apparent disappearance of the FeO$_2$ / SrO interface. We conclude that
judicious control of deposition timescales can be used to modify growth

SAMI Galaxy Survey. Our sample consists of 1319 galaxies spanning four orders
of magnitude in stellar mass and includes all morphologies and environments. We
derive luminosity-weighted, single stellar population equivalent stellar ages,
metallicities and alpha enhancements from spectra integrated within one
effective radius apertures. Variations in galaxy size explain the majority of
the scatter in the age--mass and metallicity--mass relations. Stellar
populations vary systematically in the plane of galaxy size and stellar mass,
such that galaxies with high stellar surface mass density are older, more
metal-rich and alpha-enhanced than less dense galaxies. Galaxies with high
surface mass densities have a very narrow range of metallicities, however, at
fixed mass, the spread in metallicity increases substantially with increasing
galaxy size (decreasing density). We identify residual correlations with
morphology and environment. At fixed mass and size, galaxies with late-type
morphologies, small bulges and low Sersic n are younger than early-type, high
n, high bulge-to-total galaxies. Age and metallicity both show small residual
correlations with environment; at fixed mass and size, galaxies in denser
environments or more massive halos are older and somewhat more metal rich than
those in less dense environments. We connect these trends to evolutionary
tracks within the size--mass plane.

dynamical systems analysis and data-driven model discovery. However, its
application has been hindered by the computational complexity of extended
dynamic mode decomposition; this requires a combinatorially large basis set to
adequately describe many nonlinear systems of interest, e.g. cyber-physical
infrastructure systems, biological networks, social systems, and fluid
dynamics. Often the dictionaries generated for these problems are manually
curated, requiring domain-specific knowledge and painstaking tuning. In this
paper we introduce a deep learning framework for learning Koopman operators of
nonlinear dynamical systems. We show that this novel method automatically
selects efficient deep dictionaries, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
benchmark this method on partially observed nonlinear systems, including the
glycolytic oscillator and show it is able to predict quantitatively 100 steps
into the future, using only a single timepoint, and qualitative oscillatory
behavior 400 steps into the future.

Moreover, differing from non-negative gain functions in traditional SA

tremendous amount of information about that galaxy's physical properties and
assembly history. However, present methods for extracting information from
chemical distributions are based either on coarse averages measured over
galactic scales (e.g., metallicity gradients) or on searching for clusters in
chemical space that can be identified with individual star clusters or gas
clouds on $\sim 1$ pc scales. These approaches discard most of the information,
because in galaxies gas and young stars are observed to be distributed
fractally, with correlations on all scales, and the same is likely to be true
of metals. In this paper we introduce a first theoretical model, based on
stochastically-forced diffusion, capable of predicting the multi-scale
statistics of metal fields. We derive the variance, correlation function, and
power spectrum of the metal distribution from first principles, and determine
how these quantities depend on elements' astrophysical origin sites and on the
large-scale properties of galaxies. Among other results, we explain for the
first time why the typical abundance scatter observed in the interstellar media
of nearby galaxies is $\approx 0.1$ dex, and we predict that this scatter will
be correlated on spatial scales of $\sim 0.5-1$ kpc, and over time scales of
$\sim 100-300$ Myr. We discuss the implications of our results for future
chemical tagging studies.

graph. A $(u,v)$-trail is a $(u,v)$-walk that is allowed to have repeated
vertices but no repeated edges. We call a trail odd if the number of edges in
the trail is odd. Let $\nu(u,v)$ denote the maximum number of edge-disjoint odd
$(u,v)$-trails, and $\tau(u,v)$ denote the minimum size of an edge-set that
intersects every odd $(u,v)$-trail.
  We prove that $\tau(u,v)\leq 2\nu(u,v)+1$. Our result is tight---there are
examples showing that $\tau(u,v)=2\nu(u,v)+1$---and substantially improves upon
the bound of $8$ obtained in [Churchley et al 2016] for $\tau(u,v)/\nu(u,v)$.
Our proof also yields a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a cover and a
collection of trails satisfying the above bounds.
  Our proof is simple and has two main ingredients. We show that (loosely
speaking) the problem can be reduced to the problem of packing and covering odd
$(uv,uv)$-trails losing a factor of 2 (either in the number of trails found, or
the size of the cover). Complementing this, we show that the
odd-$(uv,uv)$-trail packing and covering problems can be tackled by exploiting
a powerful min-max result of [Chudnovsky et al 2006] for packing
vertex-disjoint nonzero $A$-paths in group-labeled graphs.

Existing video player interfaces, however, only provide indirect manipulation
to support this emerging behavior. Video summarization alleviates this issue to
some extent, shortening a video based on the desired length of a summary as an
input variable. But an optimal length of a summarized video is often not
available in advance. Moreover, the user cannot edit the summary once it is
produced, limiting its practical applications. We argue that video
summarization should be an interactive, mixed-initiative process in which users
have control over the summarization procedure while algorithms help users
achieve their goal via video understanding. In this paper, we introduce
ElasticPlay, a mixed-initiative approach that combines an advanced video
summarization technique with direct interface manipulation to help users
control the video summarization process. Users can specify a time budget for
the remaining content while watching a video; our system then immediately
updates the playback plan using our proposed cut-and-forward algorithm,
determining which parts to skip or to fast-forward. This interactive process
allows users to fine-tune the summarization result with immediate feedback. We
show that our system outperforms existing video summarization techniques on the
TVSum50 dataset. We also report two lab studies (22 participants) and a
Mechanical Turk deployment study (60 participants), and show that the

electric vehicles (IWM-EV) is proposed to reduce the energy consumption and
increase the driving range by considering the unpredictable nature of the
driving power demand. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach, policy
iteration algorithm, is used to create an infinite horizon problem formulation
to calculate optimal power distribution policies for the vehicle. The developed
SDP strategy distributes the demanded power, between the front and rear IWMs by
considering states of the vehicle, including the vehicle speed and the front
and the rear wheels' slip ratios. In addition, a skid avoidance rule is added
to the power management strategy to maintain the wheels' slip ratios within the
desired values. Undesirable slip ratios cause poor brake and traction control
performances and therefore should be avoided. The resulting strategy consists
of a time- invariant, rule-based controller which is fast enough for real-time
implementations, and additionally, it is not expensive to be launched since the
future power demand is approximated without a need to vehicle communication
systems or telemetric capability. A high-fidelity model of an IWM-EV is
developed in the Autonomie/Simulink environment for evaluating the proposed
strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed SDP strategy is more
efficient in comparison to some benchmark strategies, such as an equal power
distribution (ED) and generalized rule- based dynamic programming (GRDP). The
simulation results of different driving scenarios for the considered IWM-EV
shows the proposed power management strategy leads to considerable energy
consumption reduction in average, at no additional cost.

of well-behaved solutions. The first branch is defined for arbitrary values of
the Skyrme coupling and therefore also leads to a gravitating soliton in the
Non-linear Sigma Model, while the second branch exists only for non-vanishing
Skyrme coupling. The solutions are quasi-static and in the first branch are
characterized by two integration constants that correspond to the frequency of
the phase of the Skyrme field and the value of the Skyrme profile at the
origin, while in the second branch the latter is the unique parameter
characterizing the solutions. These parameters determine the size of the
cavity, the redshift at the boundary of the cavity, the energy of the scalar
field and the charge associated to a U(1) global symmetry. We also show that
within this ansatz, assuming analyticity of the matter fields, there are no
spherically symmetric black hole solutions.

graph analytics processing systems. The Subgraph Isomorphism Graph Challenge is
a holistic specification with multiple integrated kernels that can be run
together or independently. Each kernel is well defined mathematically and can
be implemented in any programming environment. Subgraph isomorphism is amenable
to both vertex-centric implementations and array-based implementations (e.g.,
using the GraphBLAS.org standard). The computations are simple enough that
performance predictions can be made based on simple computing hardware models.
The surrounding kernels provide the context for each kernel that allows
rigorous definition of both the input and the output for each kernel.
Furthermore, since the proposed graph challenge is scalable in both problem
size and hardware, it can be used to measure and quantitatively compare a wide
range of present day and future systems. Serial implementations in C++, Python,

coasts on large-scale atmospheric conditions is weaker than over the open ocean
or inland areas. This is due to the fact that in coastal regions convection is
often supported by meso-scale land-sea interactions and the topography of
coastal areas. As these effects are not resolved and not included in standard
cumulus parametrization schemes, coastal convection is among the most poorly
simulated phenomena in global models. To outline a possible parametrization
framework for coastal convection we develop an idealized modeling approach and
test its ability to capture the main characteristics of coastal convection. The
new approach first develops a decision algorithm, or trigger function, for the
existence of coastal convection. The function is then applied in a stochastic
cloud model to increase the occurrence probability of deep convection when
land-sea interactions are diagnosed to be important. The results suggest that
the combination of the trigger function with a stochastic model is able to
capture the occurrence of deep convection in atmospheric conditions often found
for coastal convection. When coastal effects are deemed to be present the
spatial and temporal organization of clouds that has been documented form
observations is well captured by the model. The presented modeling approach has
therefore potential to improve the representation of clouds and convection in
global numerical weather forecasting and climate models.

prohibits the gap opening at/on specific points or line in momentum space,
giving rise to topological semimetals. Despite many theoretical predictions of

to be in the range of 4.2 and 5.7. (ii) Due to the contribution of $SS\to AA$

125 GeV Higgs can be sizably suppressed. However, the $SS\to AA$ channel can
not solve the tension between the relic density and the signal data of 125 GeV

$0.8<f^n/f^p<1$, and $y_d/y_u>-0.82$. (iv) The Fermi-LAT limits exclude most of

$f^n/f^p\sim -0.7$.

the resource usage of user applications. These logs, once fully analyzed and
correlated, can produce detailed information about the system health, root

providing valuable insights to domain scientists and system administrators.
However, processing HPC logs requires a deep understanding of hardware and

data is unstructured and voluminous, making it more difficult for system users
and administrators to manually inspect the data. With rapid increases in the
scale and complexity of HPC systems, log data processing is becoming a big data
challenge. This paper introduces a HPC log data analytics framework that is
based on a distributed NoSQL database technology, which provides scalability

range of information about the system so that system administrators and end

research topic due to its great benefits for various applications, whose
purpose is to reconstruct the missing histories of information diffusion traces
according to incomplete observations. The existing methods, however, often
focus only on single information diffusion trace, while in a real-world social
network, there often coexist multiple information diffusions over the same
network. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Collaborative
Inference Model (CIM) for the problem of the inference of coexisting
information diffusions. By exploiting the synergism between the coexisting
information diffusions, CIM holistically models multiple information diffusions
as a sparse 4th-order tensor called Coexisting Diffusions Tensor (CDT) without
any prior assumption of diffusion models, and collaboratively infers the
histories of the coexisting information diffusions via a low-rank approximation
of CDT with a fusion of heterogeneous constraints generated from additional
data sources. To improve the efficiency, we further propose an optimal
algorithm called Time Window based Parallel Decomposition Algorithm (TWPDA),
which can speed up the inference without compromise on the accuracy by
utilizing the temporal locality of information diffusions. The extensive
experiments conducted on real world datasets and synthetic datasets verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of CIM and TWPDA.

Taylor expansion around the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter, is
proposed and parameterized in terms of the empirical parameters. The present
knowledge of nuclear empirical parameters is first reviewed in order to
estimate their average values and associated uncertainties, and thus defining
the parameter space of the metamodeling. They are divided into isoscalar and
isovector type, and ordered according to their power in the density expansion.
The goodness of the metamodeling is analyzed against the predictions of the
original models. In addition, since no correlation among the empirical
parameters is assumed a priori, all arbitrary density dependences can be
explored, which might not be accessible in existing functionals. Spurious
correlations due to the assumed functional form are also removed. This meta-EOS
allows direct relations between the uncertainties on the empirical parameters
and the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state and its
derivatives, and the mapping between the two can be done with standard Bayesian
techniques. A sensitivity analysis shows that the more influential empirical
parameters are the isovector parameters $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$, and that
laboratory constraints at super-saturation densities are essential to reduce
the present uncertainties. The present metamodeling for the EOS for nuclear
matter is proposed for further applications in neutron stars and supernova
matter.

Using the Dirac Hamiltonian with the transfer matrix approach we obtain the
transmission probabilities and thus the respective conductance. In the presence
of the induced mass-term, the energy spectrum and the intra-cone transmission
drastically change while the inter-cone transmission remains zero. On the other
hand, the bias slightly alters the energy spectrum but it significantly affects
the transport properties due to its ability to switch on the inter-cone
transmission. In addition, we find that Klein tunneling is attenuated in the

such configurations. Our findings provide possible experimental measurements to
determine the interlayer coupling and the induced mass terms in graphene

scientists are inevitably faced with the challenge of reducing this data for

new method for reducing high-dimensional big data into a representative point
set, called projected support points (PSPs). A key ingredient in our method is
the so-called sparsity-inducing (SpIn) kernel, which encourages the
preservation of low-dimensional features when reducing high-dimensional data.
We begin by introducing a unifying theoretical framework for data reduction,
connecting PSPs with fundamental sampling principles from experimental design
and Quasi-Monte Carlo. Through this framework, we then derive sparsity
conditions under which the curse-of-dimensionality in data reduction can be
lifted for our method. Next, we propose two algorithms for one-shot and
sequential reduction via PSPs, both of which exploit big data subsampling and
majorization-minimization for efficient optimization. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical usefulness of PSPs in two real-world applications, the first for
data reduction in kernel learning, and the second for reducing Markov Chain

the case where there is uncertainty about the post-change distribution.
Specifically, the observer only knows that the post-change distribution belongs
to a parametric distribution family but he does not know the true value of the
post-change parameter. In this scenario, we propose two multi-chart detection
procedures, termed as M-SR procedure and modified M-SR procedure respectively,
and show that these two procedures are asymptotically optimal when the
post-change parameter belongs to a finite set and are asymptotically
$\epsilon-$optimal when the post-change parameter belongs to a compact set with
finite measure. Both algorithms can be calculated efficiently as their
detection statistics can be updated recursively. We then extend the study to
consider the multi-source monitoring problem with unknown post-change
parameters. When those monitored sources are mutually independent, we propose a
window-based modified M-SR detection procedure and show that the proposed
detection method is first-order asymptotically optimal when post-change
parameters belong to finite sets. We show that both computation and space

Unlike the luminosity and angular diameter distances, which correspond to the
angular size, the proper distance is the length of light path from the source
to observer. However, the proper distance has not been measured before. The
recent redshift measurement of a repeat fast radio burst (FRB) can shed light
on the proper distance. We show that the proper distance-redshift relation can
indeed be derived from dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs with measured
redshifts. From Monte Carlo simulations, we find that about 500 FRBs with DM
and redshift measurements can tightly constrain the proper distance-redshift
relation. We also show that the curvature of our Universe can be constrained
with a model-independent method using this derived proper distance-redshift
relation and the observed angular diameter distances. Owing to the high event
rate of FRBs, hundreds of FRBs can be discovered in the future by upcoming
instruments. The proper distance will play an important role in investigating
the accelerating expansion and the geometry of the Universe.

using all radio sources ClJ1001 remains among the four strongest projected

in a finite Hall voltage at zero magnetic field when a current flows through

Shannon mutual information terms. Utilisation of such a metric in network
motifs with the nodes representing different biochemical species, involved in
information sharing, uncovers rich store for interesting results. In the
current study, we make use of this formalism to obtain a comprehensive
understanding of the relative information processing mechanism in a diamond
motif and two of its sub-motifs namely bifurcation and integration motif
embedded within the diamond motif. The emerging patterns of synergy and
redundancy and their effective contribution towards ensuring high fidelity
information transmission are duly compared in the sub-motifs and independent
motifs (bifurcation and integration). In this context, the crucial roles played
by various time scales and activation coefficients in the network topologies
are especially emphasised. We show that the origin of synergy and redundancy in
information transmission can be physically justified by decomposing diamond
motif into bifurcation and integration motif.

as traditional hardware-based fault-tolerance (FT) concepts are ineffective for
on-board computers (OBCs) utilizing modern systems-on-a-chip (SoC). Therefore,
larger satellites continue to rely on proven processors with large feature

real-world solution to enable fault-tolerant general-purpose computing with

the tangent linear operator into another CLVs basis, they are norm independent,
invariant under time reversal and can be not orthonormal. CLVs can thus give a

simulations was to study the effects of various inflow conditions (boundary
layer thickness and laminar versus turbulent boundary layers) on the flow
behind the hill. The main features of the flow behind the hill are similar in
all simulations, however various differences are observed. The topology of the
streamlines (friction lines) on the surface adjacent to the lower wall was
found to be independent of the inflow conditions prescribed and comprised four
saddle points and four nodes (of which two are foci). In all simulations a
variety of vortical structures could be observed, ranging from a horseshoe
vortex - that was formed at the foot of the hill - to a train of large hairpin
vortices in the wake of the hill. In the simulation with a thick incoming
laminar boundary layer also secondary vortical structures (i.e. hairpin
vortices) were observed to be formed at either side of the hill, superposed on
the legs of the horseshoe vortex. Sufficiently far downstream of the hill, at
the symmetry plane the mean velocity and the rms of the velocity fluctuations
were found to become quasi-independent of the inflow conditions, while towards

of the loops were out of phase. As we move along the fan loop, the amplitude of
the oscillations first decreased and then increased. The out-of-phase nature
together with the amplitude variation along the loop implies that these
oscillations are very likely to be standing waves. The period of the
oscillations are estimated to be $\sim$27 min, damping time to be $\sim$45 min

projected phase speeds were in the range of acoustic speed of coronal plasma at
about 0.6 MK which further indicates that these are slow waves. To best of our

transmit simultaneously on the verification complexity of proof-labeling
schemes (PLS). In a PLS, each node is given a label, and the goal is to verify,
by exchanging messages over each link in each direction, that a certain global
predicate is satisfied by the system configuration. We consider a single
parameter r that bounds the number of distinct messages that can be sent
concurrently by any node: in the case r=1, each node may only send the same
message to all its neighbors (the broadcast model), in the case r is at least
Delta, where Delta is the largest node degree in the system, each neighbor may
be sent a distinct message (the unicast model), and in general, for r between 1
and Delta, each of the r messages is destined to a subset of the neighbors.
  We show that message compression linear in r is possible for verifying
fundamental problems such as the agreement between edge endpoints on the edge
state. Some problems, including verification of maximal matching, exhibit a
large gap in complexity between r=1 and r>1. For some other important
predicates, the verification complexity is insensitive to r, e.g., the question
whether a subset of edges constitutes a spanning-tree. We also consider the
congested clique model. We show that the crossing technique for proving lower
bounds on the verification complexity can be applied in the case of congested
clique only if r=1. Together with a new upper bound, this allows us to
determine the verification complexity of MST in the broadcast clique. Finally,
we establish a general connection between the deterministic and randomized
verification complexity for any given number r.

information flows usually exhibits complex behaviour, however, we maintain
analytic tractability by introducing what we term the effective and

However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains
unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action
points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby
obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show
analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order
parameter $\epsilon<0$), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed
correlations ""anticipating"" the waves of the linearly unstable regime.
Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with
$(-\epsilon)^{-0.5}$. By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental
car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference
regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore,
flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise
or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or
bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves

First, we introduce a new derivation of a Possio integral equation that relates

steady state solution to the Possio equation is used to account for the
aerodynamic forces in the steady state plate governing equation resulting in a
singular differential-integral equation which is transformed to an integral
equation. Next, we verify the solvability of the integral equation based on the
Fredholm alternative for compact operators in Banach spaces and the contraction
mapping theorem. Then, we derive explicit formulas for the characteristic
equations of free-clamped and free-pinned plates. The minimum solutions to the
characteristic equations are the divergence speeds which indicate when static
instabilities start to occur. We show analytically that free-pinned plates are
statically unstable. After that, we move to derive analytically flow speed
intervals that correspond to static stability regions for free-clamped plates.
We also resort to numerical computations to obtain an explicit formula for the
divergence speed of free-clamped plates. Finally, we apply the obtained results
on piezoelectric plates and we show that free-clamped piezoelectric plates are
statically more stable than conventional free-clamped plates due to the
piezoelectric coupling.

linear codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of size $p$ where $p$ is a
prime. In particular, we provide a general construction of valid inequalities
for the codeword polytope of the so-called constant-weight embedding of a
single parity-check (SPC) code over any prime field. The construction is based
on classes of building blocks that are assembled to form the left-hand side of
an inequality according to several rules. In the case of almost
doubly-symmetric valid classes we prove that the resulting inequalities are all
facet-defining, while we conjecture this to be true if and only if the class is
valid and symmetric. For $p=3$, there is only a single valid symmetric class
and we prove that the resulting inequalities together with the so-called
simplex constraints give a completely and irredundant description of the
codeword polytope of the embedded SPC code. For $p>5$, we show that there are
additional facets beyond those from the proposed construction. We use these
inequalities to develop an efficient (relaxed) ALP decoder for general
(non-SPC) linear codes over prime fields. The key ingredient is an efficient
separation algorithm based on the principle of dynamic programming.
Furthermore, we construct a decoder for linear codes over arbitrary fields
$\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q=p^m$ and $m>1$ by a factor graph representation that
reduces to several instances of the case $m=1$, which results, in general, in a
relaxation of the original decoding polytope. Finally, we present an efficient
cut-generating algorithm to search for redundant parity-checks to further
improve the performance towards maximum-likelihood decoding for short-to-medium
block lengths. Numerical experiments confirm that our new decoder is very
efficient compared to a static LP decoder for various field sizes, check-node

compatible correspondences. We guide the sampling for collecting voters by
downward dependencies on previous voting stages. All of this together results
in an accurate matching procedure. We evaluate our algorithm by controlled and

However, the systems are often so complex that numerical simulations or ad hoc
assumptions must be used to gain insight into the details of the complex
interactions between the fluid and solid mechanics. In this paper, we present
experiments and theory on viscous flow in a simple bioinspired soft valve which
illustrate essential features of interactions between hydrodynamic and elastic
forces at low Reynolds numbers. The setup comprises a sphere connected to a
spring located inside a tapering cylindrical channel. The spring is aligned
with the central axis of the channel and a pressure drop is applied across the
sphere, thus forcing the liquid through the narrow gap between the sphere and
the channel walls. The sphere's equilibrium position is determined by a balance
between spring and hydrodynamic forces. Since the gap thickness changes with
the sphere's position, the system has a pressure-dependent hydraulic
resistance. This leads to a non-linear relation between applied pressure and
flow rate: flow initially increases with pressure, but decreases when the
pressure exceeds a certain critical value as the gap closes. To rationalize
these observations, we propose a mathematical model that reduced the complexity
of the flow to a two-dimensional lubrication approximation. A closed-form
expression for the pressure-drop/flow rate is obtained which reveals that the
flow rate $Q$ depends on the pressure drop $\Delta p$, sphere radius $a$, gap
thickness $h_0$, and viscosity $\eta$ as $Q\sim \eta^{-1}
a^{1/2}h_0^{5/2}\left(\Delta p_c-\Delta p\right)^{5/2}\Delta p$, where the
critical pressure $\Delta p_c$ scales with the spring constant $k$ and sphere
radius $a$ as $\Delta p_c\sim k a^{-2}$. These predictions compared favorably
to the results of our experiments with no free parameters.

  Aims: Complement the MARCS model atmosphere suit with simulations applicable

  Methods: The MARCS code calculates stellar atmosphere models, providing
self-consistent solutions of the radiative transfer and the atmospheric
structure and chemistry. We combine MARCS with DRIFT, a kinetic model that
describes cloud formation in ultra-cool atmospheres (seed formation, growth/
evaporation, gravitational settling, convective mixing, element depletion).
  Results: We present a small grid of self-consistently calculated atmosphere
models for $T_ \text{eff} = 2000 - 3000$ K with solar initial abundances and
$\log(g) = 4.5$. Cloud formation in stellar and sub-stellar atmospheres appears
for $T_\text{eff} < 2700$ K and has a significant effect on the structure and
the spectrum of the atmosphere for $T_\text{eff} < 2400$ K. We have compared
the synthetic spectra of our models with observed spectra and found that they
fit the spectra of mid to late type M-dwarfs and early type L-dwarfs well. We
also test DRIFT-MARCS for an example exoplanet and demonstrate that our
simulations reproduce the Spitzer observations for WASP-19b rather well for

identify and classify these regions, to perform kriging, or to derive some
properties of the parameters driving the random field in one or several of the
subregions. The extension is based on replacing the latent Gaussian random
field in the LGCP by a latent spatial mixture model. The mixture model is
specified using a latent, categorically valued, random field induced by level
set operations on a Gaussian random field. Conditional on the classification,
the intensity surface for each class is modeled by a set of independent
Gaussian random fields. This allows for standard stationary covariance
structures, such as the Mat\'{e}rn family, to be used to model Gaussian random
fields with some degree of general smoothness but also occasional and
structured sharp discontinuities.
  A computationally efficient MCMC method is proposed for Bayesian inference
and we show consistency of finite dimensional approximations of the model.
Finally, the model is fitted to point pattern data derived from a tropical

of flow signatures in small collision systems. We measure a nonzero $v_2$

consistent with predictions from viscous hydrodynamic models. Comparisons with
calculations from parton transport models (based on the {\sc ampt} Monte Carlo

($d$-going) rapidities and low $p_T$. At backward (Au-going) rapidities and
$p_T>1.5$ GeV/$c$, the data diverges from {\sc ampt} calculations of $v_2$
relative to the initial geometry, indicating the possible dominance of
nongeometry related correlations, referred to as nonflow. We also present
measurements of the charged-particle multiplicity ($dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$) as a
function of $\eta$ in central $d$$+$Au collisions at the same energies. We find
that in $d$$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=$200 GeV the $v_2$ scales with
$dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$ over all $\eta$ in the PHENIX acceptance. At

nonflow effects dominating at backward rapidity.

interfacial energy. The classical mean-field treatments by Lifshitz, Slyozov,
[1] Wagner [2] and Hillert [3] predicted cubic growth law under bulk-diffusion
controlled precipitation coarsening and parabolic growth law under interface
controlled grain growth, as well as their steady-state size distribution. When
the size distribution is the steady-state one, the average grain size satisfies
the following dependence: under bulk-diffusion control and under interface
control, with correct slopes definitely given by the theory. However, when the
size distribution does not satisfy the steady-state one, the growth kinetics
would deviate from theoretical prediction. As is shown by numerical simulations
in Ref. 4 and 5, the deviation is less obvious in the growth law, but more
evident in the slope of the growth curve. Specifically, starting from a
non-steady-state size distribution, the parabolic/cubic growth law would be
recovered quickly, yet the convergence of the slope in the or curve is
extremely slow. Therefore, it would be interesting to know how to calculate the
instantaneous slope of the growth kinetics from an arbitrarily given size
distribution. As will be shown below, assuming a known growth law, the
analytical solution can be easily obtained and the exact solution can be
obtained by numerical integration.

of inflated radii is ascribed to magnetic fields which impede the onset of
convection (e.g. MacDonald & Mullan [2017a] and citations therein). Some of our
magneto-convection models have been criticized because, when they were first
reported by Mullan & MacDonald (2001), the deep interior fields were found to
be very large (50-100 MG). Such large fields are now known to be untenable. For
example, Browning et al. (2016) used stability arguments to suggest that
interior fields in low-mass stars cannot be larger than ~1 MG. Moreover, 3D
models of turbulent stellar dynamos suggest that fields generated in low-mass
interiors may be not much stronger than 10-20 kG (Browning 2008). In the
present paper, we present magneto-convective models of inflated low-mass stars
in which the interior fields are not permitted to be stronger than 10 kG. These
models are used to fit empirical data for 15 low-mass stars for which precise
masses and radii have been measured. We show that our 10 kG magneto-convective
models can replicate the empirical radii and effective temperatures for 14 of
the stars. In the case of the remaining star (in the Praesepe cluster), two
different solutions have been reported in the literature. We find that one of
these solutions (by Gillen et al. 2017) can be fitted well with our model using
the nominal age of Praesepe (800 Myr). However, the second solution (by Kraus

younger (~ 150 Myr).

well the QCD confinement and deconfinement phases, while allowing the
introduction of a temperature in a phase which resembles the confined phase,

some subtleties of such model. We confirm the lattice picture of a strong
build-up of thermal entropy towards the critical temperature T_c, both coming
from below or above T_c. We also include a chemical potential, confirming this
entropic picture and we consider its effect on the speed of sound. Moreover,
the temperature dependent confinement phase from the holography side allows us
to find a string tension that does not vanish at T_c, a finding also supported
by lattice QCD.

of light that is reflected by the planet. Methods. We have computed the flux

fully includes multiple scattering and polarization. Variations in cloud-top

clouds, and patchy clouds) can be distinguished from each other and that the
percentage of cloud cover can be estimated within 10%. Conclusions. Using our
proposed observational strategy, one should be able to determine basic orbital
parameters of a planet such as orbital inclination and estimate cloud coverage
with reduced ambiguities from the planet's polarization signals along its
orbit.

for finding sparse solutions of linear inverse problems and gained successful
applications in various mathematics and applied science fields. The proximal
gradient algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms for solving the
$\ell_p$ regularisation problem. In the present paper, we investigate the
linear convergence issue of one inexact descent method and two inexact proximal
gradient algorithms (PGA). For this purpose, an optimality condition theorem is
explored to provide the equivalences among a local minimum, second-order
optimality condition and second-order growth property of the $\ell_p$
regularization problem. By virtue of the second-order optimality condition and
second-order growth property, we establish the linear convergence properties of
the inexact descent method and inexact PGAs under some simple assumptions. Both
linear convergence to a local minimal value and linear convergence to a local
minimum are provided. Finally, the linear convergence results of the inexact
numerical methods are extended to the infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

years between observations. We report an increase by almost a factor of 2 in
the peak flux density of the central core component, C4, thought to host the
black hole, but a probable decrease in some other components, possibly due to
adiabatic expansion. The core flux increase indicates an AGN which is currently
active and feeding the jet. We detect no significant motion in 22 years between
C4 and the component C3, which is unresolved in the eMERLIN image. We present a
spectral index image made within the 512 MHz band of the 1.5 GHz observations.
The spectrum of the core, C4, is flatter than that of other components further
out in the jet. We use HST emission line images (H$\alpha$, [O III] and [O II])
to study the connection between the jet and the emission line region. Based on
the changing emission line ratios away from the core and comparison with the
eMERLIN radio jet, we conclude that photoionisation from the central AGN is
responsible for the observed emission line properties further than 4"" (360 pc)
from the core, C4. Within this region, several evidences (radio-line
co-spatiality, low [O III]/H$\alpha$ and estimated fast shocks) suggest
additional ionisation from the jet.

insulator, indeed preserve the topological nature of the surface states, that
moreover extend phase-coherently across the entire wire geometry. The
phase-coherence lengths are enhanced up to 5 $\mu$m when tuning the wires into
the bulk gap, so as to single out topological transport. The nanowires exhibit
distinct conductance oscillations, both as a function of the flux due to an

Aharonov-Bohm-type modulations indicate surface-mediated quasi-ballistic
transport. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the scaling of the observed
gate-dependent conductance oscillations reveals the topological nature of these
surface states. To this end we combined numerical tight-binding calculations of
the quantum magneto-conductance with simulations of the electrostatics,
accounting for the gate-induced inhomogenous charge carrier densities around

inhomogenous gating and is governed by flux-sensitive high-angular momentum

we consider the substitutional nitrogen doping of capped CNT (capCNT)
electrodes and perform two types of molecular dynamics simulations for the
entrapped and translocating single-stranded DNAs. We find that the
substitutional nitrogen doping of capCNTs stabilizes the edge-on nucleobase
configurations rather than the original face-on ones and slows down the DNA
translocation speed by establishing hydrogen bonds between the N dopant atoms
and nucleobases. Due to the enhanced interactions between DNAs and N-doped
capCNTs, the duration time of nucleobases within the nanogap was extended by up
to ~ 290 % and the fluctuation of the nucleobases was reduced by up to ~ 70 %.
Given the possibility to be combined with extrinsic light or gate voltage
modulation methods, the current work demonstrates that the substitutional
nitrogen doping is a promising direction for the control of DNA translocation
dynamics through a nanopore or nanogap based of carbon nanomaterials.

able to exploit chemical energy associated to polymerization to perform
mechanical work against an external load. The force-velocity relationship
quantitatively summarizes the nature of this process. By a stochastic dynamical
model, we give, together with the evolution of a staggered bundle of $N_f$
rigid living filaments facing a loaded wall, the corresponding force--velocity
relationship. We compute systematically the simplified evolution of the model
in supercritical conditions $\rho_1=U_0/W_0>1$ at $\epsilon=d^2W_0/D=0$, where
$d$ is the monomer size, $D$ is the obstacle diffusion coefficient, $U_0$ and
$W_0$ are the polymerization and depolymerization rates. Moreover, we see that
the solution at $\epsilon=0$ is valid for a good range of small non-zero
$\epsilon$ values. We consider two classical protocols: the bundle is opposed
either to a constant load or to an optical trap set-up, characterized by a
harmonic restoring force. The constant force case leads, for each $F$ value, to
a stationary velocity $V^{stat}(F;N_f,\rho_1)$ after a relaxation with
characteristic time $\tau_{micro}(F)$. When the bundle (initially taken as an
assembly of filament seeds) is subjected to a harmonic restoring force (optical
trap load), the bundle elongates and the load increases up to stalling
(equilibrium) over a characteristic time $\tau^{OT}$. Extracted from this
single experiment, the force-velocity $V^{OT}(F;N_f,\rho_1)$ curve is found to
coincide with $V^{stat}(F;N_f,\rho_1)$, except at low loads. We show that this
result follows from the adiabatic separation between $\tau_{micro}$ and
$\tau^{OT}$, i.e. $\tau_{micro}\ll\tau^{OT}$.

the transmission signal of the possible water-world GJ 1214b through
photometric observations during transit in three optical and one infrared

state-of-the-art performance in image classification. Their architectures have
largely drawn inspiration by models of the primate visual system. However,
while recent research results of neuroscience prove the existence of non-linear
operations in the response of complex visual cells, little effort has been
devoted to extend the convolution technique to non-linear forms. Typical
convolutional layers are linear systems, hence their expressiveness is limited.
To overcome this, various non-linearities have been used as activation
functions inside CNNs, while also many pooling strategies have been applied. We
address the issue of developing a convolution method in the context of a
computational model of the visual cortex, exploring quadratic forms through the
Volterra kernels. Such forms, constituting a more rich function space, are used
as approximations of the response profile of visual cells. Our proposed
second-order convolution is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that a
network which combines linear and non-linear filters in its convolutional
layers, can outperform networks that use standard linear filters with the same
architecture, yielding results competitive with the state-of-the-art on these

images and showed MUV variability. At similar orbital phases, the MUV
luminosities of both pulsars are comparable. This suggests that the emission
processes involved in both objects are similar. We estimated limits on the mass
ratio, companion's temperature, inclination, and distance to XSS J12270-4859 by
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit published folded optical
light curves. Using the resulting parameters, we modeled MUV light curves in
our HST filters. The resulting models failed to fit our MUV observations.
Fixing the mass ratio of XSS J12270-4859 to the value reported in other
studies, we obtained a distance of ~3.2 kpc. This is larger than the one
derived from radio measurements (~1.4 kpc). Assuming a uniform prior for the
mass ratio, the distance is similar to that from radio measurements. However,
it requires an undermassive companion (~0.01 M_sun). We conclude that a direct
heating model alone can not fully explain the observations in optical and MUV.
Therefore, an additional radiation source is needed. The source could be an
intrabinary shock which contributes to the MUV flux and likely to the optical
one as well. During the radio pulsar state, the MUV orbital variations of PSR
J1023+0038 detected with GALEX, suggests the presence of an asymmetric
intrabinary shock.

showing that no algorithm can achieve a meaningful bound in terms of

insensitive data aggregation in MANETs. The key idea in EZ-AG is to introduce a
token that performs a self-repelling random walk in the network and aggregates
information from nodes when they are visited for the first time. A
self-repelling random walk of a token on a graph is one in which at each step,
the token moves to a neighbor that has been visited least often. While
self-repelling random walks visit all nodes in the network much faster than
plain random walks, they tend to slow down when most of the nodes are already
visited. In this paper, we show that a single step push phase at each node can
significantly speed up the aggregation and eliminate this slow down. By doing
so, EZ-AG achieves aggregation in only O(N) time and messages. In terms of
overhead, EZ-AG outperforms existing structure-free data aggregation by a
factor of at least log(N) and achieves the lower bound for aggregation message
overhead. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of EZ-AG using ns-3
simulations in networks ranging from 100 to 4000 nodes under different mobility
models and node speeds. We also describe a hierarchical extension for EZ-AG
that can produce multi-resolution aggregates at each node using only O(NlogN)
messages, which is a poly-logarithmic factor improvement over existing
techniques.

this analyticity implies unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves,
similar to the edge states that occur in photonic 'topological insulators'. For
a medium containing holes the propagation is no longer unidirectional. We
illustrate the sensitivity of the field to the topology of the space using an
exactly solvable example. To conclude we provide a generalization of

relate ordinary anisotropic media to the recently highlighted gyrotropic ones

network simulations in ns-3, we characterize the number of times each node is
visited from the start until all nodes have been visited at least once. We
evaluate under different mobility models and on networks ranging from 100 to
1000 nodes. Our results show that until about 85% coverage, duplicate visits
are very rare highlighting the efficiency with which a majority of nodes in the

disc systems. Chemical evolution models, designed to follow the build up of
metals and dust in galaxies, do not currently account for planet formation. We
consider the possibility that the apparent under-prediction of dust mass in
high redshift galaxies by chemical evolution models could be in part, due to
these models neglecting this process, specifically due to their assumption that
a large fraction of the dust mass is removed from the interstellar medium
during star formation (so-called astration). By adding a planet formation phase
into galaxy chemical evolution, we demonstrate that the dust budget crisis can
be partially ameliorated by a factor of 1.3-1.5 only if a) circumstellar discs
prevent a large fraction of the dust mass entering the star during its birth,
and b) that dust mass is preferentially liberated via jets, winds and outflows
rather than accreted into planetary-mass bodies.

noise serve as case studies for the role of fluctuations and correlations in
biological systems. Including spatial structure and stochastic noise in
predator-prey competition invalidates the deterministic Lotka-Volterra picture
of neutral population cycles. Stochastic models yield long-lived erratic
population oscillations stemming from a resonant amplification mechanism. In
spatially extended predator-prey systems, one observes noise-stabilized
activity and persistent correlations. Fluctuation-induced renormalizations of
the oscillation parameters can be analyzed perturbatively. The critical
dynamics and the non-equilibrium relaxation kinetics at the predator extinction
threshold are characterized by the directed percolation universality class.
Spatial or environmental variability results in more localized patches which
enhances both species densities. Affixing variable rates to individual
particles and allowing for trait inheritance subject to mutations induces fast
evolutionary dynamics for the rate distributions. Stochastic spatial variants
of cyclic competition with rock-paper-scissors interactions illustrate
connections between population dynamics and evolutionary game theory, and
demonstrate how space can help maintain diversity. In two dimensions,
three-species cyclic competition models of the May-Leonard type are
characterized by the emergence of spiral patterns whose properties are
elucidated by a mapping onto a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Extensions to
general food networks can be classified on the mean-field level, which provides
both a fundamental understanding of ensuing cooperativity and emergence of
alliances. Novel space-time patterns emerge as a result of the formation of
competing alliances, such as coarsening domains that each incorporate
rock-paper-scissors competition games.

role when studying the formation of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Employing the
MESA stellar evolution code, we calculated the long-term evolution of
He-accreting CO WDs. Previous studies usually supposed that a WD can grow in
mass to the Chandrasekhar limit in the stable He burning region and finally
produce a SN Ia. However, in this study we find that off-centre carbon ignition
occurs in the stable He burning region if the accretion rate is above a
critical value (~2.05*10^{-6}{M$_\odot$}{yr}^-1), resulting in
accretion-induced collapse rather than a SN Ia. If the accretion rate is below
the critical value, explosive carbon ignition will eventually happen in the
centre producing a SN Ia. Taking into account the possibility of off-centre
carbon ignition, we have re-determined the initial parameter space that
produces SNe Ia in the He star donor channel, one of the promising channels to
produce SNe Ia in young populations. Since this parameter space is smaller than
was found in the previous study of Wang et al. (2009), the SN Ia rates are also
correspondingly smaller. We also determined the chemical abundance profile of
the He-accreting WDs at the moment of explosive carbon ignition, which can be
used as initial input for SN Ia explosion models.

address this issue with an intent communication system (ICS) that acts in place

ensure that communication is simple, yet effective without leaving pedestrians
with a sense of distrust in autonomous vehicles. To validate the ICS, two types
of experiments have been run: field tests with an autonomous vehicle to
determine how humans actually interact with the ICS and simulations to account
for multiple potential behaviors.The results from both experiments show that
humans react positively and more predictably when the intent of the vehicle is
communicated compared to when the intent of the vehicle is unknown. In
particular, the results from the simulation specifically showed a 142 percent
difference between the pedestrian's trust in the vehicle's actions when the ICS

computing (HPC) systems. While the HPC community has developed various
resilience solutions, the solution space remains fragmented. There are no
formal methods and metrics to integrate the various HPC resilience techniques
into composite solutions, nor are there methods to holistically evaluate the
adequacy and efficacy of such solutions in terms of their protection coverage,
and their performance & power efficiency characteristics. In this paper, we
develop a structured approach to the design, evaluation and optimization of HPC
resilience using the concept of design patterns. A design pattern is a general
repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem. We identify the problems
caused by various types of faults, errors and failures in HPC systems and the
techniques used to deal with these events. Each well-known solution that
addresses a specific HPC resilience challenge is described in the form of a
pattern. We develop a complete catalog of such resilience design patterns,
which may be used as essential building blocks when designing and deploying
resilience solutions. We also develop a design framework that enhances a
designer's understanding the opportunities for integrating multiple patterns
across layers of the system stack and the important constraints during
implementation of the individual patterns. It is also useful for defining
mechanisms and interfaces to coordinate flexible fault management across
hardware and software components. The overall goal of this work is to establish
a systematic methodology for the design and evaluation of resilience
technologies in extreme-scale HPC systems that keep scientific applications
running to a correct solution in a timely and cost-efficient manner despite
frequent faults, errors, and failures of various types.

In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the revenue for the seller
side via utilizing proper reserve price for the auctions in a dynamical way.
  Predicting the optimal reserve price for each auction in the repeated auction
marketplaces is a non-trivial problem. However, we were able to come up with an
efficient method of improving the seller revenue by mainly focusing on
adjusting the reserve price for those high-value inventories. Previously, no
dedicated work has been performed from this perspective. Inspired by Paul and
Michael, our model first identifies the value of the inventory by predicting
the top bid price bucket using a cascade of classifiers. The cascade is
essential in significantly reducing the false positive rate of a single
classifier. Based on the output of the first step, we build another cluster of
classifiers to predict the price separations between the top two bids. We
showed that although the high-value auctions are only a small portion of all
the traffic, successfully identifying them and setting correct reserve price
would result in a significant revenue lift. Moreover, our optimization is
compatible with all other reserve price models in the system and does not
impact their performance. In other words, when combined with other models, the
enhancement on exchange revenue will be aggregated. Simulations on randomly
sampled Yahoo ads exchange (YAXR) data showed stable and expected lift after

hardware designs for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoders. The proposed
approach, called Non-Surjective Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders (NS-FAIDs),
exploits the robustness of message-passing LDPC decoders to inaccuracies in the
calculation of exchanged messages, and it is shown to provide a unified
framework for several designs previously proposed in the literature. NS-FAIDs
are optimized by density evolution for regular and irregular LDPC codes, and
are shown to provide different trade-offs between hardware complexity and
decoding performance. Two hardware architectures targeting high-throughput
applications are also proposed, integrating both Min-Sum (MS) and NS-FAID
decoding kernels. ASIC post synthesis implementation results on 65nm CMOS
technology show that NS-FAIDs yield significant improvements in the throughput
to area ratio, by up to 58.75% with respect to the MS decoder, with even better
or only slightly degraded error correction performance.

  fringe-data compression by phase-shifting algorithms","13 pages, 13 figures and 1 table",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical phase-modulated fringe-patterns are usually digitized with XxY pixels
and 8 bits/pixel (or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are
raw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy
fringe-patterns store much less Shannon information than the capacity of the
digitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras may
waste to noise most bits/pixel. For example one would not use smartphone
cameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images.
However smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we
show here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its
(S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy
H, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images
may be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information
phase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in
spite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are
redundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and
data compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage.
Shannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression
algorithms. Here we show that phase-modulated phase-shifted fringes are highly
correlated, and as a consequence, phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be used
as fringe-data compressors. Therefore a PSA may compress a large number of
phase-shifted fringes into a single complex-valued image. This is important in
spaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by
huge distance and low-power downlink. That is, instead of transmitting M
phase-shifted fringes, one only transmit the phase-demodulated signal as
compressed sensing data.
