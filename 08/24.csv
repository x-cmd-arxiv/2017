$p>0$. The diagrammatic Hecke category $\mathcal{D}$ for $W$ over $\Bbbk$ is a
categorification of the Hecke algebra for $W$ with rich connections to modular
representation theory. We explicitly construct a functor from $\mathcal{D}$ to
a matrix category which categorifies a recursive representation $\xi:
\mathbb{Z}W \rightarrow M_{p^r}(\mathbb{Z}W)$, where $r$ is the rank of the
underlying finite root system. This functor gives a method for understanding
diagrammatic Soergel bimodules in terms of other diagrammatic Soergel bimodules
which are ``smaller'' by a factor of $p$. It also explains the presence of
self-similarity in the $p$-canonical basis, which has been observed in small
examples. By decategorifying we obtain a new lower bound on the $p$-canonical
basis, which corresponds to new lower bounds on the characters of the
indecomposable tilting modules by the recent $p$-canonical tilting character
formula due to Achar-Makisumi-Riche-Williamson.

Collins-like asymmetries are small, with the latter allowing the first
experimental constraints on gluon linear polarization in a polarized proton. At
higher values of jet transverse momenta, we observe the first non-zero Collins

resolution strategy which uses memoisation to avoid redundant duplication of
computations. Until relatively recently, tabling has required either low-level
support in the underlying Prolog engine, or extensive program transormation (de
Guzman et al., 2008). An alternative approach is to augment Prolog with low
level support for continuation capturing control operators, particularly
delimited continuations, which have been investigated in the field of
functional programming and found to be capable of supporting a wide variety of
computational effects within an otherwise declarative language.
  This technical report describes an implementation of tabling in SWI Prolog
based on delimited control operators for Prolog recently introduced by
Schrijvers et al. (2013). In comparison with a previous implementation of
tabling for SWI Prolog using delimited control (Desouter et al., 2015), this
approach, based on the functional memoising parser combinators of Johnson
(1995), stays closer to the declarative core of Prolog, requires less code, and
is able to deliver solutions from systems of tabled predicates incrementally
(as opposed to finding all solutions before delivering any to the rest of the
program).
  A collection of benchmarks shows that a small number of carefully targeted
optimisations yields performance within a factor of about 2 of the optimised
version of Desouter et al.'s system currently included in SWI Prolog.

below the neutron threshold is extremely well reproduced and the giant dipole
resonance is described in a very satisfactory way especially in its spreading
and fragmentation. Spreading and fragmentation are produced in a natural way
within such a theoretical model by the coupling of 1 particle-1 hole and 2
particle-2 hole configurations. Owing to this feature, we may provide for the
electric polarizability as a function of the excitation energy a curve with a
similar slope around the centroid energy of the giant resonance compared to the
corresponding experimental results. This represents a considerable improvement
with respect to previous theoretical predictions obtained with the random-phase
approximation or with several ab-initio models. In such cases, the spreading
width of the excitation cannot be reproduced and the polarizability as a

quality vector magnetograms by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and more
specifically the Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP). Through a
newly established method, that incorporates detailed error analysis, we
calculate the non-neutralized currents contained in active regions (AR). Two
predictors are produced, namely the total and the maximum unsigned
non-neutralized current. Both are tested in AR time-series and a representative
sample of point-in-time observations during the interval 2012-2016. The average
values of non-neutralized currents in flaring active regions are by more than
an order of magnitude higher than in non-flaring regions and correlate very
well with the corresponding flare index. The temporal evolution of these
parameters appears to be connected to physical processes, such as flux
emergence and/or magnetic polarity inversion line formation that are associated
with increased solar flare activity. Using Bayesian inference of flaring
probabilities, it is shown that the total unsigned non-neutralized current
outperforms significantly the total unsigned magnetic flux and other well
established current-related predictors. Thus, it shows good prospects for
inclusion in an operational flare forecasting service. We plan to use the new
predictor in the framework of the FLARECAST project along with other highly
performing predictors.

distribution (i.e., a score distribution vector of the ordinal basic human
ratings) using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Conventional DCNNs
which aim to minimize the difference between the predicted scalar numbers or
vectors and the ground truth cannot be directly used for the ordinal basic

score distribution of human ratings, with a new reliability-sensitive learning
method based on the kurtosis of the score distribution, which eliminates the
requirement of the original full data of human ratings (without normalization).
Experimental results on large scale aesthetic dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our introduced CJS-CNN in this task.

quadratic form of the variance function which makes the variance minimization

feasible policy space, we transform this constrained variance minimization
problem to an equivalent unconstrained MDP under a new discounted criterion and
a new reward function. The difference of the variances of Markov chains under
any two feasible policies is quantified by a difference formula. Based on the
variance difference formula, a policy iteration algorithm is developed to find
the optimal policy. We also prove the optimality of deterministic policy over
the randomized policy generated in the mean-constrained policy space. Numerical

that this simple intuition---although very useful in interpreting some
numerical results---deviates from the actual situation in several ways. Using a
fully connected quantum spin model, we derive a set of conditions on the
positions and momenta of the endpoints of the instanton, which remove the extra
degrees of freedom due to open boundaries. In comparison, the half-instanton
conjecture incorrectly sets the momenta at the endpoints to zero. We also found
that the instantons in open-boundary QMC correspond to quantum tunneling events
in the symmetric subspace (maximum total angular momentum) at all temperatures,
whereas the instantons in periodic-boundary QMC typically lie in subspaces with
lower total angular momenta at finite temperatures. This leads to a lesser than
quadratic speedup at finite temperatures. We also outline the generalization of
the instantonic tunneling method to many-qubit systems without permutation
symmetry using spin-coherent-state path integrals.

where neural networks can be trained an order of magnitude faster than with
standard training methods. The existence of super-convergence is relevant to
understanding why deep networks generalize well. One of the key elements of
super-convergence is training with one learning rate cycle and a large maximum
learning rate. A primary insight that allows super-convergence training is that
large learning rates regularize the training, hence requiring a reduction of
all other forms of regularization in order to preserve an optimal
regularization balance. We also derive a simplification of the Hessian Free
optimization method to compute an estimate of the optimal learning rate.
Experiments demonstrate super-convergence for Cifar-10/100, MNIST and Imagenet
datasets, and resnet, wide-resnet, densenet, and inception architectures. In
addition, we show that super-convergence provides a greater boost in
performance relative to standard training when the amount of labeled training

state of a $XXZ$ spin chain with boundary Markovian noise using the Fisher
information. The latter represents the distance between two infinitesimally
close states, and its superextensive size scaling witnesses a critical
behaviour due to a phase transition, since all the interaction terms are
extensive. Perturbatively in the noise strength, we found superextensive Fisher
information at anisotropy $|\Delta|\leqslant1$ and irrational
$\frac{\arccos\Delta}{\pi}$ irrespective of the order of two non-commuting
limits, i.e. the thermodynamic limit and the limit of sending
$\frac{\arccos\Delta}{\pi}$ to an irrational number via a sequence of rational
approximants. From this result we argue the existence of a non-equilibrium
quantum phase transition with a critical phase $|\Delta|\leqslant1$. From the
non-superextensivity of the Fisher information of reduced states, we infer that
this non-equilibrium quantum phase transition does not have local order
parameters but has non-local ones, at least at $|\Delta|=1$. In the
non-perturbative regime for the noise strength, we numerically computed the
reduced Fisher information which lower bounds the full state Fisher
information, and is superextensive only at $|\Delta|=1$. Form the latter
result, we derived local order parameters at $|\Delta|=1$ in the
non-perturbative case. The existence of critical behaviour witnessed by the
Fisher information in the phase $|\Delta|<1$ is still an open problem. The
Fisher information also represents the best sensitivity for any estimation of
the control parameter, in our case the anisotropy $\Delta$, and its
superextensivity implies enhanced estimation precision which is also highly
robust in the presence of a critical phase.

their progenitor systems and explosion physics. Here we report the intermediate
Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) discovery of an extraordinarily young SN Ia,
iPTF 16abc. By fitting a power law to our early light curve, we infer that
first light for the SN, that is when the SN could have first been detected by
our survey, occurred only $0.15\pm_{0.07}^{0.15}$ days before our first
detection. In the $\sim$24 hr after discovery, iPTF 16abc rose by $\sim$2 mag,
featuring a near-linear rise in flux for $\gtrsim$3 days. Early spectra show
strong C II absorption, which disappears after $\sim$7 days. Unlike the
extensivelyobserved SN Ia SN 2011fe, the $(B-V)_0$ colors of iPTF 16abc are
blue and nearly constant in the days after explosion. We show that our early
observations of iPTF 16abc cannot be explained by either SN shock breakout and
the associated, subsequent cooling or the SN ejecta colliding with a stellar
companion. Instead, we argue that the early characteristics of iPTF 16abc,
including (i) the rapid, near-linear rise, (ii) the nonevolving blue colors,
and (iii) the strong C II absorption, are the result of either ejecta
interaction with nearby, unbound material or vigorous mixing of radioactive
$^{56}$Ni in the SN ejecta, or a combination of the two. In the next few years,
dozens of very young \textit{normal} SNe Ia will be discovered, and
observations similar to those presented here will constrain the white dwarf
explosion mechanism.

Telescope to provide new constraints on its spectral properties at high
frequency. We conducted observations in three frequency bands centred at 1.4
GHz, 6.6 GHz and 19 GHz, resulting in beam resolutions of 14$^{\prime}$,
2.9$^{\prime}$ and 1$^{\prime}$ respectively. These single-dish data were also
combined with archival interferometric observations at 1.4 and 1.7 GHz. From
the combined images, we measured a flux density of ${\rm
S_{1.4GHz}=(158.3\pm9.6)\,mJy}$ for the central radio halo and ${\rm
S_{1.4GHz}=(126\pm8)\,mJy}$ and ${\rm S_{1.4GHz}=(11.7\pm0.7)\,mJy}$ for the
northern and the southern relic respectively. After the spectral modelling of
the discrete sources, we measured at 6.6 GHz ${\rm
S_{6.6GHz}=(17.1\pm1.2)\,mJy}$ and ${\rm S_{6.6GHz}=(0.6\pm0.3)\,mJy}$ for the
northern and southern relic respectively. Assuming simple diffusive shock
acceleration, we interpret measurements of the northern relic with a continuous
injection model represented by a broken power-law. This yields an injection
spectral index ${\rm \alpha_{inj}=0.7\pm0.1}$ and a Mach number ${\rm
M=3.3\pm0.9}$, consistent with recent X-ray estimates. Unlike other studies of
the same object, no significant steepening of the relic radio emission is seen
in data up to 8.35 GHz. By fitting the southern relic spectrum with a simple
power-law (${\rm S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-\alpha}}$) we obtained a spectral index
${\rm \alpha\approx1.9}$ corresponding to a Mach number (${\rm M\approx1.8}$)
in agreement with X-ray estimates. Finally, we evaluated the rotation measure
of the northern relic at 6.6 GHz. These results provide new insights on the
magnetic structure of the relic, but further observations are needed to clarify
the nature of the observed Faraday rotation.

formation timescales for close Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) pairs following
galaxy mergers. Using ROMULUS25, the first large-scale cosmological simulation
to accurately track the orbital evolution of SMBHs within their host galaxies
down to sub-kpc scales, we predict an average formation rate density of close
SMBH pairs of 0.013 cMpc^-3 Gyr^-1. We find that it is relatively rare for
galaxy mergers to result in the formation of close SMBH pairs with sub-kpc
separation and those that do form are often the result of Gyrs of orbital
evolution following the galaxy merger. The likelihood and timescale to form a
close SMBH pair depends strongly on the mass ratio of the merging galaxies, as
well as the presence of dense stellar cores. Low stellar mass ratio mergers
with galaxies that lack a dense stellar core are more likely to become tidally
disrupted and deposit their SMBH at large radii without any stellar core to aid
in their orbital decay, resulting in a population of long-lived 'wandering'
SMBHs. Conversely, SMBHs in galaxies that remain embedded within a stellar core
form close pairs in much shorter timescales on average. This timescale is a
crucial, though often ignored or very simplified, ingredient to models
predicting SMBH mergers rates and the connection between SMBH and star
formation activity.

questions in astrophysics and cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and
photometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to study gas and dust along the
lines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K
absorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral
continuum of SNe Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust
along the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which occurred in an unusual location, in
a tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods. Using a
time-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K
absorption features for variations in time, which would be indicative for
circumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore, we take advantage of the well known
photometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to dust along the
line-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we
determine that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS
medium of iPTF16abc. While the Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be
optically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points to a small column of
interstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight to
iPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM)
within a galaxy. It suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally
stripped during an interaction of NGC 5221 with one of its neighbouring
galaxies in the past $\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds could
become the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds
might diffuse, enriching the circum-galactic medium (CGM) with metals. The gas
profile along the line-of-sight should be useful for future studies of the
dynamics of the galaxy group containing NGC 5221.

coalescence of Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves in CROWs, without the presence of gain
and loss, which is in contrast to the requirement of Parity-Time (PT) symmetry
to develop exceptional points based on gain and loss balance. The EPDs arise
here by introducing symmetry breaking in a conventional chain of coupled
resonators through coupling the chain of resonators to an adjacent uniform
optical waveguide, which leads to unique modal characteristics that cannot be
realized in conventional CROWs. Such remarkable characteristics include high
quality factors (Q-factor) and strong field enhancement, even without any
mirrors at the two ends of a cavity. We show for the first time the capability
of CROWs to exhibit EPDs of various order; including the degenerate band edge
(DBE) and the stationary inflection point (SIP). The proposed CROW of finite
length shows enhanced quality factor when operating near the DBE, and the
Q-factor exhibits an anomalous scaling with the CROW's length. We develop the
theory of EPDs in such unconventional CROW using coupled-wave equations, and we
derive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation. The proposed
unconventional CROW concepts have various potential applications including
Q-switching, nonlinear devices, lasers, and extremely sensitive sensors.

an important task in cancer genomics. Clustering based on comprehensive
multi-omic molecular profiling can often achieve better results than those
using a single data type, since each omic data type (representing one view of
patients) may contain complementary information. However, it is challenging to
integrate heterogeneous omic data types directly. Based on one popular method
-- Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we presented Affinity Network Fusion (ANF)
in this paper, an ""upgrade"" of SNF with several advantages. Similar to SNF, ANF
treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity
(transition) matrix for clustering. We applied ANF to a carefully processed
harmonized cancer dataset downloaded from GDC data portals consisting of 2193
patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct
disease types. Our experimental results also demonstrated the power of feature
selection and transformation combined with using ANF in patient clustering.
Moreover, eigengap analysis suggests that the learned affinity matrices of four
cancer types using our proposed framework may have successfully captured
patient group structure and can be used for discovering unknown cancer
subtypes.

order to investigate grain size effects as well, we introduce two additional

Relative velocity between dust and gas strongly depends on the drag force. We
include collisional drag force and coulomb drag force. We find that, in a
compact H$_\mathrm{II}$ region, a dust cavity region is formed by radiation
pressure. Resulting dust cavity sizes (~0.2 pc) agree with observational
estimates reasonably well. Since dust inside an H$_\mathrm{II}$ region is
strongly charged, relative velocity between dust and gas is mainly determined
by the coulomb drag force. Strength of the coulomb drag force is about 2-order
of magnitude larger than that of the collisional drag force. In addition, in a
cloud of mass $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$, we find that the radiation pressure changes
the grain size distribution inside H$_\mathrm{II}$ regions. Since large (0.1
$\mathrm{\mu m}$) dust grains are accelerated more efficiently than small (0.01
$\mathrm{\mu m}$) grains, the large to small grain mass ratio becomes smaller
by an order of magnitude compared with the initial one. Resulting dust size
distributions depend on the luminosity of the radiation source. The large and
small grain segregation becomes weaker when we assume stronger radiation
source, since dust grain charges become larger under stronger radiation and
hence coulomb drag force becomes stronger.

introduction of the necessity and benefits taking the dislon approach, that why
the dislon Hamiltonian takes its current form. Then we study the
electron-dislocation and phonon-dislocation scattering problems, using the
dislon formalism. Both the effective electron and phonon theories are derived,
from which the role of dislocations on electronic and phononic transport
properties is computed. Comparing with the traditional dislocation scattering
studies which are intrinsically single-particle, low-order perturbation and
classical quenched defect in nature, the dislon theory not only allows easy
incorporation of quantum many-body effects such as electron correlation,
electron-phonon interaction and higher-order scattering events, but also allows
proper consideration of dislocation's long-range strain field and the dynamic
aspects on equal footing. This means that instead of developing individual
model for a specific dislocation scattering problem, the dislon theory allows
for the calculation of electronic structure and electrical transport, thermal
transport, optical and superconducting properties, etc., under one unified
theory. Furthermore, the dislon theory has another advantage over empirical
models in that it requires no fitting parameters. The dislon theory could serve
as a major computational tool to understand the role of dislocations on
multiple materials' functional properties at an unprecedented level of clarity,
and may have wide applications in dislocated energy materials.

scales as measured by the ratio rE of kinetic energy dissipation to its

study of the unforced Boussinesq equations mostly on grids of 10243 points,

conditions are either isotropic and at large scale for the velocity, and zero
for the temperature {\theta}, or in geostrophic balance. Three regimes in Fr
are observed: dominant waves, eddy-wave interactions and strong turbulence. A
wave-turbulence balance for the transfer time leads to rE growing linearly with
Fr in the intermediate regime, with a saturation at ~0.3 or more, depending on
initial conditions for larger Froude numbers. The Ellison scale is also found
to scale linearly with Fr, and the flux Richardson number Rf transitions for
roughly the same parameter values as well. Putting together the 3 relationships
of the model allows for the prediction of mixing efficiency scaling as
Fr-2~RB-1 in the low and intermediate regimes, whereas for higher Fr, it scales
as RB-1/2, as already observed: as turbulence strengthens, rE~1, the velocity
is isotropic and smaller buoyancy fluxes altogether correspond to a decoupling
of velocity and temperature fluctuations, the latter becoming passive.

dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models

formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an
evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input
responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM
model's predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much higher than
word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance

information in a way that is hidden from a determined attacker. A variety of
techniques have been proposed for design obfuscation including look-alike cells
in which functionality is determined by hard to observe mechanisms including
dummy vias or transistor threshold voltages. Threshold-based obfuscation is
especially promising because threshold voltages cannot be observed optically
and require more sophisticated measurements by the attacker. In this work, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of a methodology that applies threshold-defined
behavior to memory cells, in combination with error correcting codes to achieve
a high degree of protection against invasive reverse engineering. The
combination of error correction and small threshold manipulations is
significant because it makes the attacker's job harder without compromising the
reliability of the obfuscated key. We present analysis to quantify key
reliability of our approach, and its resistance to reverse engineering attacks
that seek to extract the key through imperfect measurement of transistor
threshold voltages. The security analysis and cost metrics we provide allow
designers to make a quantifiable tradeoff between cost and security. We find
that the combination of small threshold offsets and stronger error correcting
codes are advantageous when security is the primary objective.

combination of the two. The cold outer belts of many systems have been imaged,
facilitating their study in great detail. Far less is known about the warm
components, including the origin of the dust. The regularity of the disk
temperatures indicates an underlying structure that may be linked to the water
snow line. If the dust is generated from collisions in an exo-asteroid belt,
the dust will likely trace the location of the water snow line in the
primordial protoplanetary disk where planetesimal growth was enhanced. If
instead the warm dust arises from the inward transport from a reservoir of icy
material farther out in the system, the dust location is expected to be set by
the current snow line. We analyze the SEDs of a large sample of debris disks
with warm components. We find that warm components in single-component systems
(those without detectable cold components) follow the primordial snow line
rather than the current snow line, so they likely arise from exo-asteroid
belts. While the locations of many warm components in two-component systems are
also consistent with the primordial snow line, there is more diversity among
these systems, suggesting additional effects play a role.

within video coding standards using small modifications to the lossy coding

simply entropy code the prediction residual. However, this approach is
inefficient at compression. A more efficient and popular approach is to skip
transform and quantization but also process the residual block with DPCM, along
the horizontal or vertical direction, prior to entropy coding. This paper
explores an alternative approach based on processing the residual block with
integer-to-integer (i2i) transforms. I2i transforms can map integer pixels to
integer transform coefficients without increasing the dynamic range and can be
used for lossless compression. We focus on lossless intra coding and develop
novel i2i approximations of the odd type-3 DST (ODST-3). Experimental results
with the HEVC reference software show that the developed i2i approximations of
the ODST-3 improve lossless intra-frame compression efficiency with respect to

have motivated research on creating technologies that allow people not only to

presented to them by information retrieval systems. Whereas technology is in
place for filtering information according to relevance and/or credibility, no
single measure currently exists for evaluating the accuracy or precision (and
more generally effectiveness) of both the relevance and the credibility of
retrieved results. One obvious way of doing so is to measure relevance and
credibility effectiveness separately, and then consolidate the two measures
into one. There at least two problems with such an approach: (I) it is not
certain that the same criteria are applied to the evaluation of both relevance
and credibility (and applying different criteria introduces bias to the
evaluation); (II) many more and richer measures exist for assessing relevance
effectiveness than for assessing credibility effectiveness (hence risking
further bias).
  Motivated by the above, we present two novel types of evaluation measures
that are designed to measure the effectiveness of both relevance and
credibility in ranked lists of retrieval results. Experimental evaluation on a
small human-annotated dataset (that we make freely available to the research
community) shows that our measures are expressive and intuitive in their

embedded particles to probe the local mechanical properties of soft materials.
Despite its appealing conceptual simplicity, PT-$\mu$r requires calibration
procedures and operating assumptions that constitute a practical barrier to a
wider adoption. Here we demonstrate Differential Dynamic Microscopy
microrheology (DDM-$\mu$r), a tracking-free approach based on the multi-scale,
temporal correlation study of the image intensity fluctuations that are
observed in microscopy experiments as a consequence of the motion of the
tracers. We show that the mechanical moduli of an arbitrary sample are
determined correctly in a wide frequency range, provided that the standard DDM
analysis is reinforced with a novel, iterative, self-consistent procedure that
fully exploits the multi-scale information made available by DDM. Our approach
to DDM-$\mu$r does not require any prior calibration, is in agreement with both
traditional rheology and Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy microrheology, and works
in conditions where PT-$\mu$r fails, providing thus an operationally simple,
calibration-free probe of soft materials.

  Observations","To appear in SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subject to reasonable conditions, in large population stochastic dynamics
games, where the agents are coupled by the system's mean field (i.e. the state
distribution of the generic agent) through their nonlinear dynamics and their
nonlinear cost functions, it can be shown that a best response control action
for each agent exists which (i) depends only upon the individual agent's state
observations and the mean field, and (ii) achieves a $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibrium for the system. In this work we formulate a class of problems where
each agent has only partial observations on its individual state. We employ
nonlinear filtering theory and the Separation Principle in order to analyze the
game in the asymptotically infinite population limit. The main result is that
the $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium property holds where the best response control
action of each agent depends upon the conditional density of its own state
generated by a nonlinear filter, together with the system's mean field.
Finally, comparing this MFG problem with state estimation to that found in the
literature with a major agent whose partially observed state process is
independent of the control action of any individual agent, it is seen that, in
contrast, the partially observed state process of any agent in this work
depends upon that agent's control action.

confinement of the quarks in each proton. We predict that high-multiplicity
hadronic ridges will also be produced in the high energy photon-photon

the flux tubes between the quark and antiquark of each high energy photon will

production and ridge formation can be controlled in a novel way at the LHC by
observing the azimuthal correlations of the scattering planes of the
ultra-peripheral protons with the orientation of the produced ridges.
Photon-photon collisions can thus illuminate the fundamental physics underlying
the ridge effect and the physics of color confinement in QCD.

(DSPL) in a network growth model which evolves by node duplication (ND). The
model captures essential properties of the structure and growth dynamics of
social networks, acquaintance networks and scientific citation networks, where
duplication mechanisms play a major role. Starting from an initial seed
network, at each time step a random node, referred to as a mother node, is
selected for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network, forming a
link to the mother node, and with probability $p$ to each one of its neighbors.
The degree distribution of the resulting network turns out to follow a
power-law distribution, thus the ND network is a scale-free network. To
calculate the DSPL we derive a master equation for the time evolution of the
probability $P_t(L=\ell)$, $\ell=1,2,\dots$, where $L$ is the distance between
a pair of nodes and $t$ is the time. Finding an exact analytical solution of
the master equation, we obtain a closed form expression for $P_t(L=\ell)$. The
mean distance, $\langle L \rangle_t$, and the diameter, $\Delta_t$, are found
to scale like $\ln t$, namely the ND network is a small world network. The
variance of the DSPL is also found to scale like $\ln t$. Interestingly, the
mean distance and the diameter exhibit properties of a small world network,
rather than the ultrasmall world network behavior observed in other scale-free
networks, in which $\langle L \rangle_t \sim \ln \ln t$.

general, are often employed both for (a) selecting the optimal combination of
algorithms and values of hyper-parameters (called a configuration) for
producing the final predictive model, and (b) estimating the predictive
performance of the final model. However, the cross-validated performance of the
best configuration is optimistically biased. We present an efficient bootstrap
method that corrects for the bias, called Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV (BBC-CV).
BBC-CV's main idea is to bootstrap the whole process of selecting the
best-performing configuration on the out-of-sample predictions of each
configuration, without additional training of models. In comparison to the
alternatives, namely the nested cross-validation and a method by Tibshirani and
Tibshirani, BBC-CV is computationally more efficient, has smaller variance and
bias, and is applicable to any metric of performance (accuracy, AUC,
concordance index, mean squared error). Subsequently, we employ again the idea
of bootstrapping the out-of-sample predictions to speed up the CV process.
Specifically, using a bootstrap-based hypothesis test we stop training of
models on new folds of statistically-significantly inferior configurations. We
name the method Bootstrap Corrected with Early Dropping CV (BCED-CV) that is
both efficient and provides accurate performance estimates.

supernovae (SNe), but until now, it has been observed only in core-collapse
SNe. The level of thermal X-ray emission is a direct measure of the density of
the circumstellar medium (CSM), and the absence of X-ray emission from Type Ia
SNe has been interpreted as a sign of a very low density CSM. In this paper, we
report late-time (500--800 days after discovery) X-ray detections of SN 2012ca
in {\it Chandra} data. The presence of hydrogen in the initial spectrum led to
a classification of Type Ia-CSM, ostensibly making it the first SN~Ia detected
with X-rays. Our analysis of the X-ray data favors an asymmetric medium, with a
high-density component which supplies the X-ray emission. The data suggest a
number density $> 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the higher-density medium, which is
consistent with the large observed Balmer decrement if it arises from
collisional excitation. This is high compared to most core-collapse SNe, but it
may be consistent with densities suggested for some Type IIn or superluminous
SNe. If SN 2012ca is a thermonuclear SN, the large CSM density could imply
clumps in the wind, or a dense torus or disk, consistent with the
single-degenerate channel. A remote possibility for a core-degenerate channel
involves a white dwarf merging with the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant
branch star shortly before the explosion, leading to a common envelope around
the SN.

decision-making processes. However, this data is typically purchased from
vendors, which means agencies must understand its potential benefits beforehand
in order to properly assess its value relative to the cost of acquisition.
While the literature concerned with trajectory data is rich, it is naturally
fragmented and focused on technical contributions in niche areas, which makes
it difficult for government agencies to assess its value across different
transportation domains. To overcome this issue, the current paper explores
trajectory data from the perspective of a road transportation agency interested
in acquiring trajectories to enhance its analyses. The paper provides a
literature review illustrating applications of trajectory data in six areas of
road transportation systems analysis: demand estimation, modeling human
behavior, designing public transit, traffic performance measurement and
prediction, environment and safety. In addition, it visually explores 20
million GPS traces in Maryland, illustrating existing and suggesting new
applications of trajectory data.

can affect the general perturbations. We consider Einstein gravity extended
with Ricci tensor polynomial invariants, which admits Einstein metrics with
appropriate effective cosmological constants as its vacuum solutions. We
construct three types of quasi-topological gravities. The first type is for the
most general static metrics with spherical, toroidal or hyperbolic isometries.
The second type is for the special static metrics where $g_{tt} g_{rr}$ is
constant. The third type is the linearized quasi-topological gravities on the
Einstein metrics. We construct and classify results that are either dependent
on or independent of dimensions, up to the tenth order. We then consider a
subset of these three types and obtain Lovelock-like quasi-topological
gravities, that are independent of the dimensions. The linearized gravities on
Einstein metrics on all dimensions are simply Einstein and hence ghost free.
The theories become quasi-topological on static metrics in one specific
dimension, but non-trivial in others. We also focus on the quasi-topological
Ricci cubic invariant in four dimensions as a specific example to study its
effect on holography, including shear viscosity, thermoelectric DC
conductivities and butterfly velocity. In particular, we find that the

the Perseus cluster, which implied that its core is fairly ""quiescent"", with
velocities less than $\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$, despite the presence of an active
galactic nucleus and sloshing cold fronts. Building on previous work, we use
synthetic Hitomi/SXS observations of the hot plasma of a simulated cluster with
sloshing gas motions and varying viscosity to analyze its velocity structure in
a similar fashion. We find that sloshing motions can produce line shifts and
widths similar to those measured by Hitomi. We find these measurements are
unaffected by the value of the gas viscosity, since its effects are only
manifested clearly on angular scales smaller than the SXS $\sim$1' PSF. The PSF
biases the line shift of regions near the core as much as $\sim 40-50$ km
s$^{-1}$, so it is crucial to model this effect carefully. We also infer that
if sloshing motions dominate the observed velocity gradient, Perseus must be
observed from a line of sight which is somewhat inclined from the plane of
these motions, but one that still allows the spiral pattern to be visible.
Finally, we find that assuming isotropy of motions can underestimate the total
velocity and kinetic energy of the core in our simulation by as much as
$\sim$60%. However, the total kinetic energy in our simulated cluster core is
still less than 10% of the thermal energy in the core, in agreement with the
Hitomi observations.

time-varying loads. The application of this type of model, which is standard in
reliability analysis, is novel in this context, which has been dominated by
accumulated damage models (ADMs) over more than half a century. The proposed
model is compared with one of the traditional ADMs. Our statistical results
based on a Bayesian analysis of experimental data highlight the limitations of
using accelerated testing data to assess long-term reliability, as seen in the
wide posterior intervals. This suggests the need for more comprehensive testing
in future applications, or to encode appropriate expert knowledge in the priors
used for Bayesian analysis.

screening. Waveform inversion-based image reconstruction methods account for
higher order diffraction effects and can produce high-resolution USCT images,
but are computationally demanding. Recently, a source encoding technique was
combined with stochastic gradient descent to greatly reduce image
reconstruction times. However, this method bundles the stochastic data fidelity
term with the deterministic regularization term. This limitation can be
overcome by replacing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a structured
optimization method, such as the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that
exploits knowledge of the composition of the cost function. In this work, the
dual averaging method is combined with source encoding techniques to improve
the effectiveness of regularization while maintaining the reduced
reconstruction times afforded by source encoding. It is demonstrated that each
iteration can be decomposed into a gradient descent step based on the data
fidelity term and a proximal update step corresponding to the regularization
term. Furthermore, the regularization term is never explicitly differentiated,
allowing non-smooth regularization penalties to be naturally incorporated. The
wave equation is solved by use of a time-domain method. The effectiveness of
this approach is demonstrated through computer-simulation and experimental
studies. The results suggest that the dual averaging method can produce images
with less noise and comparable resolution to those obtained by use of
stochastic gradient descent.

suitable strategies for monitoring the execution and incorporate recovery and
adaptation mechanisms so to make distributed programs more flexible and robust.
The typical approach that is currently adopted is to embed such mechanisms in

solves a hybrid model composed of gyrokinetic ions (GKI) and an isothermal

important near the ion gyro-radius scale while electron kinetic effects are
ordered out by an electron-ion mass ratio expansion. The code is developed by
incorporating the ITEF approximation into {\tt AstroGK}, an Eulerian $\delta f$
gyrokinetics code specialized to a slab geometry [R. Numata et al., J. Compute.

ITEF equations implicitly while the nonlinear terms are treated explicitly. We
show linear and nonlinear benchmark tests to prove the validity and
applicability of the simulation code. Since the fast electron timescale is
eliminated by the mass ratio expansion, the Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy condition
is much less restrictive than in full gyrokinetic codes; the present hybrid
code runs $\sim 2\sqrt{m_\mathrm{i}/m_\mathrm{e}} \sim 100$ times faster than
{\tt AstroGK}\ with a single ion species and kinetic electrons where
$m_\mathrm{i}/m_\mathrm{e}$ is the ion-electron mass ratio. The improvement of
the computational time makes it feasible to execute ion scale gyrokinetic
simulations with a high velocity space resolution and to run multiple
simulations to determine the dependence of turbulent dynamics on parameters
such as electron--ion temperature ratio and plasma beta.

still not well established. One popular BLR model is the disk-wind model that
offers a geometric unification of a quasar based on the angle of viewing. We
construct a simple kinematical disk-wind model with a narrow outflowing wind
angle. The model is combined with radiative transfer in the Sobolev, or high
velocity, limit. We examine how angle of viewing affects the observed
characteristics of the emission line, especially the line widths and velocity
offsets. The line profiles exhibit distinct properties depending on the
orientation, wind opening angle, and region of the wind where the emission
arises.
  At low inclination angle (close to face-on), we find the shape of the
emission line is asymmetric with narrow width and significantly blueshifted. As
the inclination angle increases (close to edge-on), the line profile becomes
more symmetric, broader, and less blueshifted. Additionally, lines that arise
close to the base of the disk wind, near the accretion disk, tend to be broad
and symmetric. The relative increase in blueshift of the emission line with
increasing wind vertical distance is larger for polar winds compared with
equatorial winds. By considering the optical thickness of the wind,
single-peaked line profiles are recovered for the intermediate and equatorial
outflowing wind. The model is able to reproduce a faster response in either the
red and blue sides of the line profile found in reverberation mapping studies.
A quicker response in the red side is achieved in the model with a polar wind
and intermediate wind opening angle at low viewing angle. The blue side
response is faster for an equatorial wind seen at high inclination.

classification performance of deep rectifier networks over shallow rectifier
networks from the geometrical perspective of piecewise linear (PWL) classifier
boundaries. We show that, for a given threshold on the approximation error, the
required number of boundary facets to approximate a general smooth boundary
grows exponentially with the dimension of the data, and thus the number of
boundary facets, referred to as boundary resolution, of a PWL classifier is an
important quality measure that can be used to estimate a lower bound on the
classification errors. However, learning naively an exponentially large number
of boundary facets requires the determination of an exponentially large number
of parameters and also requires an exponentially large number of training
patterns. To overcome this issue of ""curse of dimensionality"", compressive
representations of high resolution classifier boundaries are required. To show
the superior compressive power of deep rectifier networks over shallow
rectifier networks, we prove that the maximum boundary resolution of a single
hidden layer rectifier network classifier grows exponentially with the number
of units when this number is smaller than the dimension of the patterns. When
the number of units is larger than the dimension of the patterns, the growth
rate is reduced to a polynomial order. Consequently, the capacity of generating
a high resolution boundary will increase if the same large number of units are
arranged in multiple layers instead of a single hidden layer. Taking high
dimensional spherical boundaries as examples, we show how deep rectifier
networks can utilize geometric symmetries to approximate a boundary with the
same accuracy but with a significantly fewer number of parameters than single
hidden layer nets.

thus provide a benchmark-quality EOS that surpasses that of semi-empirical and

the 99.9% confidence level in the amplitude spectra. As LAMOST

saturated whistler instability on the viscous heating and nonthermal
acceleration of electrons in a shearing, collisionless plasma with a growing
magnetic field, \textbf{B}. In this setup, an electron pressure anisotropy with
$p_{\perp,e} > p_{||,e}$ naturally arises due to the adiabatic invariance of
the electron magnetic moment ($p_{||,e}$ and $p_{\perp,e}$ are the pressures
parallel and perpendicular to \textbf{B}). If the anisotropy is large enough,
the whistler instability arises, efficiently scattering the electrons and
limiting $\Delta p_e$ ($\equiv p_{\perp,e}-p_{||,e}$). In this context, $\Delta
p_e$ taps into the plasma velocity shear, producing electron heating by the so
called anisotropic viscosity. In our simulations, we permanently drive the
growth of $|\textbf{B}|$ by externally imposing a plasma shear, allowing us to
self-consistently capture the long-term, saturated whistler instability
evolution. We find that besides the viscous heating, the scattering by whistler
modes can stochastically accelerate electrons to nonthermal energies. This
acceleration is most prominent when initially $\beta_e\sim 1$, gradually
decreasing its efficiency for larger values of $\beta_e$ ($\equiv 8\pi
p_e/|\textbf{B}|^2$). If initially $\beta_e \sim 1$, the final electron energy
distribution can be approximately described by a thermal component, plus a
power-law tail with spectral index $\sim 3.7$. In these cases, the nonthermal
tail accounts for $\sim 5\%$ of the electrons, and for $\sim 15\%$ of their
kinetic energy. We discuss the implications of our results for electron heating
and acceleration in low-collisionality astrophysical environments, such as
low-luminosity accretion flows.

the simplest and is obtained by decomposing a phase-insensitive channel as a
pure-loss channel followed by a quantum-limited amplifier channel. We prove
that the data-processing bound can be at most 1.45 bits larger than a known
lower bound on these capacities of the phase-insensitive Gaussian channel. We
discuss another data-processing upper bound as well. Two other upper bounds,
which we call the ""$\varepsilon$-degradable bound"" and the
""$\varepsilon$-close-degradable bound,"" are established using the notion of
approximate degradability along with energy constraints. We find a strong
limitation on any potential superadditivity of the coherent information of any
phase-insensitive Gaussian channel in the low-noise regime, as the
data-processing bound is very near to a known lower bound in such cases. We
also find improved achievable rates of private communication through bosonic
thermal channels, by employing coding schemes that make use of displaced
thermal states. We end by proving that an optimal Gaussian input state for the
energy-constrained, generalized channel divergence of two particular Gaussian
channels is the two-mode squeezed vacuum state that saturates the energy
constraint. What remains open for several interesting channel divergences, such
as the diamond norm or the Renyi channel divergence, is to determine whether,

Existing
tensor clustering methods either fail to account for the dynamic nature of the

between statistical guarantee and computational efficiency for existing tensor
clustering solutions. In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a
new dynamic tensor clustering method, which takes into account both sparsity
and fusion structures, and enjoys strong statistical guarantees as well as high
computational efficiency. Our proposal is based upon a new structured tensor
factorization that encourages both sparsity and smoothness in parameters along
the specified tensor modes. Computationally, we develop a highly efficient
optimization algorithm that benefits from substantial dimension reduction. In
theory, we first establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the estimator from
the structured tensor factorization. Built upon this error bound, we then
derive the rate of convergence of the estimated cluster centers, and show that
the estimated clusters recover the true cluster structures with a high
probability. Moreover, our proposed method can be naturally extended to
co-clustering of multiple modes of the tensor data. The efficacy of our
approach is illustrated via simulations and a brain dynamic functional
connectivity analysis from an Autism spectrum disorder study.

as those of the $N$-body problem, is central to understanding a wide range of
dynamics in astrophysics, from galaxy formation to planetary chaos. Because
generally no analytic solution exists to these equations, researchers rely on
numerical methods which are prone to various errors. In an effort to mitigate
these errors, powerful symplectic integrators have been employed. But
symplectic integrators can be severely limited because they are not compatible
with adaptive stepping and thus they have difficulty accommodating changing
time and length scales. A promising alternative is time-reversible integration,
which can handle adaptive time stepping, but the errors due to time-reversible
integration in astrophysics are less understood. The goal of this work is to
study analytically and numerically the errors caused by time-reversible
integration, with and without adaptive stepping. We derive the modified
differential equations of these integrators to perform the error analysis. As
an example, we consider the trapezoidal rule, a reversible non-symplectic
integrator, and show it gives secular energy error increase for a pendulum
problem and for a H\'{e}non---Heiles orbit. We conclude that using reversible
integration does not guarantee good energy conservation and that, when
possible, use of symplectic integrators is favored. We also show that
time-symmetry and time-reversibility are properties that are distinct for an
integrator.

discrete models. Second, deep neural networks can be used to automatically
combine input features, and including non-local features that capture semantic

has been studied for more than four decades. Recently, we have witnessed the
significantly improved performance of contour detection thanks to the
development of CNNs. Beyond purusing performance in existing natural image

image analysis. Segmenting various objects from radiology images or pathology
images requires accurate detection of contours. However, some problems, such as

five-dimensional gyrokinetic turbulence simulations, which have been successful
in predicting turbulence and transport in the core. The additional challenges
of boundary-plasma simulation necessitate the development of new gyrokinetic
codes or major modifications to existing core gyrokinetic codes. In this
thesis, we develop the first gyrokinetic continuum code capable of simulating
plasma turbulence on open magnetic field lines, which is a key feature of a
tokamak scrape-off layer. In contrast to prior attempts at this problem, we use
an energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space. To model
the interaction between the plasma and the wall, we design conducting-sheath
boundary conditions that permit local currents into and out of the wall. We
start by designing spatially one-dimensional kinetic models of parallel SOL
dynamics and solve these systems using novel continuum algorithms. By
generalizing these algorithms to higher dimensions and adding a model for
collisions, we present results from the first gyrokinetic continuum simulations
of turbulence on two types of open-field-line systems. The first simulation
features uniform and straight field lines, such as found in some linear plasma

move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices
of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into
adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim
of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the
opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by
attackers by occupying selected vertices. We study strategies for allocating
vertices to be occupied by the team of defenders to block attacking agents. We
show that the decision version of the problem of area protection is PSPACE-hard
under the assumption that agents can allocate their target vertices multiple
times. Further we develop various on-line vertex-allocation strategies for the
defender team in a simplified variant of the problem with single stage vertex
allocation and evaluated their performance in multiple benchmarks. The success
of a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of
the contributions of this work is that we identify suitable vertex-allocation
strategies for diverse instance types. In particular, we introduce a
simulation-based method that identifies and tries to capture bottlenecks in the
graph, that are frequently used by the attackers. Our experimental evaluation
suggests that this method often allows a successful defense even in instances

essential for planet growth, satellite formation, and planet detection. We
study the millimetre and centimetre emission from accreting CPDs by using the
simple $\alpha$ disc model. We find that it is easier to detect CPDs at shorter
radio wavelengths (e.g. $\lambda\lesssim$ 1 mm). For example, if the system is
140 pc away from us, deep observations (e.g. 5 hours) at ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm)
are sensitive to as small as 0.03 lunar mass of dust in CPDs. If the CPD is
around a Jupiter mass planet 20 AU away from the host star and has
$\alpha\lesssim 0.001$, ALMA can detect this disc when it accretes faster than
$10^{-10} M_{\odot}/yr$. ALMA can also detect the ""minimum mass sub-nebulae""
disc if such a disc exists around a young planet in YSOs. However, to
distinguish the embedded compact CPD from the circumstellar disc material, we
should observe circumstellar discs with large gaps/cavities using the highest
resolution possible. We also calculate the CPD fluxes at VLA bands, and discuss
the possibility of detecting radio emission from jets/winds launched in CPDs.
Finally we argue that, if the radial drift of dust particles is considered, the
drifting timescale for millimetre dust in CPDs can be extremely short. It only
takes 10$^2$-10$^{3}$ years for CPDs to lose millimetre dust. Thus, for CPDs to
be detectable at radio wavelengths, mm-sized dust in CPDs needs to be
replenished continuously, or the disc has a significant fraction of
micron-sized dust or a high gas surface density so that the particle drifting
timescale is long, or the radial drift is prevented by other means (e.g.
pressure traps).

is one of the most important challenges of the contemporary physics. In
principle, there is no generally valid theoretical method that could solve this
problem. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to identify the
criticality of quantum systems in higher dimensions. Departing from the
analysis of the numerical renormalization group flows, we build a general
equivalence between the higher-dimensional ground state and a one-dimensional
(1D) quantum state defined in the imaginary time direction in terms of the
so-called time matrix product state (tMPS). We show that the criticality of the
targeted model can be faithfully identified by the tMPS, using the mature
scaling schemes of correlation length and entanglement entropy in 1D quantum
theories. We benchmark our proposal with the results obtained for the
Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate critical
scaling relation of the tMPS for the gapless case, and a trivial scaling for
the gapped case with spatial anisotropy. The critical scaling behaviors are
insensitive to the system size, suggesting the criticality can be identified in
small systems. Our tMPS scheme for critical scaling shows clearly that the
spin-1/2 kagom\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a gapless ground state. More
generally, the present study indicates that the 1D conformal field theories in
imaginary time provide a very useful tool to characterize the criticality of
higher dimensional quantum systems.

regularizing grasping interaction learning through 3D geometry prediction.
Specifically, we formulate the learning of deep geometry-aware grasping model
in two steps: First, we learn to build mental geometry-aware representation by
reconstructing the scene (i.e., 3D occupancy grid) from RGBD input via
generative 3D shape modeling. Second, we learn to predict grasping outcome with
its internal geometry-aware representation. The learned outcome prediction
model is used to sequentially propose grasping solutions via
analysis-by-synthesis optimization. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) To best
of our knowledge, we are presenting for the first time a method to learn a
6-DOF grasping net from RGBD input; (2) We build a grasping dataset from
demonstrations in virtual reality with rich sensory and interaction
annotations. This dataset includes 101 everyday objects spread across 7
categories, additionally, we propose a data augmentation strategy for effective
learning; (3) We demonstrate that the learned geometry-aware representation
leads to about 10 percent relative performance improvement over the baseline
CNN on grasping objects from our dataset. (4) We further demonstrate that the
model generalizes to novel viewpoints and object instances.

cause of death from cancer. Generic large imaging instruments used in cancer
diagnosis have sensitivity, spatial resolution, and contrast inadequate for the
task of imaging details of a small organ such as the prostate. In addition,
multimodality imaging can play a significant role merging anatomical and
functional details coming from simultaneous PET and MRI. Indeed,
multi-parametric PET/MRI was demonstrated to improve diagnosis, but it suffers
from too many false positives. In order to address the above limits of the
current techniques, we have proposed, built and tested, thanks to the TOPEM
project funded by Italian National Institute of Nuclear Phisics a prototype of
an endorectal PET-TOF/MRI probe. In the applied magnification PET geometry,
performance is dominated by a high-resolution detector placed closer to the
source. The expected spatial resolution in the selected geometry is about 1.5
mm FWHM and efficiency a factor of 2 with respect to what obtained with the
conventional PET scanner. In our experimental studies, we have obtained timing
resolution of ~ 320 ps FWHM and at the same time Depth of Interaction (DOI)
resolution of under 1 mm. Tests also showed that mutual adverse PET-MR effects
are minimal. In addition, the matching endorectal RF coil was designed, built
and tested. In the next planned studies, we expect that benefiting from the
further progress in scintillator crystal surface treatment, in SiPM technology
and associated electronics would allow us to significantly improve TOF

ahead of lightning leaders and its effects on electron acceleration and
multiplication. In this paper, we derive a new set of constraints to do more
realistic modeling. We determine initial conditions based on in situ
measurements of electric field and vertical separation between the main charge
layers of thunderclouds. A maximum electric field strength of 50 kV/cm at sea
level is introduced as the upper constraint for the leader electric field. The
threshold for electron avalanches to develop of 2.86 kV/cm at sea level is
introduced as the lower value. With these constraints, we determine a region
where acceleration and multiplication of electrons occur. The maximum potential
difference in this region is found to be $\sim$52 MV, and the corresponding
number of avalanche multiplication lengths is $\sim$3.5. We then quantify the
effect of the ambient electric field compared to the leader field at the upper
altitude of the negative tip. Finally, we argue that only leaders with the
highest potential difference between its tips ($\sim$600 MV) can be candidates
for the production of TGFs. However, with the assumptions we have used, these
cannot explain the observed maximum energies of at least 40 MeV. Open questions
with regard to the temporal development of the streamer zone and its effect on
the shape of the electric field remain.

mutual information (MI)-optimized geometric-, probabilistic-, and joint

and wide interest in realizing apparently counterintuitive quantum effects. In

demonstrating the joint weak value of two observables where the coupling
strength is restricted to the second order. In this paper, we extend such a
formulation by providing a complete treatment of joint weak measurement
scenario for all-order-coupling for the observable satisfying $A^2=\mathbb{I}$

considering the probe state to be discrete as well as continuous variable, we
demonstrate how the joint weak value can be inferred for any given strength of
the coupling. A particularly interesting result we pointed out that even if the
initial pointer state is uncorrelated, the single pointer displacement can
provide the information about the joint weak value, if at least third order of
the coupling is taken into account. As an application of our scheme, we provide
an all-order-coupling treatment of the well-known Hardy paradox by considering
the continuous as well as discrete meter states and show how the negative joint
weak probabilities emerge in the quantum paradoxes at the weak coupling limit.

  Ranking","a shorter version was presented in ACML 2013",,,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bipartite ranking is a fundamental ranking problem that learns to order
relevant instances ahead of irrelevant ones. The pair-wise approach for
bi-partite ranking construct a quadratic number of pairs to solve the problem,
which is infeasible for large-scale data sets. The point-wise approach, albeit
more efficient, often results in inferior performance. That is, it is difficult
to conduct bipartite ranking accurately and efficiently at the same time. In
this paper, we develop a novel active sampling scheme within the pair-wise
approach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. The scheme is inspired from
active learning and can reach a competitive ranking performance while focusing
only on a small subset of the many pairs during training. Moreover, we propose
a general Combined Ranking and Classification (CRC) framework to accurately
conduct bipartite ranking. The framework unifies point-wise and pair-wise
approaches and is simply based on the idea of treating each instance point as a
pseudo-pair. Experiments on 14 real-word large-scale data sets demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm of Active Sampling within CRC, when coupled with a
linear Support Vector Machine, usually outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise
and pair-wise ranking approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

  Microgrid Planning","10 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a chance constrained information gap decision model for
multi-period microgrid expansion planning (MMEP) considering two categories of
uncertainties, namely random and non-random uncertainties. The main task of
MMEP is to determine the optimal sizing, type selection, and installation time
of distributed energy resources (DER) in microgrid. In the proposed
formulation, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is applied to hedge against
non-random uncertainties of long-term demand growth. Then, chance constraints
are imposed in the operational stage to address the random uncertainties of
hourly renewable energy generation and load variation. The objective of chance
constrained information gap decision model is to maximize the robustness level
of DER investment meanwhile satisfying a set of operational constraints with a
high probability. The integration of IGDT and chance constrained program,
however, makes it very challenging to compute. To address this challenge, we
propose and implement a strengthened bilinear Benders decomposition method.
Finally, the effectiveness of proposed planning model is verified through the
numerical studies on both the simple and practical complex microgrid. Also, our
new computational method demonstrates a superior solution capacity and
scalability. Compared to directly using a professional mixed integer
programming solver, it could reduce the computational time by orders of
magnitude.

Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We consider two analytic models, a pressure-driven
wind and a superbubble model, and a 3D cosmological simulation including gas
dynamics from the First Billion Years (FiBY) project. The analytic models are
normalized to match the diffuse X-ray emissivity of star-forming galaxies in
the nearby Universe. The cosmological simulation uses physically motivated star
formation and wind prescriptions, and includes radiative transfer corrections.
The models and the simulation all are found to produce sufficient heating of
the Intergalactic Medium to be detectable by current and planned radio
facilities through 21 cm measurements during the EoR. While the analytic models
predict a 21 cm emission signal relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background
sets in by $z_{\rm trans} \simeq 8 - 10$, the predicted signal in the FiBY
simulation remains in absorption until reionization completes. The 21 cm
absorption differential brightness temperature reaches a minimum of $\Delta T
\simeq -130$ to $-200$ mK, depending on model. Allowing for additional heat
from high mass X-ray binaries pushes the transition to emission to $z_{\rm
trans} \simeq 10 - 12$, with shallower absorption signatures having a minimum
of $\Delta T \simeq -110$ to $-140$ mK. The 21 cm signal may be a means of
distinguishing between the wind models, with the superbubble model favouring
earlier reheating. While an early transition to emission may indicate X-ray
binaries dominate the reheating, a transition to emission as early as $z_{\rm
trans} > 12$ would suggest the presence of additional heat sources.

In general, we find that atomic and molecular fluctuations in PIMD are larger
than in CEIMC which suggests that the potential energy surface from vdW-DF is
less structured than the one from Quantum Monte Carlo. We find qualitatively
different behaviors for systems prepared in the C2c structure for increasing
pressure. Within PIMD the C2c structure is dynamically partially stable for
P$\leq$250GPa only: it retains the symmetry of the molecular centers but not
the molecular orientation; at intermediate pressures it develops layered
structures like Pbcn or Ibam and transforms to the metallic Cmca-4 structure at
P$\geq$450GPa. Instead, within CEIMC, the C2c structure is found to be
dynamically stable at least up to 450GPa; at increasing pressure the molecular
bond length increases and the nuclear correlation decreases. For the other two
structures the two methods are in qualitative agreement although quantitative
differences remain. We discuss various structural properties and the electrical
conductivity. We find these structures become conducting around 350GPa but the
metallic Drude-like behavior is reached only at around 500GPa, consistent with
recent experimental claims.

binary matrices (called identifiability matrix). Several matrix operations are
introduced for identifiability matrix reduction with system equivalency
maintained. Based on the reduced identifiability matrices, the structural

planar graphs is at most 3. In particular, every finite planar graph is
definable in first-order logic with counting using at most 4 variables. The
previously best known upper bounds for the dimension and number of variables
were 14 and 15, respectively.
  First we show that, for dimension 3 and higher, the WL-algorithm correctly
tests isomorphism of graphs in a minor-closed class whenever it determines the
orbits of the automorphism group of any arc-colored 3-connected graph belonging
to this class.
  Then we prove that, apart from several exceptional graphs (which have
WL-dimension at most 2), the individualization of two correctly chosen vertices
of a colored 3-connected planar graph followed by the 1-dimensional
WL-algorithm produces the discrete vertex partition. This implies that the
3-dimensional WL-algorithm determines the orbits of a colored 3-connected
planar graph.
  As a byproduct of the proof, we get a classification of the 3-connected
planar graphs with fixing number 3.

a quantum device is rapidly gaining relevance. We present two protocols for a
classical verifier to verifiably delegate a quantum computation to two
non-communicating but entangled quantum provers. Our protocols have
near-optimal complexity in terms of the total resources employed by the
verifier and the honest provers, with the total number of operations of each
party, including the number of entangled pairs of qubits required of the honest
provers, scaling as $O(g\log g)$ for delegating a circuit of size $g$. This is
in contrast to previous protocols, which all require a prohibitively large
polynomial overhead. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is
linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning
neither prover can learn the circuit being delegated. The second protocol is
not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction. Our
main technical innovation is an efficient rigidity theorem which allows a
verifier to test that two entangled provers perform measurements specified by
an arbitrary $m$-qubit tensor product of single-qubit Clifford observables on
their respective halves of $m$ shared EPR pairs, with a robustness that is
independent of $m$. Our two-prover classical-verifier delegation protocols are
obtained by combining this rigidity theorem with a single-prover
quantum-verifier protocol for the verifiable delegation of a quantum
computation, introduced by Broadbent (Theory of Computing, 2018).

  For decades, 28 Cyg has exhibited four large-amplitude frequencies: two
closely spaced frequencies of spectroscopically confirmed $g$ modes near 1.5
c/d, one slightly lower exophotospheric (Stefl) frequency, and at 0.05 c/d the
difference frequency between the two g modes. This top-level framework is
indistinguishable from eta Cen (Paper I), which is also very similar in
spectral type, rotation rate, and viewing angle. The Stefl frequency is the
only one that does not seem to be affected by the difference frequency. The
amplitude of the latter undergoes large variations; around maximum the amount
of near-circumstellar matter is increased, and the amplitude of the Stefl
frequency grows by some factor. During such brightenings dozens of transient
spikes appear in the frequency spectrum, concentrated in three groups. Only
eleven frequencies were common to all years of BRITE observations.
  Be stars seem to be controlled by several coupled clocks, most of which are
not very regular on timescales of weeks to months but function for decades. The
combination of g modes to the low difference frequency and/or the atmospheric
response to it appears significantly nonlinear. Like in eta Cen, the
difference-frequency variability seems the main responsible for the modulation
of the star-to-disc mass transfer in 28 Cyg. A hierarchical set of difference
frequencies may reach the longest timescales known of the Be phenomenon.

modern epidemiology. While space often serves as a proxy, it can be
problematic. There are multiple ways to directly model water networks, but
these methods are not straightforward and can be difficult to implement. This
study suggests a simple approach for modeling water networks and diseases, and
applies this method to a dataset of self-reported gastrointestinal conditions
from a questionnaire-based population health survey in central Norway.
  Method: Our approach is based on a standard conditional autoregressive (CAR)
model. An inverse matrix was constructed, with nodes weighted based on the
distance to neighboring nodes within the networks. This matrix was then fitted
as a generic model. To illustrate its possible use, we utilized data taken from
a questionnaire-based population health survey, the HUNT Study, to measure
self-reported gastrointestinal complaints. For hypothesis testing, we used the
deviance information criterion (DIC) and included variables in a stepwise
manner.
  Results: The full model converged after six hours. We found no relation
between the water networks and the health conditions of people whose residences
connected to different parts of the network in the geographical area studied.
  Conclusion: All water network models are simplifications of the real
networks. Nevertheless, we suggest a valid approach for distinguishing between
the general spatial effect and the water network using a generic model.

structure, called a self-supporting structure, which is ready to be fabricated
via additive manufacturing without the usage of additional support structures.
Such supports in general have to be created during the fabricating process so
that the primary object can be manufactured layer by layer without collapse,
which is very time-consuming and waste of material.
  The proposed approach resolves this problem by formulating the
self-supporting requirements as a novel explicit quadratic continuous
constraint in the topology optimization problem, or specifically, requiring the
number of unsupported elements (in terms of the sum of squares of their
densities) to be zero. Benefiting form such novel formulations, computing
sensitivity of the self-supporting constraint with respect to the design
density is straightforward, which otherwise would require lots of research
efforts in general topology optimization studies. The derived sensitivity for
each element is only linearly dependent on its sole density, which, different
from previous layer-based sensitivities, consequently allows for a parallel
implementation and possible higher convergence rate. In addition, a discrete
convolution operator is also designed to detect the unsupported elements as
involved in each step of optimization iteration, and improves the detection
process 100 times as compared with simply enumerating these elements. The
approach works for cases of general overhang angle, or general domain, and
produces an optimized structures, and their associated optimal compliance, very
close to that of the reference structure obtained without considering the
self-supporting constraint, as demonstrated by extensive 2D and 3D benchmark
examples.

estimating $\gamma$ from this data. Let $\pi$ be the stationary distribution of

precise estimation of $\gamma$. Moreover, we provide the first procedure for
computing a fully data-dependent interval, from a single finite-length
trajectory of the chain, that traps the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}$ of the
chain at a prescribed confidence level. The interval does not require the
knowledge of any parameters of the chain. This stands in contrast to previous
approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset
mechanism, or additional prior knowledge. The interval is constructed around
the relaxation time $t_{\text{relax}} = 1/\gamma$, which is strongly related to
the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero roughly at a
$1/\sqrt{n}$ rate, where $n$ is the length of the sample path.

sparse excitation, both of which are unknown. Considering a linear convolution
model, as opposed to the standard circular convolution model, we derive a
sufficient condition for stable deconvolution. The columns of the linear
convolution matrix form a Riesz basis with the tightness of the Riesz bounds
determined by the autocorrelation of the blur kernel. Employing a Bayesian
framework results in a non-convex, non-smooth cost function consisting of an
$\ell_2$ data-fidelity term and a sparsity promoting $\ell_p$-norm ($0 \le p
\le 1$) regularizer. Since the $\ell_p$-norm is not differentiable at the
origin, we employ an $\epsilon$-regularized $\ell_p$-norm as a surrogate. The
data term is also non-convex in both the blur kernel and excitation. An
iterative scheme termed alternating minimization (Alt. Min.) $\ell_p-\ell_2$
projections algorithm (ALPA) is developed for optimization of the
$\epsilon$-regularized cost function. Further, we demonstrate that, in every
iteration, the $\epsilon$-regularized cost function is non-increasing and more
importantly, bounds the original $\ell_p$-norm-based cost. Due to non-convexity
of the cost, the accuracy of estimation is largely influenced by the
initialization. Considering regularized least-squares estimate as the
initialization, we analyze how the initialization errors are concentrated,
first in Gaussian noise, and then in bounded noise, the latter case resulting
in tighter bounds. Comparisons with state-of-the-art blind deconvolution
algorithms show that the deconvolution accuracy is higher in case of ALPA. In
the context of natural speech signals, ALPA results in accurate deconvolution
of a voiced speech segment into a sparse excitation and smooth vocal tract
response.

density in the Universe peaks at 1 < z < 2 and sharply declines towards z = 0.
But a clear picture of the underlying processes, in particular the evolution of
cold atomic (~100 K) and molecular gas phases, that drive such a strong
evolution is yet to emerge. MALS is designed to use MeerKAT's L- and UHF-band
receivers to carry out the most sensitive (N(HI)>10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$)
dust-unbiased search of intervening HI 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorption lines at 0
< z < 2. This will provide reliable measurements of the evolution of cold
atomic and molecular gas cross-sections of galaxies, and unravel the processes
driving the steep evolution in the SFR density. The large sample of HI and OH
absorbers obtained from the survey will (i) lead to tightest constraints on the
fundamental constants of physics, and (ii) be ideally suited to probe the
evolution of magnetic fields in disks of galaxies via Zeeman Splitting or
Rotation Measure synthesis. The survey will also provide an unbiased census of
HI and OH absorbers, i.e. cold gas associated with powerful AGNs (>10$^{24}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$) at 0 < z < 2, and will simultaneously deliver a blind HI and OH
emission line survey, and radio continuum survey. Here, we describe the MALS
survey design, observing plan and the science issues to be addressed under
various science themes.

$\mathcal{C}$ is chordal, then $I(\bar{\mathcal{C}})$ has a linear resolution
over all fields. The converse has recently been rejected, but the following
question which poses a weaker version of the converse is still open: ""if
$I(\bar{\mathcal{C}})$ has linear quotients, is $\mathcal{C}$ necessarily
chordal?"". Here, by introducing the concept of the ascent of a clutter, we
split this question into two simpler questions and present some clues in
support of an affirmative answer. In particular, we show that if
$I(\bar{\mathcal{C}})$ is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a simplicial complex
with a vertex decomposable Alexander dual, then $\mathcal{C}$ is chordal.

approach delivering single-scan 2D NMR images with unprecedented resilience to
field inhomogeneities. The method relies on performing a pre-acquisition
encoding and a subsequent image read out while using the disturbing frequency
inhomogeneities as part of the image formation processes, rather than as
artifacts to be overwhelmed by the application of external gradients. This
study introduces the use of this new single-shot MRI technique as a
diffusion-monitoring tool, for accessing regions that have hitherto been
unapproachable by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods. In order to achieve
this, xSPEN MRIs intrinsic diffusion weighting effects are formulated using a
customized, spatially-localized b-matrix analysis; with this, we devise a novel
diffusion-weighting scheme that both exploits and overcomes xSPENs strong
intrinsic weighting effects. The ability to provide reliable and robust
diffusion maps in challenging head and brain regions, including the eyes and
the optic nerves, is thus demonstrated in humans at 3T; new avenues for imaging
other body regions are also briefly discussed.

the analysis of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. AutoLens
simultaneously models the lens galaxy's light and mass whilst reconstructing
the extended source galaxy on an adaptive pixel-grid. The method's approach to
source-plane discretization is amorphous, adapting its clustering and
regularization to the intrinsic properties of the lensed source. The lens's
light is fitted using a superposition of Sersic functions, allowing AutoLens to
cleanly deblend its light from the source. Single component mass models
representing the lens's total mass density profile are demonstrated, which in
conjunction with light modeling can detect central images using a centrally
cored profile. Decomposed mass modeling is also shown, which can fully decouple
a lens's light and dark matter and determine whether the two component are
geometrically aligned. The complexity of the light and mass models are
automatically chosen via Bayesian model comparison. These steps form AutoLens's
automated analysis pipeline, such that all results in this work are generated
without any user-intervention. This is rigorously tested on a large suite of
simulated images, assessing its performance on a broad range of lens profiles,
source morphologies and lensing geometries. The method's performance is
excellent, with accurate light, mass and source profiles inferred for data sets
representative of both existing Hubble imaging and future Euclid wide-field

Recently Friggstad, Rezapour, Salavatipour [FOCS'16] and Cohen-Addad, Klein,
Mathieu [FOCS'16] showed that the standard local search algorithm yields a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in time $(n \cdot k)^{1/\epsilon^{O(d)}}$, giving
the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem in
low-dimensional Euclidean space. While local search achieves optimal
approximation guarantees, it is not competitive with the state-of-the-art
heuristics such as the famous $k$-means++ and $D^2$-sampling algorithms.
  In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap between theory and practice by
giving a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for low-dimensional $k$-means
running in time $n \cdot k \cdot (\log n)^{(d\epsilon^{-1})^{O(d)}}$, and so
matching the running time of the $k$-means++ and $D^2$-sampling heuristics up
to polylogarithmic factors. We speed-up the local search approach by making a
non-standard use of randomized dissections that allows to find the best local
move efficiently using a quite simple dynamic program. We hope that our
techniques could help design better local search heuristics for geometric
problems. We note that the doubly exponential dependency on $d$ is necessary as
$k$-means is APX-hard in dimension $d = \omega(\log n)$.

extension of this problem is the following: Suppose that the edges of the graph

this computation in the case of dense tensors. We also present sequential and
parallel algorithms that attain the lower bounds and are therefore
communication optimal. In particular, we show that the structure of the
computation allows for less communication than the straightforward approach of
casting the computation as a matrix multiplication operation.

users to annotate the data precisely. We describe a recurrent neural network

train and evaluate the system on 8 important fields using a dataset of 326,471
invoices. The recurrent neural network and baseline model achieve 0.891 and
0.887 average F1 scores respectively on seen invoice layouts. For the harder

units are often p-n junctions. Unique electronic properties of a 'topological'

fundamental reasons. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach to realize a
p-n junction of topological surface states (TSS's) of a three-dimensional (3D)

ultrathin Sb film is grown on a 3D TI of Bi2Se3 with a typical n-type TSS, the
surface develops a strongly p-type TSS through the substantial hybridization
between the 2D Sb film and the Bi2Se3 surface. Thus, the Bi2Se3 surface covered
partially with Sb films bifurcates into areas of n- and p-type TSS's as
separated by atomic step edges with a lateral electronic junction of as short
as 2 nm. This approach opens a different avenue toward various electronic and
spintronic devices based on well defined topological p-n junctions with the
scalability down to atomic dimensions

planar drawing of a graph such that vertices are placed at prescribed positions
in the plane and such that every edge is realized as a y-monotone curve. This
can be interpreted as a variant of Level Planarity in which the vertices on
each level appear in a prescribed total order. We establish a complexity
dichotomy with respect to both the maximum degree and the level-width, that is,
the maximum number of vertices that share a level. Our study of Ordered Level
Planarity is motivated by connections to several other graph drawing problems.
  Geodesic Planarity asks for a planar drawing of a graph such that vertices
are placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is
realized as a polygonal path composed of line segments with two adjacent
directions from a given set $S$ of directions symmetric with respect to the
origin. Our results on Ordered Level Planarity imply $NP$-hardness for any $S$
with $|S|\ge 4$ even if the given graph is a matching. Katz, Krug, Rutter and
Wolff claimed that for matchings Manhattan Geodesic Planarity, the case where
$S$ contains precisely the horizontal and vertical directions, can be solved in
polynomial time [GD'09]. Our results imply that this is incorrect unless
$P=NP$. Our reduction extends to settle the complexity of the Bi-Monotonicity
problem, which was proposed by Fulek, Pelsmajer, Schaefer and
\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}.
  Ordered Level Planarity turns out to be a special case of T-Level Planarity,
Clustered Level Planarity and Constrained Level Planarity. Thus, our results
strengthen previous hardness results. In particular, our reduction to Clustered
Level Planarity generates instances with only two non-trivial clusters. This
answers a question posed by Angelini, Da Lozzo, Di Battista, Frati and Roselli.

explanatory variables (e.g., age, sex, weight, etc.) to the survival

are serious concerns about the privacy of individuals in the data set when
medical data is used to fit the regression models. The closest work addressing
such privacy concerns is the work on Cox regression which linearly projects the
original data to a lower dimensional space. However, the weakness of this
approach is that there is no formal privacy guarantee for such projection. In
this work, we aim to propose solutions for the regression problem in survival
analysis with the protection of differential privacy which is a golden standard
of privacy protection in data privacy research. To this end, we extend the
Output Perturbation and Objective Perturbation approaches which are originally
proposed to protect differential privacy for the Empirical Risk Minimization

differential privacy with better accuracy. We show that our proposed approaches
achieve good accuracy as compared to the non-private results while guaranteeing
differential privacy for individuals in the private data set.

powers of the deformation parameter using the Seiberg-Witten map. The
gravity-matter couplings in the expansion arise as an effect of the gauge
symmetry breaking. We calculate in detail the first order NC correction to the
classical Dirac action in curved space-time and show that it does not vanish.
This significant feature of the presented model enables us to potentially
observe the NC effects already at the lowest perturbative order. Moreover, NC
effects are apparent even in the flat space-time limit. We analyse NC
modification of the Dirac equation, Feynman propagator and dispersion relation
for electrons in Minkowski space-time.

backreaction effects in the inflationary dynamics. We review the case in which

logarithmic scaling of the proper field distance at large field. This behaviour
is universal in Type II string flux compactifications and consistent with a
refinement of the Swampland Conjecture. The critical point at which this

cathode and electrolyte materials for energy-dense Mg batteries, but their
observed electrochemical performance depends strongly on synthesis conditions.
Using first principles calculations and percolation theory, we explore the
extent to which spinel inversion influences Mg$^{2+}$ ionic mobility in
MgMn$_2$O$_4$ as a prototypical cathode, and MgIn$_2$S$_4$ as a potential solid
electrolyte. We find that spinel inversion and the resulting changes of the
local cation ordering give rise to both increased and decreased Mg$^{2+}$
migration barriers, along specific migration pathways, in the oxide as well as
the sulfide.
  To quantify the impact of spinel inversion on macroscopic Mg$^{2+}$
transport, we determine the percolation thresholds in both MgMn$_2$O$_4$ and
MgIn$_2$S$_4$. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of inversion on the
electrochemical properties of the MgMn$_2$O$_4$ cathode via changes in the
phase behavior, average Mg insertion voltages and extractable capacities, at
varying degrees of inversion. Our results confirm that inversion is a major
performance limiting factor of Mg spinels and that synthesis techniques or
compositions that stabilize the well-ordered spinel structure are crucial for
the success of Mg spinels in multivalent batteries.

specific application areas in detail. In contrast, these informal notes aim to
outline some elements of the information-theoretic ""way of thinking,"" by
cutting a rapid and interesting path through some of the theory's foundational
concepts and results. They are aimed at practicing systems scientists who are
interested in exploring potential connections between information theory and
their own fields. The main mathematical prerequisite for the notes is comfort
with elementary probability, including sample spaces, conditioning, and
expectations. We take the Kullback-Leibler divergence as our most basic
concept, and then proceed to develop the entropy and mutual information. We
discuss some of the main results, including the Chernoff bounds as a
characterization of the divergence; Gibbs' Theorem; and the Data Processing
Inequality. A recurring theme is that the definitions of information theory
support natural theorems that sound ``obvious'' when translated into English.
More pithily, ``information theory makes common sense precise.'' Since the

Mission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision photometric
time series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However, bright targets
require a large number of pixels to capture the entirety of the stellar flux,
and bandwidth restrictions limit the number and brightness of stars that can be
observed. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric technique, that
we call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars using a limited number of
pixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and does not require extensive pixel
allocation, and will allow us to use K2 and other photometric missions, such as
TESS, to observe very bright stars for asteroseismology and to search for
transiting exoplanets. We apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the
Pleiades open cluster. Each star exhibits variability; six of the stars show
what are most-likely slowly pulsating B-star (SPB) pulsations, with amplitudes
ranging from 20 to 2000 ppm. For the star Maia, we demonstrate the utility of
combining K2 photometry with spectroscopy and interferometry to show that it is
not a 'Maia variable', and to establish that its variability is caused by
rotational modulation of a large chemical spot on a 10 d time scale.

network operators must allow flexible customization and fast provision of their

virtualization, whereby each service is mapped to a virtual subnetwork
providing dedicated on-demand support to network users. In practice, each
service consists of a prespecified sequence of functions, called a service
function chain (SFC), while each service function in a SFC can only be provided
by some given network nodes. Thus, to support a given service, we must select
network function nodes according to the SFC and determine the routing strategy
through the function nodes in a specified order. A crucial network slicing
problem that needs to be addressed is how to optimally localize the service
functions in a physical network as specified by the SFCs, subject to link and
node capacity constraints. In this paper, we formulate the network slicing
problem as a mixed binary linear program and establish its strong NP-hardness.
Furthermore, we propose efficient penalty successive upper bound minimization

the problem. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithms.

In the Solar Twin Planet Search program we observed several solar twin

stellar companions at moderate orbital periods do not display signs of a

the three peculiar stars are double-lined binaries, and that their companions

vortices along each wall that are left-right symmetric, while at sufficiently
high slip velocities, this flow loses its stability though a supercritical
bifurcation. Surprisingly, the new flow state that bifurcates from a left-right

exponentially localized, power-law localized, and delocalized. However, the
existence of these phase transitions remains controversial, with many other
works divided between those which claim that quantum percolation in 2D is
always localized, and those which assert there is a transition to a less

anisotropic two-dimensional strips fall in the first group, whereas our
previous work and most others in the second group were based on an isotropic
square geometry. To better understand the difference in our results and those
based on strip geometry, we apply our direct calculation of the transmission
coefficient to highly anisotropic strips of varying widths at three energies
and a wide range of dilutions. We find that the localization length of the
strips does not converge at low dilution as the strip width increases toward
the isotropic limit, indicating the presence of a delocalized state for small
disorder. We additionally calculate the inverse participation ratio of the

presentations of a stimulus to a coding neuron elicit similar responses. One
common way to assess similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided
into spike-resolved, such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance,
and time-resolved, e.g. the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance.
  New Method: We use independent steady-rate Poisson processes as surrogates
for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing information to address two basic
questions: How does the sensitivity of the different spike train distances to
temporal coding depend on the rates of the two processes and how do the
distances deal with very low rates?
  Results: Spike-resolved distances always contain rate information even for
parameters indicating time coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates
but beneficial for very low rates. In contrast, the operational range for
detecting time coding of time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates,
but these measures produce artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance
is the only measure that is sensitive to timing information only.
  Comparison with Existing Methods: While our results on rate-dependent
expectation values for the spike-resolved distances agree with
\citet{Chicharro11}, we here go one step further and specifically investigate
applicability for very low rates.
  Conclusions: The most appropriate measure depends on the rates of the data
being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that allows
an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.

identification results and show how probit models with heteroscedasticity can
be used to estimate the strength of the two effects. We apply our method to the
data on academic promotions in Spain studied in Zinovyeva & Bagues (2015). We
find evidence of both favors and information effects at work. Empirical results
are consistent with evidence obtained from quality measures collected five
years after promotion.

cosmological environment, which responds to a key open question in the study of
relativistic jets. Using small simulation systems during prior research, we
initially studied the evolution of both electron-proton and electron-positron
relativistic jets containing helical magnetic fields, by focusing on their
interactions with an ambient plasma. Here, using larger jet radii, we have
performed simulations of global jets containing helical magnetic fields in
order to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such
as the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI) and
the Mushroom instability (MI). We found that the evolution of global jets
strongly depends on the size of the jet radius. For example, phase bunching of
jet electrons, in particular in the electron-proton jet, is mixed with larger
jet radius due to the more complicated structures of magnetic fields with
excited kinetic instabilities. In our simulation study these kinetic
instabilities lead to new types of instabilities in global jets. In the
electron-proton jet simulation a modified recollimation occurs and jet
electrons are strongly perturbed. In the electron-positron jet simulation mixed
kinetic instabilities occur at early times followed by a turbulence-like
structure. Simulations using much larger (and longer) systems are further
required in order to thoroughly investigate the evolution of global jets
containing helical magnetic fields.

locking phenomena in structural mechanics applications of isogeometric
analysis. Interpreting the well-known $\bar{B}$ projection in two different
ways we develop two formulations for locking problems in beams and nearly
incompressible elastic solids. One formulation leads to a sparse symmetric
symmetric system and the other leads to a sparse non-symmetric system. To
demonstrate the utility of B\'{e}zier projection for both geometry and material
locking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko beams and
volumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the
approach can be applied generally to other types of locking phenemona as well.
B\'{e}zier projection is a local projection technique with optimal
approximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are
comparable to global $L^2$ projection. In the context of $\bar{B}$ methods, the
use of B\'ezier projection produces sparse stiffness matrices with only a
slight increase in bandwidth when compared to standard displacement-based
methods. Of particular importance is that the approach is applicable to any
spline representation that can be written in B\'ezier form like NURBS,
T-splines, LR-splines, etc. We discuss in detail how to integrate this approach
into an existing finite element framework with minimal disruption through the
use of B\'ezier extraction operators and a newly introduced dual basis for the
B\'{e}zierprojection operator. We then demonstrate the behavior of the two
proposed formulations through several challenging benchmark problems.

understanding of quantum mechanics can serve as a Rosetta Stone which allows us
to reconcile Western and non-Western scientific systems.
