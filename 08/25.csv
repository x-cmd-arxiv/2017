associated with electroporation (EP) for times after electrical pulsing. We
purposefully give only a short description of pore creation and subsequent
evolution of pore populations, as these are adequately discussed in both
reviews and original research reports. In contrast, post-pulse pore concepts
have changed dramatically. For perspective we note that pores are not directly
observed. Instead understanding of pores is based on inference from experiments
and, increasingly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the past decade
concepts for post-pulse pores have changed significantly: The idea of pure
lipidic transient pores (TPs) that exist for milliseconds or longer post-pulse
has become inconsistent with MD results, which support TP lifetimes of only
$\sim$100 ns. A typical large TP number during cell EP pulsing is of order
$10^6$. In twenty MD-based TP lifetimes (2 us total), the TP number plummets to
$\sim$0.001. In short, TPs vanish 2 us after a pulse ends, and cannot account
for post-pulse behavior such as large and relatively non-specific ionic and
molecular transport. Instead, an early conjecture of complex pores (CPs) with
both lipidic and other molecule should be taken seriously. Indeed, in the past
decade several experiments provide partial support for complex pores (CPs).
Presently, CPs are ""dark"", in the sense that while some CP functions are known,
little is known about their structure(s). There may be a wide range of
lifetimes and permeabilities, not yet revealed by experiments. Like cosmology's
dark matter, these unseen pores present us with an outstanding problem.

genes is often compared to functional pathways such as the Kyoto Encyclopaedia
at Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to identify active metabolic processes. Even though
a plethora of tools allow to analyze and to compare omics data in respect to

defined set of conditions. Furthermore, for transcriptomic datasets, it is
crucial to compare the entire set of pathways in order to obtain a global
overview of the species' metabolic functions. Results: Here, we present the
tool KEGGexpressionMapper, a module, that is implemented in the programming
language R. The module allows to highlight the expression of transcriptomic or
proteomic measurements in various conditions on pathways and incorporates
methods to analyze gene enrichment analyses and expression clustering in time
series data. KEGGexpressionMapper supports time series data from transcriptomic
or proteomics measurements from different individuals. As the tool is
implemented in the scripting language R, it can be integrated into existing
analysis pipelines to obtain a global overview of the dataset. The R package

that produce electromagnetic (EM) signals associated with gravitational waves

bursts (GRBs). The brief gamma-ray emission (the ""prompt GRB"" emission) is
produced by ultra-relativistic jets, as a result, this emission is strongly
beamed over a small solid angle along the jet. It is estimated to be a decade
or more before a short GRB jet within the LIGO volume points along our line of
sight. For this reason, the study of the prompt signal as an EM counterpart to
GW events has been sparse. We argue that for a realistic jet model, one whose
luminosity and Lorentz factor vary smoothly with angle, the prompt signal can
be detected for a significantly broader range of viewing angles. This can lead
to a new type of EM counterpart, an ""off-axis"" short GRB. Our estimates and
simulations show that it is feasible to detect these signals with the aid of
the temporal coincidence from a LIGO trigger, even if the observer is
substantially misaligned with respect to the jet.

from the accretion of minor planets, but the exact properties of polluting
material, and in particular the evidence for water in some cases are not yet
understood. Previous works studied the water retention in minor planets around
main-sequence and evolving host stars, in order to evaluate the possibility
that water survives inside minor planets around WDs. However, all of these
studies focused on small, comet-sized to moonlet-sized minor planets, when the
inferred mass inside the convection zones of He-dominated WDs could actually
also be compatible with much more massive minor planets. In this study we
therefore explore for the first time, the water retention inside exo-planetary
dwarf planets, or moderate-sized moons, with radii of the order of hundreds of
kilometres. We now cover nearly the entire potential mass range of minor
planets. The rest of the parameter space considered in this study is identical
to that of our previous study, and also includes multiple WD progenitor star
masses. We find that water retention in more massive minor planets is still
affected by the mass of the WD progenitor, however not as much as when small
minor planets were considered. We also find that water retention is now almost
always greater than zero. On average, the detected water fraction in
He-dominated WD atmospheres should be at least 5\%, irrespective of the assumed
initial water composition, if it came from a single accretion event of an icy
dwarf planet or moon. This finding also strengthens the possibility of WD
habitability. To finalize our previous and current findings, we provide a code
which may be freely used as a service to the community. The code calculates ice
and water retention by interpolation, spanning the full mass range of both
minor planets and their host stars.

online clique cover or matching algorithm for the delivery of missing data. We
derive approximations for the expected delivery rate of both schemes using the

between the Hamiltonians for La$_2$CuO$_4$ and HgBa$_2$CuO$_4$, which have

$2p_\sigma$ orbitals are farther(~3.7eV) below from the Cu $d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbital for the La compound than the Hg compound(~2.4eV) in the three-band
Hamiltonian. This causes a substantial difference in the character of the
$d_{x^2-y^2}-2p_\sigma$ antibonding band at the Fermi level and makes the
effective onsite Coulomb interaction U larger for the La compound than the Hg
compound for the two- and one-band Hamiltonians. ii)The ratio of the
second-neighbor to the nearest transfer t'/t is also substantially different
(~0.26) for the Hg and ~0.15 for the La compound in the one-band Hamiltonian.

energy. However, there is no compelling observational or theoretical reason to
expect such tight correlation to hold across all scales. We use test particle
simulations, tracing the propagation of charged particles (protons) through a
random magnetic field, to study the cosmic ray distribution at scales
comparable to the correlation scale of the turbulent flow in the interstellar
medium ($\simeq 100\,{\rm pc}$ in spiral galaxies). In these simulations, we
find that there is no spatial correlation between the cosmic ray number density
and the magnetic field energy density. In fact, their distributions are
approximately statistically independent. We find that low-energy cosmic rays
can become trapped between magnetic mirrors, whose location depends more on the
structure of the field lines than on the field strength.

on $g$-factors and exchange interactions. Our results paint YbMgGaO$_{4}$ as an
easy-plane XXZ antiferromagnet with the combined and necessary presence of
sub-leading next-nearest neighbor and weak anisotropic off-diagonal

the dramatic energy losses of the emitting particles. Self-absorption limits
the luminosities at low radio frequency, while coherence favours steep
optically thin spectra. Furthermore, the magnetic geometry must have a high
degree of order to obtain coherent curvature emission. Particles emit photons
along their velocity vectors, thereby greatly reducing the inverse Compton
mechanism. In this case we predict that fast radio bursts emit most of their

PDF fit to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data which includes small-$x$
resummation in the evolution of PDFs and in the computation of DIS structure

logarithms through the implementation of a variable flavour number scheme at
small $x$. As a result, we perform the small-$x$ resummation of the matching
conditions in PDF evolution at heavy flavour thresholds. The resummed results
are accurate at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy and matched, for the
first time, to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). Furthermore, we improve on
our previous work by considering a novel all-order treatment of running
coupling contributions. These results, which are implemented in a new release

equally applicable to accreting carbon-oxygen WDs. We use the Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution code to evolve a
suite of models that confirm these analytic results and demonstrate that
Urca-process cooling substantially modifies the thermal evolution of accreting
ONe WDs. Most importantly, we show that MESA models with lower temperatures at

develop convectively unstable regions, even when using the Ledoux criterion. We
discuss the difficulties that we encounter in modeling these convective regions

that oxygen ignites around a density of $\log(\rho_{\rm c}/\rm g\,cm^{-3})

single-parton ($\sigma_{\rm SPS}$) values in high-energy proton-proton,
proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus is reviewed. The basic parameter of the
factorized $n$-parton scattering ansatz is an effective cross section
$\sigma_{\rm eff}$ encoding all unknowns about the underlying generalized
$n$-parton distribution in the proton (nucleon). In its simplest and most
economical form, the $\sigma_{\rm eff}$ parameter can be derived from the
transverse parton profile of the colliding protons and/or nucleus, using a
Glauber approach. Numerical examples for the cross sections and yields expected
for the concurrent DPS or TPS production of heavy-quarks, quarkonia, and/or
gauge bosons in proton and nuclear collisions at LHC and Future Circular
Collider (FCC) energies are provided. The obtained cross sections are based on
perturbative QCD predictions for $\sigma_{\rm SPS}$ at next-to-leading-order
(NLO) or next-to-NLO (NNLO) accuracy including, when needed, nuclear
modifications of the corresponding parton densities.

the electrically charged dyons which indeed normally emerge in the systems with
$\theta\neq 0$ as a result of Witten's effect. We explain the basic reason why
the ""dyon"" mechanism does not materialize-- it is because the Witten's effect
holds for a static magnetic monopole treated as an external source. It should
be contrasted with our case when $N$- types of monopoles are not static, but
rather the dynamical degrees of freedom which fluctuate and themselves
determine the ground state of the system.

speakers, and background noise are learned from training data. Over the past
decade, many supervised separation algorithms have been put forward. In
particular, the recent introduction of deep learning to supervised speech
separation has dramatically accelerated progress and boosted separation
performance. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the research on
deep learning based supervised speech separation in the last several years. We
first introduce the background of speech separation and the formulation of
supervised separation. Then we discuss three main components of supervised
separation: learning machines, training targets, and acoustic features. Much of
the overview is on separation algorithms where we review monaural methods,
including speech enhancement (speech-nonspeech separation), speaker separation
(multi-talker separation), and speech dereverberation, as well as

(LB) model is developed for simulating double-diffusive convection in porous
media at the representative elementary volume scale. The MRT-LB model is
constructed in the framework of the triple-distribution-function approach: the
velocity field, the temperature and concentration fields are solved separately
by three different MRT-LB equations. The present model has two distinctive
features. First, the equilibrium moments of the temperature and concentration
distributions have been modified, which makes the effective thermal diffusivity
and heat capacity ratio as well as the effective mass diffusivity and porosity
decoupled . This feature is very useful in practical applications. Second,
source terms have been added into the MRT-LB equations of the temperature and
concentration fields so as to recover the macroscopic temperature and
concentration equations. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present model can
serve as an accurate and efficient numerical method for simulating
double-diffusive convection in porous media.

formalism takes into account the dynamics of large gluon densities at small $x$
and has been successfully applied to Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and
particle production in high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions in the small
$x$ kinematic region. The effective degrees of of freedom in CGC are Wilson
lines which enter in the effective quark (and gluon) propagators and re-sum
multiple soft scatterings from the small $x$ gluon field of the target. It is
however known that the CGC effective theory breaks down when one probes the
moderately large $x$ (high $p_t$) kinematics where collinear factorization and
DGLAP evolution of parton distribution functions should be the right framework.
Here we propose a general framework which may allow one to eventually unify the
two approaches and to calculate pQCD cross sections in both small and large
Bjorken $x$ regions. We take the first step towards this goal by deriving an
expression for the quark propagator in a background field which includes
scatterings from both small and large $x$ modes of the gluon field of the
target. We describe how this quark propagator can be used to calculate QCD
structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ at all $x$ and thus generalize the dipole
model of DIS. We outline this approach can also be used to extend the so-called
hybrid approach to particle production in the forward rapidity region of high
energy hadronic and nuclear collisions to all $x$ and $p_t$ regions and
speculate on how one may apply the same techniques to extend the

0.54%, 0.96%, 0.35%, 0.69% and 0.57% for the 6MV-FFF, 6MV, 10MV-FFF, 10MV and
15MV energies, respectively at 10cm depth. For the 6 MV phase-space collimated
with cones of 0.13, 0.25, 0.35, 1.0cm diameter, the LVs calculated at 1.5cm
depth were 75.6%, 25.4%, 17.6% and 8.0% respectively. Calculated LV for the
0.25cm cone-collimated 6MV beam were 61.2%, 40.7%, 22.5% in 0.02x0.02x0.5cm^3,
0.05x0.05x0.5cm^3 and 0.1x0.1x0.5cm^3 voxels respectively.
  Conclusion: Single PSF can be used to achieve sub-percent latent variance in
open 10x10cm^2 field MC simulations, whereas more PSFs would have to be summed
for small SRS fields.

vicinity of the central star on high-eccentricity orbits that become
circularized---with a concomitant decrease in the semimajor axis---through a
tidal interaction with the star. Giant planets that arrive with periastron
distances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\mathrm{R}$ lose their
gaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets'
distribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is
nonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay.
Here we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of
a spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization
time becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous
studies already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its
properties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by
tidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor
$Q^\prime_\mathrm{p}$). Our work extends these treatments by constructing
explicit model distributions for comparison with the data and by carrying out
backward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters. We show that
circularization generally occurs outside the distribution's inner edge (which
defines the boundary of the so-called sub-Jovian desert) and that typically
$Q^\prime_\mathrm{p}\approx10^6$ in the circularization zone (to within a
factor of 3). We also find tentative evidence for an eccentricity gradient in
lower-mass planets, indicating that formation through HEM may be relevant down
to Neptune scales.

pentacene, and Fe-porphyrin. One of the most striking results of our work is
that the converged active space orbitals obtained from HCISCF are relatively
insensitive to the accuracy of the HCI calculation. This allows us to obtain
nearly converged CASSCF energies with an estimated error of less than 1 mHa
using the orbitals obtained from the HCISCF procedure in which the integral
transformation is the dominant cost. For example, an HCISCF calculation on
Fe-Porphyrin model complex with an active space of (44e, 44o) took only 412
seconds per iteration on a single node containing 28 cores, out of which 185
seconds were spent in the HCI calculation and the remaining 227 seconds were
mainly used for integral transformation. Finally, we also show that
active-space orbitals can be optimized using HCISCF to substantially speed up
the convergence of the HCI energy to the Full CI limit because HCI is not

of the density in molecular clouds, and is often considered to trace the

excitation in various environments. The ratio of the rate coefficients for
electrons and H$_2$ molecules, $\simeq$10$^5$ for HCN, yields the requirements
for electron excitation to be of practical importance if $n({\rm H}_2) \leq\
10^{5.5} ~ \rm cm^{-3}$ and $X({\rm e}^-) \geq\ 10^{-5}$, where the numerical
factors reflect critical values $n_{\rm{}c}({\rm H_2})$ and $X^*({\rm{}e}^-)$.
This indicates that in regions where a large fraction of carbon is ionized,
$X({\rm e}^-)$ will be large enough to make electron excitation significant.
The situation is in general similar for other ""high density tracers"", including
HCO$^+$, CN, and CS. But there are significant differences in the critical
electron fractional abundance, $X^*({\rm e}^-)$, defined by the value required
for equal effect from collisions with H$_2$ and e$^-$. Electron excitation is,
for example, unimportant for CO and C$^+$. Electron excitation may be
responsible for the surprisingly large spatial extent of the emission from
dense gas tracers in some molecular clouds (Pety et al. 2017; Kauffmann,
Goldsmith et al. 2017). The enhanced estimates for HCN abundances and HCN/CO
and HCN/HCO$^+$ ratios observed in the nuclear regions of luminous galaxies may
be in part a result of electron excitation of high dipole moment tracers. The
importance of electron excitation will depend on detailed models of the
chemistry, which may well be non-steady state and non-static.

seen in Kepler data about 1400 days previously. The dimming rate for the entire
period reported is 22.1 +\- 9.7 milli-mag/yr in the Swift wavebands, with
amounts of 21.0 +\- 4.5 mmag in the groundbased B measurements, 14.0 +\- 4.5

near-simultaneous Spitzer photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, although a longer
wavelength excess from a substantial debris disk is still possible (e.g., as

neutral color (i.e., R_V >= 5, but not flat across all the bands) compared with

of high purity Ge detectors to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay in
Ge-76. The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is comprised of 44.1 kg (29.7 kg enriched in
Ge-76) of Ge detectors divided between two modules contained in a
low-background shield at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead,
South Dakota, USA. The initial goals of the DEMONSTRATOR are to establish the
required background and scalability of a Ge-based next-generation ton-scale
experiment. Following a commissioning run that started in 2015, the first
detector module started low-background data production in early 2016. The
second detector module was added in August 2016 to begin operation of the
entire array. We discuss results of the initial physics runs, as well as the
status and physics reach of the full MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR experiment.

starburst-dominated galaxies (including HII regions and Seyferts, for example),
extracted from the Spitzer/IRS ATLAS project (Hern\'an-Caballero &
Hatziminaoglou 2011), have their 6.2 $\mu$m profiles fitted allowing their
separation into the Peeters' A, B and C classes (Peeters et al. 2002). 67% of
these galaxies were classified as class A, 31% were as class B and 2% as class
C. Currently class A sources, corresponding to a central wavelength near 6.22
$\mu$m, seem only to be explained by polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles
(PANH, Hudgins et al. 2005), whereas class B may represent a mix between PAHs
and PANHs emissions or different PANH structures or ionization states.
Therefore, these spectra suggest a significant presence of PANHs in the
interstellar medium (ISM) of these galaxies that could be related to their
starburst-dominated emission. These results also suggest that PANHs constitute
another reservoir of nitrogen in the Universe, in addition to the nitrogen in
the gas phase and ices of the ISM.

the experiments with nanoparticles trapped in an optical lattice, we identify
two distinct features of the widths. First, the widths along an optical lattice
are much broader than those in the other directions. Second, the spectral
widths are narrower for larger nanoparticles. We develop a theory of thermal
broadening and show that the spectral widths normalized by the frequencies of

the Hamiltonian must be hermitian, is replaced by another set of requirements,
including notably symmetry under PT, where P denotes parity and T denotes time
reversal. Here we study the role of boundary conditions in PT quantum mechanics
by constructing a simple model that is the PT symmetric analog of a particle in
a box. The model has the usual particle in a box Hamiltonian but boundary
conditions that respect PT symmetry rather than hermiticity. We find that for a
broad class of PT-symmetric boundary conditions the model respects the
condition of unbroken PT-symmetry, namely that the Hamiltonian and the symmetry
operator PT have simultaneous eigenfunctions, implying that the energy
eigenvalues are real. We also find that the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint under
the PT inner product. Thus we obtain a simple soluble model that fulfils all
the requirements of PT quantum mechanics. In the second part of this paper we
formulate a variational principle for PT quantum mechanics that is the analog
of the textbook Rayleigh-Ritz principle. Finally we consider electromagnetic
analogs of the PT-symmetric particle in a box. We show that the isolated
particle in a box may be realized as a Fabry-Perot cavity between an absorbing
medium and its conjugate gain medium. Coupling the cavity to an external
continuum of incoming and outgoing states turns the energy levels of the box
into sharp resonances. Remarkably we find that the resonances have a
Breit-Wigner lineshape in transmission and a Fano lineshape in reflection; by
contrast in the corresponding hermitian case the lineshapes always have a
Breit-Wigner form in both transmission and reflection.

tables of Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs), using hierarchical Dirichlet
processes (HDPs). The main result of this paper is to show that improved
parameter estimation allows BNCs to outperform leading learning methods such as
Random Forest for both 0-1 loss and RMSE, albeit just on categorical datasets.
  As data assets become larger, entering the hyped world of ""big"", efficient
accurate classification requires three main elements: (1) classifiers with
low-bias that can capture the fine-detail of large datasets (2) out-of-core
learners that can learn from data without having to hold it all in main memory
and (3) models that can classify new data very efficiently.
  The latest Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) satisfy these requirements.
Their bias can be controlled easily by increasing the number of parents of the
nodes in the graph. Their structure can be learned out of core with a limited
number of passes over the data. However, as the bias is made lower to
accurately model classification tasks, so is the accuracy of their parameters'
estimates, as each parameter is estimated from ever decreasing quantities of
data. In this paper, we introduce the use of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes
for accurate BNC parameter estimation.
  We conduct an extensive set of experiments on 68 standard datasets and
demonstrate that our resulting classifiers perform very competitively with
Random Forest in terms of prediction, while keeping the out-of-core capability
and superior classification time.

the young high-mass protostar candidate NGC 2264 CMM3 with ALMA. CMM3 is
resolved into the two continuum peaks, CMM3A and CMM3B, at an angular
separation of 0.9"". Thus, CMM3 is found to be a binary system candidate. We
have detected molecular outflows associated with CMM3A and CMM3B each,
indicating active star formation. In addition to the two peaks, six faint
continuum peaks are detected around CMM3A and CMM3B, most of which are thought
to be evolved low-mass protostars. CMM3A is found to be rich in molecular line
emission including complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3. The
emission of complex organic molecules is distributed within a compact region
around the continuum peak of CMM3A. Hence, CMM3A apparently harbors a hot core.
On the other hand, CMM3B is deficient in molecular line emission, although its
continuum flux is almost comparable to that of CMM3A. Possible origins of the
striking difference between CMM3A and CMM3B are discussed.

show that when the top-ranked blame assignment is considered, Nate's
data-driven model is able to correctly predict the exact sub-expression that

higher than the state-of-the-art SHErrLoc tool. Furthermore, Nate's accuracy

applications due to low Gilbert damping and absence of Ohmic loss. Magnetic
order of MIs can be manipulated and even switched by spin-orbit torques (SOTs)
generated through spin Hall effect and Rashba-Edelstein effect in heavy
metal/MI bilayers. SOTs on MIs are more intriguing than magnetic metals since
SOTs cannot be transferred to MIs through direct injection of electron spins.
Understanding of SOTs on MIs remains elusive, especially how SOTs scale with
the film thickness. Here, we observe the critical role of dimensionality on the
SOT efficiency by systematically studying the MI layer thickness dependent SOT
efficiency in tungsten/thulium iron garnet (W/TmIG) bilayers. We first show
that the TmIG thin film evolves from two-dimensional to three-dimensional
magnetic phase transitions as the thickness increases, due to the suppression
of long-wavelength thermal fluctuation. Then, we report the significant
enhancement of the measured SOT efficiency as the thickness increases. We
attribute this effect to the increase of the magnetic moment density in concert
with the suppression of thermal fluctuations. At last, we demonstrate the
current-induced SOT switching in the W/TmIG bilayers with a TmIG thickness up
to 15 nm. The switching current density is comparable with those of heavy
metal/ferromagnetic metal cases. Our findings shed light on the understanding
of SOTs in MIs, which is important for the future development of ultrathin
MI-based low-power spintronics.

general technique for constructing a data structure to answer approximate near

preprocessing, the query time is dominated by $O(n^{\rho} \log n)$ evaluations
of hash functions from $\mathcal{H}$ and $O(n^{\rho})$ hash table lookups and

processing and computer vision. Among them, the Hierarchical Multi-scale RNN
(HM-RNN), a kind of multi-scale hierarchical RNN proposed recently, can learn
the hierarchical temporal structure from data automatically. In this paper, we
extend the work to solve the computer vision task of action recognition.
However, in sequence-to-sequence models like RNN, it is normally very hard to
discover the relationships between inputs and outputs given static inputs. As a
solution, attention mechanism could be applied to extract the relevant
information from input thus facilitating the modeling of input-output
relationships. Based on these considerations, we propose a novel attention
network, namely Hierarchical Multi-scale Attention Network (HM-AN), by
combining the HM-RNN and the attention mechanism and apply it to action
recognition. A newly proposed gradient estimation method for stochastic
neurons, namely Gumbel-softmax, is exploited to implement the temporal boundary
detectors and the stochastic hard attention mechanism. To amealiate the
negative effect of sensitive temperature of the Gumbel-softmax, an adaptive
temperature training method is applied to better the system performance. The
experimental results demonstrate the improved effect of HM-AN over LSTM with
attention on the vision task. Through visualization of what have been learnt by
the networks, it can be observed that both the attention regions of images and
the hierarchical temporal structure can be captured by HM-AN.

problems in many scientific fields such as signal processing (or the spiked
covariance model). In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for fixed $p$, any
penalty term of the form $k'(p-k'/2+1/2)C_n$ may lead to an asymptotically
consistent estimator under the condition that $C_n\to\infty$ and $C_n/n\to0$.
We also extend our results to the case $n,p\to\infty$, with $p/n\to c>0$. In
this case, for $k=o(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$, we first investigate the limiting laws
for the leading eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix $S_n$ under the
condition that $\lambda_k>1+\sqrt{c}$. At low SNR, since the AIC tends to
underestimate the number of signals $k$, the AIC should be re-defined in this
case. As a natural extension of the AIC for fixed $p$, we propose the extended
AIC (EAIC), i.e., the AIC-type method with tuning parameter
$\gamma=\varphi(c)=1/2+\sqrt{1/c}-\log(1+\sqrt{c})/c$, and demonstrate that the
EAIC-type method, i.e., the AIC-type method with tuning parameter
$\gamma>\varphi(c)$, can select the number of signals $k$ consistently. In the
following two cases, (1) $p$ fixed, $n\to\infty$, (2) $n,p\to\infty$ with
$p/n\to 0$, if the AIC is defined as the degeneration of the EAIC in the case
$n,p\to\infty$ with $p/n\to c>0$, i.e., $\gamma=\lim_{c\rightarrow
0+0}\varphi(c)=1$, then we have essentially demonstrated that, to achieve the
consistency of the AIC-type method in the above two cases, $\gamma>1$ is
required. Moreover, we show that the EAIC-type method is essentially
tuning-free and outperforms the well-known KN estimator proposed in Kritchman

statistics of observed UHECRs at the highest energies, and the observation of
the cosmogenic flux of neutrinos for a range of UHECR models. These
observations should solve the long-standing puzzle of the origin of the highest
energy particles ever observed, providing a new window onto the most energetic
environments and events in the Universe, while studying particle interactions
well beyond accelerator energies. The discovery of CTNs will help solve the
puzzle of the origin of UHECRs and begin a new field of Astroparticle Physics
with the study of neutrino properties at ultra-high energies.

percolation analysis based on discrete points. Using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF)
algorithm, we generate the S-bb relation, between the fractional mass of the
largest connected group (S) and the FoF linking length (bb). We propose a new
model, the Probability Cloud Cluster Expansion Theory (PCCET) to relate the
S-bb relation with correlation functions. We show that the S-bb relation
reflects a combination of all orders of correlation functions. Using N-body
simulation, we find that the S-bb relation is robust against redshift
distortion and incompleteness in observation. From the Bolshoi simulation, with
Halo Abundance Matching (HAM), we have generated a mock galaxy catalogue. Good
matching of the projected two-point correlation function with observation is
confirmed. However, comparing the mock catalogue with the latest galaxy
catalogue from SDSS DR12, we have found significant differences in their S-bb
relations. This indicates that the mock galaxy catalogue cannot accurately
retain higher order correlation functions than the two-point correlation
function, which reveals the limit of HAM method. As a new measurement, S-bb
relation is applicable to a wide range of data types, fast to compute, robust
against redshift distortion and incompleteness, and it contains information of

most of the existing works, which presume that the bandwidth of the transmitted

efficiency during recent years. However, the rapid decomposition of \ce{MAPbI3}

comprehensive understanding of the degradation mechanism is required. To do
this, we investigate the effect of water intercalation and hydration of the
decomposition and ion migration of \ce{CH3NH3PbX3} using first-principles
calculations. We find that water interacts with \ce{PbX6} and MA through
hydrogen bonding, and the former interaction enhances gradually, while the
latter hardly changes when going from X=I to Br and to Cl. Thermodynamic
calculations indicate that water exothermically intercalates into the
perovskite, while the water intercalated and monohydrated compounds are stable
with respect to decomposition. More importantly, the water intercalation
greatly reduces the activation energies for vacancy-mediated ion migration,
which become higher going from X=I to Br and to Cl. Our work indicates that
hydration of halide perovskites must be avoided to prevent the degradation of
PSCs upon moisture exposure.

which are characterized by their unique native folds whereas the great majority
of random polypeptides are neither clustered nor foldable to unique structures.
Since a given polypeptide can be either foldable or unfoldable, a kind of
""folding transition"" is expected at the boundary of a protein family in the
sequence space. By Monte Carlo simulations of a statistical mechanical model of
protein sequence alignment that coherently incorporates both short-range and
long-range interactions as well as variable-length insertions to reproduce the
statistics of the multiple sequence alignment of a given protein family, we
demonstrate the existence of such transition between natural-like sequences and
random sequences in the sequence subspaces for 15 domain families of various
folds. The transition was found to be highly cooperative and two-state-like.
Furthermore, enforcing or suppressing consensus residues on a few of the
well-conserved sites enhanced or diminished, respectively, the natural-like
pattern formation over the entire sequence. In most families, the key sites
included ligand binding sites. These results suggest some selective pressure on
the key residues, such as ligand binding activity, may cooperatively facilitate
the emergence of a protein family during evolution. From a more practical
aspect, the present results highlight an essential role of long-range effects
in precisely defining protein families, which are absent in conventional

underlying mechanisms of cell membrane electroporation (EP). Prior
experimental, theoretical and modeling have emphasized a single pore lifetime
as adequate for particular conditions. Here we introduce a much more complex
response: The rapid creation of many types of pore structures, of which some
are traditional transient lipidic pores (TPs), but the great majority are
complex pores (CPs) based on both lipids and other molecules or molecular
segments. At the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane (PM) non-lipidic
molecules come from the over-crowded cytoplasm. At the outer leaflet they
originate from the extracellular medium and extracellular matrix. Some
partially or fully insert into TPs during or shortly after TP formation, or
bind to the membrane nearby. This process is complex, leading to mostly
short-lived structures, with relatively few lasting for long times. We
speculate that the characteristic pore lifetimes range from $\sim$100 ns to
1,000 s, based on implications from experiments. The frequency-of-occurrence
probably falls off extremely rapidly with increasing lifetime, $\tau_{CP}$,
which implies that most are inaccessible to traditional experimental methods.
It also suggests that unexpected behavior can occur early in pulsing, vanishing
before post-pulse observations begin.

universe during the QCD crossover assuming that dark matter is made of axions.
Thermoelectric fields arise at pressure gradients in the primordial plasma due
to the difference in charge, energy density and equation of state between the
quark and lepton components. The axion field is coupled to the EM field, so
when its spatial gradient is misaligned with the thermoelectric field, an
electric current is driven. Due to the finite resistivity of the plasma an
electric field appears that is generally rotational. For a QCD axion mass
consistent with observational constraints and a conventional efficiency for
turbulent dynamo amplification --- driven by the same pressure gradients
responsible for the thermoelectric fields --- a magnetic field is generated on
subhorizon scales. After significant Alfv\'enic unwinding it reaches a present
day strength of $B \sim 10^{-13 }$ G on a characteristic scale $L_B \sim $ 20
pc. The resulting combination of $BL_B^{1/2}$ is significantly stronger than in
any astrophysical scenario, providing a clear test for the cosmological origin
of the field through $\gamma$-ray observations of distant blazars. The
amplitude of the pressure gradients may be inferred from the detection of
concomitant gravitational waves, while several experiments are underway to
confirm or rule out the existence of axions.

[OII] emitters has a shape typical of that inferred for star-forming galaxies,
with the contribution from central galaxies, $\langle N

The $\langle N \rangle_{\left[OII\right]\, cen}$ can be described as the sum of
an asymmetric Gaussian for disks and a step function for spheroids, which
plateaus below unity. The model [OII] emitters have a clustering bias close to
unity, which is below the expectations for eBOSS and DESI ELGs. At $z\sim 1$, a
comparison with observed g-band selected galaxy, which are expected to be
dominated by [OII] emitters, indicates that our model produces too few [OII]

pulse produces ultra-fast re-structuring of the electronic landscape generating
a wealth of material states continuously changing in space and in time in
accord with the variations of the intensity. These unconventional transient
material states combine simultaneously dielectric and metal properties
(Die-Met). The laser excitation transforms a transparent dielectric into
electrically inhomogeneous state early in the pulse time [1]. The permittivity
of excited material varies in time and in space changing from positive to
negative values that strongly affects the interaction process.
  The interplay between the transient permittivity gradient and polarisation of
the incident laser becomes the major process of the new interaction mode. In a
particular relation between the polarization and the permittivity gradient the
incident field amplitude grows up while the wave is approaching to the surface
where the real part of permittivity turns to zero. That results in the local
increase in the absorbed energy density. The complex 3D structure of the
permittivity makes a transparent part of excited dielectric (at ${\epsilon}0 >
{\epsilon}re > 0$) optically active. The electro-magnetic wave passing through
such a medium gets a twisted trajectory and accrues the geometric phase [2].
The plane of polarisation rotation and phase depends on the 3D permittivity
structure [3]. Measuring the polarisation and phase of the probe beam allows
quantitatively identify this new transient state. We discuss the revelations of
this effect in different experimental situations and possible applications.

This is the first time that the AGB stars in NGC 6809 are targeted. Moreover,

investigate the dependence of AGB Na abundance dispersion on GC parameters, we
compared the AGB [Na/H] distributions we obtained (including NGC 2808 presented

i.e., a total of nine GCs, covering a wide range of GC parameters. We find that
NGC 104 and NGC 6809 have comparable AGB and RGB Na abundance distributions
revealed by the K-S test, while NGC 6121 shows a lack of very Na-rich AGB star.
By analyzing all the nine GCs, the Na abundances and multiple populations of
AGB stars show a complex picture. In some GCs, AGB stars have similar Na
abundances and/or second-population fractions as their RGB counterparts, while
some GCs do not have Na-rich second-population AGB star, and various cases
exist between the two extremes. In addition, the fitted relations between
fractions of AGB second population and GC global parameters show that AGB
second-population fraction slightly anticorrelates with GC central
concentration, while no robust dependency can be confirmed with other GC
parameters. Current data roughly support the prediction of FRMS scenario.
However, considering the weak observational and theoretical trends where
scatter and exceptions exist, the fraction of second-population AGB stars can
be affected by more than one or two factors, and may even be a result of
stochasticity.

galactic chemical evolution. They are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) when their masses reach the Chandrasekar
mass limit in binaries. Previous studies have suggested that He novae may be
progenitor candidates of SNe Ia. However, the mass retention efficiencies
during He nova outbursts are still uncertain. In this article, we aim to study
the mass retention efficiencies of He nova outbursts and to investigate whether
SNe Ia can be produced through He nova outbursts. Using the stellar evolution
code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulated a series of
multicycle He-layer flashes, in which the initial WD masses range from 0.7 to
1.35 Msun with various accretion rates. We obtained the mass retention
efficiencies of He nova outbursts for various initial WD masses, which can be
used in the binary population synthesis studies. In our simulations, He nova
outbursts can increase the mass of the WD to the Chandrasekar mass limit and
the explosive carbon burning can be triggered in the center of the WD; this
suggests that He nova outbursts can produce SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the mass
retention efficiencies in the present work are lower than those of previous
studies, which leads to a lower birthrates of SNe Ia through the WD + He star
channel. Furthermore, we obtained the elemental abundances distribution at the
moment of explosive carbon burning, which can be used as the initial input
parameters in studying explosion models of SNe Ia.

requires two specific inputs gauged on observations: (i) the star formation
rate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/sub-mm/radio
measurements; (ii) average star-formation histories for individual galaxies,
with different prescriptions for discs and spheroids. The continuity equation
also includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent
numerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass
function derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass
function and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and
the main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance matching
technique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass function for
active and quiescent galaxies, of the galaxy main sequence and of the
star-formation efficiency with current observations is found; the comparison
with data also allows to robustly constrain the characteristic timescales for
star formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history
of their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in-situ star
formation vs. that contributed by external merger events. The continuity
equation is shown to yield quantitative outcomes that must be complied by
detailed physical models, that can provide a basis to improve the (sub-grid)
physical recipes implemented in theoretical approaches and numerical

quantum interference effects survive in the mesoscopic regime -- dynamics of an
entangled Bell state encoded into the qubit subsystem remains highly sensitive
to the symmetry of the total wave function. Moreover, relaxation of these
states is slowed down due to the formation of collective dark states weakly
coupled to light. Dark states also significantly influence dynamics of
excitations of photon subsystem by absorbing them into the qubit subsystem and
releasing quasiperiodically in time. We argue that predicted phenomena can be

of systems with uncertain parameters by deterministic dynamics. These methods
are used in a wide range of applications, spanning from simulation of uncertain
systems to estimation and control. For practical purposes the exploited
spectral series expansion is typically truncated to allow for efficient
computation, which leads to approximation errors. Despite the Hilbert space
nature of polynomial chaos, there are only a few results in the literature that
explicitly discuss and quantify these approximation errors. This work derives
error bounds for polynomial chaos approximations of polynomial and
non-polynomial mappings. Sufficient conditions are established, which allow
investigating the question whether zero truncation errors can be achieved and
which series order is required to achieve this. Furthermore, convex quadratic
programs, whose argmin operator is a special case of a piecewise polynomial
mapping, are studied due to their relevance in predictive control. Several
simulation examples illustrate our findings.

rearrangement moves such as rNNI (rooted Nearest Neighbour Interchange) and
rSPR (rooted Subtree Prune and Regraft). Recently, these moves were generalized
to rooted phylogenetic networks, which are a more suitable representation of
reticulate evolutionary histories, and it was shown that any two rooted
phylogenetic networks of the same complexity are connected by a sequence of
either rSPR or rNNI moves. Here, we show that this is possible using only tail
moves, which are a restricted version of rSPR moves on networks that are more
closely related to rSPR moves on trees. The connectedness still holds even when
we restrict to distance-1 tail moves (a localized version of tail-moves).
Moreover, we give bounds on the number of (distance-1) tail moves necessary to
turn one network into another, which in turn yield new bounds for rSPR, rNNI
and SPR (i.e. the equivalent of rSPR on unrooted networks). The upper bounds
are constructive, meaning that we can actually find a sequence with at most
this length for any pair of networks. Finally, we show that finding a shortest
sequence of tail or rSPR moves is NP-hard.

spatially decaying correlations, known to exist in a broad range of physical

we elucidate the physical mechanism of this unusual subdiffusion. In
particular, we explain why with growing temperature and/or time a first
crossover occurs to standard, power-law subdiffusion, with a time-dependent
power law exponent, and then a second crossover occurs to normal diffusion with
a disorder-renormalized diffusion coefficient. Interestingly, the initial,
nominally ultraslow diffusion turns out to be much faster than the universal de
Gennes-Baessler-Zwanzig limit of the renormalized normal diffusion, which
physically cannot be attained at sufficiently low temperatures and/or for
strong disorder. The ultraslow diffusion is also non-ergodic and displays a
local bias phenomenon. Our simple scaling theory not only explains our

for the overall vortex dynamics. The paper's second contribution is a series of
three-dimensional numerical simulations examining the effect of different
orientations of dipolar heat release on idealized tropical cyclones.
Comparisons with numerical solutions of the asymptotic equations yield evidence
that supports the original predictions. In addition, the influence of
asymmetric diabatic heat release on the time evolution of centerline tilt is
analysed further, and a steering mechanism based on the orientation of the

conversion of the embedded magnetic field energy into kinetic and thermal
plasma energy, via bulk acceleration and Ohmic dissipation. In many high-energy
astrophysical events, magnetic reconnection is invoked to explain the
non-thermal signatures. However, the processes by which field energy is
transferred to the plasma to power the observed emission are still not properly
understood. Here, via 3D particle-in-cell simulations of a readily available
(TW-mJ-class) laser interacting with a micro-scale plasma slab, we show that
when the electron beams excited on both sides of the slab approach the end of
the plasma structure, ultrafast relativistic magnetic reconnection occurs in a
magnetically-dominated (low-$\beta$) plasma. The resulting efficient particle
acceleration leads to the emission of relativistic electron jets with cut-off

research on antiferromagnets has not been progressed as drastically as that on

show that the magnetic moments in NiO, a typical natural antiferromagnet, can
indeed be controlled by the spin torque with a relatively small electric

transverse resistance resulting from the spin Hall magnetoresistance . The

waveguides, described by a reduction to ordinary differential eqautions of
generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equations (GNLSEs) with cubic-quintic (CQ)
and saturable (SAT) nonlinearities and a graded-index profile, the beam widths
exhibit two different types of beating behavior, with transitions between them.
We present an analytic model to explain these phenomena, which originate in a
1:1 resonance in a 2 degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. We show how small
oscillations near a fixed point close to 1:1 resonance in such a system can be
approximated using an integrable Hamiltonian and, ultimately, by a single first
order differential equation. In particular, the beating transitions can be
located from coincidences of roots of a pair of quadratic equations, with
coefficients determined (in a highly complex manner) by the internal parameters
and initial conditions of the original system. The results of the analytic
model agree with numerics of the original system over large parameter ranges,
and allow new predictions that can be verified directly. In the CQ case we
identify a band of beam energies for which there is only a single beating
transition (as opposed to 0 or 2) as the eccentricity is increased. In the SAT
case we explain the sudden (dis)appearance of beating transitions for certain
values of the other parameters as the grade-index is changed.

within the full Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism that includes a 3D harmonic
confinement we simulate and identify the emergence of a Goldstone mode of the
BCS gap in a cigar-shaped $^6$Li gas. By analyzing this Goldstone mode over a
wide range of parameters, we show that its excitation spectrum is gapless and
that its main frequency is not fixed by the trapping potential but that it is
determined by the details of the quench. Thus, we report the emergence of a
pure Goldstone mode of the BCS gap that --in contrast to situations in many
previous studies-- maintains its gapless excitation spectrum predicted by the
Goldstone theorem. Furthermore, we observe that the size-dependent superfluid
resonances resulting from the atypical BCS-BEC crossover have a direct impact
on this Goldstone mode. Finally, we find that the interaction quench-induced

that there exists a constant $C_{P}$ (depending only on $P$) such that
$\mbox{La}^{\#}(n,P)<C_{P}\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$. However, the order of
the constant $C_{P}$ following from their proof is typically exponential in
$|P|$. Here, we show that if the height of the poset is constant, this can be
improved. We show that for every positive integer $h$ there exists a constant
$c_{h}$ such that if $P$ has height at most $h$, then $$\mbox{La}^{\#}(n,P)\leq
|P|^{c_{h}}\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}.$$
  Our methods also immediately imply that similar bounds hold in grids as well.
That is, we show that if $\mathcal{F}\subset [k]^{n}$ such that $\mathcal{F}$
does not contain an induced copy of $P$ and $n\geq 2|P|$, then
$$|\mathcal{F}|\leq |P|^{c_{h}}w,$$ where $w$ is the width of $[k]^{n}$.
  A small part of our proof is to partition $2^{[n]}$ (or $[k]^{n}$) into
certain fixed dimensional grids of large sides. We show that this special
partition can be used to derive bounds in a number of other extremal set
theoretical problems and their generalizations in grids, such as the size of
families avoiding weak posets, Boolean algebras, or two distinct sets and their
union. This might be of independent interest.

effective gauge potential which depends on the density $\rho$ of the
condensate, the kinetic energy density of the matter field becomes nonlinear in
$\rho$ and additional flow-dependent terms enter the wave equation for the
phase of the condensate wavefunction. To begin with, we consider a certain
class of density-dependent `single-component' gauge potentials, and later
extend this class to encompass more general `multi-component' potentials. The
nonlinear flow terms are cast into the general form of an inner-product between
the velocity field of the fluid and the gauge potential. This is achieved by
introducing a coupling matrix of dimensionless functions $\gamma_{ij}\left(
\rho \right)$, which characterises the particular functional form of the gauge
potential and regulates the strengths of the nonlinear terms accordingly. In
the momentum-transport equation of the fluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due
to the density-dependent vector potential. A body-force of dilation appears as
a product of the gauge potential and the dilation rate of the fluid, while the
fluid stress tensor features a flow-dependent pressure contribution given by
the inner-product of the gauge potential and the current density of the fluid.
This explicit dependence of the fluid pressure on the flow highlights the lack
of Galilean invariance of the nonlinear fluid.

identification. We show that recent analytical and parametrized models for

extract information about ejecta properties and binary parameters directly from

that the only information about $\beta$ is its membership in some set $B
\subset (0,1]$, we distinguish between two models of uncertainty: one in which
$\beta$ is fixed and one in which it varies over time. As our main result we
show that the conceptual loss of efficiency incurred by incentives in the form

Cosmology by taking into account a broad class of self-interacting scalar field

cosmological solutions. The stability of critical points and the asymptotic
behavior of the phase space are analyzed using dynamical system tools and
numerical techniques. We study two class of interacting dark energy models and
consider two specific potentials as examples: the hyperbolic potential and the
inverse power-law potential. We found a rich and interesting phenomenology

transfer, large Reynolds numbers ($\mathcal{O}\sim 10^{3}$) are needed and low
Prandtl numbers of the order unity $Pr = 1$ are preferred. Compared to helical
MHD turbulence, though, the inverse transfer is much less efficient in
transferring magnetic energy to larger scales than the well-known effect of the
inverse cascade. Hence, applying the inverse transfer to the magnetic field
evolution in the Early Universe, we question whether the nonhelical inverse

simulation of complex atomic and molecular systems. We introduce a
computational method to reduce the complexity of atomic configuration space by
systematically recognising hierarchical levels of atomic structure, and
identifying the individual components. Given a list of atomic coordinates, a
network is generated based on the distances between the atoms. Using the
technique of modularity optimisation, the network is decomposed into modules.
This procedure can be performed at different resolution levels, leading to a
decomposition of the system at different scales, from which hierarchical
structure can be identified. By considering the amount of information required
to represent a given modular decomposition we can furthermore find the most
succinct descriptions of a given atomic ensemble. Our straightforward,
automatic and general approach is applied to complex crystal structures. We
show that modular decomposition of these structures considerably simplifies
configuration space, which in turn can be used in discovery of novel crystal
structures, and opens up a pathway towards accelerated molecular dynamics of
complex atomic ensembles. The power of this approach is demonstrated by the

general approach will be explained in this paper for a linear kinetic BGK model

equation. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are derived from
the kinetic conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the
network. This analysis leads to the consideration of a fixpoint problem
involving the coupled solutions of kinetic half-space problems. A new
approximate method for the solution of kinetic half-space problems is derived
and used for the determination of the coupling conditions. Numerical
comparisons between the solutions of the macroscopic equation with different

different life stages have failed due to lack of data. We close this gap by
using a large data set of mobile phone calls from a European country in 2007,
to study how the people's call patterns to their close social contacts are
associated with age and gender of the callers. We hypothesize that (i)
communication with peers, defined as callers of similar age, will be most
important during the period of family formation and that (ii) the importance of
best friends defined as same-sex callers of exactly the same age, will be
stronger for women than for men. Results show that the frequency of phone calls
with the same-sex peers in this population turns out to be relatively stable
through life for both men and women. In line with the first hypothesis, there
was a significant increase in the length of the phone calls for callers between
ages 30 to 40 years. Partly in line with the second hypothesis, the increase in
phone calls turned out to be particularly pronounced among females, although
there were only minor gender differences in call frequencies. Furthermore,
women tended to have long phone conversations with their same-age female
friend, and also with somewhat older peers. In sum, we provide evidence from
big data for the adult life stages at which peers are most important, and
suggest that best friends appear to have a niche of their own in human
sociality.

providing a systematic way to describe how multicentrality propagates across

\times n$ matrix $A$, vector $x$, and function $f$. In exact arithmetic, the
method's error after $k$ iterations is bounded by the error of the best
degree-$k$ polynomial uniformly approximating $f(x)$ on the range
$[\lambda_{min}(A), \lambda_{max}(A)]$. However, despite decades of work, it
has been unclear if this powerful guarantee holds in finite precision.
  We resolve this problem, proving that when $\max_{x \in [\lambda_{min},
\lambda_{max}]}|f(x)| \le C$, Lanczos essentially matches the exact arithmetic
guarantee if computations use roughly $\log(nC\|A\|)$ bits of precision. Our
proof extends work of Druskin and Knizhnerman [DK91], leveraging the stability
of the classic Chebyshev recurrence to bound the stability of any polynomial
approximating $f(x)$.
  We also study the special case of $f(A) = A^{-1}$, where stronger guarantees
hold. In exact arithmetic Lanczos performs as well as the best polynomial
approximating $1/x$ at each of $A$'s eigenvalues, rather than on the full
eigenvalue range. In seminal work, Greenbaum gives an approach to extending
this bound to finite precision: she proves that finite precision Lanczos and
the related CG method match any polynomial approximating $1/x$ in a tiny range
around each eigenvalue [Gre89].
  For $A^{-1}$, this bound appears stronger than ours. However, we exhibit
matrices with condition number $\kappa$ where exact arithmetic Lanczos
converges in $polylog(\kappa)$ iterations, but Greenbaum's bound predicts
$\Omega(\kappa^{1/5})$ iterations. It thus cannot offer significant improvement
over the $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ bound achievable via our result. Our analysis raises
the question of if convergence in less than $poly(\kappa)$ iterations can be
expected in finite precision, even for matrices with clustered, skewed, or
otherwise favorable eigenvalue distributions.

that the induced mass loss rate be such that the ""photon-tiring"" parameter $m

sufficient to overcome the gravitational potential $GM/R$. Our analysis unifies
previous super-Eddington wind models that either: (1) assumed a direct
radiative flux-driving without accounting for the advection of radiative
enthalpy that can become important in such an optically thick flow; or (2)
assumed that such super-Eddington outflows are adiabatic, neglecting the
effects of the diffusive radiative flux. We show that these distinct models
become applicable in the asymptotic limits of small vs. large values of $m

radiative diffusion and wind momentum, we obtain general solutions that
effectively bridge the behaviours of these limiting models. Two key scaling
results are for the terminal wind speed to escape speed, which is found to vary
as $v_\infty^2/v_{esc}^2 = \Gamma_o/(1+m \Gamma_o) -1$, and for the final
observed luminosity $L_{ obs}$, which for all allowed steady-solutions with $m

relying on maximal period sequences and other tools from finite fields. A
covering array of strength $t$, denoted $\mathrm{CA}(N; t, k,v)$, is an
$N\times k$ array with entries from an alphabet $A$ of size $v$, with the
property that in the $N\times t$ subarray defined by any $t$ columns, each of
the $v^t$ vectors in $A^t$ appears at least once as a row. Covering arrays
generalize orthogonal arrays, which are classic combinatorial objects that have
been studied extensively. Constructing covering arrays with a small
row-to-column ratio is important in the design of statistical experiments,
however it is also a challenging mathematical problem.
  Linear feedback shift register (LFSR) sequences are sequences of elements
from a finite field that satisfy a linear recurrence relation. It is well-known
that these are periodic; LFSR sequences that attain the maximum possible period
are maximal (period) sequences, often abbreviated to m-sequences in the
literature. Arrays constructed from cyclic shifts of maximal sequences possess
strong combinatorial properties and have been previously used to construct
orthogonal and covering arrays (Moura et al., 2016), although only one of the
known constructions is for covering arrays that are not orthogonal arrays
(Raaphorst et al., 2014). In this thesis we present several new such
constructions.
  The cornerstone of our results is a study of the combinatorial properties of
arrays constructed from maximal sequences, where we make fundamental
connections with concepts from diverse areas of discrete mathematics, such as
orthogonal arrays, error-correcting codes, divisibility of polynomials and

the Kalb-Ramond field in four as well as in higher dimensions. It turns out
that the Buchdahl's limit gets severely affected by the inclusion of the
Kalb-Ramond field. In particular, the Kalb-Ramond field in four spacetime
dimensions enables one to pack extra mass in any compact stellar structure of a
given radius. On the other hand, a completely opposite picture emerges if the
Kalb-Ramond field exists in higher dimensions, where the mass content of a
compact star is smaller compared to that in general relativity. Implications
are discussed.

  Sz\'ekelyhidi",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Functional equations satisfied by additive functions have a special interest
not only in the theory of functional equations, but also in the theory of
(commutative) algebra because the fundamental notions such as derivations and
automorphisms are additive functions satisfying some further functional
equations as well. It is an important question that how these morphisms can be
characterized among additive mappings in general.
  The paper contains some multivariate characterizations of higher order
derivations. The univariate characterizations are given as consequences by the
diagonalization of the multivariate formulas. The method allows us to refine
the process of computing the solutions of univariate functional equations of
the form \[ \sum_{k=1}^{n}x^{p_{k}}f_{k}(x^{q_{k}})=0, \] where $p_k$ and $q_k$
($k=1, \ldots, n$) are given nonnegative integers and the unknown functions
$f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}\colon R\to R$ are supposed to be additive on the ring
$R$. It is illustrated by some explicit examples too.
  As another application of the multivariate setting we use spectral analysis
and spectral synthesis in the space of the additive solutions to prove that
such a functional equation characterizes derivations of higher order. The
results are uniformly based on the investigation of the multivariate version of
the functional equations.

over $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}=\mathbb{N}^2$ is studied from algebraic
perspective. It is seen that the dynamics of the IVTs solely depends on the
dynamics (state transition diagram) of the pair of two variable Boolean
functions. A set of sixteen \textit{Collatz-like} IVTs are identified in two
dimensions. Also, the dynamical system of IVTs having attractor with one, two,
three and four cycles are studied. Additionally, some quantitative information
of \textit{Integral Value Transformations} (IVTs) in different bases and

atmosphere, and also in studying the radiative balance of the earth. The
conventional manner of such cloud analysis is performed mainly via satellite
images. However, because of its low temporal- and spatial- resolutions,
ground-based sky cameras are now getting popular. In this paper, we study the
relation between the cloud cover obtained from MODIS images, with the coverage
obtained from ground-based sky cameras. This will help us to better understand
cloud formation in the atmosphere - both from satellite images and ground-based
observations.

circuits. To minimize information loss and reduce oscillations a tapered
impedance transformer of new design is needed at the input/output for
compliance with other 50 $\Omega$ components. We show that an optimal tapered
transformer of length $\ell$, joining amplifier to input line, can be
constructed using a variational principle applied to the linearized Riccati
equation describing the voltage reflection coefficient of the taper. For an
incident signal of frequency $\omega_o$ the variational solution results in an
infinite set of equivalent optimal transformers, each with the same form for
the reflection coefficient, each able to eliminate input-line reflections. For
the special case of optimal lossless transformers, the group velocity $v_g$ is
shown to be constant, with characteristic impedance dependent on frequency
$\omega_c=\pi v_g / \ell$. While these solutions inhibit input-line reflections
only for frequency $\omega_o$, a subset of optimal lossless transformers with
$\omega_o$ significantly detuned from $\omega_c$ does exhibit a wide bandpass.
Specifically, by choosing $\omega_o\rightarrow 0$
($\omega_o\rightarrow\infty$), we obtain a subset of optimal low-pass
(high-pass) lossless tapers with bandwidth $(0,\sim\omega_c)$
($(\sim\omega_c,\infty)$). From the subset of solutions we derive both the
wide-band low-pass and high-pass transformers, and we discuss the extent to
which they can be realized given fabrication constraints. In particular, we
demonstrate the superior reflection response of our high-pass transformer when
compared to other taper designs. Our results have application to amplifier,
transceiver, and other components sensitive to impedance mismatch.
