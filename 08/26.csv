and metal-insulator transitions. Here we systematically study the ground state
electronic and structural properties for a family of Re-based DPs $A_2B$ReO$_6$
($A$=Sr, Ca and $B$=Cr, Fe), which are related by a common low energy
Hamiltonian, using density functional theory + $U$ calculations. We show that
the on-site interaction $U$ of Re induces orbital ordering (denoted COO), with
each Re site having an occupied $d_{xy}$ orbital and a C-type alternation among
$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$, resulting in an insulating state consistent with
experimentally determined insulators Sr$_2$CrReO$_6$, Ca$_2$CrReO$_6$, and
Ca$_2$FeReO$_6$. The threshold value of $U_{Re}$ for orbital ordering is
reduced by inducing $E_g$ octahedral distortions of the same C-type wavelength
(denoted COD), which serves as a structural signature of the orbital ordering;
octahedral tilting also reduces the threshold. The COO, and the concomitant
COD, are a spontaneously broken symmetry for the Sr based materials (i.e.
$a^0a^0c^-$ tilt pattern), while not for the Ca based systems (i.e. $a^-a^-b^+$
tilt pattern). Spin-orbit coupling does not qualitatively change the physics of
the COO/COD, but can induce relevant quantitative changes. We prove that a
single set of $U_{Cr}$,$U_{Fe}$,$U_{Re}$ capture the experimentally observed
metallic state in Sr$_2$FeReO$_6$ and insulating states in the other three
systems. We predict that the COO is the origin of the insulating state in
Sr$_2$CrReO$_6$, and that the concomitant COD may be experimentally observed at
sufficiently low temperatures (ie. space group P$4_2/m$). Additionally, given
our prescribed values of $U$, we show that the COO induced insulating state in
Ca$_2$CrReO$_6$ will survive even if the COD amplitude is suppressed (e.g. due

fully exploit the potential of hybrid AD beamforming systems. Alternatively,
CSIT can be estimated by assuming a model for the propagation channel, whereas
this model is only validated in millimeter-wave (mmWave) band thanks to its
poor scattering nature. In this paper, we focus on time division duplex (TDD)
systems with hybrid beamforming structure and propose a reciprocity calibration
scheme that allows to acquire full CSIT. Different to existing CSIT acquisition
methods, our approach does not require any assumption on the channel model and
can, in theory, estimate the CSIT up to an arbitrary small error.

radiation reaction and other effects in which their own fields can influence
their motion. Self-force phenomena such as these have been poorly understood
for spacetime dimensions not equal to four, despite the relevance of differing
dimensionalities for holographic duals, effectively two-dimensional condensed
matter and fluid systems, and so on. We remedy this by showing that forces and
torques acting on extended electromagnetic charges in all dimensions $d \geq 3$
have the same functional form as the usual test body expressions, except that
the electromagnetic field appearing in those expressions is not the physical
one; it is an effective surrogate. For arbitrary even $d \geq 4$, our surrogate
field locally satisfies the source-free field equations, and is conceptually
very similar to what arises in the Detweiler-Whiting prescription previously
established when $d=4$. The odd-dimensional case is different, involving
effective fields which are not necessarily source-free. Moreover, we find a
1-parameter family of natural effective fields for each odd $d$, where the free
parameter--a lengthscale--is degenerate with (finite) renormalizations of a
body's stress-energy tensor. While different parameter choices can result in
different forces, they do so without affecting physical observables. Having
established these general results, explicit point-particle self-forces are
derived in odd-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes. Simple examples are discussed
for $d=3$ and $d=5$, one of which illustrates that the particularly slow decay
of fields in three spacetime dimensions results in particles creating their own
""preferred rest frames:"" Initially-static charges which are later perturbed
have a strong tendency to return to rest. Our results easily extend also to the
scalar and gravitational self-force problems.

approximate a regular solution to the von K\'arm\'an equations defined on a

the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of a well-posed linear problem is
established and this allows the proof of local existence and uniqueness of a
discrete solution to the non-linear problem with a Banach fixed point theorem.
The Newton scheme is locally second-order convergent and appears to be a robust
solution strategy up to machine precision. A comprehensive a priori and a
posteriori energy-norm error analysis relies on one sufficiently large
stabilization parameter and sufficiently fine triangulations. In case the other
stabilization parameter degenerates towards infinity, the DGFEM reduces to a
novel $C^0$ interior penalty method (IPDG). Moreover, a reliable and efficient
a posteriori error analysis immediately follows for the DGFEM of this paper,
while the different norms in the known $C^0$-IPDG lead to complications with
some non-residual type remaining terms. Numerical experiments confirm the
best-approximation results and the equivalence of the error and the error
estimators. A related adaptive mesh-refining algorithm leads to optimal
empirical convergence rates for a non convex domain.

shape of the magnetic field distribution is similar to that for neutron stars.
This finding is in favor of the hypothesis that the magnetic field of a neutron
star is determined mainly by the magnetic field of its predecessor, the massive
OB star. Further, we model the evolution of an ensemble of magnetic massive
stars in the Galaxy. We use our own population synthesis code to obtain the
distribution of stellar radii, ages, masses, temperatures, effective magnetic
fields and magnetic fluxes from the pre-main sequence (PMS) via zero age main
sequence (ZAMS) up to the terminal age main sequence (TAMS) stages. A
comparison of the obtained in our model magnetic field distribution (MFD) with
that obtained from the recent measurements of the stellar magnetic field allows
us to conclude that the evolution of magnetic fields of massive stars is slow
if not absent. The shape of the real MFD shows no indications of the magnetic
desert proposed previously. Based on this finding we argue that the observed

Although extensive research has been performed on image dehazing and on
semantic scene understanding with clear-weather images, little attention has
been paid to SFSU. Due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating foggy
images, we choose to generate synthetic fog on real images that depict
clear-weather outdoor scenes, and then leverage these partially synthetic data
for SFSU by employing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN). In
particular, a complete pipeline to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather
images using incomplete depth information is developed. We apply our fog
synthesis on the Cityscapes dataset and generate Foggy Cityscapes with 20550
images. SFSU is tackled in two ways: 1) with typical supervised learning, and
2) with a novel type of semi-supervised learning, which combines 1) with an
unsupervised supervision transfer from clear-weather images to their synthetic
foggy counterparts. In addition, we carefully study the usefulness of image
dehazing for SFSU. For evaluation, we present Foggy Driving, a dataset with 101
real-world images depicting foggy driving scenes, which come with ground truth
annotations for semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive
experiments show that 1) supervised learning with our synthetic data
significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art CNN for SFSU on
Foggy Driving; 2) our semi-supervised learning strategy further improves
performance; and 3) image dehazing marginally advances SFSU with our learning
strategy. The datasets, models and code are made publicly available.

histories to investigate the formation of their gaseous halos and especially
their hot ($>10^6$~K) X-ray luminous coronae. Our simulations predict the
presence of significant hot gas in the halos as early as $z=3-4$, well before
the halos ought to be able to sustain hot mode accretion in the conventional
picture. The nascent coronae grow inside-out and initially do so primarily as a
result of outflows from the central galaxies powered by merger-induced shock
heating and strong supernovae feedback, both of which are elemental features of
today's successful galaxy formation models. Furthermore, the outflows and the
forming coronae also accelerate the transition from cold to hot mode accretion
by contributing to the conditions for sustaining stable accretion shocks. They
also disrupt the filamentary streams funneling cold gas onto the central
galaxies by causing their mouths to fray into a broad delta, detach from the
galaxies, and be pushed away to larger radii. And even though at early times
the filaments repeatedly re-form, the hot gas and the outflows act to weaken
the filaments and accelerate their ultimate disruption. Although galactic
outflows are generally thought of as ejective feedback, we find that their
action on the filaments suggests a preventive role as well.

the $\ell_1$ minimization problem $\min_{x}\|A x - b\|_1$ in the overdetermined
case, where there are far more constraints than variables. Specifically, we
have $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ for $n \gg d$. Commonly known as the Least
Absolute Deviations problem, $\ell_1$ regression can be used to solve many
important combinatorial problems, such as minimum cut and shortest path.
SGD-based algorithms are appealing for their simplicity and practical
efficiency. Our primary insight is that careful preprocessing can yield
preconditioned matrices $\tilde{A}$ with strong properties (besides good
condition number and low-dimension) that allow for faster convergence of
gradient descent. In particular, we precondition using Lewis weights to obtain
an isotropic matrix with fewer rows and strong upper bounds on all row norms.
We leverage these conditions to find a good initialization, which we use along
with recent smoothing reductions and accelerated stochastic gradient descent
algorithms to achieve $\epsilon$ relative error in $\tilde{O}(nnz(A) + d^{2.5}
\epsilon^{-2})$ time with high probability, where $nnz(A)$ is the number of
non-zeros in $A$. This improves over the previous best result using gradient
descent for $\ell_1$ regression. We also match the best known running times for
interior point methods in several settings.
  Finally, we also show that if our original matrix $A$ is approximately
isotropic and the row norms are approximately equal, we can give an algorithm
that avoids using fast matrix multiplication and obtains a running time of
$\tilde{O}(nnz(A) + s d^{1.5}\epsilon^{-2} + d^2\epsilon^{-2})$, where $s$ is
the maximum number of non-zeros in a row of $A$. In this setting, we beat the
best interior point methods for certain parameter regimes.

band touching and captures the normal-state properties of the 227 pyrochlore
iridates and half-Heusler alloys. Electron-electron interactions may favor
non-$s$-wave pairing in such systems, including even-parity $d$-wave pairing.
We argue that the lowest energy $d$-wave pairings are always of complex (e.g.,
$d + i d$) type, with nodal Weyl quasiparticles. This implies $\varrho(E) \sim
|E|^2$ scaling of the density of states (DoS) at low energies in the clean
limit, or $\varrho(E) \sim |E|$ over a wide critical region in the presence of
disorder. The latter is consistent with the $T$-dependence of the penetration
depth in the half-Heusler compound YPtBi. We enumerate routes for experimental
verification, including specific heat, thermal conductivity, NMR relaxation
time, and topological Fermi arcs. Nucleation of any $d$-wave pairing also
causes a small lattice distortion and induces an $s$-wave component; this gives
a route to strain-engineer exotic $s+d$ pairings. We also consider odd-parity,
fully gapped $p$-wave superconductivity. For hole doping, a gapless Majorana
fluid with cubic dispersion appears at the surface. We invent a generalized
surface model with $\nu$-fold dispersion to simulate a bulk with winding number
$\nu$. Using exact diagonalization, we show that disorder drives the surface
into a critically delocalized phase, with universal DoS and multifractal
scaling consistent with the conformal field theory (CFT) SO($n$)${}_\nu$, where
$n \rightarrow 0$ counts replicas. This is contrary to the naive expectation of
a surface thermal metal, and implies that the topology tunes the surface
renormalization group to the CFT in the presence of disorder.

fundamental research in quantum physics. This paper reviews the theoretical and
experimental progress in research on cold hybrid ion-atom systems which aim to
combine the best features of the two well-established fields. We provide a
broad overview of the theoretical description of ion-atom mixtures and their
applications, and report on advances in experiments with ions trapped in Paul
or dipole traps overlapped with a cloud of cold atoms, and with ions directly
produced in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We start with microscopic models
describing the electronic structure, interactions, and collisional physics of
ion-atom systems at low and ultralow temperatures, including radiative and
non-radiative charge transfer processes and their control with magnetically
tunable Feshbach resonances. Then we describe the relevant experimental
techniques and the intrinsic properties of hybrid systems. In particular, we
discuss the impact of the micromotion of ions in Paul traps on ion-atom hybrid
systems. Next, we review recent proposals for using ions immersed in ultracold
gases for studying cold collisions, chemistry, many-body physics, quantum
simulation, and quantum computation and their experimental realizations. In the
last part we focus on the formation of molecular ions via spontaneous radiative
association, photoassociation, magnetoassociation, and sympathetic cooling. We
discuss applications and prospects of cold molecular ions for cold controlled
chemistry and precision spectroscopy.

our simulations develop a clearly bimodal distribution in the $[\rm \alpha/Fe]$

which operate in different regions of the galaxies: a) an early ($z>1$) and
intense high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation phase in the inner region
($R\lesssim 5$ kpc) induced by gas-rich mergers, followed by more quiescent
low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation; and b) an early phase of
high-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ star formation in the outer disc followed by a shrinking
of the gas disc owing to a temporarily lowered gas accretion rate, after which
disc growth resumes. In process b), a double-peaked star formation history
around the time and radius of disc shrinking accentuates the dichotomy. If the
early star formation phase is prolonged (rather than short and intense),
chemical evolution proceeds as per process a) in the inner region, but the
dichotomy is less clear. In the outer region, the dichotomy is only evident if
the first intense phase of star formation covers a large enough radial range
before disc shrinking occurs; otherwise, the outer disc consists of only
low-$\rm[\alpha/Fe]$ sequence stars. We discuss the implication that both
processes occurred in the Milky Way.

Surprisingly, they revealed that a major fraction of their MIR emission comes
from the polar regions. This is at odds with the expectation based on AGN
unification, which postulates a dusty torus in the equatorial region. The
nearby, archetypical AGN in the Circinus galaxy offers one of the best
opportunities to study the MIR emission in greater detail. New, high quality
MIR images obtained with the upgraded VISIR instrument at the Very Large
Telescope show that the previously detected bar-like structure extends up to at
least 40 pc on both sides of the nucleus along the edges of the ionization
cone. Motivated by observations across a wide wavelength range and on different
spatial scales, we propose a phenomenological dust emission model for the AGN
in the Circinus galaxy consisting of a compact dusty disk and a large-scale
dusty cone shell, illuminated by a tilted accretion disk with an anisotropic
emission pattern. Undertaking detailed radiative transfer simulations, we
demonstrate that such a model is able to explain the peculiar MIR morphology
and account for the entire IR spectral energy distribution. Our results call
for caution when attributing dust emission of unresolved sources entirely to
the torus and warrant further investigation of the MIR emission in the polar
regions of AGN.

discover high-mass star-forming regions at different evolutionary phases. Using
the Parkes telescope, we observed the NH3 (1,1) to (3,3) inversion transitions
towards 354 ATLASGAL clumps in the fourth quadrant. For a subsample of 289

a median NH3(1,1) line width of about 2 km/s and rotational temperatures from
12 to 28 K with a mean of 18 K. For a subsample with detected NH3 (2,2)

(2,2) optical depth from the (1,1) optical depth and the (2,2) to (1,1) main
beam brightness temperature ratio leads to an underestimation of the rotational
temperature and column density. A larger median virial parameter of about 1 is
determined using the broader N2H+ line width than is estimated from the NH3
line width of about 0.5 with a general trend of a decreasing virial parameter
with increasing gas mass. We found a warmer surrounding of ATLASGAL clumps than
the surrounding of low-mass cores and smaller velocity dispersions in low-mass

poorly constrained in normal (main-sequence) star-forming z > 5 galaxies where
often only one single FIR point is available. To better inform estimates of the
FIR luminosity, we construct a sample of local galaxies and three low-redshift
analogs of z > 5 systems. The trends in this sample suggest that normal
high-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared to average z <
4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies. The blue-shifted peak and
mid-IR excess emission could be explained by a combination of a larger fraction
of the metal-poor inter-stellar medium (ISM) being optically thin to
ultra-violet (UV) light and a stronger UV radiation field due to high star
formation densities. Assuming a maximally warm IR SED suggests 0.6 dex
increased total FIR luminosities, which removes some tension between dust
attenuation models and observations of the IRX-$\beta$ relation at z > 5.
Despite this, some galaxies still fall below the minimum IRX-$\beta$ relation
derived with standard dust cloud models. We propose that radiation pressure in
these highly star-forming galaxies causes a spatial offset between dust clouds
and young star-forming regions within the lifetime of O/B stars. These offsets
change the radiation balance and create viewing-angle effects that can change
UV colors at fixed IRX. We provide a modified model that can explain the
location of these galaxies on the IRX-$\beta$ diagram.

sharp dependence on stellar mass, in the sense that ~ 70% of galaxies with
stellar mass M_* > 10^11 h^-2 M_sun tend to have very little rotation, while
nearly all galaxies at lower mass show some net rotation. The ~ 30% of
high-mass galaxies that have significant rotation do not stand out in other
galaxy properties except for a higher incidence of ionized gas emission. Our
data are consistent with recent simulation results suggesting that major
merging and gas accretion have more impact on the rotational support of
lower-mass galaxies. When carefully matching the stellar mass distributions, we
find no residual differences in angular momentum content between satellite and
central galaxies at the 20\% level. Similarly, at fixed mass, galaxies have
consistent rotation properties across a wide range of halo mass. However, we
find that errors in classification of centrals and satellites with group

improve constraints, the impact of group finding methods will have to be

characterizing the Orion A cloud, indicating that variations in the fundamental
optical properties of dust may exist between local clouds. We show that over a
wide range of extinction, the column density probability distribution function
(PDF$_N$) of the cloud can be well described by a simple power law with an
index that represents a steeper decline with column density than found in
similar studies of the Orion and Perseus clouds. Using only the protostellar
population of the cloud and our extinction maps we investigate the Schmidt
relation within the cloud. We show that the protostellar surface density,
$\Sigma_*$, is directly proportional to the ratio of the protostellar and cloud
pdfs. We use the cumulative distribution of protostars to infer the functional
forms for both $\Sigma_*$ and PDF$_*$. We find that $\Sigma_*$ is best
described by two power-law functions with steeper indicies than found in other
local GMCs. We find that the protostellar pdf is a declining function of
extinction also best described by two power-laws whose behavior mirrors that of
$\Sigma_*$. Our observations suggest that variations both in the slope of the
Schmidt relation and in the sizes of the protostellar populations between GMCs
are largely driven by variations in the slope of the cloud pdf. This confirms
earlier studies suggesting that cloud structure plays a major role in setting
the global star formation rates in GMCs.

received considerable attention in machine learning. However, such formulations
often require solving for a matrix of the size of the data matrix, making it
challenging to apply them to large scale datasets. Moreover, in many
applications the data can display structures beyond simply being low-rank,
e.g., images and videos present complex spatio-temporal structures that are
largely ignored by standard low-rank methods. In this paper we study a matrix
factorization technique that is suitable for large datasets and captures
additional structure in the factors by using a particular form of
regularization that includes well-known regularizers such as total variation
and the nuclear norm as particular cases. Although the resulting optimization
problem is non-convex, we show that if the size of the factors is large enough,
under certain conditions, any local minimizer for the factors yields a global
minimizer. A few practical algorithms are also provided to solve the matrix
factorization problem, and bounds on the distance from a given approximate
solution of the optimization problem to the global optimum are derived.
Examples in neural calcium imaging video segmentation and hyperspectral
compressed recovery show the advantages of our approach on high-dimensional
datasets.

post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for scalar-tensor gravity (STG) with an
arbitrary potential, under the assumption that the source matter is given by a
non-rotating sphere of constant density, pressure and internal energy. For our
calculation we write the STG field equations in a form which is manifestly
invariant under conformal transformations of the metric and redefinitions of
the scalar field. This easily shows that also the obtained PPN parameters are
invariant under such transformations. Our result is consistent with the
expectation that STG is a fully conservative theory, i.e., only $\gamma$ and
$\beta$ differ from their general relativity values $\gamma = \beta = 1$, which
indicates the absence of preferred frame and preferred location effects. We
find that the values of the PPN parameters depend on both the radius of the
gravitating mass source and the distance between the source and the observer.
Most interestingly, we find that also at large distances from the source
$\beta$ does not approach $\beta = 1$, but receives corrections due to a
modified gravitational self-energy of the source. Finally, we compare our
result to a number of measurements of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ in the Solar System.
We find that in particular measurements of $\beta$ improve the previously
obtained bounds on the theory parameters, due to the aforementioned
long-distance corrections.

processing using single-core CPUs. However, considering a parallel processing

of steps. On such architectures, the number of steps corresponds to the number

directly apply a mature dependency graph learned from a source domain to the

dependency graph often can not achieve good performance. Traditional transfer
learning methods mainly focus on numerical data and are not applicable.
  In this paper, we propose ACRET, a knowledge transfer based model for

The motivation of this paper is to improve this numerical method, from the
regularity results of the Bloch transform of the total field, which have been
studied in [Zha17]. As the set of the singularities of the total field is
discrete in $\R$, and finite in one periodic cell, we are able to improve the
numerical method by designing a proper integration contour with special
conditions at the singularities. With a good choice of the transformation, we
can prove that the new numerical method could possess a super algebraic
convergence rate. \high{This new method improves the efficient significantly.
At the end of this paper, several numerical results will be provided to show
the fast convergence of the new method.} The method also provides a possibility
to solve more complicated problems efficiently, e.g., three dimensional
problems, or electromagnetic scattering problems.

introducing an effective fluid through defining effective energy density and

definitions have been already introduced to study the energy conditions in
$f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ gravity. We examine various models to which different
effective equations of state, corresponding to different $h({\sf T})$
functions, can be attributed. It is also discussed that one can link between an
assumed $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ model in the effective picture and the theories
with generalized equation of state ({\sf EoS}). We obtain cosmological
scenarios exhibiting a nonsingular bounce before and after which the Universe
lives within a de-Sitter phase. We then proceed to find general solutions for
matter bounce and investigate their properties. We show that the properties of
bouncing solution in the effective picture of $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ gravity are
as follows: for a specific form of the $f({\sf R,T})$ function, these solutions
are without any future singularities. Moreover, stability analysis of the
nonsingular solutions through matter density perturbations revealed that except
two of the models, the parameters of scalar-type perturbations for the other
ones have a slight transient fluctuation around the bounce point and damp to
zero or a finite value at late times. Hence these bouncing solutions are stable
against scalar-type perturbations. It is possible that all energy conditions be
respected by the real perfect fluid, however, the null and the strong energy
conditions can be violated by the effective fluid near the bounce event.

dynamical, or, more recently, their informational properties, usually taking
either a reductionist or holistic perspective. Yet, studying only individual
system elements or the dynamics of the system as a whole disregards the
organisational structure of the system - whether there are subsets of elements
with joint causes or effects, and whether the system is strongly integrated or
composed of several loosely interacting components. Integrated information
theory (IIT), offers a theoretical framework to (1) investigate the
compositional cause-effect structure of a system, and to (2) identify causal
borders of highly integrated elements comprising local maxima of intrinsic
cause-effect power. Here we apply this comprehensive causal analysis to a
Boolean network model of the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
cell-cycle. We demonstrate that this biological model features a non-trivial
causal architecture, whose discovery may provide insights about the real cell
cycle that could not be gained from holistic or reductionist approaches. We
also show how some specific properties of this underlying causal architecture
relate to the biological notion of autonomy. Ultimately, we suggest that
analysing the causal organisation of a system, including key features like
intrinsic control and stable causal borders, should prove relevant for
distinguishing life from non-life, and thus could also illuminate the origin of

constraints. One example is finding acceptable car body styling designs based
on constraints like aesthetics and functionality. Current active-learning based
methods learn feasible domains for bounded input spaces. However, we usually
lack prior knowledge about how to set those input variable bounds. Bounds that
are too small will fail to cover all feasible domains; while bounds that are
too large will waste query budget. To avoid this problem, we introduce Active
Expansion Sampling (AES), a method that identifies (possibly disconnected)
feasible domains over an unbounded input space. AES progressively expands our
knowledge of the input space, and uses successive exploitation and exploration
stages to switch between learning the decision boundary and searching for new
feasible domains. We show that AES has a misclassification loss guarantee
within the explored region, independent of the number of iterations or labeled
samples. Thus it can be used for real-time prediction of samples' feasibility
within the explored region. We evaluate AES on three test examples and compare
AES with two adaptive sampling methods -- the Neighborhood-Voronoi algorithm

on LN photonic crystal slab cavities, ranging from short to long length scales,
using a fully-3D Bloch mode expansion technique. We compute the optical density
of states, quality factors and effective mode volumes of the cavity modes, with
and without disorder, and compare with the localized modes of the corresponding
disordered photonic crystal waveguide. We demonstrate how the quality factors
and effective mode volumes saturate at a specific cavity length and become
bounded by the corresponding values of the Anderson modes appearing in the
disordered waveguide. By means of the intensity fluctuation criterion, we
observe Anderson localization for cavity lengths larger than around L31, and
show that the field confinement in the disordered LN cavities is mainly
determined by the local characteristics of the structural disorder as long as
the confinement region is far enough from the cavity mirrors and the effective
mode localization length is much smaller than the cavity length; under this
regime, the disordered cavity system becomes insensitive to changes in the
cavity boundaries and a good agreement with the intensity fluctuation criterion
is found for localization. Surprisingly, we find that the Anderson localized
modes do not appear as new disorder-induced resonances in the main spectral
region of the LN cavity modes, and, moreover, the disordered DOS enhancement is
largest for the disordered waveguide system with the same length. These results
are fundamentally interesting for applications such as lasing and cavity-QED,
and provide new insights into the role of the boundary condition on finite-size
slow-light waveguides. They also point out the clear failure of using models
based on the cavity boundaries/mirrors and a single slow-light Bloch mode to

experienced a resurgence of malaria. Here, we develop a modelbased framework
that integrates entomological, geographical, social and environmental evidence
in order to guide the mosquito control efforts and apply this framework to data
from an entomological survey study conducted in Central Greece. Our results
indicate that malaria transmission risk in Greece is potentially substantial.
In addition, specific districts such as seaside, lakeside and rice field
regions appear to represent potential malaria hotspots in Central Greece. We
found that appropriate maps depicting the basic reproduction number, R0 , are
useful tools for informing policy makers on the risk of malaria resurgence and
can serve as a guide to inform recommendations regarding control measures.

  ""Quantum Gravity Phenomenology and Experimental Implications""",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The definition of a length operator in quantum cosmology is usually
influenced by a~quantum theory for gravity considered. The semiclassical limit
at the Planck age must meet the requirements implied in present observations.
The features of a semiclassical wave-functional state are investigated, for
which the modern measure(ment)s is consistent. The results of a length
measurement at present times are compared with the same measurement operation
at cosmological times. By this measure, it is possible to discriminate, within
the same Planck-length expansion, the corrections to a Minkowski flat space
possibly due to classicalization of quantum phenomena at the Planck time and
those due to possible quantum-gravitational manifestations of present times.
This~analysis and the comparison with the previous literature can be framed as
a test for the verification of the time at which anomalies at present related
to the gravitational field, and, in particular, whether they are ascribed to
the classicalization epoch. Indeed, it allows to discriminate not only within
the possible quantum features of the quasi (Minkowski) flat spacetime, but also
from (possibly Lorentz violating) phenomena detectable at high-energy
astrophysical scales. The results of two different (coordinate) length measures
have been compared both at cosmological time and as a perturbation element on
flat Minkowski spacetime. The differences for the components of the
corresponding classical(ized) metric tensor have been analyzed at different
orders of expansions. The comparison of the results of (straight) length
measures in two different directions, in particular, can encode the pertinent
information about the parameters defining the semiclassical wavefunctional for
(semiclassicalized) gravitational field.

strain and interface energies that contribute to the stability of a nucleating

barrier to growth. The small differences between different compositions points
toward the need for the study of possible precipitate/matrix interface
reconstruction. A classical semi-quantitative nucleation theory approach
including elastic strain energy captures the trends in precipitate energy
versus size and composition. This validates the use of mesoscale models to
assess stability and interactions of precipitates. Studies of smaller 3d

that the early stages of precipitation may be diffusion-limited. Overall, these

$\gamma$-ray SNR RX J0852.0$-$4622 (G266.2$-$1.2, Vela Jr.). We used the
NANTEN2 $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) and ATCA & Parkes HI datasets in order to derive
the molecular and atomic gas associated with the TeV $\gamma$-ray shell of the
SNR. We find that atomic gas over a velocity range from $V_\mathrm{LSR}$ = $-4$
km s$^{-1}$ to 50 km s$^{-1}$ or 60 km s$^{-1}$ is associated with the entire
SNR, while molecular gas is associated with a limited portion of the SNR. The
large velocity dispersion of the HI is ascribed to the expanding motion of a
few HI shells overlapping toward the SNR but is not due to the Galactic
rotation. The total masses of the associated HI and molecular gases are
estimated to be $\sim2.5 \times 10^4 $ $M_{\odot}$ and $\sim10^3$ $M_{\odot}$,
respectively. A comparison with the H.E.S.S. TeV $\gamma$-rays indicates that
the interstellar protons have an average density around 100 cm$^{-3}$ and shows
a good spatial correspondence with the TeV $\gamma$-rays. The total cosmic ray
proton energy is estimated to be $\sim10^{48}$ erg for the hadronic
$\gamma$-ray production, which may still be an underestimate by a factor of a
few due to a small filling factor of the SNR volume by the interstellar
protons. This result presents a third case, after RX J1713.7$-$3946 and HESS
J1731$-$347, of the good spatial correspondence between the TeV $\gamma$-rays
and the interstellar protons, lending further support for a hadronic component
in the $\gamma$-rays from young TeV $\gamma$-ray SNRs.

tackle MIBMIs, providing both upper and lower bounds, and that lead to
effective heuristics for SaA selection. The upper and lower bounds are obtained
via successive convex approximations and semidefinite programming relaxations,
respectively, and selections are obtained with a novel slicing algorithm from
the solutions of the bounding problems. Custom branch-and-bound and
combinatorial greedy approaches are also developed for a broad class of systems

modification originates from allowing the ratio of the first Eddington
coefficients to depart from unity. At the heart of the method is the fact that
this ratio may be computed once and for all over the entire range of values of
the single-scattering albedo and scattering asymmetry factor. We benchmark our
improved two-stream method by calculating the fraction of flux reflected by a
single atmospheric layer (the reflectivity) and comparing these calculations to
those performed using a 32-stream discrete-ordinates method. We further compare
our improved two-stream method to the two-stream source function (16 streams)
and delta-Eddington methods, demonstrating that it is often more accurate at
the order-of-magnitude level. Finally, we illustrate its accuracy using a toy
model of the early Martian atmosphere hosting a cloud layer composed of

regarding similarity between tasks, its asymmetric property and unreliable

Additionally, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the ones with extremely

output an inaccurate task-partition. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a novel task-clustering algorithm by using the matrix completion technique. The
proposed algorithm constructs a partially-observed similarity matrix based on
the certainty of cluster membership of the task-pairs. We then use a matrix
completion algorithm to complete the similarity matrix. Our theoretical
analysis shows that under mild constraints, the proposed algorithm will
perfectly recover the underlying ""true"" similarity matrix with a high
probability. Our results show that the new task clustering method can discover
task clusters for training flexible and superior neural network models in a
multi-task learning setup for sentiment classification and dialog intent
classification tasks. Our task clustering approach also extends metric-based
few-shot learning methods to adapt multiple metrics, which demonstrates
empirical advantages when the tasks are diverse.

even if we use a deep residual network, the translation invariance of the CNN

functions of both kinds R1ml and R2ml are shown to provide accurate values over

and the angular function of the first kind in a series of products of the
corresponding spherical functions, with the angular coordinate being a free

values for R2ml when the radial coordinate xi is larger than 0.01 and l is

accurate values for R1ml over all parameter ranges. Next is the calculation of
R2ml as an integral of the product of S1ml and a spherical Neumann function
kernel. This is useful for smaller values of xi. Also used is the near equality
of pairs of low order eigenvalues when the size parameter c is large that leads

programming (RMSP) model considering distributional robustness. We optimize the
RMSP over the worst-case distribution within an ambiguity set of probability
distributions constructed directly from historical data samples. The proposed
RMSP is intractable due to the multistage nested minimax structure in its
objective function, so we reformulate it into a deterministic equivalent that
contains a series of convex combination of expectation and conditional value at
risk (CVaR), which can be solved by a customized stochastic dual dynamic
programming (SDDP) algorithm in this paper. As the size of collected data
samples increases to infinity, we show the consistency of the RMSP with
distributional robustness to the traditional multistage stochastic programming.
In addition, to test the computational performance of our proposed model and
algorithm, we conduct numerical experiments for a risk-averse hydrothermal
scheduling problem, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of our
RMSP framework.

compute tasks can witness speedup by orders of magnitude. To maximize the
chance of in-memory data access, existing cache algorithms, be it recency- or
frequency-based, settle on cache hit ratio as the optimization objective.
However, unlike the conventional belief, we show in this paper that simply
pursuing a higher cache hit ratio of individual data blocks does not
necessarily translate into faster task completion in data-parallel
environments. A data-parallel task typically depends on multiple input data
blocks. Unless all of these blocks are cached in memory, no speedup will
result. To capture this all-or-nothing property, we propose a more relevant
metric, called effective cache hit ratio. Specifically, a cache hit of a data
block is said to be effective if it can speed up a compute task. In order to
optimize the effective cache hit ratio, we propose the Least Effective
Reference Count (LERC) policy that persists the dependent blocks of a compute
task as a whole in memory. We have implemented the LERC policy as a memory
manager in Spark and evaluated its performance through Amazon EC2 deployment.
Evaluation results demonstrate that LERC helps speed up data-parallel jobs by

connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they
produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area
and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training
framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on
MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while
forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the
network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done
iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and
maximally clustered mapping. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the
area (energy) consumption by 28% - 55% (49% - 67%) with respect to the original
network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28% - 49% (15% -
29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware
framework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the
memristive technology for reliable operations.

different galactic environment indicates that massive GMCs preferentially
reside along galactic spiral structures whereas inter-arm regions have many
small GMCs. Based on the phase transition dynamics from magnetized warm neutral
medium to molecular clouds, Kobayashi et al. 2017 proposes a semi-analytical
evolutionary description for GMC mass functions including cloud-cloud collision
(CCC) process. Their results show that CCC is less dominant in shaping the mass
function of GMCs compared with the accretion of dense HI gas driven by the
propagation of supersonic shock waves. However, their formulation does not take
into account the possible enhancement of star formation by CCC. Radio
observations within the Milky Way indicate the importance of CCC for the
formation of star clusters and massive stars. In this article, we reformulate
the time evolution equation largely modified from Kobayashi et al. 2017 so that
we additionally compute star formation subsequently taking place in CCC clouds.
Our results suggest that, although CCC events between smaller clouds outnumber
the ones between massive GMCs, CCC-driven star formation is mostly driven by
massive GMCs > 10^5.5 Msun (where Msun is the solar mass). The resultant
cumulative CCC-driven star formation may amount to a few 10 percent of the
total star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.

Sub-wavelength phononic bandgap opening in bubbly media, J. Diff. Eq., 263

This phenomena can be explained by the periodic inference of cell resonance
which is due to the high contrast in both the density and bulk modulus between
the bubbles and the surrounding medium. In this paper, we prove that the first
Bloch eigenvalue achieves its maximum at the corner of the Brillouin zone.
Moreover, by computing the asymptotic of the Bloch eigenfunctions in the
periodic structure near that critical frequency, we demonstrate that these
eigenfunctions can be decomposed into two parts: one part is slowly varying and
satisfies a homogenized equation, while the other is periodic across each
elementary crystal cell and is varying. They rigorously justify, in the
nondilute case, the observed super-focusing of acoustic waves in bubbly
crystals near and below the maximum of the first Bloch eigenvalue and confirm
the band gap opening near and above this critical frequency.

Successful models can highlight the principles by which a network is organized

review the prospects and promise of generative models for network neuroscience.
We begin with a primer on network generative models, with a discussion of
compressibility and predictability, utility in intuiting mechanisms, and a
short history on their use in network science broadly. We then discuss
generative models in practice and application, paying particular attention to
the critical need for cross-validation. Next, we review generative models of
biological neural networks, both at the cellular and large-scale level, and
across a variety of species including \emph{C. elegans}, \emph{Drosophila},
mouse, rat, cat, macaque, and human. We offer a careful treatment of a few
relevant distinctions, including differences between generative models and null
models, sufficiency and redundancy, inferring and claiming mechanism, and
functional and structural connectivity. We close with a discussion of future
directions, outlining exciting frontiers both in empirical data collection
efforts as well as in method and theory development that, together, further the

resembling the one of charged isotropic solutions. On the ground of this
database, and taking into account the conditions for physically realistic star
models, a method is proposed for generating all such solutions. It is based on
the energy density and the radial pressure as seeding functions. Numerous
relations between the realistic conditions are found and the need for a graphic
proof is reduced just to one pair of inequalities. This general formalism is
illustrated with an example of a class of solutions with linear equation of
state and simple energy density. It is found that the solutions depend on three
free constants and concrete examples are given. Some other popular models are
studied with the same method.

privacy. On the one hand, many of the popular techniques such as data
de-identification are problematic because of their dependence on the background
knowledge of adversaries. On the other hand, rigorous methods such as the
exponential mechanism for differential privacy are often computationally
impractical to use for releasing high dimensional data or cannot preserve high
utility of original data due to their extensive data perturbation.
  This paper presents a criterion called plausible deniability that provides a
formal privacy guarantee, notably for releasing sensitive datasets: an output
record can be released only if a certain amount of input records are
indistinguishable, up to a privacy parameter. This notion does not depend on
the background knowledge of an adversary. Also, it can efficiently be checked
by privacy tests. We present mechanisms to generate synthetic datasets with
similar statistical properties to the input data and the same format. We study
this technique both theoretically and experimentally. A key theoretical result
shows that, with proper randomization, the plausible deniability mechanism
generates differentially private synthetic data. We demonstrate the efficiency
of this generative technique on a large dataset; it is shown to preserve the
utility of original data with respect to various statistical analysis and
machine learning measures.

underlaying a cellular network where both D2D and cellular users (CUs) are
discrete power-rate systems with limited feedback from the receivers. It is
assumed that there exists an adversary which wants to eavesdrop on the
information transmission from the base station (BS) to CUs. Since D2D
communication shares the same spectrum with cellular network, cross
interference must be considered. However, when secrecy capacity is considered,
the interference caused by D2D communication can help to improve the secrecy
communications by confusing the eavesdroppers. Since both systems share the
same spectrum, cross interference must be considered. We formulate the proposed
resource allocation into an optimization problem whose objective is to maximize
the average transmission rate of D2D pair in the presence of the cellular
communications under average transmission power constraint. For the cellular
network, we require a minimum average achievable secrecy rate in the absence of
D2D communication as well as a maximum secrecy outage probability in the
presence of D2D communication which should be satisfied. Due to high complexity
convex optimization methods, to solve the proposed optimization problem, we
apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is an evolutionary approach.
Moreover, we model and study the error in the feedback channel and the
imperfectness of channel distribution information (CDI) using parametric and
nonparametric methods. Finally, the impact of different system parameters on
the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated through simulations. The
performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using numerical results for
different scenarios.

evolution of asteroids, and up to now has only been studied numerically. This
paper describes the first analytic model of the TYORP effect. Although the
model rests on numerous physical and mathematical simplifications, the final
analytic expression for TYORP is found to be in agreement with the results of
rigorous numeric simulations to the accuracy of several tens per cent.
  The obtained analytic expression is used to estimate the TYORP produced by
the non-flat surface of regolith, -- a contribution to TYORP that has never
been considered. It is found that the contribution to TYORP arising from
regolith can be comparable to the conventional TYORP produced by boulders.
  Then, the analytic expression is fitted with a log-normal function and used
to integrate TYORP over all boulder sizes. The general trend of TYORP for
multiple boulders appears qualitatively similar to the trend of one boulder,
and also demonstrates a maximal TYORP at some particular rotation rate. The
obtained expression for integrated TYORP may be instrumental for simulations of
evolution of asteroids subject to TYORP.
  To conclude, the physical origin of TYORP is discussed in light of the
constructed analytic model.

non-reciprocal wave propagation by exploring and exploiting the concept of
metastable modular metastructures. Through studying the dynamics of wave
propagation in a chain composed of finite metastable modules, we provide
experimental and analysis results on non-reciprocal wave propagation and unveil
the underlying mechanisms in accomplishing such unidirectional energy
transmission. Utilizing the property adaptation feature afforded via
transitioning amongst metastable states, we uncovered an unprecedented bandgap
reconfiguration characteristic, which enables the adaptivity of wave
propagation within the metastructure. Overall, this investigation elucidates
the rich dynamics attainable by periodicity, nonlinearity, asymmetry, and
metastability, and creates a new class of adaptive structural and material
systems capable of realizing tunable bandgaps and non-reciprocal wave
transmissions.

have attracted significant interest in recent years. Here we present new trends
in the study of radiation effects in solid methane. We particularly focus on
relaxation phenomena in solid methane pre-irradiated by energetic neutrons and
electron beam. We compare experimental results obtained in the temperature
range from 10K to 100K with a model based on the assumption that radiolysis
defect recombinations happen in two stages, at two different temperatures. In
the case of slow heating up of the solid methane sample, irradiated at 10K, the
first wave of recombination occurs around 20K with a further second wave taking
place between 50 and 60K. We also discuss the role of the recombination
mechanisms in burp phenomenon discovered by J. Carpenter in the late 1980s. An
understanding of these mechanisms is vital for the designing and operation of
solid methane moderators used in advanced neutron sources and could also be a
possible explanation for the driving forces behind cryo-volcanism on celestial
bodies.

  Networks","8 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to rapidly identify symmetry and anti-symmetry is an essential
attribute of intelligence. Symmetry perception is a central process in human
vision and may be key to human 3D visualization. While previous work in
understanding neuron symmetry perception has concentrated on the neuron as an
integrator, here we show how the coincidence detecting property of the spiking
neuron can be used to reveal symmetry density in spatial data. We develop a
method for synchronizing symmetry-identifying spiking artificial neural
networks to enable layering and feedback in the network. We show a method for
building a network capable of identifying symmetry density between sets of data
and present a digital logic implementation demonstrating an 8x8
leaky-integrate-and-fire symmetry detector in a field programmable gate array.
Our results show that the efficiencies of spiking neural networks can be
harnessed to rapidly identify symmetry in spatial data with applications in
image processing, 3D computer vision, and robotics.

E 97, 012150 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevE.97.012150",,"q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new model that combines economic growth rate fluctuations at the
microscopic and macroscopic level is presented. At the microscopic level, firms
are growing at different rates while also being exposed to idiosyncratic shocks
at the firm and sector level. We describe such fluctuations as independent
L\'evy-stable fluctuations, varying over multiple orders of magnitude. These
fluctuations are aggregated and measured at the macroscopic level in averaged
economic output quantities such as GDP. A fundamental question is thereby to
what extend individual firm size fluctuations can have a noticeable impact on
the overall economy. We argue that this question can be answered by considering
the L\'evy fluctuations as embedded in a steep confining potential well,
ensuring nonlinear mean-reversal behavior, without having to rely on
microscopic details of the system. The steepness of the potential well directly
controls the extend towards which idiosyncratic shocks to firms and sectors are
damped at the level of the economy. Additionally, the theory naturally accounts
for business cycles, represented in terms of a bimodal economic output
distribution, and thus connects two so far unrelated fields in economics. By
analyzing 200 years of US GDP growth rates, we find that the model is in good
agreement with the data.

  Analysis and Recommendations for the Data Infrastructure for CMIP6",,,,,"cs.DC cs.DB physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We document the data transfer workflow, data transfer performance, and other
aspects of staging approximately 56 terabytes of climate model output data from
the distributed Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive to the
National Energy Research Supercomputing Center (NERSC) at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory required for tracking and characterizing extratropical
storms, a phenomena of importance in the mid-latitudes. We present this
analysis to illustrate the current challenges in assembling multi-model data
sets at major computing facilities for large-scale studies of CMIP5 data.
Because of the larger archive size of the upcoming CMIP6 phase of model
intercomparison, we expect such data transfers to become of increasing
importance, and perhaps of routine necessity. We find that data transfer rates
using the ESGF are often slower than what is typically available to US
residences and that there is significant room for improvement in the data
transfer capabilities of the ESGF portal and data centers both in terms of
workflow mechanics and in data transfer performance. We believe performance
improvements of at least an order of magnitude are within technical reach using
current best practices, as illustrated by the performance we achieved in
transferring the complete raw data set between two high performance computing
facilities. To achieve these performance improvements, we recommend: that
current best practices (such as the Science DMZ model) be applied to the data
servers and networks at ESGF data centers; that sufficient financial and human
resources be devoted at the ESGF data centers for systems and network
engineering tasks to support high performance data movement; and that
performance metrics for data transfer between ESGF data centers and major
computing facilities used for climate data analysis be established, regularly
tested, and published.
