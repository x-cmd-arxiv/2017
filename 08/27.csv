are linearly coupled to their two nearest neighbors and to Ising spins
representing internal degrees of freedom. String-spin coupling induces a
long-range ferromagnetic interaction among spins that competes with a spin-spin
antiferromagnetic coupling. As a consequence, the complex phase diagram of the
system exhibits different flat rippled and buckled states, with first or second
order transition lines between states. The two-dimensional version of the model
has a similar phase diagram, which has been recently used to explain the
rippled to buckled transition observed in scanning tunnelling microscopy
experiments with suspended graphene sheets. Here we describe in detail the
phase diagram of the simpler one-dimensional model and phase stability using
bifurcation theory. This gives additional insight into the physical mechanisms
underlying the different phases and the behavior observed in experiments.

time-consuming to annotate data for traditional supervised classification, we
instead propose scalable Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) models for

political polls, and Cook partisan voting index as population level data. In
LLP classification settings, the training data is divided into a set of
unlabeled bags, where only the label distribution in of each bag is known,
removing the requirement of instance-level annotations. Our proposed LLP model,
Weighted Label Regularization (WLR), provides a scalable generalization of
prior work on label regularization to support weights for samples inside bags,
which is applicable in this setting where bags are arranged hierarchically
(e.g., county-level bags are nested inside of state-level bags). We apply our
model to Twitter data collected in the year leading up to the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, producing estimates of the relationships among political
sentiment and demographics over time and place. We find that our approach
closely tracks traditional polling data stratified by demographic category,
resulting in error reductions of 28-44% over baseline approaches. We also
provide descriptive evaluations showing how the model may be used to estimate
interactions among many variables and to identify linguistic temporal
variation, capabilities which are typically not feasible using traditional

the end of inflation in the early Universe, by using the irreversible
thermodynamic of open systems. The matter content of the Universe is assumed to
consist of the inflationary scalar field, which, through its decay, generates
relativistic matter, and pressureless dark matter, respectively. At the early
stages of reheating the inflationary scalar field transfers its energy to the
newly created matter particles, with the field energy decreasing to near zero.
The general equations governing the irreversible matter creation during
reheating are obtained by combining the thermodynamics description of the
matter creation and the gravitational field equations. A dimensionless form of
the general system of the reheating equations is also introduced. The role of
the different inflationary scalar field potentials is analyzed by using
analytical and numerical methods, and the evolution of the matter and scalar
field densities, as well as of the cosmological parameters during reheating,
are obtained. Typically, the values of the energy densities of relativistic
matter and dark matter reach their maximum when the Universe is reheated up to
the reheating temperature, which is determined for each case, as a function of
the scalar field decay width, the scalar field particle mass, and of the
cosmological parameters. An interesting result is that particle production
leads to the acceleration of the Universe during the reheating phase, with the
deceleration parameter showing a complex dynamics. Once the energy density of
the scalar field becomes negligible with respect to the matter densities, the
expansion of the Universe decelerates, and inflation has a graceful exit after
reheating.

distinguishing pathological from normal EEG recordings in the Temple University
Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus. We use two basic, shallow and deep ConvNet
architectures recently shown to decode task-related information from EEG at
least as well as established algorithms designed for this purpose. In decoding
EEG pathology, both ConvNets reached substantially better accuracies (about 6%
better, ~85% vs. ~79%) than the only published result for this dataset, and
were still better when using only 1 minute of each recording for training and
only six seconds of each recording for testing. We used automated methods to
optimize architectural hyperparameters and found intriguingly different ConvNet
architectures, e.g., with max pooling as the only nonlinearity. Visualizations
of the ConvNet decoding behavior showed that they used spectral power changes
in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, possibly alongside
other features, consistent with expectations derived from spectral analysis of
the EEG data and from the textual medical reports. Analysis of the textual
medical reports also highlighted the potential for accuracy increases by
integrating contextual information, such as the age of subjects. In summary,
the ConvNets and visualization techniques used in this study constitute a next
step towards clinically useful automated EEG diagnosis and establish a new
baseline for future work on this topic.

examined how the derived magnetic field structure correlates with the disc

drawbacks for assessing the data distribution in the plot. We propose
gatherplots, an extension of scatterplots that eliminates overplotting,

to the same position coalesces to form a stacked entity, thereby making it
easier to compare the absolute and relative sizes of data groupings. The size
and aspect ratio of data points can also be changed dynamically to make it
easier to compare the composition of different groups. Furthermore, several
embedded interaction techniques support slicing and dicing the gatherplot by
pivoting on particular dimensions, ranges, and values in the dataset. Our
evaluation shows that gatherplots enable users from the general public to judge
the relative portion of subgroups more quickly and more correctly than when
using conventional scatterplots with jittering. Furthermore, a review conducted

the regolith layer on small bodies and their variations in the layer that
largely influence the collisional and thermal evolution of the bodies. We
conducted compression experiments and investigated the relationship between the
porosity and the compression using fluffy granular samples. We focused on a
low-pressure and high-porosity regime. We used tens of {\mu}m-sized irregular
and spherical powders as analogs of porous regolith. The initial porosity of
the samples ranged from 0.80 to 0.53. The uniaxial pressure applied to the
samples lays in the range from 30 to 4x10^5 Pa. The porosity of the samples
remained at their initial values below a threshold pressure and then decreased
when the pressure exceeded the threshold. We defined this uniaxial pressure at
the threshold as ""yield strength"". The yield strength increased as the initial
porosity of a sample decreased. The yield strengths of samples consisting of
irregular particles did not significantly depend on their size distributions
when the samples had the same initial porosity. We compared the results of our
experiments with a previously proposed theoretical model. We calculated the
average interparticle force acting on contact points of constituent particles
under the uniaxial pressure of yield strength using the theoretical model and
compared it with theoretically estimated forces required to roll or slide the
particles. The calculated interparticle force was larger than the rolling
friction force and smaller than the sliding friction force. The yield strength
of regolith may be constrained by these forces. Our results may be useful for
planetary scientists to estimate the depth above which the porosity of a
regolith layer is almost equal to that of the regolith surface and to interpret
the compression property of an asteroid surface obtained by a lander.

in physical quantities. The changes can occur for various reasons; these
reasons are highlighted in this work. Outliers are unusual measurements.
Outliers are important; they are information-bearing occurrences. This work
seeks to identify them based on an approach presented in [1]. A critical review
of most previous works in this area has been presented in [2], and few more are
considered here just to set the stage. The main work can be described as this;
given a set of measurements from sensors that represent a normal situation, [1]
proceeds by first estimating the probability density function (pdf) of the set
using a data-split approach, then estimate the entropy of the set using the
arithmetic mean as an approximation for the expectation. The increase in
entropy that occurs when strange data is recorded is used to detect unusual
measurements in the test set depending on the desired confidence interval or
false alarm rate. The results presented in [1] have been confirmed for
different test signals such as the Gaussian, Beta, in one dimension and beta in
two dimensions, and a beta and uniform mixture distribution in two dimensions.
Finally, the method was confirmed on real data and the results are presented.
The major drawbacks of [1] were identified, and a method that seeks to mitigate
this using the Bhattacharyya distance is presented. This method detects more
subtle anomalies, especially the type that would pass as normal in [1].
Finally, recommendations for future research are presented: the subject of
interpretability, especially for subtle measurements, being the most elusive as
of today.

(GI) and the Tamura coefficient (TC), for holographic autofocusing on
dense/connected or sparse samples. We provide a theoretical analysis predicting
that for uniformly distributed image data, TC and GI exhibit similar behavior,
while for naturally sparse images containing few high-valued signal entries and
many low-valued noisy background pixels, TC is more sensitive to distribution
changes in the signal and more resistive to background noise. These predictions
are also confirmed by experimental results using SoG-based holographic
autofocusing on dense and connected samples (such as stained breast tissue
sections) as well as highly sparse samples (such as isolated Giardia lamblia
cysts). Through these experiments, we found that ToG and GoG offer almost
identical autofocusing performance on dense and connected samples, whereas for
naturally sparse samples, GoG should be calculated on a relatively small region
of interest (ROI) closely surrounding the object, while ToG offers more
flexibility in choosing a larger ROI containing more background pixels.

Concrete schemes for two classic model equations are constructed with
semi-implicit, linear-implicit properties that make considerable lower cost

Vibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=4-3 emission lines were detected for HCN and
HNC, but not for HCO+. Their observed flux ratios further support our
previously obtained suggestion, based on J=3-2 data, that (1) infrared
radiative pumping plays a role in rotational excitation at v=0, at least for
HCN and HNC, and (2) HCN abundance is higher than HCO+ and HNC. The flux
measurements of the isotopologue H13CN, H13CO+, and HN13C J=3-2 emission lines
support the higher HCN abundance scenario. Based on modeling with collisional
excitation, we constrain the physical properties of these line-emitting
molecular gas, but find that higher HNC rotational excitation than HCN and HCO+
is difficult to explain, due to the higher effective critical density of HNC.

micron infrared spectrum and find that our observational results are well
explained if the radiation source is located at 30-100 pc from the molecular
gas. The simultaneously covered very bright CO J=3-2 emission line displays a
broad emission wing, which we interpret as being due to molecular outflow

transportation system. Accurate modeling of the spatiotemporally varying
traffic speed thus plays a crucial role in urban planning and development. This
paper addresses the problem of efficient fine-grained traffic speed prediction
using big traffic data obtained from static sensors. Gaussian processes (GPs)
have been previously used to model various traffic phenomena, including flow
and speed. However, GPs do not scale with big traffic data due to their cubic
time complexity. In this work, we address their efficiency issues by proposing
local GPs to learn from and make predictions for correlated subsets of data.
The main idea is to quickly group speed variables in both spatial and temporal
dimensions into a finite number of clusters, so that future and unobserved
traffic speed queries can be heuristically mapped to one of such clusters. A
local GP corresponding to that cluster can then be trained on the fly to make
predictions in real-time. We call this method localization. We use non-negative
matrix factorization for localization and propose simple heuristics for cluster
mapping. We additionally leverage on the expressiveness of GP kernel functions
to model road network topology and incorporate side information. Extensive
experiments using real-world traffic data collected in the two U.S. cities of
Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., show that our proposed local GPs significantly
improve both runtime performances and prediction accuracies compared to the
baseline global and local GPs.

  Despite its importance, all proofs of the correctness of Strassen's famous

investigate virtual knot concordance. The signatures are defined first for
almost classical knots, which are virtual knots admitting homologically trivial
representations. The signatures and $\omega$-signatures are shown to give
bounds on the topological slice genus of almost classical knots, and they are
applied to address a recent question of Dye, Kaestner, and Kauffman on the
virtual slice genus of classical knots. A conjecture on the topological slice
genus is formulated and confirmed for all classical knots with up to 11
crossings and for 2150 out of 2175 of the 12 crossing knots.
  The Seifert pairing is used to define directed Alexander polynomials, which
we show satisfy a Fox-Milnor criterion when the almost classical knot is slice.
We introduce virtual disk-band surfaces and use them to establish realization
theorems for Seifert matrices of almost classical knots. As a consequence, we
deduce that any integral polynomial $\Delta(t)$ satisfying $\Delta(1)=1$ occurs
as the Alexander polynomial of an almost classical knot.
  In the last section, we use parity projection and Turaev's coverings of knots
to extend the Tristram-Levine signatures to all virtual knots. A key step is a
theorem saying that parity projection preserves concordance of virtual knots.
This theorem implies that the signatures, $\omega$-signatures, and Fox-Milnor
criterion can be lifted to give slice obstructions for all virtual knots. There
are 76 almost classical knots with up to six crossings, and we use our
invariants to determine the slice status for all of them and the slice genus
for all but four. Table 2 at the end summarizes our findings.

sequence hypothesis (M. O. Steinmetz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.

trigger sequence that is dimerized and, subsequently, the remainder N terminal
(NT) part of each monomer (that is partially ordered) zips together to form the
coiled coil. In this work, methods are developed to computationally explore the
trigger sequence hypothesis based on an extension of a previously introduced

Replica Exchange Method Mean Square (HTREM_MS) procedure, which scales the
Hamiltonian in both potential and kinetic energies, to enhance sampling
generically, along with additional restraints to enhance sampling in desired
regions of conformational space. The method is applied to a 31-residue
truncation of the 33-residue leucine zipper (GCN4-p1) of the yeast
transcriptional activator GCN4. Using a variety of HTREM_MS simulations, we
find that the NT of one monomer of the dimer becomes disordered when the NT
parts of the monomers are separated. In contrast, when the CT parts of the
monomers are separated, both monomers remain alpha helical. These simulations
suggest that the CT does act as a trigger sequence and are consistent with a
disordered NT. We also investigate whether the disordered NT can be induced to
re-form the dimerized leucine zipper. It does, but with some lack of recovery
of alpha helical hydrogen bonding structure in the NT.

with a photo multiplier tube and its signal is observed on an oscilloscope. The
detector construction can be achieved by relatively simple means and can be
used as an educational tool.

algebraic domains. A survey of their elementary properties is provided.
Examples of periods includes Feynman Integrals from Quantum Physics and
Multiple Zeta Values from Number Theory.
  But what about finite characteristic, via the global-to-local principle? We
include some considerations regarding periods and Jacobi sums, the analog of
Veneziano amplitudes in String Theory.

angular momentum in an external field is derived. Methods for the extraction of
an electron vortex beam with a given orbital polarization and for the
manipulation of such a beam are developed.

  Measures for Wikipedia Authors",,,,,"cs.DL cs.DB cs.DC cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wikipedia, an open collaborative website, can be edited by anyone, even
anonymously, thus becoming victim to ill-intentioned changes. Therefore,
ranking Wikipedia authors by calculating impact measures based on the edit
history can help to identify reputational users or harmful activity such as
vandalism \cite{Adler:2008:MAC:1822258.1822279}. However, processing millions
of edits on one system can take a long time. The author implements an open
source framework to calculate such rankings in a distributed way (MapReduce)
and evaluates its performance on various sized datasets. A reimplementation of
the contribution measures by \citeauthor{Adler:2008:MAC:1822258.1822279}
demonstrates its extensibility and usability, as well as problems of handling
huge datasets and their possible resolutions. The results put different
performance optimizations into perspective and show that horizontal scaling can
decrease the total processing time.

macro-molecules, such as RNA and single-stranded DNA. Methods of ""writing"" and
""reading"" macromolecular strands are currently available, but they are slow and
expensive. In an ideal molecular data storage system, routine operations such
as write, read, erase, store, and transfer must be done reliably and at high
speed within an integrated chip. As a first step toward demonstrating the
feasibility of this concept, we report preliminary results of DNA readout
experiments conducted in miniaturized chambers that are scalable to even
smaller dimensions. We show that translocation of a single-stranded DNA
molecule (consisting of 50 adenosine bases followed by 100 cytosine bases)
through an ion-channel yields a characteristic signal that is attributable to
the 2-segment structure of the molecule. We also examine the dependence of the
rate and speed of molecular translocation on the adjustable parameters of the
experiment.
