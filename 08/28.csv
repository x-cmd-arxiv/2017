as assorted nuclear chromatin patterns in a tumor, assorted species of bacteria
in biofilms, or assorted aggregates of subcellular particles. Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Component Analysis (MCA) provide
information about which features in multidimensional data aggregate, but do not
provide in situ spatial information about these aggregations. This paper
outlines the Numericized Histogram Score (NHS) algorithm, which converts the
histogram distribution of shortest distances between objects into a continuous
variable that can be represented as a spatial heatmap. A histogram can be
transformed into an intensity value by assigning a weighting factor to each
sequential bin. Each object in an image can be replaced by its NHS value, which
when calibrated to a color scale results in a heatmap. These spatial heatmaps
reveal regions of aggregation amid heterogeneity that would otherwise mask
loco-regional spatial associations, which will be especially useful in the
field of digital pathology. In addition to visualizing aggregations as
heatmaps, the ability to calculate degrees of recurring patterns of aggregation
allows investigators to stratify samples for further insights into clinical
outcome, response to treatment, or omic subtypes (genomic, transcriptomic,
proteomic, metabolomic, etc.).

sizing problem. Capital flow constraint is different from traditional capacity
constraints: when a manufacturer launches production, its present capital
should not be less than its present total production cost; otherwise, it must
decrease production quantity or suspend production. Unsatisfied demand in one
period may cause customer's demand to shrink in the next period considering
loss of goodwill. Fixed loan can be adopted in the starting period for
production. A mixed integer model for a deterministic single-item problem is
constructed. Based on the analysis about the structure of optimal solutions, we
approximate it to a traveling salesman problem, and divide it into sub-linear
programming problems without integer variables. A forward recursive algorithm
with heuristic adjustments is proposed to solve it. When unit variable
production costs are equal and goodwill loss rate is zero, the algorithm can
obtain optimal solutions. Under other situations, numerical comparisons with
CPLEX 12.6.2 show our algorithm can reach optimal in most cases and has
computation time advantage for large-size problems. Numerical tests also
demonstrate that initial capital availability as well as loan interest rate can
substantially affect the manufacturer's optimal lot sizing decisions.

defined as the amount of information needed to specify when to stop while

could be equivalently defined as (a) the minimal plain complexity of a Turing
machine that stops after reading $x$ on a one-directional input tape; (b) the
minimal plain complexity of an algorithm that enumerates a prefix-free set

first $x$ is understood as a terminated binary string; (d) as a minimal upper

supercritical Hopf~bifurcation from $x \equiv 0$ in the well-understood
single-delay case $b = \infty$. Normalizing $f' (0)=1$, branches of constant
minimal period $p_k = 2\pi/\omega_k$ are known to bifurcate from eigenvalues
$i\omega_k = i(k+\tfrac{1}{2})\pi$ at $\lambda_k = (-1)^{k+1}\omega_k$, for any
nonnegative integer $k$. The unstable dimension of these rapidly oscillating
periodic solutions is $k$, at the local branch $k$. We obtain stabilization of
such branches, for arbitrarily large unstable dimension $k$, and for,
necessarily, delicately narrow regions of control amplitudes $b < 0$.
  For $p$:= $p_k$ the branch $k$ of constant period $p_k$ persists as a
solution, for any $b\neq 0$. Indeed the delayed feedback term controlled by $b$
vanishes on branch $k$: the feedback control is noninvasive there. Following an
idea of Pyragas (1992), we seek parameter regions $\mathcal{P} =
(\underline{b}_k,\overline{b}_k)$ of controls $b \neq 0$ such that the branch
$k$ becomes stable, locally at Hopf~bifurcation. We determine rigorous
expansions for $\mathcal{P}$ in the limit of large $k$. Our analysis is based
on a 2-scale covering lift for the slow and rapid frequencies involved.
  These results complement earlier results by Fiedler and Oliva (2016) which
required control terms $$b^{-1} (x(t-\vartheta) + x(t-\vartheta -p/2))$$ with a
third delay $\vartheta$ near 1.

alphabets is not feasible, this work introduces the notion of almost lossless
source coding. Analog to the weak variable-length source coding problem studied
by Han (IEEE TIT, 2000, 46, 1217-1226), almost lossless source coding aims at
relaxing the lossless block-wise assumption to allow an average per-letter
distortion that vanishes asymptotically as the block-length tends to infinity.
In this setup, we show on one hand that Shannon entropy characterizes the
minimum achievable rate (similarly to the case of finite alphabet sources)
while on the other that almost lossless universal source coding becomes
feasible for the family of finite-entropy stationary memoryless sources with
infinite alphabets. Furthermore, we study a stronger notion of almost lossless
universality that demands uniform convergence of the average per-letter
distortion to zero, where we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for
the so-called family of envelope distributions to achieve it. Remarkably, this
condition is the same necessary and sufficient condition needed for the
existence of a strongly minimax (lossless) universal source code for the family
of envelope distributions. Finally, we show that an almost lossless coding
scheme offers faster rate of convergence for the (minimax) redundancy compared
to the well-known information radius developed for the lossless case at the
expense of tolerating a non-zero distortion that vanishes to zero as the
block-length grows. This shows that even when lossless universality is
feasible, an almost lossless scheme can offer different regimes on the rates of
convergence of the (worst case) redundancy versus the (worst case) distortion.

simulated by the direct simulation BGK (DSBGK) method. These flows are
rarefied, within the slip and transitional flow regimes, which are beyond many
traditional computational fluid dynamic simulation schemes, such as those based
on the continuum flow assumption. The flows are very slow and thus many
traditional particle simulation methods suffer large statistical noises. The
adopted method is a combination of particle and gas kinetic methods and it can
simulate micro-flows properly. The simulation results of mass flow rates have
excellent agreement with experimental measurements. In another case of 2D
channel, the DSBGK comparisons with the DSMC result and the solution of Shakhov
equation are also in very good agreement. Another finding from this study is
that numerical simulations by including two reservoirs at the channel ends lead
to appreciable differences in simulation results of velocity and pressure
distributions within the micro-channel. This is due to the inhaling and
exhaling effects of reservoirs at the channel ends. Even though excluding those
reservoirs may accelerate the simulations significantly by using a single
channel in simulations, special attentions are needed because this treatment
may over-simplify the problem, and some procedures and results may be
questionable. One example is to determine the surface momentum accommodation
coefficient by using analytical solution of the mass flow rate obtained in a
single-channel problem without the confinement effect of reservoirs at the two
ends.

the largest known value of {\delta} in a non-iterative manner. We do this by
using the algebraic structure to go directly to large limiting values, reducing
the problem to a simpler combinatorial optimization problem. While these
limiting values are not necessarily feasible, we give an explicit algorithm for
arbitrarily approximating them by feasible {\delta}. Using this approach, we
find the largest known value of {\delta} to date, {\delta} = 0.9808348. We also

a challenging task due to differences in structural content and contrast. Too
thick and wide specimens cannot be processed all at once and must be cut into
smaller pieces. This dramatically increases the complexity of the problem,
since each piece should be individually and manually pre-aligned. To the best
of our knowledge, no automatic method can reliably locate such piece of tissue
within its respective whole in the MRI slice, and align it without any prior
information. We propose here a novel automatic approach to the joint problem of
multimodal registration between histology and MRI, when only a fraction of
tissue is available from histology. The approach relies on the representation
of images using their level lines so as to reach contrast invariance. Shape
elements obtained via the extraction of bitangents are encoded in a
projective-invariant manner, which permits the identification of common pieces
of curves between two images. We evaluated the approach on human brain
histology and compared resulting alignments against manually annotated ground
truths. Considering the complexity of the brain folding patterns, preliminary
results are promising and suggest the use of characteristic and meaningful
shape elements for improved robustness and efficiency.

D 96, 083511 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevD.96.083511",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models of inflationary magnetogenesis with a coupling to the electromagnetic
action of the form $f^2 F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$, are known to suffer from several
problems. These include the strong coupling problem, the back reaction problem
and also strong constraints due to Schwinger effect. We propose a model which
resolves all these issues. In our model, the coupling function, $f$, grows
during inflation and transits to a decaying phase post inflation. This
evolutionary behaviour is chosen so as to avoid the problem of strong coupling.
By assuming a suitable power law form of the coupling function, we can also
neglect back reaction effects during inflation. To avoid back reaction
post-inflation, we find that the reheating temperature is restricted to be
below $ \approx 1.7 \times 10^4$ GeV. The magnetic energy spectrum is predicted
to be non-helical and generically blue. The estimated present day magnetic
field strength and the corresponding coherence length taking reheating at the
QCD epoch(150 MeV) are $ 1.4 \times 10^{-12}$ G and $6.1 \times 10^{-4}$ Mpc,
respectively. This is obtained after taking account of nonlinear processing
over and above the flux freezing evolution after reheating. If we consider also
the possibility of a non-helical inverse cascade, as indicated in direct
numerical simulations, the coherence length and the magnetic field strength are
even larger. In all cases mentioned above, the magnetic fields generated in our
models satisfy the $\gamma$-ray bound below a certain reheating temperature.

based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of their coupled systems, including
the presence of a biosphere and the possibility of what we call an
agency-dominated biosphere (i.e. an energy-intensive technological species).
The premise is that Earths entry into the Anthropocene represents what might be
from an astrobiological perspective a predictable planetary transition. We
explore this problem from the perspective of the solar system and exoplanet
studies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms of free energy
generation driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for
global evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological
transformations driven by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences
(which might have reached a turning point with global urbanization). Finally,
we describe quantitatively the classification scheme based on the maintenance
of chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other
worlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the
Anthropocene can be seen as the onset of the hybridization of the planet - a
transitional stage from one class of planetary systems interaction to another.
For Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield not
just new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel
planetary ecosystem functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and
enhance planetary dissipation.

its ability to drill sub-surface tunnels and canals into glass substrates, a

various mixing processes which bring these elements to the surface.

  We develop a new carbon model atom including CII/III/IV/V, and discuss
problems related to carbon spectroscopy in O-type stars. We describe different
tests to examine the reliability of our implementation, and investigate which
mechanisms influence the carbon ionization balance. By comparing with
high-resolution spectra from six O-type stars, we check in how far
observational constraints can be reproduced by our new carbon line synthesis.
  Carbon lines are even more sensitive to a variation of temperature, gravity,
and mass-loss rate, than hydrogen/helium lines. We are able to reproduce most
of the observed lines from our stellar sample, and to estimate those specific
carbon abundances which bring the lines from different ions into agreement. For
hot dwarfs and supergiants earlier than O7, X-rays from wind-embedded shocks
can impact the synthesized line strengths, particularly for CIV, potentially
affecting the abundance determination.
  We have demonstrated our capability to derive realistic carbon abundances by
means of FASTWIND, using our recently developed model atom. We found that
complex effects can have a strong influence on the carbon ionization balance in
hot stars. For a further understanding, the UV range needs to be explored as

isolated Wolf-Rayet (WR) star HD 56925. We present millimeter/submillimeter
observations of $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) line emission toward the entire

$\sim$54, and $\sim$67 km s$^{-1}$, and three HI clouds: two of them are at
VLSR $\sim$54 km s$^{-1}$ and the other is at $\sim$63 km s$^{-1}$. These
clouds except for the CO cloud at 67 km s$^{-1}$ are limb-brightened in the
radio continuum, suggesting part of each cloud has been ionized. We newly found
an expanding gas motion of CO/HI, whose center and expansion velocities are
$\sim$51 and $\sim$4.5 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This is consistent with large
line widths of the CO and HI clouds at 54 km s$^{-1}$. The kinematic
temperature of CO clouds at 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$ are derived to be 17 and 61
K, respectively, whereas that of the CO cloud at 67 km s$^{-1}$ is only 6 K,
indicating that the former two clouds have been heated by strong UV radiation.
We concluded that the 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$ CO clouds and three HI clouds are
associated with NGC 2359, even if these clouds have different velocities.
Although the velocity difference including the expanding motion are typical
signatures of the stellar feedback from the exciting star, our analysis
revealed that the observed large momentum for the 37 km s$^{-1}$ CO cloud
cannot be explained only by the total wind momentum of the WR star and its
progenitor. We therefore propose an alternative scenario that the isolated
high-mass progenitor of HD 56925 was formed by a collision between the CO
clouds at 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$. If we apply the collision scenario, NGC 2359
corresponds to the final phase of the cloud-cloud collision.

freezeout scheme where all hadrons are assumed to freezeout at the same thermal
state and a flavor dependent sequential freezeout scheme with different
freezeout thermal states for hadrons with or without valence strange quarks.
The data of mean hadron yields as well as scaled variance of net proton and net
charge distributions have been analysed. We find the freezeout temperature $T$
to drop by $\sim5\%$ while the dimensionless freezeout parameters $\mu_B/T$ and
$VT^3$ ($\mu_B$ and $V$ are the baryon chemical potential and the volume at
freezeout respectively) are insensitive to the systematics of the input hadron
spectrum. The observed hint of flavor hierarchy in $T$ and $VT^3$ with only
confirmed resonances survives the systematics of the hadron spectrum. It is
more prominent between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\sim10 - 100$ GeV where the maximum
hierarchy in $T\sim10\%$ and $VT^3\sim40\%$. However, the uncertainties in the
thermal parameters due to the systematics of the hadron spectrum and their
decay properties do not allow us to make a quantitative estimate of the flavor
hierarchy yet.

membranes (controlled by a bending rigidity) in thermodynamic equilibrium in
two dimensions. Building on work by Berry, Nye, Longuet-Higgins and others, we
show that the statistics of specular points is fully characterized by three
fundamental length scales, namely, a correlation length $\xi$, a microscopic
length scale $\ell$ and the overall size $L$ of the interface or membrane. By
combining a scaling analysis with numerical simulations, we confirm the

Earth-size planets with orbital periods $P_\mathrm{orb}\sim 1\,$day was
recently identified in an analysis of data from the Kepler planet candidate
catalog. We argue that these objects could represent the remnant rocky cores of
giant planets that arrived at the stellar vicinity on high-eccentricity orbits
and were rapidly stripped of their gaseous envelopes after crossing their
respective Roche limits (RLs) $a_\mathrm{R,p}$. In this picture, objects with
$P_\mathrm{orb}\gtrsim1\,$day are mostly ""early"" cores that originated in
planets with an initial periastron distance $a_\mathrm{per,0}\le
a_\mathrm{R,p}$; they had high initial eccentricities but their orbits
underwent fast tidal circularization after the cores were exposed. Objects with
$P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim 1\,$day are, by contrast, mostly ""late"" cores that
originated in planets with $a_\mathrm{per,0}>a_\mathrm{R,p}$; these planets
underwent orbital circularization to a radius $>a_\mathrm{per,0}$ but
eventually reached $a_\mathrm{R,p}$ through tidal orbital decay. This picture
naturally accounts for the spatial distribution of hot Earths and for the
similarity of their inferred occurrence rate to that of hot Jupiters, and it
fits well with the interpretation of the so-called sub-Jovian desert in the

coded by the same gene. Structurally altered proteins usually lose their
functions and sometimes gain an undesirable function instead. These types of
mutations and their effects can result in genetic diseases or antibiotic
resistant bacteria, among other health issues. Important curing methods have
been developed for detecting mutations against AIDS as well as genetic
diseases. Another example is the influenza virus. The reasons why a vaccination
developed to fight against influenza does not work the following year are (a)
the mutation of its DNA and (b) the outbreak of the virus after it has been
mutated especially if it is a virus that escaped the vaccinations target. Due
to such reasons, it is highly important to know in advance the location of a
potential mutation in a protein as well as the problems it might cause the
medical sciences. In this study we have used artificial neural networks, which
are one of the latest artificial intelligence technologies, to determine the
effects of cancer mutations. The model we developed has given more successful
results compared to other methods. We foresee that our model will bring a new
dimension to medical research and the medical industry.

order to address this issue, we introduce the multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) three-way channel (3WC) with an intermittent node and study its
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region and sum-DoF. We devise a non-adaptive encoding
scheme based on zero-forcing, interference alignment and erasure coding, and
show its DoF region (and thus sum-DoF) optimality for non-intermittent 3WCs and
its sum-DoF optimality for (node-)intermittent 3WCs. However, we show by
example that in general some DoF tuples in the intermittent 3WC can only be
achieved by adaptive schemes, such as decode-forward relaying. This shows that
non-adaptive encoding is sufficient for the non-intermittent 3WC and for the
sum-DoF of intermittent 3WCs, but adaptive encoding is necessary for the DoF
region of intermittent 3WCs. Our work contributes to a better understanding of
the fundamental limits of multi-way communication systems with intermittency

privacy-preserving access control framework for Tor. TorPolice enables
abuse-plagued service providers such as Yelp to enforce access rules to police

pressures in excess of a few TPa creating the novel super-dense phases of
Aluminium and silicon [1-5]. Recently it was demonstrated that the Bessel beam
(BB) focused inside sapphire produced the cylindrical void being two orders of
magnitude larger than that generated by the GB [6-8]. Analysis of the
experimental data presented below allows making the remarkable conclusions
based solely on the void size measurements without any ad hoc assumptions about
the interaction process. First, the void size is direct evidence of strong
(>40%) absorption of the pulse energy. Second, it is a direct experimental
evidence of the high-energy concentration in the central spike of the focus.
The unique features of the intense Bessel beam interaction then allow
understanding the experimental observation. This interaction generates early in
the pulse time the spatial distribution of excited permittivity changing from
positive to negative values. Then the light interacts with
zero-real-permittivity surface, separating plasma and dielectric areas, which
leads to high energy concentration near the axis of cylindrical focus up to
several MJ/cm3 (pressure range of 4-8 TPa). The effect depends on the angle
between the permittivity gradient and the field polarisation. High pressure
generates intense cylindrical shock/ rarefaction waves, which led to formation
of void and compressed shell. We demonstrate that the Bessel beam proves to be
an effective tool for producing extreme pressure/temperature conditions on the
laboratory tabletop. It appears that adjusting polarisation and permittivity
gradient might be a novel way for increasing the maximum pressure. This tool
allows for search of novel high-pressure material phases, for the 3D laser
machining and for creating Warm Dense Matter as those in star cores.

is essential to estimate the spillover effect in each specific network
separately. However, the unbiased estimation of these network-specific

upon recent work and focus on electrically-polarizable metagratings, comprised
of loaded conducting wires in front of a perfect elecric conductor, excited by
transverse-electric polarized fields, which are more practical for planar
fabrication. The derivation further relates the metagrating performance
parameters to the individual meta-atom load, facilitating an efficient
semianalytical synthesis scheme to determine the required conductor geometry

feature preferable working points, in which the sensitivity to these
non-idealities is rather low. The analytical relations shed light on the
physical origin of this phenomenon, associating it with fundamental
interference processes taking place in the device. These results, verified via

  Quality Prediction","Add the link of source code",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) remains a very challenging problem due
to the unavailability of a reference image. Deep learning based BIQA methods
have been attracting increasing attention in recent years, yet it remains a
difficult task to train a robust deep BIQA model because of the very limited
number of training samples with human subjective scores. Most existing methods
learn a regression network to minimize the prediction error of a scalar image
quality score. However, such a scheme ignores the fact that an image will
receive divergent subjective scores from different subjects, which cannot be
adequately represented by a single scalar number. This is particularly true on
complex, real-world distorted images. Moreover, images may broadly differ in
their distributions of assigned subjective scores. Recognizing this, we propose
a new representation of perceptual image quality, called probabilistic quality
representation (PQR), to describe the image subjective score distribution,
whereby a more robust loss function can be employed to train a deep BIQA model.
The proposed PQR method is shown to not only speed up the convergence of deep
model training, but to also greatly improve the achievable level of quality
prediction accuracy relative to scalar quality score regression methods. The

insulator for light by utilizing a Dirac-Maxwell correspondence. Departing from
structural photonic approaches which mimic the pseudo-spin-\textonehalf{}
behavior of electrons, we exploit the integer spin and discrete symmetries of
the photon to formulate a distinct bosonic topological phase of matter. We
introduce a bosonic Kramers theorem and the photonic equivalent of topological
quantization, which arises solely from photon spin. Our continuum field theory
predicts that photons acquire a mass in the presence of a spatio-temporally
dispersive degenerate chirality, a unique form of magneto-electric coupling
inside matter fundamentally different from well-known chirality,
magneto-electricity, gyrotropy or bi-anisotropy. We predict that this unique
dispersive (non-local) degenerate chiral medium has anomalous parity and
time-reversal symmetries and if found in nature will exhibit a gapped Quantum
spin-1 Hall bosonic phase. Photons do not possess a conductivity transport
parameter which can be quantized (unlike electronic systems), but we predict
that photon spin quantization of symmetry-protected edge states is amenable to
experimental isolation leading to a new bosonic phase of matter.

on its accuracy for complex atomic systems. To facilitate the development of
the theory further we aim to measure transition dipole matrix elements of
metastable helium (He*) (the ideal 3 body test-bed) to the highest accuracy
thus far. We have undertaken a measurement of the `tune-out wavelength' which
occurs when the contributions to the dynamic polarizability from all atomic
transitions sum to zero; thus illuminating an atom with this wavelength of
light then produces no net energy shift. This provides a strict constraint on
the transition dipole matrix elements without the complication and inaccuracy
of other methods.
  Using a novel atom-laser based technique we have made the first measurement
of the tune-out wavelength in metastable helium between the $3^{3}P_{1,2,3}$

Dritschel (J. Fluid Mech. 521, 2004, pp. 343-352) to provide balanced
initializations for two-dimensional and three-dimensional geophysical flows,
here in the simpler context of a finite dimensional Hamiltonian two-scale
system with strong gyroscopic forces. It is well known that when the potential
is analytic, such systems have an approximate slow manifold that is defined up
to terms that are exponentially small with respect to the scale separation
parameter. The method of optimal balance relies on the observation that the
approximate slow manifold remains an adiabatic invariant under slow
deformations of the nonlinear interactions. The method is formulated as a
boundary value problem for a homotopic deformation of the system from a linear
regime, where the slow-fast splitting is known exactly, to the full nonlinear
regime. We show that, providing the ramp function which defines the homotopy is
of Gevrey class 2 and satisfies vanishing conditions to all orders at the
temporal end points, the solution of the optimal balance boundary value problem
yields a point on the approximate slow manifold that is exponentially close to
the approximation to the slow manifold via exponential asymptotics, albeit with
a smaller power of the small parameter in the exponent. In general, the order
of accuracy of optimal balance is limited by the order of vanishing derivatives
of the ramp function at the temporal end points. We also give a numerical
demonstration of the efficacy of optimal balance, showing the dependence of
accuracy on the ramp time and the ramp function.

Therefore it is of importance to make black hole mass measurements as accurate

black hole mass of $6.61\pm0.25\,$M$_{\odot}$, based on an orbital inclination
$i$ of $51.0\pm0.9$ degrees. This was obtained by Cantrell et al. (2010), as an
average of independent fits to $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band light curves. In this
work we perform an independent check on the value of $i$ by re-analyzing
existing YALO/SMARTS $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band photometry, using different
modeling software and fitting strategy. Performing a fit to the three light
curves simultaneously, we obtain a value for $i$ of $54.1\pm1.1$ degrees,
resulting in a black hole mass of $5.86\pm0.24\,$M$_{\odot}$. Applying the same
model to the light curves individually, we obtain $58.2\pm1.9$, $53.6\pm1.6$
and $50.5\pm2.2$ degrees for $V$-, $I$- and $H$-band, respectively, where the
differences in best-fitting $i$ are caused by the contribution of the residual
accretion disc light in the three different bands. We conclude that the mass
determination of this black hole may still be subject to systematic effects
exceeding the statistical uncertainty. Obtaining more accurate masses would be
greatly helped by continuous phase-resolved spectroscopic observations
simultaneous with photometry.

enumeration of properly colored triangulations. The enumeration of plane
lattice walks confined to the first quadrant is governed by similar equations,
and has led in the past 20 years to a rich collection of attractive results
dealing with the nature (algebraic, D-finite or not) of the associated
generating function, depending on the set of allowed steps, taken in $\{-1,
0,1\}^2$.
  We first adapt Tutte's approach to prove (or reprove) the algebraicity of all
quadrant models known or conjectured to be algebraic. This includes Gessel's
famous model, and the first proof ever found for one model with weighted steps.
To be applicable, the method requires the existence of two rational functions
called invariant and decoupling function respectively. When they exist,
algebraicity follows almost automatically.
  Then, we move to a complex analytic viewpoint that has already proved very
powerful, leading in particular to integral expressions for the generating
function in the non-D-finite cases, as well as to proofs of non-D-finiteness.
We develop in this context a weaker notion of invariant. Now all quadrant
models have invariants, and for those that have in addition a decoupling
function, we obtain integral-free expressions for the generating function, and
a proof that this series is D-algebraic (that is, satisfies polynomial
differential equations).

is effective, and achieves between 13% to 20% improvement over the best
state-of-the-art scheme. We propose three defense mechanisms -- hiding,
replacement and generalization -- and evaluate their effectiveness for
mitigating the social link privacy risks stemming from mobility data sharing.
Our experimental results show that both hiding and replacement mechanisms
outperform generalization. Moreover, hiding and replacement achieve a
comparable trade-off between utility and privacy, the former preserving better
utility and the latter providing better privacy.

recombination, PMFs induce the fluid motions in a photon-baryon plasma through
the Lorentz force. Due to the viscosity in the plasma, such induced fluid
motions would be damped and this means the dissipation of PMFs. In the early
Universe with $z \gtrsim 2 \times 10^6$, cosmic microwave background (CMB)
photons are quickly thermalized with the dissipated energy and shift to a
different Planck distribution with a new temperature. In other words, the
energy injection due to the dissipation of PMFs changes the baryon-photon
number ratio during this era and we name such a process {\it magnetic
reheating}. By using the current results of the baryon-photon number ratio
obtained from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and CMB observations, we put a
strongest constraint on the amplitude of PMFs on small scales which we can not
access through CMB anisotropy and CMB distortions, $B_{0} \lesssim 1.0 \;
\mu{\rm G}$ at the scales $10^{4} \; h{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 10^{8} \; h{\rm

magnetic reheating puts a quite strong constraint in the case of the
blue-tilted spectrum, for example, $B_0 \lesssim 10^{-17} \;{\rm nG}$,
$10^{-23} \;{\rm nG}$, and $10^{-29} \;{\rm nG}$ at 1~comoving Mpc for

  In this general framework, we firstly prove that each positive and

its cluster monomials are linearly independent. Skew-symmetric cluster algebras
are verified to be d-vector-positive, which gives the affirmation of Conjecture
[conjd] in [FZ3] in this case. And since the positivity of skew-symmetric
cluster algebras is well-known, the new proof is obtained for the linearly
independence of cluster monomials of skew-symmetric cluster algebras.
  For a class of GLP algebras which are pointed, g-vectors of cluster monomials
are defined. We verify that for any positive GLP algebra pointed at $t_0$, the
g-vectors ${\bf g}_{1;t}^{t_0},\cdots, {\bf g}_{n;t}^{t_0}$ form a $\mathbb

Without invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear
dynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the
final state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for
$v_n\lbrace 2\rbrace$ and $v_n\lbrace 4\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist
unattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with
increasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)
collisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate
shape of the transverse momentum dependence. We further find that the
non-abelian features of QCD interference can give rise to odd harmonic
anisotropies. These findings indicate that the no-interaction baseline
including QCD interference effects can make a sizeable if not dominant
contribution to the measured $v_n$ coefficients in pp collisions. Prospects for
analyzing QCD interference contributions further and their possible relevance
for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions are discussed shortly.

  properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA)",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The behaviour of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere is highly
dependent on their thermal properties. Here we investigate the volatility of
SOA formed from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene upon ozone- and
OH-induced oxidation, and the effect of OH-induced ageing on the initially
produced SOA. For all three terpenes, the ozone-induced SOA was less volatile
than the OH-induced SOA. The thermal properties of the SOA were described using
three parameters extracted from the volatility measurements: the temperature at
which 50 per cent of the volume has evaporated (TVFR0.5), which is used as a
general volatility indicator; a slope factor (SVFR), which describes the
volatility distribution; and TVFR0.1, which measures the volatility of the
least volatile particle fraction. Limonene-derived SOA generally had higher
TVFR0.5 values and shallower slopes than SOA derived from alpha- and
beta-pinene. This was especially true for the ozone-induced SOA, partially
because the ozonolysis of limonene has a strong tendency to cause SOA formation
and to produce extremely low volatility VOCs (ELVOCs). Ageing by OH exposure
did not reduce TVFR0.5 for any of the studied terpenes but did increase the
breadth of the volatility distribution by increasing the aerosols heterogeneity
and contents of substances with different vapour pressures, also leading to
increases in TVFR0.1. This stands in contrast to previously reported results
from smog chamber experiments, in which TVFR0.5 always increased with ageing.
These results demonstrate that there are two opposing processes that influence
the evolution of SOAs thermal properties as they age, and that results from
both flow reactors and static chambers are needed to fully understand the
temporal evolution of atmospheric SOA thermal properties.

intense ionization by protostellar energetic MeV particles. As a result, the
surrounding gas is enriched in molecular ions, such as HCO$^{+}$ and
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly understood for
Class 0 objects. Recently, based on Herschel observations taken as part of the
key program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS), a very
low HCO$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio of about 3-4, has been reported
toward the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. This finding suggests a cosmic-ray
ionization rate in excess of 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, much higher than the
canonical value of $\zeta$ = 3$\times$10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ (value expected in
quiescent dense clouds). To assess the specificity of OMC-2 FIR4, we have
extended this study to a sample of sources in low- and intermediate mass. More
specifically, we seek to measure the HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio
from high energy lines (J $\ge$ 6) toward this source sample in order to infer
the flux of energetic particles in the warm and dense gas surrounding the
protostars. We use observations performed with the Heterodyne Instrument for
the FarInfrared spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory toward a
sample of 9 protostars. We report HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratios in
the range of 5 up to 73 toward our source sample. The large error bars do not
allow us to conclude whether OMC-2~FIR4 is a peculiar source. Nonetheless, an
important result is that the measured HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ ratio does not
vary with the source luminosity. At the present time, OMC-2 FIR4 remains the
only source where a high flux of energetic particles is clearly evident. More
sensitive and higher angular resolution observations are required to further

Second, it relies on a time-consuming iterative process, and there is no

about urgent technical challenge to power transmission network operators in

paper, an optimal framework is proposed for transmission expansion planning in
a deregulated power market environment. The level of congestion in the network
is utilized as the driving signal for the need of network expansion. A
compromise between the congestion cost and the investment cost is used to
determine the optimal expansion scheme. The long-term network expansion problem
is formed as the decoupled combination of: 1) the master problem (minimization
of investment costs subject to investment constraints and the Benders cuts
generated by the operational problem (power pool) and 2) the operational
problem, whose solution provides congestion details and associated multipliers.
A proper power-pool model is developed and solved for congestion cost,
congestion revenue, and transmission shadow prices. Also, we proposed to use a
set of metrics to rate the effect of the expansion on the generators, demands,
and the system as a whole. The proposed model is applied to the Garver six-bus

decreases. It indicates that the electron-hole compensation, if it exists, can
only occur in a narrow temperature range, and in most of the temperature range
there is an electron-hole imbalance. Our results are not consistent with the
perfect electron-hole compensation picture that is commonly considered to be
the cause of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2. We identified a flat band
near the Brillouin zone center that is close to the Fermi level and exhibits a
pronounced temperature dependence. Such a flat band can play an important role
in dictating the transport properties of WTe2. Our results provide new insight

However, we find that training a network to predict a high spatial resolution

hypothesize that achieving a compromise between spatial and depth resolutions

a regression-classification cascaded network (RCCN), which consists of a
regression branch predicting a low spatial resolution continuous depth map and
a classification branch predicting a high spatial resolution discrete depth

flexible and scalable sensing coverage with a low deployment cost, by employing
mobile users/devices to perform sensing tasks. In this work, we propose a novel
MCS framework with data reuse, where multiple tasks with common data
requirement can share (reuse) the common data with each other through an MCS
platform. We study the optimal assignment of mobile users and tasks (with data
reuse) systematically, under both information symmetry and asymmetry, depending
on whether the user cost and the task valuation are public information. In the
former case, we formulate the assignment problem as a generalized Knapsack
problem and solve the problem by using classic algorithms. In the latter case,
we propose a truthful and optimal double auction mechanism, built upon the
above Knapsack assignment problem, to elicit the private information of both
users and tasks and meanwhile achieve the same optimal assignment as under
information symmetry. Simulation results show by allowing data reuse among
tasks, the social welfare can be increased up to 100~380%, comparing with those
without data reuse. We further show that the proposed double auction is not
budget balance for the auctioneer, mainly due to the data reuse among tasks. To
this end, we further introduce a reserve price into the double auction (for
each data item) to achieve a desired tradeoff between the budget balance and
the social efficiency.

coalescing binary NS systems. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors may be
sensitive to this effect, and thus could potentially further constrain
scalar-tensor theories. This type of analysis requires waveform models of
dynamically scalarizing systems; in this work we devise an analytic model of
dynamical scalarization using an effective action approach. For the first time,
we compute the Newtonian-order Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of a
dynamically scalarizing binary in a self-consistent manner. Despite only
working to leading order, the model accurately predicts the frequency at which
dynamical scalarization occurs. In conjunction with Landau theory, our model
allows one to definitively establish dynamical scalarization as a second-order
phase transition. We also connect dynamical scalarization to the related
phenomena of spontaneous scalarization and induced scalarization; these
phenomena are naturally encompassed into our effective action approach.

show that if $f(X)$ has degree $n\geq 2$ and no multiple roots, then an
inequality such as (*) holds for all $d>1/n$, provided we do not require

Gross and Vincent, as well as the other results mentioned above, are
generalized to values of binary forms and decomposable forms at integral

homomorphism ${\mathbf R}\to {\bf \Gamma}$ between two relational structures,

over a domain $D$. In a fixed template CSP, denoted $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$, the
right side structure ${\bf \Gamma}$ is fixed and the left side structure
${\mathbf R}$ is unconstrained.
  We consider the following problem: given a prespecified finite set of
algebras ${\mathcal B}$ whose domain is $D$, is it possible to present the
solutions set of a given instance of $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$ (which is an input to
the problem) as a subalgebra of ${\mathbb A}_1\times ... \times {\mathbb

  We study this problem and show that it can be reformulated as an instance of
a certain fixed-template CSP, over another template ${\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal

Under natural assumptions on ${\mathcal B}$, we prove that $CSP({\bf

  We also study the conditions under which $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$ can be reduced

the relationship between $Pol({\bf \Gamma})$ and $Pol({\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal

has a local approach and is able to run on large networks. It has a simple and
effective method; given a network, algorithm constructs a preference network of
nodes where each node has a single outgoing edge showing its preferred node to
be in the same community with. In such a preference network, each connected
component is a community. Selection of the preferred node is performed using
similarity based metrics of nodes. We use two alternatives for this purpose
which can be calculated in 1-neighborhood of nodes, i.e. number of common
neighbors of selector node and its neighbors and, the spread capability of
neighbors around the selector node which is calculated by the gossip algorithm
of Lind et.al. Our algorithm is tested on both computer generated LFR networks
and real-life networks with ground-truth community structure. It can identify

achieves comparable throughput to AllGather -- a non-fault-tolerant distributed

Our approach can also be applied to more general Hamiltonians that are not

power grows for the optimal receiver. Furthermore, we devise a heuristic

often susceptible to evasion attacks, in which an adversary makes changes to
the input (such as malware) in order to avoid being detected. A conventional
approach to evaluate ML robustness to such attacks, as well as to design robust
ML, is by considering simplified feature-space models of attacks, where the
attacker changes ML features directly to effect evasion, while minimizing or
constraining the magnitude of this change. We investigate the effectiveness of
this approach to designing robust ML in the face of attacks that can be
realized in actual malware (realizable attacks). We demonstrate that in the
context of structure-based PDF malware detection, such techniques appear to
have limited effectiveness, but they are effective with content-based

with conserved features (those that cannot be unilaterally modified without
compromising malicious functionality) significantly improves performance.
Finally, we show that feature space models enable generalized robustness when

are tuned to be robust to a specific realizable attack.

that the choice of penalty parameters is pivotal. The estimator is based on
applying a self-normalization to the constraints that characterize the
estimator. Importantly, we show how to cast the computation of the estimator as
the solution of a convex program with second order cone constraints. This
allows the use of algorithms with theoretical guarantees and reliable
implementation. Under sparsity assumptions, we derive $\ell_q$-rates of
convergence and show that consistency can be achieved even if the number of
regressors exceeds the sample size. We further provide a simple to implement
rule to threshold the estimator that yields a provably sparse estimator with
similar $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-rates of convergence. The thresholds are
data-driven and component dependents. Finally, we also study the rates of
convergence of estimators that refit the data based on a selected support with
possible model selection mistakes. In addition to our finite sample theoretical
results that allow for non-i.i.d. data, we also present simulations to compare

corruption to keep stealth against the bad data detection. However, a more

paper, we generalize the data attacks that they can be pure FDI attacks or
combined with availability attacks (e.g., DoS attacks) and analyze the attacks
with limited adversarial knowledge or limited attack resources. The attack
impact is evaluated by the proposed metrics and the detection probability of
attacks is calculated using the distribution property of data with or without

develop a dynamic programming algorithm that can efficiently approximate the

an empirical Bayes approach for estimating class priors and show that our

oversampled region) upscaling framework based on some recently developed
multiscale methods [10]. Our proposed method consists of identifying
multi-continua parameters via local basis functions and constructing non-local
(in the oversampled region) transfer and effective properties. To achieve this,
we significantly modify our recent work proposed within Generalized Multiscale
Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) in [10] and derive appropriate local problems in
oversampled regions once we identify important modes representing each
continua. We use piecewise constant functions in each fracture network and in
the matrix to write an upscaled equation. Thus, the resulting upscaled equation
is of minimal size and the unknowns are average pressures in the fractures and
the matrix. We note that the use of non-local upscaled model for porous media
flows is not new, e.g., in [14], the authors derive non-local approach. Our
main contribution is identifying appropriate local problems together with local
spectral modes to represent each continua. The model problem for fractures
assumes that one can identify fracture networks. The resulting non-local
equation (restricted to the oversampling region, which is several times larger
compared to the target coarse block) has the same form as \cite{Hamdi_Nonlocal}
with much smaller local regions. We present numerical results, which show that
the proposed approach can provide good accuracy.

evolution of global variables such as the ocean temperature or the surface air
temperature. This spurious trend reduces the fidelity to initial conditions and
has a great influence on the equilibrium climate after long simulation times.
Useful insight on the nature of the climate drift can be obtained using two
global metrics, i.e. the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and at
the ocean surface. The former is an indicator of the limitations within a given
climate model, at the level of both numerical implementation and physical
parameterisations, while the latter is an indicator of the goodness of the
tuning procedure. Using the MIT general circulation model, we construct
different configurations with various degree of complexity (i.e. different
parameterisations for the bulk cloud albedo, inclusion or not of friction
heating, different bathymetry configurations) to which we apply the same tuning
procedure in order to obtain control runs for fixed external forcing where the
climate drift is minimised. We find that the interplay between tuning procedure
and different configurations of the same climate model provides crucial
information on the stability of the control runs and on the goodness of a given
parameterisation. This approach is particularly relevant for constructing
good-quality control runs of the geological past where huge uncertainties are
found in both initial and boundary conditions. We will focus on robust results
that can be generally applied to other climate models.

Using a two-dimensional Dirac equation, the effect of a random sign of the
Dirac mass is studied numerically. The edge state at the sample boundary has a
strong influence on the electromagnetic field and its polarization inside the
sample. The creation of edge states through a randomly fluctuating sign of the
Dirac mass defeats Anderson localization and allows the electromagnetic field
to distribute over the entire sample. The width of the distribution increases
with an increasing gap due to increasing sharpness of the edge states. These
results are compared with those of a random one-band Helmholtz equation. In
contrast to the Dirac model, the one-band model displays a clear signature of
Anderson localization.

propose that recommender-system researchers should instead calculate metrics

two-neutron and two-proton separation energies with r.m.s. errors of 0.69 MeV

consider a Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) inspired

intracellular, extracellular, and cerebrospinal fluid. The model, called

in all respects and inherent adaptivity to local microstructure, while sensibly
reducing the computational cost. We also investigated NODDI-SH performance when

through an ion-channel yields a characteristic signal that is attributable to
the 2-segment structure of the molecule. We also examine the dependence of the
translocation rate and speed on the adjustable parameters of the experiment.

falling of apple on earth. Maxwell's electromagnetic revolution unifies
electricity, magnetism, and light. Einstein's relativity revolution unifies
space with time, and gravity with space-time distortion. The quantum revolution
unifies particle with waves, and energy with frequency. Each of those
revolution changes our world view. In this article, we will describe a
revolution that is happening now: the second quantum revolution which unifies
matter/space with information. In other words, the new world view suggests that
elementary particles (the bosonic force particles and fermionic matter
particles) all originated from quantum information (qubits): they are
collective excitations of an entangled qubit ocean that corresponds to our
space. The beautiful geometric Yang-Mills gauge theory and the strange Fermi
statistics of matter particles now have a common algebraic quantum
informational origin.

the 9th century, the kamal. After an introduction to historic seafaring and
navigation, they build this simple tool and understand how it can be used to
measure angles. After learning that the elevation of Polaris is (almost)
identical to the latitude of the observer, they apply this knowledge while
using the kamal. During a field trip, they actually measure the elevation of
Polaris. The result is compared with modern methods.

  Results",,,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of Shannon entropy estimation in countable infinite alphabets is
addressed from the study and use of convergence results of the entropy
functional, which is known to be discontinuous with respect to the total
variation distance in $\infty$-alphabets. Sufficient conditions for the
convergence of the entropy are used, including scenarios with both finitely and
infinitely supported assumptions on the distributions. From this new
perspective, four plug-in histogram-based estimators are studied showing that
convergence results are instrumental to derive new strong consistency and rate
of convergences results. Different scenarios and conditions are used on both
the estimators and the underlying distribution, considering for example finite
and unknown supported assumptions and summable tail bounded conditions.
