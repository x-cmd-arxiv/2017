reconstruction from interferometric data. A simple model of the interferometric
observables is given and the issues arising from sparse Fourier data are
discussed. The effects of various regularizations are described. In the
proposed general framework, most existing algorithms can be understood. For an
astronomer, such an understanding is crucial not only for selecting and using
an algorithm but also to ensure correct interpretation of the resulting image.

central regions of galaxies. Nuclear star clusters are present mainly in faint
galaxies while upermassive black holes are common in galaxies with masses $\geq
10^{10}$ M$_\odot $. In the intermediate galactic mass range both types of
central massive objects (CMOs) are found. Here we present our collection of a
huge set of nuclear star cluster and massive black hole data that enlarges
significantly already existing data bases useful to investigate for
correlations of their absolute magnitudes, velocity dispersions and masses with
structural parameters of their host galaxies. In particular, we directed our
attention to some differences between the correlations of nuclear star clusters
and massive black holes as subsets of CMOs with hosting galaxies. In this
context, the mass-velocity dispersion relation plays a relevant role because it
seems the one that shows a clearer difference between the supermassive black
holes and nuclear star clusters. The $M_{MBH}-{\sigma}$ has a slope of $5.19\pm
0.28$ while $M_{NSC}-{\sigma}$ has the much smaller slope of $1.84\pm 0.64$.
The slopes of the CMO mass- host galaxy B magnitude of the two types of CMOs
are indistinguishable within the errors while that of the NSC mass-host galaxy
mass relation is significantly smaller than for supermassive black holes.
Another important result is the clear depauperation of the NSC population in
bright galaxy hosts, which reflects also in a clear flattening of the NSC mass
vs host galaxy mass at high host masses.

this subject. In fact in this case Hamiltonians contain not only Hermitian
masses $m_1$, but also contribution from anti-Hermitian components of fermion
masses $m_2$. Main misunderstanding a number of papers is consist in using of
this model for any values of fermion masses for fixed values of $m_1$ and
$m_2$. However the basis appearing of two parameters masses may be undertaken a
simple estimation for determination maximal permissible value of fermion mass
$M={m_1}^2/2m_2$ which may be used for this model. Easy to see that $M$ becomes
infinite and hence experimentally does not observable only in Dirac's limit,
when the non-Hermitian mass fully is disappearing. In particular the equality
$m_1=m_2$ can be realized only in two cases when $m_1=m_2=0$ and $m_1=m_2=2M$.
Moreover in the second case the question is about the possibility existence a
number of new fermions masses which are equal to the masses of particles

this case the paradox of the ""two masses"" takes place and its solution may be
done only in suggested model with a maximal mass. Appearing particles can be
considered as some new particles arising beyond SM. The unusual properties of

density-dependent pressure and cell multiplication, with a free boundary model
as its singular limit when the pressure-density relationship becomes highly
nonlinear. In particular, the constitutive law connecting pressure $p$ and
density $\rho$ is $p(\rho)=\frac{m}{m-1} \rho^{m-1}$, and when $m \gg 1$, the
cell density $\rho$ may evolve its support due to a pressure-driven geometric
motion with sharp interface along the boundary of its support. The nonlinearity
and degeneracy in the diffusion bring great challenges in numerical
simulations, let alone the capturing of the singular free boundary limit. Prior
to the present paper, there is lack of standard mechanism to numerically
capture the front propagation speed as $m\gg 1$. In this paper, we develope a
numerical scheme based on a novel prediction-correction reformulation that can
accurately approximate the front propagation even when the nonlinearity is
extremely strong. We show that the semi-discrete scheme naturally connects to
the free boundary limit equation as $m \rightarrow \infty$, and with proper
spacial discretization, the fully discrete scheme has improved stability,
preserves positivity, and implements without nonlinear solvers. Finally,
extensive numerical examples in both one and two dimensions are provided to

reference system presented as a two-component hard-sphere fluid confined in a

primitive model (PM) we derive an explicit expression for the relevant chemical
potential of a confined ionic system which takes into account the third-order

size-asymmetric PM are calculated for different matrix porosities as well as
for different sizes of matrix and fluid particles. It is observed that general
trends of the coexistence curves with the matrix porosity are similar to those
of simple fluids under disordered confinement, i.e., the coexistence region
gets narrower with a decrease of porosity, and simultaneously the reduced
critical temperature $T_{c}^{*}$ and the critical density $\rho_{i,c}^{*}$
become lower. At the same time, our results suggest that an increase in size
asymmetry of oppositely charged ions considerably affects the vapor-liquid
diagrams leading to a faster decrease of $T_{c}^{*}$ and $\rho_{i,c}^{*}$ and
even to a disappearance of the phase transition, especially for the case of
small matrix particles.

in-vehicle network --- have recently been proposed. However, they fail to
identify which Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack.
Clearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic,
isolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme,
called Viden (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the
attacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The
first phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the
measured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter.
Viden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the
transmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the
voltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since Viden adapts its profiles
to changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU
under various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with
modern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily
deployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype
and two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs
based solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a
low false identification rate of 0.2%.

Helmholtz equation posed in the exterior of a bounded obstacle with Dirichlet
boundary conditions when the obstacle is trapping. There are two resolvent
estimates for this situation currently in the literature: (i) in the case of
elliptic trapping the general ""worst case"" bound of exponential growth applies,
and examples show that this growth can be realised through some sequence of
wavenumbers, (ii) in the prototypical case of hyperbolic trapping where the
Helmholtz equation is posed in the exterior of two strictly convex obstacles
(or several obstacles with additional constraints) the nontrapping resolvent
estimate holds with a logarithmic loss.
  This paper proves the first resolvent estimate for parabolic trapping by
obstacles, studying a class of obstacles the prototypical example of which is
the exterior of two squares (in 2-d), or two cubes (in 3-d), whose sides are
parallel. We show, via developments of the vector-field/multiplier argument of
Morawetz and the first application of this methodology to trapping
configurations, that a resolvent estimate holds with a polynomial loss over the
nontrapping estimate. We use this bound, along with the other trapping
resolvent estimates, to prove results about integral-equation formulations of
the boundary value problem in the case of trapping. Feeding these bounds into
existing frameworks for analysing finite and boundary element methods, we
obtain the first wavenumber-explicit proofs of convergence for numerical
methods for solving the Helmholtz equation in the exterior of a trapping
obstacle.

approach is distributable across multiple agents, so that each agent can
independently compute its own control while sharing statistics of its coverage

simplicial complexes can be used to model higher-order interactions between
three or more objects in complex systems. There has been a recent surge in
activity for the development of data analysis methods applicable to simplicial
complexes, including techniques based on computational topology, higher-order
random processes, generalized Cheeger inequalities, isoperimetric inequalities,
and spectral methods. In particular, spectral learning methods (e.g. label

represent a new direction for analyzing such complex datasets.
  To apply spectral learning methods to massive datasets modeled as simplicial
complexes, we develop a method for sparsifying simplicial complexes that
preserves the spectrum of the associated Laplacian matrices. We show that the
theory of Spielman and Srivastava for the sparsification of graphs extends to
simplicial complexes via the up Laplacian. In particular, we introduce a
generalized effective resistance for simplices, provide an algorithm for
sparsifying simplicial complexes at a fixed dimension, and give a specific
version of the generalized Cheeger inequality for weighted simplicial
complexes. Finally, we introduce higher-order generalizations of spectral
clustering and label propagation for simplicial complexes and demonstrate via
experiments the utility of the proposed spectral sparsification method for
these applications.

algorithm is a family of geometrical arrangements which correspond to the
complete set of solutions to the array optimisation problem, and differ from
each other according to the relative weight given to each of the (maybe
conflicting) objetives of the optimisation. Since the algorithm works with
parallel optimisation it admits as many cost functions as desired, and can
incorporate constraints such as budget (cost cap) for the array and topological
limitations of the terrain, like geographical accidents where telescopes cannot
be installed. It also admits different types of telescopes (hybrid arrays) and
the number of telescopes of each type can be treated as a parameter to be
optimised - constrained, for example, by the cost of each type or the energy
range of interest. The purpose of the algorithm, which converges fast to
optimised solutions (if compared to the time for a complete Monte Carlo
Simulation of a single configuration), is to provide a tool to investigate the
full parameter space of possible geometries, and help in designing complex
arrays. It does not substitute a detailed Monte Carlo study, but aims to guide
it. In the examples of arrays shown here we have used as metrics simple
heuristic expressions describing the fundamentals of the IAC technique, but

phase for large systems with finite magnetization per spin.

clustering bias exists if halos are binned by mass or by any other halo
property. This secondary bias implies that no single halo property encompasses
all the spatial clustering information of the halo population. The mean values
of some halo properties depend on their halo's distance to a more massive
neighbor. Halo samples selected by having high values of one of these
properties therefore inherit a neighbor bias such that they are much more
likely to be close to a much more massive neighbor. This neighbor bias largely
accounts for the secondary bias seen in halos binned by mass and split by
concentration or age. However, halos binned by other mass-like properties still
show a secondary bias even when the neighbor bias is removed. The secondary
bias of halos selected by their spin behaves differently than that for other

accurately model a number of astrophysical systems involving black holes and

accretion disks, while neutrino transport is critical to core-collapse
supernovae and to the modeling of electromagnetic transients and
nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, evolving the full Boltzmann
equations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the
implementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation
hydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's
equation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based
on a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum
density of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in
missing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the
radiation. Instead of the approximate analytical closure currently used in
core-collapse and merger simulations, we complement the two-moment scheme with
a low-accuracy Monte-Carlo evolution. The Monte-Carlo results can provide any

possible origins for the initial misclassification of these objects, including
poor characterization of the host star, the difficulty in detecting a secondary
eclipse in systems on an eccentric orbit, and the difficulty in distinguishing
between the smallest stars and gas giant planets as the two populations have
indistinguishable radius distributions. Our work emphasizes the need for
obtaining medium-precision radial velocity measurements to distinguish between
companions that are small stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets.

transverse measurement (e.g., transverse energy or min $p_T$ for jet veto) is
parametrically larger relative to the typical transverse momentum beyond the

factorized in terms of collinear and soft degrees of freedom. The virtuality
for these degrees of freedom is set by the transverse measurement, as in
typical transverse-momentum dependent observables such as Drell-Yan, Higgs

next generation of space-based surveys demands exquisite reconstruction of the
point-spread function (PSF). However, unresolved binary stars can significantly
distort the PSF shape. In an effort to mitigate this bias, we aim at detecting
unresolved binaries in realistic Euclid stellar populations. We tested methods
in numerical experiments where (i) the PSF shape is known to Euclid
requirements across the field of view, and (ii) the PSF shape is unknown. We
drew simulated catalogues of PSF shapes for this proof-of-concept paper.
Following the Euclid survey plan, the objects were observed four times. We
propose three methods to detect unresolved binary stars. The detection is based
on the systematic and correlated biases between exposures of the same object.
One method is a simple correlation analysis, while the two others use
supervised machine-learning algorithms (random forest and artificial neural
network). In both experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our methods to
detect unresolved binary stars in simulated catalogues. The performance depends
on the level of prior knowledge of the PSF shape and the shape measurement
errors. Good detection performances are observed in both experiments. Full
complexity, in terms of the images and the survey design, is not included, but
key aspects of a more mature pipeline are discussed. Finding unresolved
binaries in objects used for PSF reconstruction increases the quality of the
PSF determination at arbitrary positions. We show, using different approaches,
that we are able to detect at least binary stars that are most damaging for the

be at most three canonical boundary charges on an equal-time slice, we consider
all Fourier modes of these charges with respect to the Euclidean boundary time
and study their associated algebras. Besides the (centerless)
$\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ current algebra we find for stricter boundary conditions a
Virasoro algebra, a warped conformal algebra and a $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ current
algebra. In each of these cases we get one half of a corresponding symmetry
algebra in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological
constant and analogous boundary conditions. However, on-shell some of these
algebras reduce to finite-dimensional ones, reminiscent of the on-shell
breaking of conformal invariance in SYK. We conclude with a discussion of
thermodynamical aspects, in particular the entropy and some Cardyology.

model like limits: N_2 >> N_1 and N_1 >> N_2 which correspond to the
semi-classical N=5 Vasiliev theories with O(N_1) and USp(2N_2) internal

AdS/CFT correspondence comprise the ABJ quadrality among the N=5 ABJ theory,

The model combines Newtonian viscosity with hyperelasticity of Mooney-Rivlin
type; it is a special case of the viscoplasticty model proposed by Simo and
Miehe (1992). A simple, efficient and robust implicit time stepping procedure
is suggested. Lagrangian and Eulerian versions of the algorithm are available,
with equivalent properties. The numerical scheme is iteration free,
unconditionally stable and first order accurate. It exactly preserves the
inelastic incompressibility, symmetry, positive definiteness of the internal
variables, and w-invariance. The accuracy of the stress computations is tested
using a series of numerical simulations involving a non-proportional loading
and large strain increments. In terms of accuracy, the proposed algorithm is
equivalent to the modified Euler backward method with exact inelastic
incompressibility; the proposed method is also equivalent to the classical
integration method based on exponential mapping. Since the new method is
iteration free, it is more robust and computationally efficient. The algorithm
is implemented into MSC.MARC and a series of initial boundary value problems is
solved in order to demonstrate the usability of the numerical procedures.

limit of pure dephasing noise we find a threshold of 43.7(1)% using a tensor

surprisingly large in the regime of realistic noise bias ratios, for example
28.2(2)% at a bias of 10. The performance is in fact at or near the hashing

weight-4 stabilizers on a square lattice, but merely requires measuring
products of Y instead of Z around the faces, as this doubles the number of
useful syndrome bits associated with the dominant Z errors. Our results
demonstrate that large efficiency gains can be found by appropriately tailoring

feature extraction, data generation and network pre-training. DAEs consist of
an encoder and decoder which may be trained simultaneously to minimise a loss
(function) between an input and the reconstruction of a corrupted version of
the input. There are two common loss functions used for training autoencoders,
these include the mean-squared error (MSE) and the binary cross-entropy (BCE).
When training autoencoders on image data a natural choice of loss function is
BCE, since pixel values may be normalised to take values in [0,1] and the
decoder model may be designed to generate samples that take values in (0,1). We
show theoretically that DAEs trained to minimise BCE may be used to take
gradient steps in the data space towards regions of high probability under the
data-generating distribution. Previously this had only been shown for DAEs
trained using MSE. As a consequence of the theory, iterative application of a
trained DAE moves a data sample from regions of low probability to regions of
higher probability under the data-generating distribution. Firstly, we validate
the theory by showing that novel data samples, consistent with the training
data, may be synthesised when the initial data samples are random noise.
Secondly, we motivate the theory by showing that initial data samples
synthesised via other methods may be improved via iterative application of a
trained DAE to those initial samples.

and intensive accretion onto the star has began due to the rearrangement of its

Aur B. More precisely, we assume that the increase of accretion is a response
to changing conditions in the outer disk regions, which followed after the
sound wave, generated by these changes, crossed the disk in a radial direction.
The difference in the parameters of the blue and red lobes of the RW Aur A jet,
according to our opinion, is a result of the asymmetric distribution of the
circumstellar matter above and below the disk, due to a fly-by of the
companion. It was found from the analysis of RW Aur historical light curve that
deep and long $(\Delta t>150$ days) dimmings of RW Aur A observed after 2010

very much studied in Mathematics and in Computer Science. In 2016 Carnielli and
Coniglio introduced a class of multialgebras called swap structures, as a
semantic framework for dealing with several logics of formal inconsistency (or
LFIs) which cannot be semantically characterized by a single finite matrix. In
particular, these LFIs are not algebraizable by the standard tools of abstract
algebraic logic. In this paper, the first steps towards a theory of
non-deterministic algebraization of logics by swap structures are given.
Specifically, a formal study of swap structures for LFIs is developed, by
adapting concepts of universal algebra to multialgebras in a suitable way. A
decomposition theorem similar to Birkhoff's representation theorem is obtained
for each class of swap structures. Moreover, when applied to the 3-valued
algebraizable logic J3 the usual class of algebraic models is recovered, and
the swap structures semantics became twist-structures semantics (as introduced
by Fidel-Vakarelov). This fact, together with the existence of a functor from
the category of Boolean algebras to the category of swap structures for each
LFI, which is closely connected with Kalman's functor, suggests that swap
structures can be considered as non-deterministic twist structures, opening so
interesting possibilities for dealing with non-algebraizable logics by means of
multialgebraic semantics.

high lift can be attained by the Gurney flap on airfoils at high angles of

Analysis of the wake structures along with the lift spectra reveals four
characteristic wake modes (steady, 2S, P and 2P), influencing the aerodynamic
performance. The effects of the flap over wide range of angles of attack and
flap heights are considered to identify the occurrence of these wake modes, and
are encapsulated in a wake classification diagram. Companion three-dimensional

on the wake regimes. The spanwise instabilities that appear for higher angles

process components of psychobiological stress responses. Particularly the
change of cortisol secretion due to stress exposure has been discussed as an
endophenotype of many psychosomatic health outcomes. To assess its process
components, a large variety of non-compartmental parameters (i.e., composite
measures of substance concentrations at different points in time) like the area
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) are utilized. However, a systematic
evaluation and validation of these parameters based on a physiologically
plausible model of cortisol secretion has not been performed so far. Thus, a
population pharmacokinetic (mixed-effects SDE) model was developed and fitted
to densely sampled salivary cortisol data of 10 males from Montreal, Canada,
and sparsely sampled data of 200 mixed-sex participants from Dresden, Germany,
who completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Besides the two major
process components representing (1) stress-related cortisol secretion
(reactivity) and (2) cortisol elimination (recovery), the model incorporates
two additional, often disregarded components: (3) the secretory delay after
stress onset, and (4) deviations from the projected steady-state concentration.
The fitted model (R2 = 99%) was thereafter used to investigate the correlation
structure of the four individually varying, and readily interpretable model
parameters and eleven popular non-compartmental parameters. Based on these
analyses, we recommend to use the minimum-maximum cortisol difference and the
minimum concentration as proxy measures of reactivity and recovery,
respectively. Finally, statistical power analyses of the reactivity-related sex
effect illustrate the consequences of using impure non-compartmental measures
of the different process components that underlie the cortisol stress response.

result, when accurate AAM fitting is required on a different set of variations

overcome the need for time consuming data collection and annotation, transfer
learning approaches have received recent attention. The goal is to transfer
knowledge from previously available datasets (source) to a new dataset

subspace from the source that best describes the target space. We propose a
metric to compute the directional similarity between the source eigenvectors

variance of target data when projected onto source eigenvectors. Using this
equivalence, we select a subset of source principal directions that capture the
variance in target data. To define our model, we augment the selected source
subspace with the target subspace learned from a handful of target examples. In
experiments done on six publicly available datasets, we show that our approach
outperforms the state of the art in terms of the RMS fitting error as well as

problem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving
websites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the
number of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and
the cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to
the functionality. We then apply this methodology to 74 Web API standards
implemented in modern browsers. We find that allowing websites default access
to large parts of the Web API poses significant security and privacy risks,
with little corresponding benefit.
  We also introduce a configurable browser extension that allows users to
selectively restrict access to low-benefit, high-risk features on a per site
basis. We evaluated our extension with two hardened browser configurations, and
found that blocking 15 of the 74 standards avoids 52.0% of code paths related
to previous CVEs, and 50.0% of implementation code identified by our metric,
without affecting the functionality of 94.7% of measured websites.

take advantage of deep learning in handling wireless OFDM channels in an

CSI explicitly and then detect/recover the transmitted symbols with the
estimated CSI, our deep learning based approach estimates CSI implicitly and
recovers the transmitted symbols directly. To address channel distortion, a
deep learning model is first trained offline using the data generated from the
simulation based on the channel statistics and then used for recovering the
online transmitted data directly. From our simulation results, the deep
learning based approach has the ability to address channel distortions and
detect the transmitted symbols with performance comparable to minimum

approach is more robust than conventional methods when fewer training pilots
are used, the cyclic prefix (CP) is omitted, and nonlinear clipping noise is
presented. In summary, deep learning is a promising tool for channel estimation

in our society. When social influence takes place in experiments on a
population of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect
the outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis
develops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where
interference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference).
In this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and
flexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of
primary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are
estimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on
the unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights
the importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential
outcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced
covariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the
causal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model
mis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in
real-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and
confounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based
imputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate
this principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes
during the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying
network topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis
asserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an
opportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world
experiments.

conjecture that spontaneous current singularities lead to nanoflares that heat
the corona has been controversial. In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), can
genuine current singularities emerge from a smooth 3D line-tied magnetic field?
To numerically resolve this issue, the schemes employed must preserve magnetic
topology exactly to avoid artificial reconnection in the presence of singular
current densities. Structure-preserving numerical methods are favorable for
mitigating numerical dissipation, and variational integration is a powerful
machinery for deriving them. In this thesis, we develop variational integrators
for ideal MHD in Lagrangian labeling by discretizing Newcomb's Lagrangian on a
moving mesh using discretized exterior calculus. With the built-in frozen-in
equation, the schemes are free of artificial reconnection, hence optimal for
studying current singularity formation.
  Using this method, we first study a fundamental prototype problem in 2D, the
Hahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem. It considers the effect of boundary
perturbations on a 2D plasma magnetized by a sheared field, and its linear
solution is singular. We find that with increasing resolution, the nonlinear
solution converges to one with a current singularity. We then extend the HKT
problem to 3D line-tied geometry, which models the solar corona by anchoring
the field lines in the boundaries. The linear solution, which is singular in
2D, is found to be smooth. The nonlinear solution turns out smooth for short
systems. Nonetheless, the scaling of peak current density vs. system length
suggests that the nonlinear solution may become singular at a finite length.
With the results in hand, we cannot confirm or rule out this possibility
conclusively, since we cannot obtain solutions with system lengths near the
extrapolated critical value.

modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to
form images of the absorbed optical energy density within tissue. If the object
possesses spatially variant acoustic properties that are unaccounted for by the
reconstruction method, the estimated image can contain distortions. While
reconstruction methods have recently been developed to compensate for this
effect, they generally require the object's acoustic properties to be known a
priori. To circumvent the need for detailed information regarding an object's
acoustic properties, we previously proposed a half-time reconstruction method
for PACT. A half-time reconstruction method estimates the PACT image from a
data set that has been temporally truncated to exclude the data components that
have been strongly aberrated. However, this method can be improved upon when
the approximate sizes and locations of isolated heterogeneous structures, such
as bones or gas pockets, are known. To address this, we investigate PACT
reconstruction methods that are based on a variable data truncation (VDT)
approach. The VDT approach represents a generalization of the half-time
approach, in which the degree of temporal truncation for each measurement is
determined by the distance between the corresponding ultrasonic transducer
location and the nearest known bone or gas void location. Computer-simulated
and experimental data are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in mitigating artifacts due to acoustic heterogeneities.

NRPPs can be used to diagnose all regression models with scalar response using

the randomized quantile residuals (RQR), which are previously proposed by Dunn

between the present day value $w_0$ to an early time $w_i=w_a+w_0\equiv
w(z\gg0)$ with a steepness given in terms of $q$ parameter. The proposed
parametrization is $w=w_0+w_a(z/z_T)^q/(1+(z/z_T))^q$, with $w_0$, $w_i$, $q $
and $z_T$ constant parameters. It reduces to the widely used EoS
$w=w_0+w_a(1-a)$ for $z_T=q=1$. This transition is motivated by scalar field
dynamics such as for example quintessence models. We study if a late time
transition is favored by BAO measurements combined with local determination of
$H_0$ and information from the CMB. According to our results, an EoS with a
present value of $w_0 = -0.92$ and a high redshift value $w_i =-0.99$,
featuring a transition at $z_T = 0.28$ with an exponent $q = 9.97$ was favored
by data coming from local dynamics of the Universe (BAO combined with $H_0$
determination). We find that a dynamical DE model allows to simultaneously fit
$H_0$ from local determinations and Planck CMB measurements, alleviating the
tension obtained in a $\Lambda$CDM model.
  Additionally to this analysis we solved numerically the evolution of matter
over-densities in the presence of dark energy both at background level and when
its perturbations were considered. We show that the presence of a steep
transition in the DE EoS gets imprinted into the evolution of matter
overdensities and that the addition of an effective sound speed term does not
erase such feature.

machine learning to predict the properties of the band gap for a large number
of kesterite I$_2$-II-IV-V$_4$ semiconductors. In determining the magnitude of
the fundamental gap, we compare results for a number of machine-learning

This error is well within the uncertainty of even the most advanced
first-principles methods for calculating semiconductor band gaps. Predicting
the direct--indirect property of the band gap is more challenging. After
significant feature engineering, we are able to train a classifier that
predicts the nature of the band gap with an accuracy of 89 \% using logistic
regression. Using these trained models, the band gap properties of 1568
kesterite I$_2$-II-IV-V$_4$ compounds are predicted. We find 717 compounds with
band gaps in the range 0.5 -- 2.5 eV that can potentially act as solar
absorbers, and 242 materials with a band gap in the ``\emph{optimum range}"" of
1.2 -- 1.8 eV. The stability of these 242 compounds is assessed by calculating
the Energy Above Hull using the Materials Project database, and the band gaps
are verified using hybrid functional calculations; in the end, we identify 25
compounds that are expected to be synthesizable, and have a band gap in the
range 1.2 -- 1.8 eV -- most of which are previously unexplored. These results
will be useful in the materials engineering of efficient photovoltaic devices.

S0, and S galaxies are adequately described by either a NFW or a cored King
model, both for the Reg and Irr samples, with a slight preference for the NFW
model. The spatial distribution concentration increases from the S to the S0
and to the E populations, both in the Reg and the Irr stacks, reflecting the
well-known morphology-radius relation. Reg clusters have a more concentrated
spatial distribution of E and S0 galaxies than Irr clusters, while the spatial
distributions of S galaxies in Reg and Irr clusters are similar. We propose a
new phenomenological model that provides acceptable fits to the VDP of all our
galaxy samples. The VDPs become steeper and with a higher normalization from E
to S0 to S galaxies. The S0 VDP is close to that of E galaxies in Reg clusters,
and intermediate between those of E and S galaxies in Irr clusters. Our results
suggest that S galaxies are a recently accreted cluster population, that take
less than 3 Gyr to evolve into S0 galaxies after accretion, and in doing so
modify their phase-space distribution, approaching that of cluster ellipticals.
While in Reg clusters this evolutionary process is mostly completed, it is
still ongoing in Irr clusters.

average in the teleportation of such an alphabet of states? Here, we consider a
variation of this question, where Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is used as a
resource rather than plain entanglement. We provide a solution by means of an
optimisation within the space of Gaussian quantum channels, which allows for an
intuitive visualisation of the problem. We first show that not all channels are

schemes relying on asymmetric two-mode Gaussian states enable one to reach the
maximal fidelity at the border with the inaccessible region. Our results
provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of steering as a resource for secure
quantum teleportation beyond the so-called no-cloning threshold. The schemes we
propose can be readily implemented experimentally by a conventional
Braunstein-Kimble continuous variable teleportation protocol involving homodyne
detections and corrective displacements with an optimally tuned gain. These
protocols can be integrated as elementary building blocks in quantum networks,
for reliable storage and transmission of quantum optical states.

This requires accurate and efficient means to evaluate the infrastructure
system reliability. While numerous research efforts have addressed and
quantified the impact of natural disasters on infrastructure systems, typically
using the Monte Carlo approach, they still suffer from high computational cost
and, thus, are of limited applicability to large systems. This paper presents a
deep learning framework for accelerating infrastructure system reliability

constructed and studied: (1) A classifier surrogate which speeds up the
connectivity determination of networks, and (2) An end-to-end surrogate that
replaces a number of components such as roadway status realization,
connectivity determination, and connectivity averaging. The proposed approach
is applied to a simulation-based study of the two-terminal connectivity of a

cooler gas out to a radius of 10 kpc. The cavities are surrounded by cool
bright rims and filaments that may have been lifted from smaller radii by the
buoyant bubbles. X-ray imaging suggests a potential ghost bubble of $\gtrsim$
5\,kpc diameter to the northwest. We find that the amount of gas lifted by AGN

AGN driven outflow is effective in offsetting cooling in low-mass clusters. The
cluster cooling time scale is $>30$ times longer than the dynamical time scale,
which is consistent with the lack of cold molecular gas at the cluster center.

low-permeability rock. For this reason, accurately predicting flow and
transport in fractured systems is vital for improving the performance of
subsurface applications. Fracture sizes in these systems can range from
millimeters to kilometers. Although, modeling flow and transport using the
discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is known to be more accurate due to
incorporation of the detailed fracture network structure over continuum-based
methods, capturing the flow and transport in such a wide range of scales is
still computationally intractable. Furthermore, if one has to quantify
uncertainty, hundreds of realizations of these DFN models have to be run. To
reduce the computational burden, we solve flow and transport on a graph
representation of a DFN. We study the accuracy of the graph approach by
comparing breakthrough times and tracer particle statistical data between the
graph-based and the high-fidelity DFN approaches, for fracture networks with
varying number of fractures and degree of heterogeneity. We show that the graph
approach shows a consistent bias with up to an order of magnitude slower
breakthrough when compared to the DFN approach. We show that this is due to
graph algorithm's under-prediction of the pressure gradients across
intersections on a given fracture, leading to slower tracer particle speeds
between intersections and longer travel times. We present a bias correction
methodology to the graph algorithm that reduces the discrepancy between the DFN
and graph predictions. We show that with this bias correction, the graph
algorithm predictions significantly improve and the results are very accurate.
The good accuracy and the low computational cost, with $O(10^4)$ times lower
times than the DFN, makes the graph algorithm, an ideal technique to
incorporate in uncertainty quantification methods.

types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including
California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the
process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads.
  However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional
software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner case behaviors that
can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents
involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in
a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are
heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving

  In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic
testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven

designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in
driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest
systematically explores different parts of the DNN logic by generating test
inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands
of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g.,
blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in
three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.

understood. Here we explore an alternative paradigm where tissue chirality
results from spontaneous symmetry breaking at the cellular scale, with
molecular chirality acting only as a weak bias that ensures that one handedness
predominates over the other. Specifically, we show that systems capable of
generating planar polarity, found in many epithelial tissues, can also
generically break left-right symmetry, and we identify the key interaction
parameters that must be varied to access the chiral phase. In addition to a
chiral polar phase corresponding to one found in liquid crystal films, a
two-dimensional chiral nematic phase with no liquid crystal analog is also
possible. Our results have clear implications for the interpretation of mutant

arc-melted Nb-B samples close to the 1:1 composition was carried out. Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that all samples are both non-stoichiometric, and
comprising of two crystal phases: a majority orthorhombic NbB-type phase, and
traces of a minor body-centered cubic Nb-rich phase Nb$_{ss}$ with
stoichiometry close to Nb$_{0.98}$B$_{0.02}$. The emergence of
superconductivity near T$_c \sim$ 9.0 K was inferred from magnetization data in
chunk and powder samples. However, the very small superconducting volume
fractions are inconsistent with superconductivity arising from the major NbB
phase. On the other hand, micrographs of selected samples clearly show that the
minority Nb$_{ss}$ forms a three-dimensional network of filaments that meander
around the grains of the majority phase, forming a percolation path. Here we
report the superconductivity of the Nb$_{ss}$ phase, and argue that the low
superconducting volume fraction of non-stoichiometric NbB and zero resistance
are due to the filaments of the minority phase. The electronic contribution to
the entropy of the superconducting state, yielded from an analysis using the
alpha model for single-band systems, indicates that the Sommerfeld constant of
the arc-melted samples is close to the values found in non-superconducting NbB.
Micrograph, XRD, and bulk measurements of magnetization, electrical
resistivity, and specific heat suggest that the superconducting state in the
NbB samples bearing some Nb$_{ss}$ minority phase is due to the latter.

(HVCs), observed to be traveling in the halo with velocities of a few 100 km/s
and occasionally impacting the disk at such velocities, especially in the outer
regions of the Galaxy. We address the possibility of particle acceleration in
shocks triggered by such HVC accretion events, and the detectability of
consequent non-thermal emission in the radio to gamma-ray bands and high-energy
neutrinos. For plausible shock velocities ~300 km/s and magnetic field
strengths ~0.3-10 muG, electrons and protons may be accelerated up to ~1-10 TeV
and ~30-10^3 TeV, respectively, in sufficiently strong adiabatic shocks during
their lifetime of ~10^6 yr. The resultant pion decay and inverse Compton
gamma-rays may be the origin of some unidentified Galactic GeV-TeV sources,
particularly the ""dark"" source HESS J1503-582 that is spatially coincident with
anomalous HI structure known as ""forbidden-velocity wings"". Correlation of
their locations with star-forming regions may be weak, absent or even opposite.
Non-thermal radio and X-ray emission from primary and/or secondary electrons
may be detectable with deeper observations. The contribution of HVC accretion
to Galactic cosmic rays is subdominant, but could be non-negligible in the
outer Galaxy. As the thermal emission induced by HVC accretion is likely
difficult to detect, observations of such phenomena may offer a unique

multiple dense molecular streamers originated from the ambient clouds 20-pc

gas streamers appear to carry gas directly toward the nuclear region and might
be captured by the central potential. Our phase-plot analysis indicates that
these streamers show a signature of rotation and inward radial motion with
progressively higher velocities as the gas approaches the CND and finally ends
up co-rotating with the CND. Our results might suggest a possible mechanism of
gas feeding the CND from 20 pc around 2 pc in the GC. In this paper, we discuss
the morphology and the kinematics of these streamers. As the nearest observable

The effect of the pitch of the grooved surface and Weber number on droplet
dynamics and impact outcome are studied. At low pitch and Weber number, the
maximum droplet spreading is found to be greater in the longitudinal direction
than the transverse direction to the grooves. The preferential spreading
inversely scales with the pitch at a given Weber number. In this case, the
outcome is no bouncing (NB); however, this changes at larger pitch or Weber
number. Under these conditions, the following outcomes are obtained as function
of the pitch and Weber number - droplet completely bounces off the surface
(CB), bouncing occurs with droplet breakup (BDB) or no bouncing due to Cassie
to Wenzel wetting transition (NBW). In BDB and NBW, the liquid penetrates the
grooves partially or completely beneath the droplet due to the wetting
transition. The former results in droplet breakup alongside bouncing while the
latter suppresses the bouncing. These outcomes are demarcated on Weber number -
dimensionless pitch plane and the proposed regime map suggests the existence of
a critical Weber number or pitch for the transition from one regime to the
other. CB and BDB are quantified by plotting coefficient of restitution of the
bouncing droplet and volume of daughter droplet left on the surface,
respectively. The critical Weber number needed for the transition from CB to
BDB is estimated using an existing mathematical model and is compared with the
measurements. The comparison is good and provides insights in mechanism of the
liquid penetration into the grooves.

assumption, allowing more general sequential data sources, such as time series

properties of classical SDL, the statistical properties of CSDL remain

convergence rate of CSDL in terms of reconstruction risk, by both upper
bounding the risk of an established CSDL estimator and proving a matching

reconstruction risk is possible precisely in the `ultra-sparse' setting, in

optical sciences. An intense coherent light beam strongly interacting with the
matter causes a coherent motion of a particle, forming a strongly dressed
excited particle. A photon emission from this dressed excited particle is a
strong nonlinear process causing high-harmonic generation(HHG), where the
perturbation analysis is broken down. In this work, we study a coherent photon
emission from a strongly dressed excited atom in terms of complex spectral
analysis in the extended Floquet-Hilbert-space. We have obtained the
eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian with use of Feshbach-Brilloiun-Wigner
projection method. In this extended space, the eigenstates of the total
Hamiltonian consisting of the radiation field and the atom system have complex
eigenvalues whose imaginary part represents the decay rate. Time evolution of
the system is represented by the complex eigenvector expansion so that the
correlation dynamics between the photon and the atom is fully taken into
account. The HHG is interpreted as the irreversible spontaneous photon emission
due to the resonance singularity in terms of the multiple Floquet states that
are generated by periodic external field. We have found that the interference
between the emitted photons over the different Floquet states causes spatial
pulse emission correlated with the decay process of the excited atom.

the nonlinear optical response caused by the Berry curvature dipole in momentum
space. Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are expected to be excellent candidates for
observing these nonlinear effects because they carry a large Berry curvature
concentrated in small regions, i.e., near the Weyl points. We have implemented
the semiclassical Berry curvature dipole formalism into an $ab~initio$ scheme
and investigated the second-order nonlinear response for two representative
groups of materials: the TaAs-family type-I WSMs and MoTe$_2$-family type-II
WSMs. Both types of WSMs exhibited a Berry curvature dipole, in which type-II
Weyl points are usually superior to the type-I because of the strong tilt.
Corresponding nonlinear susceptibilities in several materials promise a
nonlinear Hall effect in the $dc$ field limit, which is within the

individually in different contexts. Both of them have their own advantages and
limitations. For instance, although classification algorithms are more powerful
than clustering methods in predicting class labels of objects, they do not
perform well when there is a lack of sufficient manually labeled reliable data.
On the other hand, although clustering algorithms do not produce label
information for objects, they provide supplementary constraints (e.g., if two
objects are clustered together, it is more likely that the same label is
assigned to both of them) that one can leverage for label prediction of a set
of unknown objects. Therefore, systematic utilization of both these types of
algorithms together can lead to better prediction performance. In this paper,
We propose a novel algorithm, called EC3 that merges classification and
clustering together in order to support both binary and multi-class
classification. EC3 is based on a principled combination of multiple
classification and multiple clustering methods using an optimization function.
We theoretically show the convexity and optimality of the problem and solve it
by block coordinate descent method. We additionally propose iEC3, a variant of
EC3 that handles imbalanced training data. We perform an extensive experimental
analysis by comparing EC3 and iEC3 with 14 baseline methods (7 well-known
standalone classifiers, 5 ensemble classifiers, and 2 existing methods that
merge classification and clustering) on 13 standard benchmark datasets. We show
that our methods outperform other baselines for every single dataset, achieving
at most 10% higher AUC. Moreover our methods are faster (1.21 times faster than
the best baseline), more resilient to noise and class imbalance than the best
baseline method.

release (GDR1). Combining Gaia astrometry with radial velocities of around 320
000 stars drawn from various catalogues, I integrate orbits in a Galactic
potential to identify those stars which pass within a few parsecs. Such
encounters could influence the solar system, for example through gravitational
perturbations of the Oort cloud. 16 stars are found to come within 2 pc
(although a few of these have dubious data). This is fewer than were found in a
similar study based on Hipparcos data, even though the present study has many
more candidates. This is partly because I reject stars with large radial
velocity uncertainties (>10 km/s), and partly because of missing stars in GDR1
(especially at the bright end). The closest encounter found is Gl 710, a K
dwarf long-known to come close to the Sun in about 1.3 Myr. The Gaia astrometry
predict a much closer passage than pre-Gaia estimates, however: just 16 000 AU
(90% confidence interval: 10 000 to 21 000 AU), which will bring this star well
within the Oort cloud. Using a simple model for the spatial, velocity, and
luminosity distributions of stars, together with an approximation of the
observational selection function, I model the incompleteness of this Gaia-based
search as a function of the time and distance of closest approach. Applying
this to a subset of the observed encounters (excluding duplicates and stars
with implausibly large velocities), I estimate the rate of stellar encounters
within 5 pc averaged over the past and future 5 Myr to be 545 +/- 59 per Myr.
Assuming a quadratic scaling of the rate within some encounter distance (which
my model predicts), this corresponds to 87 +/- 9 per My within 2 pc. A more
accurate analysis and assessment will be possible with future Gaia data

strong end-to-end guarantees, it is inherently compositional, and it can be
enforced using a simple security type system. Unfortunately, it is too
restrictive for real systems. Mechanisms for downgrading information are needed
to capture real-world security requirements, but downgrading eliminates the
strong compositional security guarantees of noninterference.
  We introduce nonmalleable information flow, a new formal security condition
that generalizes noninterference to permit controlled downgrading of both
confidentiality and integrity. While previous work on robust declassification
prevents adversaries from exploiting the downgrading of confidentiality, our
key insight is transparent endorsement, a mechanism for downgrading integrity
while defending against adversarial exploitation. Robust declassification
appeared to break the duality of confidentiality and integrity by making
confidentiality depend on integrity, but transparent endorsement makes
integrity depend on confidentiality, restoring this duality. We show how to
extend a security-typed programming language with transparent endorsement and
prove that this static type system enforces nonmalleable information flow, a
new security property that subsumes robust declassification and transparent
endorsement. Finally, we describe an implementation of this type system in the

curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ and make the first measurement of the cosmic

Compared with other methods, the proposed one involving the quasar data
achieves constraints with higher precision in this redshift range. More
importantly, our results indicate that the measured $\Omega_k$ is in good
agreement with zero cosmic curvature, implying that there is no significant
deviation from a flat Universe. Finally, we investigate the possibility of
testing $\Omega_k$ with a much higher accuracy using quasars observed in the
future VLBI surveys. It is shown that our method could provide a reliable and
tight constraint on the prior $\Omega_k$ and one can expect the zero cosmic
curvature to be established at the precision of $\Delta\Omega_k\sim 10^{-2}$
with 250 well-observed radio quasars.

The direct observation of state-to-state ultracold endothermic reaction remains

ribbons form at the main flare site, followed by the formation of secondary
ribbons at remote locations. We observe a number of plasma flows at
extreme-ultraviolet temperatures during the early phase of the flare (as early
as 15 min before the onset) propagating towards the formation site of the
secondary ribbons. The secondary ribbon formation is co-temporal with the
arrival of the pre-flare generated plasma flows. The primary ribbons are

scintillations in the polar cap. We have approached this problem by
multi-instrument techniques that comprise the EISCAT Svalbard Radar, SuperDARN
radars, in-situ rocket, and GPS scintillation measurements. The Discussion
section aims to unify the bits and pieces of highly specialized information
from several papers into a generalized picture. The cusp ionosphere appears as
a hot region in GPS scintillation climatology maps. Our results are consistent
with the existing view that scintillations in the cusp and the polar cap
ionosphere are mainly due to multi-scale structures generated by instability
processes associated with the cross-polar transport of polar cap patches. We
have demonstrated that the SuperDARN convection model can be used to track
these patches backward and forward in time. Hence, once a patch has been
detected in the cusp inflow region, SuperDARN can be used to forecast its
destination in the future. However, the high-density gradient of polar cap
patches is not the only prerequisite for high-latitude scintillations.

successfully motivate the principle. And I propose that a compelling way of so
doing is to understand it as a generalisation of Einstein's principle of the
mutually independent existence---the `being-thus'---of spatially distant
things. In particular I first describe an argument, due to Demopoulos, to the
effect that the so-called `no-signalling' condition can be viewed as a
generalisation of Einstein's principle that is appropriate for an irreducibly
statistical theory such as quantum mechanics. I then argue that a compelling
way to motivate information causality is to in turn consider it as a further
generalisation of the Einsteinian principle that is appropriate for a theory of
communication. I describe, however, some important conceptual obstacles that
must yet be overcome if the project of establishing information causality as a

of $f(R)$ modified gravity, which introduces a perturbation of the Ricci scalar
$R$ in the Einstein-Hilbert action, has been extensively applied to cosmology
to explain the acceleration of the universe. In this paper, we focus on the
recently-released VLBI observations of the compact structure in
intermediate-luminosity quasars combined with the angular-diameter-distance
measurements from galaxy clusters, which consists of 145 data points performing
as individual cosmological standard rulers in the redshift range $0.023\le z\le
2.80$, to investigate observational constraints on two viable models in $f(R)$
theories within the Palatini formalism: $f_1(R)=R-\frac{a}{R^b}$ and
$f_2(R)=R-\frac{aR}{R+ab}$. We also combine the individual standard ruler data
with the observations of CMB and BAO, which provides stringent constraints.
Furthermore, two model diagnostics, $Om(z)$ and statefinder, are also applied
to distinguish the two $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results show
that (1) The quasars sample performs very well to place constraints on the two
$f(R)$ cosmologies, which indicates its potential to act as a powerful
complementary probe to other cosmological standard rulers. (2) The $\Lambda$CDM
model, which corresponds to $b=0$ in the two $f(R)$ cosmologies is still
included within $1\sigma$ range. However, there still exists some possibility
that $\Lambda$CDM may not the best cosmological model preferred by the current
high-redshift observations. (3) The information criteria indicate that the
cosmological constant model is still the best one, while the $f_1(R)$ model
gets the smallest observational support. (4) The $f_2(R)$ model, which evolves
quite different from $f_1(R)$ model at early times, still significantly
deviates from both $f_1(R)$ and $\Lambda$CDM model at the present time.

technique to calibrate the linear size of of this standard ruler as $l_m=
11.03\pm0.25$ pc, which is the typical radius at which AGN jets become opaque
at the observed frequency $\nu\sim 2$ GHz. In the framework of flat
$\Lambda$CDM model, we find a high value of the matter density parameter,
$\Omega_m=0.322^{+0.244}_{-0.141}$, and a low value of the Hubble constant,
$H_0=67.6^{+7.8}_{-7.4}\; \rm{kms}^{-1}\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which is in excellent
agreement with the CMB anisotropy measurements by \textit{Planck}. We obtain

for the constant $w$ of a dynamical dark-energy model, which demonstrates no
significant deviation from the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Consistent
fitting results are also obtained for other cosmological models explaining the
cosmic acceleration, like Ricci dark energy (RDE) or Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
(DGP) brane-world scenario. While no significant change in $w$ with redshift is
detected, there is still considerable room for evolution in $w$ and the
transition redshift at which $w$ departing from -1 is located at $z\sim 2.0$.
Our results demonstrate that the method extensively investigated in our work on
observational radio quasar data can be used to effectively derive cosmological

low-redshift clusters may provide an important source of angular diameter
distances, considering the redshift coverage of these two astrophysical probes.

slow running time, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose S3CMTF, a

exploiting the sparsity of real-world tensors, and high accuracy by capturing
inter-relations between factors. Also, S3CMTF accomplishes additional speed-up
by lock-free parallel SGD update for multi-core shared memory systems. We

shows linear scalability on the number of data entries and the number of cores.

systems that lack hydrogen and show only cooling during the bursts. We find
that the bolometric light curves are well described by the combination of a
power law and a one-sided Gaussian. The power-law decay index is between 1.3
and 2.1 and similar to that for the 37-bursts sample. There are individual
bursters with a narrower range. The Gaussian is detected in half of all bursts,
with a typical standard deviation of 50~s and a fluence ranging up to 60% of
the total fluence. The Gaussian appears consistent with being due to the rp

process is active is underabundant in H by a factor of at least five with
respect to cosmic abundances. Ninety-four percent of all bursts from
ultracompact X-ray binaries lack the Gaussian component, and the remaining 6%

important from several perspectives. The smallest eigenvalue density is
typically expressible in terms of determinants or Pfaffians. These results are
of utmost significance in understanding the spectral behavior of
Wishart-Laguerre ensembles and, among other things, unveil the underlying
universality aspects in the asymptotic limits. However, obtaining exact and
explicit expressions by expanding determinants or Pfaffians becomes impractical
if large dimension matrices are involved. For the real matrices ($\beta=1$)
Edelman has provided an efficient recurrence scheme to work out exact and
explicit results for the smallest eigenvalue density which does not involve
determinants or matrices. Very recently, an analogous recurrence scheme has
been obtained for the complex matrices ($\beta=2$). In the present work we
extend this to $\beta$-Wishart-Laguerre ensembles for the case when exponent
$\alpha$ in the associated Laguerre weight function, $\lambda^\alpha
e^{-\beta\lambda/2}$, is a non-negative integer, while $\beta$ is positive
real. This also gives access to the smallest eigenvalue density of fixed trace
$\beta$-Wishart-Laguerre ensemble, as well as moments for both cases. Moreover,
comparison with earlier results for the smallest eigenvalue density in terms of
certain hypergeometric function of matrix argument results in an effective way
of evaluating these explicitly. Exact evaluations for large values of $n$ (the
matrix dimension) and $\alpha$ also enable us to compare with Tracy-Widom
density and large deviation results of Katzav and Castillo. We also use our
result to obtain the density of the largest of the proper delay times which are
eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith matrix and are relevant to the problem of
quantum chaotic scattering.

no such properties are available. As a general tool, we develop a deterministic
distributed clustering algorithm. Our solution relies on a new type of
combinatorial structures (selectors), which might be of independent interest.
Using the clustering, we develop a deterministic distributed local broadcast
algorithm accomplishing this task in $O(\Delta \log^*N \log N)$ rounds, where
$\Delta$ is the density of the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first solution in pure scenario which is only polylog$(n)$ away from the
universal lower bound $\Omega(\Delta)$, valid also for scenarios with
randomization and other features. Therefore, none of these features
substantially helps in performing the local broadcast task. Using clustering,
we also build a deterministic global broadcast algorithm that terminates within

critical importance to consider the selection and survival of
multi-generational crews in a confined space. Negative effects, such as
infertility, overpopulation and inbreeding, can easily cause the crew to either
be wiped out or genetically unhealthy, if the population is not under a strict
birth control. In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo code named HERITAGE that
simulates the evolution of a kin-based crew. This computer model, the first of
its kind, accounts for a large number of free human-based parameters to be
investigated proactively in order to ensure a viable mission. We show the
reliability of HERITAGE by examining three types of population based on
previously published computations. The first is a generic model where no
birth/population control has been set up, quickly leading to fatal
overcrowding. The second is the model presented by Moore (2003), that succeeds
to bring settlers to another Earth under a 200 year-long flight, but the final
crew is largely diminished (about a third of the initial crew) and about 20% of
them show inbreeding of various levels. The third scenario is the model by
Smith (2014) that is more successful in maintaining genetic diversity for the
same journey duration. We find that both the Moore and Smith scenario would
greatly benefit from coupling a kin-based crew together with a cryogenic bank
of sperm/eggs/embryos to ensure a genetically healthy first generation of
settlers. We also demonstrate that if initial social engineering constraints
are indeed needed to maintain an healthy crew alive for centuries-long
journeys, it is necessary to reevaluate those principles after each generation
to compensate for unbalanced births and deaths, weighted by the inbreeding
coefficient and a need for maximizing genetic diversity.

that remarkably the \textit{large-scale} (energy-containing range) statistics

study, we extend this universality, which was seen to encompass also flows at
moderate Reynolds number, to Taylor-Couette flow. In doing so, we find that
also the transversal structure function of the spanwise velocity component
exhibits the same universal behaviour across all flow types considered. We
further demonstrate that these observations are consistent with predictions
developed based on an attached-eddy hypothesis. These considerations also yield
a possible explanation for the efficacy of the ESS framework by showing that it
relaxes the self-similarity assumption for the attached eddy contributions. By
taking the effect of streamwise alignment into account, the attached eddy model
predicts different behaviour for structure functions in the streamwise and in
the spanwise directions and that this effect cancels in the ESS-framework ---
both consistent with the data. Moreover, it is demonstrated here that also the

novel TDP fermions without high-energy counterparts. Although identifying ideal
TDP semimetals, which host clean TDP fermions around the Fermi level ($E_F$)
without coexisting of other quasiparticles, is critical to explore the
intrinsic properties of this new fermion, it is still a big challenge and has
not been achieved up to now. Here, we disclose an effective approach to search
for ideal TDP semimetals via selective band crossing between antibonding $s$
and bonding $p$ orbitals along a line in the momentum space with $C_{3v}$
symmetry. Applying this approach, we have successfully identified the
NaCu$_3$Te$_2$ family of compounds to be ideal TDP semimetals, where two and
only two pairs of TDPs are located around the $E_F$. Moreover, we reveal an
interesting mechanism to modulate energy splitting between a pair of TDPs, and
illustrate the intrinsic features of TDP Fermi arcs in these ideal TDP
semimetals.

as well. Our results rule out reprocessing as the dominant mechanism for the UV
variability, as well as the inward propagating fluctuations in the accretion
rate. Absence of a positive correlation between the photon index and the UV
flux suggests that the observed UV emission is unlikely to be the seed photons
for the thermal Comptonisation. We find a strong correlation between the
continuum flux and the soft-excess temperature which implies that the soft
excess is most likely the reprocessed X-ray emission in the inner accretion
disc. Strong X-ray heating of the innermost regions in the disc, due to
gravitational light bending, appears to be an important effect in 1H~0707-495,
giving rise to a significant fraction of the soft excess as reprocessed thermal
emission. We also find indications for a non-static, dynamic X-ray corona,

Perturbations of the equilibrium state with a particular wave number produce
transient standing waves with a specific frequency, analogous to those in a
tense string. In the neuronal network, the equilibrium corresponds to a
spatially homogeneous, asynchronous state. Perturbations of this state excite
the network's oscillatory modes, which reflect the interplay of episodes of
synchronous spiking with the excitatory-inhibitory spatial interactions. In the
thermodynamic limit, an exact low-dimensional neural field model describing the
macroscopic dynamics of the network is derived. This allows us to obtain
formulas for the Turing eigenvalues of the spatially-homogeneous state, and
hence to obtain its stability boundary. We find that the frequency of each
Turing mode depends on the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the synaptic
pattern of connectivity. The decay rate instead, is identical for all
oscillation modes as a consequence of the heterogeneity-induced
desynchronization of the neurons. Finally, we numerically compute the spectrum
of spatially-inhomogeneous solutions branching from the Turing bifurcation,
showing that similar oscillatory modes operate in neural bump states, and are
maintained away from onset.

allows for a unique identification of hyperbolic distributions and for
unravelling components of more complicated trajectories. This method is
illustrated by a few examples. They show that fundamental postulates of the
demographic and economic research are contradicted by data, even by precisely
the same data, which are used in this research. The generally accepted
postulates are based on the incorrect understanding of hyperbolic
distributions, which characterise the historical growth of population and the
historical economic growth. In particular, data used, but never analysed,
during the formulation of the Unified Growth Theory show that this theory is
based on fundamentally incorrect premises and thus is fundamentally defective.
Application of this simple method of analysis points to new directions in the
demographic and economic research. It suggests simpler interpretations of the
mechanism of growth. The concept or the evidence of the past primitive and
difficult living conditions, which might be perhaps described as some kind of
stagnation, is not questioned or disputed. It is only demonstrated that
trajectories of the past economic growth and of the growth of population were
not reflecting any form of stagnation and thus that they were not shaped by
these primitive and difficult living conditions. The concept or evidence of an
explosion in technology, medicine, education and in the improved living
conditions is not questioned or disputed. It is only demonstrated that this
possible explosion is not reflected in the trajectories of the economic growth

the physical realizations of the qubits and the implementations of various

slower than gate operations, and conventional surface code implementations that
rely heavily on syndrome measurements could therefore be challenging. However,
fast and accurate reset of quantum dot qubits--without readout--can be achieved
via tunneling to a reservoir. Here, we propose small-scale surface code
implementations for which syndrome measurements are replaced by a combination
of Toffoli gates and qubit reset. For quantum dot qubits, this enables much
faster error correction than measurement-based schemes, but requires additional
ancilla qubits and non-nearest-neighbor interactions. We have performed
numerical simulations of two different coding schemes, obtaining error
thresholds on the orders of $10^{-2}$ for a 1D architecture that only corrects
bit-flip errors, and $10^{-4}$ for a 2D architecture that corrects bit- and
phase-flip errors.

valuable information from data collected in the wild. This exposes learning
algorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which
a fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated
to subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only
against a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent
complexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning
points (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we rst extend the
de nition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel
poisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to
compute the gradient of interest through automatic di erentiation, while also
reversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity.
Compared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a
wider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient- based procedures,
including neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically
evaluate its e ectiveness on several application examples, including spam
ltering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition. We nally show
that, similarly to adversarial test examples, adversarial training examples can

by the theorems proved in the thesis is that surprisingly small compromise is
necessary on the efficacy of the solutions to make the approach work. The
problems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical
applications.
  The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A
sharp extremal bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most
8-vertex polygons using established techniques in the field of art gallery
problems. This fills in the gap between already known results for partitioning
into at most 6- and 10-vertex orthogonal polygons.
  Next, these techniques are further developed to prove a new type of extremal
art gallery result. The novelty provided by this approach is that it
establishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem has
strong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an
$\frac83$-approximation algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with
rectangular vision.
  In the second part, the graph theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is
studied in complete and complete grid graphs. Once again, the extremal approach
is conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem.
  In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the
maximum degree of realizable demand graphs is 4 times higher than previous best
results. The techniques developed are then used to solve the classical extremal
edge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete base
graphs.
  The complete grid base graph lies on the other end of the spectrum in terms
density amongst path-pairable graphs. It is shown that complete grid graphs are
relatively efficient in routing edge-disjoint paths.

removing the contributions to the fluctuations from the number of participating

been observed as a function of collision energy. The results are compared with

for the first time a large negative or positive variation, as an indicator of
price stability, and relate this to a standard measure of volatility. In an
empirical analysis of daily returns for $1071$ stocks traded in the New York

behavior, with a maximum, as a function of volatility. Also, we show that the
statistical properties of the empirical data can be reproduced by a nonlinear
Heston model. This analysis implies that, contrary to conventional wisdom, not

persistent disturbances. In this work, a global Lyapunov function is
constructed by combining known local Lyapunov functions for simpler, local
sub-problems via an explicit formula that depends on the problem parameters.
Specifically, we consider the scenario where one set consists of the union of
two lines and the other set is a line, so that the two sets intersect in two
distinct points. Locally, near each intersection point, the problem reduces to
the intersection of just two lines, but globally the geometry is non-convex and
the Douglas-Rachford operator multi-valued. Our approach is intended to be
prototypical for addressing the convergence analysis of the Douglas-Rachford

  Methods: The variability of medical findings focused on the prostate gland

firstly evaluated, and secondly compared with a consensus of these two experts.
Using a prostate MRI database, experts drew regions of interest (ROIs)
corresponding to healthy prostate (peripheral and central zones) and cancer
using a semi-automated tool. One of the experts then drew the ROI with
knowledge of the other expert's ROI.
  Results: The surface area of each ROI as the Hausdorff distance and the Dice
coefficient for each contour were evaluated between the different experiments,
taking the drawing of the second expert as the reference. The results showed
that the significant differences between the two experts became non-significant
with a collaborative work.
  Conclusions: This study shows that collaborative work with a dedicated tool
allows a better consensus between expertise than using a double blind
evaluation. Although we show this for prostate cancer evaluation in T2-weighted
MRI, the results of this research can be extrapolated to other diseases and

for its complex dielectric permittivity, magnetodielectric and pyrocurrent
behavior as a function of temperature (T). In order to enable meaningful
discussions, the results of ac and dc magnetizatioin and heat-capacity studies
are also reported. We emphasize on the following findings: (i) There is a
pyrocurrent peak near T_N, but it is shown not to arise from ferroelectricity,
but possibly due to 'thermally stimulated depolarization current', unlike in
many other members of this rare-earth series, in which case ferroelectric
features were reported at or above T_N; (ii) however, the pyrocurrent measured
in the presence of a bias electric field (after cooling in zero electric field)
as well as dielectric constant reveal a weak peak with increasing T around 22 K
- the temperature around which population of the exchange-split excited state
of Kramers doublet has been known to occur. This finding suggests that this
compound presents a novel situation in which multiferroicity is induced by an
interplay between crystal-field effects and exchange interaction. No multiglass
features could be observed down to 2 K unlike in many members of this family.

Lacs, which are the most numerous extragalactic VHE sources. Using significant
correlations between different bands, we aim to identify the best TeV BL Lac
candidates that can be discovered by the current and next generation of imaging

  Methods: We formed five datasets from lower energy data, i.e. radio,
mid-infrared, optical, X-rays, and GeV $\gamma$-ray, and five VHE $\gamma$-ray
datasets to perform a correlation study between different bands and to
construct the prediction method. The low energy datasets were averaged for
individual sources, while the VHE $\gamma$-ray data were divided into subsets
according to the flux state of the source. We then looked for significant
correlations and determined their best-fit parameters. Using the best-fit
parameters we predicted the level of VHE $\gamma$-ray flux for a sample of 182
BL Lacs, which have not been detected at TeV energies. We identified the most
promising TeV BL Lac candidates based on the predicted VHE $\gamma$-ray flux
for each source.
  Results: We found 14 significant correlations between radio, mid-infrared,
optical, $\gamma$-ray, and VHE $\gamma$-ray bands. The correlation between
optical and VHE $\gamma$-ray luminosity is established for the first time. We
attribute this to the more complete sample and more accurate handling of host

interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Under this framework,
the computation of the forward pass in a CNN is equivalent to a pursuit
algorithm aiming to estimate the nested sparse representation vectors -- or
feature maps -- from a given input signal. Despite having served as a pivotal
connection between CNNs and sparse modeling, a deeper understanding of the
ML-CSC is still lacking: there are no pursuit algorithms that can serve this
model exactly, nor are there conditions to guarantee a non-empty model. While
one can easily obtain signals that approximately satisfy the ML-CSC
constraints, it remains unclear how to simply sample from the model and, more
importantly, how one can train the convolutional filters from real data.
  In this work, we propose a sound pursuit algorithm for the ML-CSC model by
adopting a projection approach. We provide new and improved bounds on the
stability of the solution of such pursuit and we analyze different practical
alternatives to implement this in practice. We show that the training of the
filters is essential to allow for non-trivial signals in the model, and we
derive an online algorithm to learn the dictionaries from real data,
effectively resulting in cascaded sparse convolutional layers. Last, but not
least, we demonstrate the applicability of the ML-CSC model for several
applications in an unsupervised setting, providing competitive results. Our
work represents a bridge between matrix factorization, sparse dictionary
learning and sparse auto-encoders, and we analyze these connections in detail.

their relationship to the flare ribbons, cusp field and arcades formed in the

classification and segmentation of images. In some cases, it is desirable to
focus the attention of the net on a specific region in the image; one such case
is the recognition of the contents of transparent vessels, where the vessel
region in the image is already known. This work presents a valve filter
approach for focusing the attention of the net on a region of interest (ROI).
In this approach, the ROI is inserted into the net as a binary map. The net
uses a different set of convolution filters for the ROI and background image
regions, resulting in a different set of features being extracted from each
region. More accurately, for each filter used on the image, a corresponding
valve filter exists that acts on the ROI map and determines the regions in
which the corresponding image filter will be used. This valve filter
effectively acts as a valve that inhibits specific features in different image
regions according to the ROI map. In addition, a new data set for images of
materials in glassware vessels in a chemistry laboratory setting is presented.
This data set contains a thousand images with pixel-wise annotation according
to categories ranging from filled and empty to the exact phase of the material
inside the vessel. The results of the valve filter approach and fully
convolutional neural nets (FCN) with no ROI input are compared based on this
data set.

performed better than data selection. It is beneficial in a scenario when there

understanding of the devolatilization that produced the Earth. To quantify the
chemical relationships between the Earth, the Sun and other bodies in the Solar
System, the elemental abundances of the bulk Earth are required. The key to
comparing Earth's composition with those of other objects is to have a
determination of the bulk composition with an appropriate estimate of
uncertainties. Here we present concordance estimates (with uncertainties) of
the elemental abundances of the bulk Earth, which can be used in such studies.
First we compile, combine and renormalize a large set of heterogeneous
literature values of the primitive mantle (PM) and of the core. We then
integrate standard radial density profiles of the Earth and renormalize them to
the current best estimate for the mass of the Earth. Using estimates of the
uncertainties in i) the density profiles, ii) the core-mantle boundary and iii)
the inner core boundary, we employ standard error propagation to obtain a core
mass fraction of $32.5 \pm 0.3$ wt%. Our bulk Earth abundances are the weighted
sum of our concordance core abundances and concordance PM abundances. Our
concordance estimates for the abundances of Mg, Sn, Br, B, Cd and Be are
significantly lower than previous estimates of the bulk Earth. Our concordance
estimates for the abundances of Na, K, Cl, Zn, Sr, F, Ga, Rb, Nb, Gd, Ta, He,

domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the
conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty
quantification and information propagation through and across the modules.
However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update
of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when
certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to
avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the
information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation
to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we
investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model
in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between

convex position in the plane, i.e., convex drawings. We consider two families
of graph classes with nice convex drawings: outer $k$-planar graphs, where each
edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges; and, outer $k$-quasi-planar graphs
where no $k$ edges can mutually cross. We show that the outer $k$-planar graphs
are $(\lfloor\sqrt{4k+1}\rfloor+1)$-degenerate, and consequently that every
outer $k$-planar graph can be $(\lfloor\sqrt{4k+1}\rfloor+2)$-colored, and this
bound is tight. We further show that every outer $k$-planar graph has a
balanced separator of size $O(k)$. This implies that every outer $k$-planar
graph has treewidth $O(k)$. For fixed $k$, these small balanced separators
allow us to obtain a simple quasi-polynomial time algorithm to test whether a
given graph is outer $k$-planar, i.e., none of these recognition problems are
NP-complete unless ETH fails. For the outer $k$-quasi-planar graphs we prove
that, unlike other beyond-planar graph classes, every edge-maximal $n$-vertex
outer $k$-quasi planar graph has the same number of edges, namely $2(k-1)n -
\binom{2k-1}{2}$. We also construct planar 3-trees that are not outer
$3$-quasi-planar. Finally, we restrict outer $k$-planar and outer
$k$-quasi-planar drawings to \emph{closed} drawings, where the vertex sequence
on the boundary is a cycle in the graph. For each $k$, we express closed outer
$k$-planarity and \emph{closed outer $k$-quasi-planarity} in extended monadic
second-order logic. Thus, closed outer $k$-planarity is linear-time testable by
Courcelle's Theorem.

leading to significant progress in a multitude of diverse contexts including,
e.g., quantum transport, open quantum systems, quantum communication, extreme
violation of local realism, and quantum gravity geometries. However, the
question on how to produce and control general quantum complex networks in

reconfigurable implementation of quantum complex networks. The experimental
proposal is based on optical frequency combs, parametric processes, pulse
shaping and multimode measurements allowing the arbitrary control of the number
of the nodes (optical modes) and topology of the links (interactions between
the modes) within the network. Moreover, we also show how to simulate quantum
dynamics within the network combined with the ability to address its individual

implementation of two recently proposed probing techniques for quantum complex
networks and structured environments. Overall, our general method for
implementing quantum complex networks with reconfigurable set-up has potential
to define an experimental playground for designing and controlling complex

correlation so that two groups of strongly and weakly correlated tasks are
formed. The two groups of tasks are learned in a curriculum learning setup by
transferring the acquired knowledge from the strongly to the weakly correlated.
The learning process within each group though, is performed in a multi-task
classification setup. The proposed method learns better and converges faster

more widely used non-parametric prediction methods. Tree-structured methods
yield a histogram reconstruction of the regression surface, where the bins
correspond to terminal nodes of recursive partitioning. Trees are powerful, yet
susceptible to over-fitting. Strategies against overfitting have traditionally
relied on pruning greedily grown trees. The Bayesian framework offers an
alternative remedy against overfitting through priors. Roughly speaking, a good
prior charges smaller trees where overfitting does not occur. While the
consistency of random histograms, trees and their ensembles has been studied
quite extensively, the theoretical understanding of the Bayesian counterparts
has been missing. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding why/when
do Bayesian trees and their ensembles not overfit. To address this question, we
study the speed at which the posterior concentrates around the true smooth
regression function. We propose a spike-and-tree variant of the popular
Bayesian CART prior and establish new theoretical results showing that
regression trees (and their ensembles) (a) are capable of recovering smooth
regression surfaces, achieving optimal rates up to a log factor, (b) can adapt
to the unknown level of smoothness and (c) can perform effective dimension
reduction when p>n. These results provide a piece of missing theoretical
evidence explaining why Bayesian trees (and additive variants thereof) have

Real-world graphs are usually directed, where the edges have a direction and
they are not symmetric. Betweenness centrality is an important index widely
used to analyze networks. In this paper, first given a directed network $G$ and
a vertex $r \in V(G)$, we propose an exact algorithm to compute betweenness
score of $r$. Our algorithm pre-computes a set $\mathcal{RV}(r)$, which is used
to prune a huge amount of computations that do not contribute to the
betweenness score of $r$. Time complexity of our algorithm depends on
$|\mathcal{RV}(r)|$ and it is respectively
$\Theta(|\mathcal{RV}(r)|\cdot|E(G)|)$ and
$\Theta(|\mathcal{RV}(r)|\cdot|E(G)|+|\mathcal{RV}(r)|\cdot|V(G)|\log |V(G)|)$
for unweighted graphs and weighted graphs with positive weights.
$|\mathcal{RV}(r)|$ is bounded from above by $|V(G)|-1$ and in most cases, it
is a small constant. Then, for the cases where $\mathcal{RV}(r)$ is large, we
present a simple randomized algorithm that samples from $\mathcal{RV}(r)$ and
performs computations for only the sampled elements. We show that this
algorithm provides an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation to the betweenness
score of $r$. Finally, we perform extensive experiments over several real-world
datasets from different domains for several randomly chosen vertices as well as
for the vertices with the highest betweenness scores. Our experiments reveal
that for estimating betweenness score of a single vertex, our algorithm
significantly outperforms the most efficient existing randomized algorithms, in
terms of both running time and accuracy. Our experiments also reveal that our
algorithm improves the existing algorithms when someone is interested in
computing betweenness values of the vertices in a set whose cardinality is very
small.

and multiple speakers are simultaneously active. There is thus some sort of

(SQCC) protocol, where random numbers for quantum key distribution (QKD) and
bits for classical communication are encoded on the \emph{same} weak coherent
pulse, and decoded by the \emph{same} coherent receiver. Such a scheme could be
appealing in practice since a single coherent communication system can be used
for multiple purposes. However, previous studies show that the SQCC protocol
can only tolerate very small phase noise. This makes it incompatible with the
coherent communication scheme using a true local oscillator (LO), which
presents a relatively high phase noise due to the fact that the signal and the
LO are generated from two independent lasers. In this paper, we improve the
phase noise tolerance of the SQCC scheme using a true LO by adopting a refined
noise model where phase noises originated from different sources are treated
differently: on one hand, phase noise associated with the coherent receiver may
be regarded as \emph{trusted} noise, since the detector can be calibrated
locally and the photon statistics of the detected signals can be determined
from the measurement results; on the other hand, phase noise due to the
instability of fiber interferometers may be regarded as \emph{untrusted} noise,
since its randomness (from the adversary's point to view) is hard to justify.
Simulation results show the tolerable phase noise in this refined noise model
is significantly higher than that in the previous study where all the phase
noises are assumed to be untrusted. We conduct an experiment to show the
required phase stability can be achieved in a coherent communication system
using a true LO.

The differential cross sections of a Z boson in association with jets with pT >
30 GeV and |y|< 2.5 at sqrt s = 13 TeV are measured in a fiducial phase space,
probing strong interactions that completely dominate in these processes, while
measurements of a W boson in association with at least two jets at high pT and
high di-jet invariant mass, where the electroweak production is enhanced, are
performed with sqrt s = 8 TeV data. Angular distributions in W+jets events with
high pT jets are also measured at sqrt s = 8 TeV focusing on small angular
separation between the jets and the W decay products, where contributions from
real W emission are expected large. Finally a measurement of the splitting
scales occurring in the kt jet-clustering algorithm is presented for final
states containing a Z boson at sqrt s = 8 TeV. This measurement based on
charged-particle track information constitutes a complementary approach to
study jet properties. Data distributions of all the measurements are corrected

locally, while keeping it globally disordered. The study is done in the context
of the emergence of diversity in opinion propagation models with interactions
rooted in conformity, but some suggestions on how this could be extended to
other topics (like ecology and neuroscience) are also made. We do this by
introducing a generic modification that can be added to different opinion
propagation models (and other agent based models) and that seems to introduce a
global tendency towards diversity without leading the system to a frozen state,
even in the absence of thermal noises, contrarian agents or cyclic
interactions. This modification consists of effectively introducing a
relaxation period right after an agent changes its state, during which it
cannot change its state again. We tested this modification for the voter model
in a square lattice and verified that in the thermodynamic limit, the only
attractor is the completely disordered state, where all opinions coexist in the
same proportion. For fixed lattice sizes, finite size effects cause a
transition with the lenght of the relaxation period between coexistence and
consensus. We made simulations for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 opinions in a square
lattice and mean field calculations for an arbitrary number of opinions.

chain recurrence for flows and Lyapunov functions. For a continuous flow on a
compact metric space, uniformly Lipschitz continuous on the compact subsets of
the time, we first make explicit a Lipschitz continuous Lyapunov function
strict -that is strictly decreasing- outside the strong chain recurrent set of
the flow. This construction extends to flows some recent advances of Fathi and
Pageault in the case of homeomorphisms; moreover, it improves Conley's result
about the existence of a continuous Lyapunov function strictly decreasing
outside the chain recurrent set of a continuous flow. We then present two
consequences of this theorem. From one hand, we characterize the strong chain
recurrent set in terms of Lipschitz continuous Lyapunov functions. From the
other hand, in the case of a flow induced by a vector field, we establish a
sufficient condition for the existence of a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ strict Lyapunov
function and we also discuss various examples. Moreover, for general continuous
flows, we show that the strong chain recurrent set has only one strong chain
transitive component if and only if the only Lipschitz continuous Lyapunov
functions are the constants. Finally, we provide a necessary and sufficient
condition to guarantee that the strong chain recurrent set and the chain
recurrent one coincide.

challenge faced by testers lies in crafting efficient test suites, able to
detect a maximum number of bugs with manageable effort. To do so, they rely on
coverage criteria, which define some precise test objectives to be covered.
However, many common criteria specify a significant number of objectives that
occur to be infeasible or redundant in practice, like covering dead code or
semantically equal mutants. Such objectives are well-known to be harmful to the
design of test suites, impacting both the efficiency and precision of testers'
effort. This work introduces a sound and scalable formal technique able to
prune out a significant part of the infeasible and redundant objectives
produced by a large panel of white-box criteria. In a nutshell, we reduce this
challenging problem to proving the validity of logical assertions in the code
under test. This technique is implemented in a tool that relies on
weakest-precondition calculus and SMT solving for proving the assertions. The
tool is built on top of the Frama-C verification platform, which we carefully
tune for our specific scalability needs. The experiments reveal that the tool
can prune out up to 27% of test objectives in a program and scale to

manipulation of individual atoms--has been directly achieved with only one
technique: scanning probe microscopy. In this Review, we demonstrate that
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is emerging as an alternative
method for the direct assembly of nanostructures, with possible applications in
plasmonics, quantum technologies, and materials science. Atomically precise
manipulation with STEM relies on recent advances in instrumentation that have
enabled non-destructive atomic-resolution imaging at lower electron energies.
While momentum transfer from highly energetic electrons often leads to atom
ejection, interesting dynamics can be induced when the transferable kinetic
energies are comparable to bond strengths in the material. Operating in this
regime, very recent experiments have revealed the potential for single-atom
manipulation using the Angstrom-sized electron beam. To truly enable control,
however, it is vital to understand the relevant atomic-scale phenomena through
accurate dynamical simulations. Although excellent agreement between experiment
and theory for the specific case of atomic displacements from graphene has been
recently achieved using density functional theory molecular dynamics, in many
other cases quantitative accuracy remains a challenge. We provide a
comprehensive reanalysis of available experimental data on beam-driven dynamics
in light of the state-of-the-art in simulations, and identify important targets
for improvement. Overall, the modern electron microscope has great potential to
become an atom-scale fabrication platform, especially for covalently bonded 2D
nanostructures. We review the developments that have made this possible, argue
that graphene is an ideal starting material, and assess the main challenges
moving forward.

of an undirected graph and the second smallest eigenvalue of its normalized
Laplacian, is a cornerstone of spectral graph theory. The Cheeger inequality
has been extended to directed graphs and hypergraphs using normalized
Laplacians for those, that are no longer linear but piecewise linear
transformations.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a submodular transformation
$F:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, which applies $m$ submodular functions to the
$n$-dimensional input vector, and then introduce the notions of its Laplacian
and normalized Laplacian. With these notions, we unify and generalize the
existing Cheeger inequalities by showing a Cheeger inequality for submodular
transformations, which relates the conductance of a submodular transformation
and the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of its normalized Laplacian. This
result recovers the Cheeger inequalities for undirected graphs, directed
graphs, and hypergraphs, and derives novel Cheeger inequalities for mutual
information and directed information.
  Computing the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of a normalized Laplacian of a
submodular transformation is NP-hard under the small set expansion hypothesis.
In this paper, we present a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm
for the symmetric case, which is tight, and a polynomial-time $O(\log^2n+\log n
\cdot \log m)$-approximation algorithm for the general case.
  We expect the algebra concerned with submodular transformations, or
\emph{submodular algebra}, to be useful in the future not only for generalizing
spectral graph theory but also for analyzing other problems that involve
piecewise linear transformations, e.g., deep learning.

show how a concrete model can be built automatically using dynamic traces.
Then, using graph traversals, we mine for potentially vulnerable operations.
Using the information captured in the model, our approach then automatically
creates and conducts security tests, to practically validate the found CSRF

studied (by hybrid filters we mean those which blend ensemble covariances with
some other regularizing covariances). To isolate effects of non-stationarity
from effects due to nonlinearity (and the non-Gaussianity it causes), a new
doubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model (DSADM) is proposed. The
model is hierarchical: it is a linear stochastic partial differential equation
whose coefficients are random fields defined through their own stochastic
partial differential equations. DSADM generates conditionally Gaussian
spatiotemporal random fields with a tunable degree of non-stationarity in space
and time. DSADM allows the use of the exact Kalman filter as a baseline
benchmark.
  In numerical experiments with DSADM as the ""model of truth"", the relative
importance of the three kinds of covariance blending is studied: with static,
time-smoothed, and space-smoothed covariances. It is shown that the stronger
the non-stationarity, the less useful the static covariance matrix becomes and
the more beneficial the time-smoothed covariances are. Time-smoothing of
background-error covariances proved to be systematically more useful than their
space-smoothing. Under non-stationarity, a filter that extends the (previously
proposed by the authors) Hierarchical Bayes Ensemble Filter and accommodates
the three covariance-blending techniques is shown to outperform all other
configurations of the filters tested. The R code of the model and the filters
is available from github.com/cyrulnic/NoStRa.

forms an asymmetric ring at a radius of about 120 au, which is suggestive of
dust trapping in a gas vortex. We present high spatial resolution (0"".58x0"".78
~ 80x110 au) NOEMA observations of the 1.12 mm and 2.22 mm dust continuum
emission from the AB Aur disk. Significant azimuthal variations of the flux
ratio at both wavelengths indicate a size segregation of the large dust
particles along the ring. Our continuum images also show that the intensity
variations along the ring are smaller at 2.22 mm than at 1.12 mm, contrary to
what dust trapping models with a gas vortex have predicted. Our two-fluid
(gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that this feature is well
explained if the gas vortex has started to decay due to turbulent diffusion,
and dust particles are thus losing the azimuthal trapping on different
timescales depending on their size. The comparison between our observations and
simulations allows us to constrain the size distribution and the total mass of
solid particles in the ring, which we find to be of the order of 30 Earth
masses, enough to form future rocky planets.

bounded by an elastic membrane and immersed in another Newtonian fluid, in a
uniform DC electric field is investigated. Discontinuity of electrical
properties such as conductivities of the internal and external fluid media as
well as capacitance and conductance of the membrane lead to a net interfacial
Maxwell stress which can cause the deformation of such an elastic capsule. We
investigate this problem considering well established membrane laws for a thin
elastic membrane, with fully resolved hydrodynamics in the Stokes flow limit
and describe the electrostatics using the capacitor model. In the limit of
small deformation, the analytical theory predicts the dynamics fairly
satisfactorily. Large deformations at high capillary number though necessitate
a numerical approach (Boundary element method in the present case) to solve
this highly non-linear problem. Akin to vesicles, at intermediate times, highly
nonlinear biconcave shapes along with squaring and hexagon like shapes are
observed when the outer medium is more conducting. The study identifies the
essentiality of parameters such as high membrane capacitance, low membrane
conductance, low hydrodynamic time scales and high capillary number for
observation of these shape transitions. The transition is due to large
compressive Maxwell stress at the poles at intermediate times. Thus such shape

one-dimensional lattice ring by suddenly changing the potential of a site. From
the point-of-view of the conventional Friedel oscillation, which is a static or
equilibrium problem, it is of interest what temporal and spatial oscillations
the local sudden quench will induce. Numerically, the primary observation is
that for a generic site, the local particle density switches between two
plateaus periodically in time. Making use of the proximity of the realistic
model to an exactly solvable model and employing the {Abel regularization} to
assign a definite value to a divergent series, we obtain an analytical formula
for the heights of the plateaus, which turns out to be very accurate for sites
not too close to the quench site. The unexpected relevance and the incredible
accuracy of the Abel regularization are yet to be understood. Eventually, when
the contribution of the defect mode is also taken into account, the plateaus
for those sites close to or on the quench site can also be accurately
predicted. We have also studied the infinite lattice case. In this case,
ensuing the quench, the out-going wave fronts leave behind a stable density
oscillation pattern. Because of some interesting single-particle property, this
dynamically generated Friedel oscillation differs from its conventional static
counterpart only by the defect mode.

follows a binary computation offloading policy, i.e., data set of a task has to
be executed as a whole either locally or remotely at the MEC server via task
offloading. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the (weighted) sum
computation rate of all the WDs in the network by jointly optimizing the
individual computing mode selection (i.e., local computing or offloading) and
the system transmission time allocation (on WPT and task offloading). The major
difficulty lies in the combinatorial nature of multi-user computing mode
selection and its strong coupling with transmission time allocation. To tackle
this problem, we first consider a decoupled optimization, where we assume that
the mode selection is given and propose a simple bi-section search algorithm to
obtain the conditional optimal time allocation. On top of that, a coordinate
descent method is devised to optimize the mode selection. The method is simple
in implementation but may suffer from high computational complexity in a
large-size network. To address this problem, we further propose a joint
optimization method based on the ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers) decomposition technique, which enjoys much slower increase of
computational complexity as the networks size increases. Extensive simulations
show that both the proposed methods can efficiently achieve near-optimal
performance under various network setups, and significantly outperform the
other representative benchmark methods considered.

properties of the different methods. The usual goal is to show that the
approach is asymptotically efficient and that the metric used is unbiased or
maybe biased.
  This project is based on a work done by [1]. The approach is based on the
principle that the entropy of the data is increased when an anomalous data
point is measured. The entropy of the data set is thus to be estimated. In this
report however, preliminary efforts at confirming the results of [1] is
presented. To estimate the entropy of the dataset, since no parametric form is
assumed, the probability density function of the data set is first estimated
using data split method. This estimated pdf value is then plugged-in to the
entropy estimation formula to estimate the entropy of the dataset. The data
(test signal) used in this report is Gaussian distributed with zero mean and
variance 4. Results of pdf estimation using the k-nearest neighbour method
using the entire dataset, and a data-split method are presented and compared
based on how well they approximate the probability density function of a
Gaussian with similar mean and variance. The number of nearest neighbours
chosen for the purpose of this report is 8. This is arbitrary, but is
reasonable since the number of anomalies introduced is expected to be less than
this upon data-split. The data-split method is preferred and rightly so.

crucial in order to make the decryption possible, is guaranteed by the use of
invertible layers or by the Feistel structure. In this work a new family of
ciphers, called wave ciphers, is introduced. In wave ciphers, round functions
feature wave functions, which are vectorial Boolean functions obtained as the
composition of non-invertible layers, where the confusion layer enlarges the
message which returns to its original size after the diffusion layer is
applied. This is motivated by the fact that relaxing the requirement that all
the layers are invertible allows to consider more functions which are optimal
with regard to non-linearity. In particular it allows to consider injective APN
S-boxes. In order to guarantee efficient decryption we propose to use wave
functions in Feistel Networks. With regard to security, the immunity from some
group-theoretical attacks is investigated. In particular, it is shown how to
avoid that the group generated by the round functions acts imprimitively, which

more powerful and more useful projection method of Jain and Kamilla fails in
the torus geometry because it does not preserve the periodic boundary

succeeded in constructing a modified projection method that is consistent with
both the periodic boundary conditions and the general structure of the CF

generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other.
The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the
energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the
gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model
learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does
not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one
Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution
equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on a

semiclassically calculable regime on ${\rm I\!R}^3 \times S^1$. Their tensions
T$_{\text{k}}$ are computed in two ways: numerically, for $2$ $\le$ N $\le$
$10$, and via an analytic approach using a re-summed perturbative expansion.
The latter serves both as a consistency check on the numerical results and as a
tool to analytically study the large-N limit. We find that dYM k-string ratios
T$_{\text{k}}$/T$_{\text{1}}$ do not obey the well-known sine- or
Casimir-scaling laws. Instead, we show that the ratios
T$_{\text{k}}$/T$_{\text{1}}$ are bound above by a square root of Casimir
scaling, previously found to hold for stringlike solutions of the MIT Bag
Model. The reason behind this similarity is that dYM dynamically realizes, in a
theoretically controlled setting, the main model assumptions of the Bag Model.
We also compare confining strings in dYM and in other four-dimensional theories
with abelian confinement, notably Seiberg-Witten theory, and show that the
unbroken $Z_N$ center symmetry in dYM leads to different properties of
k-strings in the two theories; for example, a ""baryon vertex"" exists in dYM but
not in softly-broken Seiberg-Witten theory. Our results also indicate that, at
large values of N, k-strings in dYM do not become free.

has been shown that $D_T/(v_B^2 \tau_L)$ is universal in some holographic
models as well as condensed matter systems including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) models. We investigate to what extent this relation is universal in the
Q-lattice models with infrared (IR) scaling geometry, focusing on the effect of
spatial anisotropy. Indeed it was shown that $\mathcal{E}_i :=
D_{T,i}/(v_{B,i}^2 \tau_L)$ ($i=x,y$) is determined only by some scaling
exponents of the IR metric in the low temperature limit regardless of the
matter fields and ultraviolet data. Inspired by this observation, in this work,
we find the concrete expressions for $\mathcal{E}_i$ in terms of the critical
dynamical exponents $z_i$ in each direction. By analyzing the IR scaling
geometry we identify the allowed scaling parameter regimes, which enable us to
compute the allowed range of $\mathcal{E}_i$. We find the lower bound of
$\mathcal{E}_i$ is always $1/2$, which is not affected by anisotropy, contrary
to the $\eta/s$ case. However, there may be an upper bound determined by
anisotropy.

classically controlled by differences in electrochemical potential. Applying
this concept to oxides in which interfaces can be polar and cations may adopt a

simple band insulators such as LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. However, many oxides have a
more complex electronic structure, with charge, orbital and/or spin orders
arising from correlations between transition metal and oxygen ions. Strong
correlations thus offer a rich playground to engineer functional interfaces but
their compatibility with the classical band alignment picture remains an open
question. Here we show that beyond differences in electron affinities and polar
effects, a key parameter determining charge transfer at correlated oxide
interfaces is the energy required to alter the covalence of the metaloxygen

charge reconstruction at interfaces with gadolinium titanate GdTiO3. X-ray
absorption spectroscopy shows that the charge transfer is thwarted by
hybridization effects tuned by the rare-earth (R) size. Charge transfer results
in an induced ferromagnetic-like state in the nickelate, exemplifying the
potential of correlated interfaces to design novel phases. Further, our work
clarifies strategies to engineer two-dimensional systems through the control of
both doping and covalence.

image segmentation, yet has proven to be an elusive objective as manual brain
structure tracings have shown more than 10% variability. To improve
reproducibility, lon-gitudinal segmentation (4D) approaches have been
investigated to reconcile tem-poral variations with traditional 3D approaches.
In the past decade, multi-atlas la-bel fusion has become a state-of-the-art
segmentation technique for 3D image and many efforts have been made to adapt it
to a 4D longitudinal fashion. However, the previous methods were either limited
by using application specified energy function (e.g., surface fusion and multi
model fusion) or only considered tem-poral smoothness on two consecutive time
points (t and t+1) under sparsity as-sumption. Therefore, a 4D multi-atlas
label fusion theory for general label fusion purpose and simultaneously
considering temporal consistency on all time points is appealing. Herein, we
propose a novel longitudinal label fusion algorithm, called 4D joint label
fusion (4DJLF), to incorporate the temporal consistency modeling via non-local
patch-intensity covariance models. The advantages of 4DJLF include: (1) 4DJLF
is under the general label fusion framework by simul-taneously incorporating
the spatial and temporal covariance on all longitudinal time points. (2) The
proposed algorithm is a longitudinal generalization of a lead-ing joint label
fusion method (JLF) that has proven adaptable to a wide variety of
applications. (3) The spatial temporal consistency of atlases is modeled in a
prob-abilistic model inspired from both voting based and statistical fusion.
The pro-posed approach improves the consistency of the longitudinal
segmentation while retaining sensitivity compared with original JLF approach
using the same set of atlases. The method is available online in open-source.

Using high resolution quantization theory, the corresponding best achievable

determined in the asymptotic regime of a large number of UAVs. Next, the
dynamic case where the GT density is allowed to vary periodically through time

In general, the tradeoff between the total UAV movement and the achievable

in a discrete-variable setting, i.e., for qubits, offers unit-fidelity

obtain the $L^p$-Sobolev spaces, analyzed previously by Peetre, following an
initial insight by Douady. Peetre found that these $L^p$-Sobolev spaces are
highly degenerate for $0<p<1$. Essentially, the contact is lost between the
function and its derivatives. Here, we analyze this degeneracy for the more
general $L^p$-Carleman classes defined by a weight sequence. Under some
reasonable growth and regularity properties, and a condition on the collection
of test functions, we find that there is a sharp boundary, defined in terms of
the weight sequence: on the one side, we get Douady-Peetre's phenomenon of
""disconnexion"" between the function and its derivatives, while on the other, we
obtain a collection of highly smooth functions. We also look at the more
standard second phase transition, between non-quasianalyticity and
quasianalyticity, in the $L^p$ setting, with $0<p<1$.

estimating the corresponding matter distribution in lensing galaxies has been
primarily performed by maximum likelihood modeling of observations. This is
typically a time and resource-consuming procedure, requiring sophisticated
lensing codes, several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum
likelihood model parameters in a computationally expensive process with
downhill optimizers. Accurate analysis of a single lens can take up to a few
weeks and requires the attention of dedicated experts. Tens of thousands of new
lenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming generation of ground and
space surveys, the analysis of which can be a challenging task. Here we report
the use of deep convolutional neural networks to accurately estimate lensing
parameters in an extremely fast and automated way, circumventing the
difficulties faced by maximum likelihood methods. We also show that lens
removal can be made fast and automated using Independent Component Analysis of
multi-filter imaging data. Our networks can recover the parameters of the
Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid density profile, commonly used to model strong
lensing systems, with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of
sophisticated models, but about ten million times faster: 100 systems in
approximately 1s on a single graphics processing unit. These networks can
provide a way for non-experts to obtain lensing parameter estimates for large
samples of data. Our results suggest that neural networks can be a powerful and
fast alternative to maximum likelihood procedures commonly used in
astrophysics, radically transforming the traditional methods of data reduction
and analysis.

first, when dark energy does not exhibit fluctuations on cluster scales, and
second, when dark energy inside the overdense region collapses similar to dark
matter. Using the Sheth-Tormen and Reed mass functions, we investigate the
abundance of dark matter halos in the framework of agegraphic dark energy
cosmologies. The model parameter $\alpha$ is a crucial parameter in order to
count the abundance of dark matter halos. Specifically, the present analysis
suggests that the agegraphic dark energy model with bigger (smaller) value of
$\alpha$ predicts less (more) virialized halos with respect to that of
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We also show that in agegraphic dark energy models, the
number of halos strongly depends on clustered or uniformed distributions of

paper proposes CirCNN, a principled approach to represent weights and process

computational complexity (both in inference and training) from O(n2) to
O(nlogn) and the storage complexity from O(n2) to O(n), with negligible

mathematical rigor: it can converge to the same effectiveness as DNNs without

for analysis of concurrent processes, parametrized systems, and they are also
used as abstract models for programs for bounds analysis. While termination is
the basic liveness property that asks the qualitative question of whether a
given model always terminates or not, the more general quantitative question
asks for bounds on the number of steps to termination. In the realm of
quantitative bounds a fundamental problem is to obtain asymptotic bounds on
termination time. Large asymptotic bounds such as exponential or higher already
suggest that either there is some error in modeling, or the model is not useful
in practice. Hence we focus on polynomial asymptotic bounds for VASS. While
some well-known approaches (e.g., lexicographic ranking functions) are neither
sound nor complete with respect to polynomial bounds, other approaches only
present sound methods for upper bounds. In this work our main contributions are
as follows: First, for linear asymptotic bounds we present a sound and complete
method for VASS, and moreover, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. Second,
we classify VASS according the normals of the vectors of the cycles. We show
that singularities in the normal are the key reason for asymptotic bounds such
as exponential and non-elementary for VASS. In absence of singularities, we
show that the asymptotic complexity bound is always polynomial and of the form
${\Theta}(n^k)$, for some k $\leq$ d. We present an algorithm, with time
complexity polynomial in the size of the VASS and exponential in dimension d,

reside in several places simultaneously? These questions lie at the heart of
this paper which presents an updated survey of some important stages in the
evolution of the three-boxes paradox, as well as novel conclusions drawn from
it. We begin with the original thought experiment of Aharonov and Vaidman, and
proceed to its non-counterfactual version. The latter was recently realized by
Okamoto and Takeuchi using a quantum router. We then outline a dynamic version
of this experiment, where a particle is shown to ""disappear"" and ""re-appear""
during the time evolution of the system. This surprising prediction based on
self-cancellation of weak values is directly related to our notion of Quantum
Oblivion. Finally, we present the non-counterfactual version of this
disappearing-reappearing experiment. Within the near future, this last version
of the experiment is likely to be realized in the lab, proving the existence of
exotic hitherto unknown forms of superposition. With the aid of Bell's theorem,
we prove the inherent nonlocality and nontemporality underlying such pre- and
post-selected systems, rendering anomalous weak values ontologically real.

nations in terms of STEM education and training. Furthermore, many economic
forecasts predict a rising shortage of domestic STEM-trained professions in the
US for years to come. One potential solution to this deficit is to decrease the
rates at which students leave STEM-related fields in higher education, as
currently over half of all students intending to graduate with a STEM degree
eventually attrite. However, little quantitative research at scale has looked
at causes of STEM attrition, let alone the use of machine learning to examine
how well this phenomenon can be predicted. In this paper, we detail our efforts
to model and predict dropout from STEM fields using one of the largest known
datasets used for research on students at a traditional campus setting. Our
results suggest that attrition from STEM fields can be accurately predicted
with data that is routinely collected at universities using only information on
students' first academic year. We also propose a method to model student STEM
intentions for each academic term to better understand the timing of STEM
attrition events. We believe these results show great promise in using machine
learning to improve STEM retention in traditional and non-traditional campus

a communication channel where the input sub-word probabilities convey the
information about the output HMM state sequence. The quality of the acoustic
model is thus quantified in terms of the information transmitted through this
channel. The process of inferring the most likely HMM state sequence from the
sub-word probabilities is known as decoding. HMM based decoding assumes that an
acoustic model yields accurate state-level probabilities and the data
distribution given the underlying hidden state is independent of any other
state in the sequence. We quantify 1) the acoustic model accuracy and 2) its
robustness to mismatch between data and the HMM conditional independence
assumption in terms of some mutual information quantities. In this context,
exploiting deep neural network (DNN) posterior probabilities leads to a simple
and straightforward analysis framework to assess shortcomings of the acoustic
model for HMM based decoding. This analysis enables us to evaluate the Gaussian
mixture acoustic model (GMM) and the importance of many hidden layers in DNNs
without any need of explicit speech recognition. In addition, it sheds light on
the contribution of low-dimensional models to enhance acoustic modeling for
better compliance with the HMM based decoding requirements.

of direct coupling between polarization and magnetization are known, and it is
unclear whether they can be useful to the design of novel spintronic devices
exploiting the control of magnetization by electric fields. For instance, the
typical bi-quadratic coupling only allows to change the magnitude of the
magnetization by an electric field, but it does not permit an
electric-field-induced switching of the magnetization. Similarly, the so-called
Lifshitz invariants allow an electric-field control of complicated magnetic
orderings, but not of the magnetization. Here, we report the discovery of novel
direct couplings between polarization and magnetization in epitaxial perovskite
films, via the use of first-principles methods and the development of an
original Landau-type phenomenological theory. Our results feature penta-linear
interactions involving the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic vectors as well
as the polar distortions and oxygen octahedral tilting, and permit a number of
striking effects. Examples include a continuous electric-field control of the
magnetization magnitude and sign, and the discrete switching of the
magnetization magnitude. Thus, the high-order, penta-linear couplings
demonstrated in this work may open new paths towards novel magneto-electric

the non-Euclidean geometry. If $G$ is a closed subgroup in the orthogonal group
such that the orbit of a single Euclidean unit vector does not cover the
(Euclidean) unit sphere centered at the origin then there always exists a
non-Euclidean Minkowski functional such that the elements of $G$ preserve the
Minkowskian length of vectors. In other words the Minkowski geometry is an
alternative of the Euclidean geometry for the subgroup $G$. It is rich of
isometries if $G$ is ""close enough"" to the orthogonal group or at least to one
of its transitive subgroups. The measure of non-transitivity is related to the
Hausdorff distances of the orbits under the elements of $G$ to the Euclidean
sphere. Its maximum/minimum belongs to the so-called lazy/busy orbits, i.e.
they are the solutions of an optimization problem on the Euclidean sphere. The
extremal distances allow us to characterize the reducible/irreducible
subgroups. We also formulate an upper and a lower bound for the ratio of the
extremal distances.
  As another application of the analytic tools we introduce the rank of a
closed non-transitive group $G$. We shall see that if $G$ is of maximal rank
then it is finite or reducible. Since the reducible and the finite subgroups
form two natural prototypes of non-transitive subgroups, the rank seems to be a
fundamental notion in their characterization. Closed, non-transitive groups of
rank $n-1$ will be also characterized. Using the general results we classify
all their possible types in lower dimensional cases $n=2, 3$ and $4$.
  Finally we present some applications of the results to the holonomy group of
a metric linear connection on a connected Riemannian manifold.
