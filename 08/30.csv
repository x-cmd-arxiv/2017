extreme starforming engines in the universe, producing stars over ~100 Myr. The
star formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 100 $M_\odot$ per year,
require large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be delivered to their cores,
despite strong feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei. Starburst
galaxies are therefore ideal targets to unravel the critical interplay between
this feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH$^+$, is a
most useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas
without supra-thermal energy input, so its presence highlights dissipation of
mechanical energy or strong UV irradiation. Here, we report the detection of
CH$^+$(J=1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed
starburst galaxies at redshifts z~2.5. This line has such a high critical
density for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense ($>10^5$
cm$^{-3}$) gas, and is absorbed in low-density gas. We find that the CH$^+$
emission lines, which are broader than 1000 km s$^{-1}$, originate in dense
shock waves powered by hot galactic winds. The CH$^+$ absorption lines reveal
highly turbulent reservoirs of cool ($T\sim 100$K), low-density gas, extending
far outside (>10 kpc) the starburst cores (radii <1 kpc). We show that the
galactic winds sustain turbulence in the 10 kpc-scale environments of the
starburst cores, processing these environments into multi-phase,
gravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow rates are found to
be insufficient to balance the star formation rates. Another mass input is
therefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by on-going
mergers or cold stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic feedback,
coupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase instead
of quenching it.

single-shot readout of the SiV$^-$ spin with 89% fidelity. Coherent control of

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of massive protostars. The model grid is
based on the paradigm of core accretion theory for massive star formation with
pre-assembled gravitationally-bound cores as initial conditions. In particular,
following the Turbulent Core Model, initial core properties are set primarily
by their mass and the pressure of their ambient clump. We then model the
evolution of the protostar and its surround structures in a self-consistent
way. The model grid contains about 9000 SEDs with 4 free parameters: initial
core mass, the mean surface density of the environment, the protostellar mass,
and the inclination. The model grid is used to fit observed SEDs via chi^2
minimization, with the foreground extinction additionally estimated. We
demonstrate the fitting process and results using the example of massive
protostar G35.20- 0.74. Compared with other SED model grids currently used for
massive star formation studies, in our model grid, the properties of the
protostar and its surrounding structures are more physically connected, which
reduces the dimensionality of the parameter spaces and the total number of
models. This excludes possible fitting of models that are physically
unrealistic or that are not internally self-consistent in the context of the
Turbulent Core Model. Thus, this model grid serves not only as a fitting tool
to estimate properties of massive protostars, but also as a test of core
accretion theory. The SED model grid is publicly released with this paper.

achieve a physical resolution of $\sim$80 pc for this $2<z<3$ LAE sample,
allowing a detailed characterization of the LAE rest-frame ultraviolet
continuum surface brightness profiles and substructure. We use lens-model
reconstructions of the LAEs to identify and model individual clumps, which we
subsequently use to constrain the parameters of a generative statistical model
of the LAE population. Since the BELLS GALLERY sample is selected primarily on
the basis of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, the LAEs that we study here are likely to
be directly comparable to those selected in wide-field narrow-band LAE surveys,
in contrast with the lensed LAEs identified in cluster lensing fields. We find
an LAE clumpiness fraction of approximately 88%, significantly higher than
found in previous (non-lensing) studies. We find a well-resolved characteristic
clump half-light radii of $\sim$350 pc, a scale comparable to the largest H II
regions seen in the local universe. This statistical characterization of LAE
surface-brightness profiles will be incorporated into future lensing analyses
using the BELLS GALLERY sample to constrain the incidence of dark-matter
substructure in the foreground lensing galaxies.

the worst-case. Feedback control structures are partitioned into two general
classes: stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) and genetic. For the former

between two different moving average (MA) based, two trading range (TR) based,
and one strategy based on historical optimal (HistOpt) trajectories. This paper
also gives a preliminary discussion about how modified dynamic hedging-inspired

present at $T=0$ fragments into two quasiparticle states for finite temperature

at $T_c$, after which it increases towards zero, and at $T\gg T_c$ the polaron
eventually becomes overdamped due to strong scattering with thermally excited

($\sim $6-11 pm) transverse displacements, which suggests that charge-lattice
coupling is strong and hence favors lattice-locked modulations. We further
unearth phase inhomogeneity in the periodic lattice displacements at room
temperature, and emergent phase coherence at 93K. Such local phase variations
not only govern the long range correlations of the charge-ordered state, but
also results in apparent shifts in the ordering wavevector. These
atomically-resolved observations underscore the importance of lattice coupling
and provide a microscopic explanation for putative ""incommensurate"" order in
hole-doped oxides.

m^{-(1+\alpha)}$ are known to generate condensation effects, in the sense that,
when the exponent $\alpha$ lies in a certain interval, the largest variable in
a sum of $N$ (independent and identically distributed) terms is for large $N$
of the same order as the sum itself. In particular, when the distribution has
infinite mean ($0<\alpha<1$) one finds unconstrained condensation, whereas for
$\alpha>1$ constrained condensation takes places fixing the total mass to a
large enough value $M=\sum_{i=1}^N m_i > M_c$. In both cases, a standard
indicator of the condensation phenomenon is the participation ratio
$Y_k=\langle \sum_i m_i^k / (\sum_i m_i)^k\rangle$ ($k>1$), which takes a
finite value for $N \to \infty$ when condensation occurs. To better understand
the connection between constrained and unconstrained condensation, we study
here the situation when the total mass is fixed to a superextensive value $M
\sim N^{1+\delta}$ ($\delta >0$), hence interpolating between the unconstrained
condensation case (where the typical value of the total mass scales as $M\sim
N^{1/\alpha}$ for $\alpha<1$) and the extensive constrained mass. In particular
we show that for exponents $\alpha<1$ a condensate phase for values $\delta >
\delta_c=1/\alpha-1$ is separated from a homogeneous phase at $\delta <
\delta_c$ by a transition line, $\delta=\delta_c$, where a weak condensation
phenomenon takes place. We focus on the evaluation of the participation ratio
as a generic indicator of condensation, also recalling or presenting results in
the standard cases of unconstrained mass and of fixed extensive mass.

differences between instances using attribute phrases. Attribute phrases
capture distinguishing aspects of an object (e.g., ""propeller on the nose"" or
""door near the wing"" for airplanes) in a compositional manner. Instances within
a category can be described by a set of these phrases and collectively they
span the space of semantic attributes for a category. We collect a large
dataset of such phrases by asking annotators to describe several visual
differences between a pair of instances within a category. We then learn to
describe and ground these phrases to images in the context of a *reference
game* between a speaker and a listener. The goal of a speaker is to describe
attributes of an image that allows the listener to correctly identify it within
a pair. Data collected in a pairwise manner improves the ability of the speaker
to generate, and the ability of the listener to interpret visual descriptions.
Moreover, due to the compositionality of attribute phrases, the trained
listeners can interpret descriptions not seen during training for image
retrieval, and the speakers can generate attribute-based explanations for
differences between previously unseen categories. We also show that embedding
an image into the semantic space of attribute phrases derived from listeners
offers 20% improvement in accuracy over existing attribute-based

period of 16 ms, PSR J0537$-$6910 is the fastest spinning and most energetic

glitch behavior in ways that are inaccessible in other pulsars. We observe a
strong linear correlation between spin frequency glitch magnitude and wait time
to the following glitch. We also find that the post-glitch spin-down recovery
is well described by a single two-component model fit to all glitches for which
we have adequate input data. This consists of an exponential amplitude $A =

distributions $\bar{d}$/$\bar{u}$ near the valence region (Bjorken-x $\approx$
0.1 - 0.3).~Current measurements appear to suggest different high-x behaviors
of these distributions, leading to large uncertainties in global fits. The
charged W cross section ratio (W$^+$/W$^-$) is sensitive to the unpolarized
$u,\;d,\;\bar{u},$ and $\bar{d}$ quark distributions at large $Q^2$ set by the
$W$ mass and could help shed light on this discrepancy. The STAR experiment at
RHIC is well equipped to measure the leptonic decays of W bosons, in the
mid-rapidity range $\left(|\eta| \leq 1 \right)$, produced in proton+proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500/510 GeV. At these kinematics STAR is sensitive

inversions, often driven by strong spin-orbit coupling, result in a state that

symmetry is maintained. More generally, topological states that arise by virtue
of a protecting symmetry have resulted in a flourishing research field on both
the experimental as well as theoretical side of the condensed matter agenda. As
a prime signature topological band insulators can exhibit protected spin
filtered edge states, whose time reversal invariant partner is spatially
separated on the other edge. While these edge states have resultantly been

column density regions in $^{13}$CO(2-1). Our target is a quiescent cloud (PGCC
G282.98-32.40, which we refer to as the ""Planck cold cloud"" or PCC) in the
southern outskirts of the galaxy where star-formation activity is very low and
largely confined to one location. We decompose the cloud into structures using
a dendrogram and apply an identical analysis to matched-resolution cubes of the
30 Doradus molecular cloud (located near intense star formation) for
comparison. Structures in the PCC exhibit roughly 10 times lower surface
density and 5 times lower velocity dispersion than comparably sized structures
in 30 Dor, underscoring the non-universality of molecular cloud properties. In
both clouds, structures with relatively higher surface density lie closer to
simple virial equilibrium, whereas lower surface density structures tend to
exhibit super-virial line widths. In the PCC, relatively high line widths are
found in the vicinity of an infrared source whose properties are consistent
with a luminous young stellar object. More generally, we find that the smallest
resolved structures (""leaves"") of the dendrogram span close to the full range
of line widths observed across all scales. As a result, while the bulk of the
kinetic energy is found on the largest scales, the small-scale energetics tend
to be dominated by only a few structures, leading to substantial scatter in
observed size-linewidth relationships.

the flow around a 180-degree sharp bend to infinitesimal 3D disturbances using
a linear stability analysis. The stability analysis predicts that 3D transition
is via a synchronous instability of the steady flows. A highly accurate global
linear stability analysis of the flow was conducted with Reynolds number
$Re<1150$ and bend opening ratio (ratio of bend width to inlet height)
$0.2\leq\beta\leq5$. This range of $Re$ and $\beta$ captures both steady-state
2D flow solutions as well as the inception of unsteady 2D flow. For
$0.2\leq\beta\leq1$, the 2D base flow transitions from steady to unsteady at
higher Reynolds number as $\beta$ increases. The stability analysis shows that
at the onset of instability, the base flow becomes three-dimensionally unstable
in two different modes, namely spanwise oscillating mode for $\beta=0.2$, and
spanwise synchronous mode for $\beta \geq 0.3$. The critical Reynolds number
and the spanwise wavelength of perturbations increase as $\beta$ increases. For
$1<\beta\leq2$ both the critical Reynolds for onset of unsteadiness and the
spanwise wavelength decrease as $\beta$ increases. Finally, for $2<\beta\leq5$,
the critical Reynolds number and spanwise wavelength remain almost constant.
The linear stability analysis also shows that the base flow becomes unstable to
different 3D modes depending on the opening ratio. The modes are found to be
localised near the reattachment point of the first recirculation bubble.

involve applying ideas from quantum information to fundamental physics.
  The first part is focused on examining discrete-time models in quantum
computation (discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata) as
discretized models of relativistic systems. One of the results here is a
theorem demonstrating that a large class of discrete-time quantum walks have
relativistic dynamics in the continuum limit. Additionally, the problem of
fermion doubling for these models is investigated, and it is seen that the
problem can be circumvented in two dimensional space. This was already known
for one dimensional systems.
  Another result involves taking the limits of causal free field theories in
discrete spacetime to recover continuum field theories, something that is not
straightforward because of the nontrivial nature of the vacuum in quantum field
theory. Additionally, it is shown that general systems of fermions evolving
causally in discrete spacetime can be represented by quantum cellular automata,
which makes them efficiently simulable by quantum computers. A related result
is that quantum cellular automata composed of fermions are equivalent to
regular quantum cellular automata.
  In the second part of this thesis, the focus is on the foundations of
statistical physics. The main result of this part is a general bound on the
time it takes a quantum system to effectively reach equilibrium. The discussion
also includes a practical definition of equilibration that takes our
measurement capabilities into account. Finally, the nature of the equilibrium
state is also discussed, with a focus on initial state independence, which
relates to the important question of when the equilibrium state is a Gibbs
state.

that on a plane. The requirement that a condensate wave function be single
valued upon once encircling the cylinder means that such a single vortex cannot
remain stationary. Instead, it acquires one of a series of quantized
translational velocities around the circumference, the simplest being $\pm
\hbar/(2MR)$, with $M$ the mass of the superfluid particles and $R$ the radius
of the cylinder. A generalization to a finite cylinder automatically includes
these quantum-mechanical effects through the pairing of the single vortex and
its image in either the top or bottom end of the surface. The dynamics of a
single vortex on this surface provides a hydrodynamic analog of Laughlin
pumping. The interaction energy for two vortices on an infinite cylinder is
proportional to the classical stream function $\chi({\bf r}_{12})$, and it
crosses over from logarithmic to linear when the intervortex separation ${\bf
r}_{12}$ becomes larger than the cylinder radius. An Appendix summarizes the
connection to an earlier study of Ho and Huang for one or more vortices on an

Datamaran automatically identifies field and record endpoints, separates the
structured parts from the unstructured noise or formatting, and can tease apart
multiple structures from within a dataset, in order to efficiently extract
structured relational datasets from semi-structured log datasets, at scale with
high accuracy. Compared to other unsupervised log dataset extraction tools
developed in prior work, Datamaran does not require the record boundaries to be
known beforehand, making it much more applicable to the noisy log files that
are ubiquitous in data lakes. Datamaran can successfully extract structured
information from all datasets used in prior work, and can achieve 95%
extraction accuracy on automatically collected log datasets from GitHub - a
substantial 66% increase of accuracy compared to unsupervised schemes from
prior work. Our user study further demonstrates that the extraction results of

measured and model-predicted abundances of He, C and N in a sample of 35
well-observed Galactic planetary nebulae (PN). All observations, data
reductions, and abundance determinations were performed in house to ensure
maximum homogeneity. Progenitor star masses (M < 4M_sun) were inferred using
two published sets of post-AGB model tracks and L and T_eff values. We conclude
the following: 1) the mean values of N/O across the progenitor mass range
exceeds the solar value, indicating significant N enrichment in the majority of
our objects; 2) the onset of hot bottom burning appears to begin around 2 solar
masses, i.e., lower than ~5 M_sun implied by theory; 3) most of our objects
show a clear He enrichment, as expected from dredge-up episodes; 4) the average
sample C/O value is 1.23, consistent with the effects of third dredge-up; and
5) model grids used to compare to observations successfully span the
distribution over metallicity space of all C/O and many He/H data points but
mostly fail to do so in the case of N/O. The evident enrichment of N in PN and
the general discrepancy between the observed and model-predicted N/O abundance
ratios signal the need for extra-mixing as an effect of rotation and/or
thermohaline mixing in the models. The unexpectedly high N enrichment that is
implied here for low mass stars, if confirmed, will likely impact our
conclusions about the source of N in the Universe.

oscillons can be produced in string cosmology and illustrate their production
and potential phenomenology with two explicit examples: the case of an
initially displaced volume modulus in the KKLT scenario and the case of a
displaced blow-up Kaehler modulus in the Large Volume Scenario (LVS). One, in
principle, observable consequence of oscillon dynamics is the production of
gravitational waves which, contrary to those produced from preheating after
high scale inflation, could have lower frequencies, closer to the currently
observable range. We also show that, for the considered parameter ranges,
oscillating fibre and volume moduli do not develop any significant
non-perturbative dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the vacua in the LVS and
the KKLT scenario are stable against local overshootings of the field into the
decompatification region, which provides an additional check on the longevity

low-temperature behavior of the physical heat capacity, and thus provide a
useful probe of gapless bulk or edge excitations of the system. Assuming a
power-law scaling of the COE with an exponent $\alpha$ at low fictitious
temperatures, we derive an analytical formula for the distribution function of
the RDM eigenvalues. We numerically test the effectiveness of the formula in
relativistic free scalar boson in two spatial dimensions, and find that the
distribution function can detect the expected $\alpha=3$ scaling of the COE
much more efficiently than the raw data of the COE. We also calculate the
distribution function in the ground state of the half-filled Landau level with

distribution of tilt angles ($\chi$) between the spin and magnetic axes in
young pulsars. Under the hypothesis that the NS shape is determined by the
magnetically-induced deformation, and that the toroidal component of the
internal magnetic field exceeds the poloidal one, we show that the dissipation
of precessional motions by bulk viscosity can naturally produce a bi-modal
distribution of tilt angles, as observed in radio/$\gamma$-ray pulsars, with a
low probability of achieving $\chi \sim (20^\circ - 70^\circ)$ if the interior
B-field is $\sim (10^{11} - 10^{15})$~G and the birth spin period is $\sim 10 -
300$~ms. As a corollary of the model, the idea that the NS shape is solely
determined by the poloidal magnetic field, or by the centrifugal deformation of
the crust, is found to be inconsistent with the tilt angle distribution in
young pulsars. When applied to the Crab pulsar, with $\chi \sim 45^\circ -
70^\circ$ and birth spin $\sim$ 20 ms, our model implies that: (i) the
magnetically-induced ellipticity is $\epsilon_B \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-6}$; (ii)
the measured positive $\dot{\chi} \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-12}$ rad s$^{-1}$
requires an additional viscous process, acting on a timescale $\lesssim 10^4$
yrs. We interpret the latter as crust-core coupling via mutual friction in the
superfluid NS interior. One critical implication of our model is a GW signal at

experimental reach of these target materials. We find that Dirac materials can
play a crucial role in detecting dark matter in the keV to MeV mass range that
scatters with electrons via a kinetically mixed dark photon, as the dark photon
does not develop an in-medium effective mass. The same target materials provide
excellent sensitivity to absorption of light bosonic dark matter in the meV to

vertex constraint in a tensor, the total number of solutions compatible with

contraction of a tensor network. We introduce an iterative
compression-decimation (ICD) scheme that performs this contraction efficiently.
The ICD algorithm first propagates local constraints to longer ranges via
repeated contraction-decomposition sweeps over all lattice bonds, thus
achieving compression on a given length scale. It then decimates the lattice
via coarse-graining tensor contractions. Repeated iterations of these two steps
gradually collapse the tensor network and ultimately yield the exact tensor
trace for large systems, without the need for manual control of tensor
dimensions. Our protocol allows us to obtain the exact number of solutions for
computations where a naive enumeration would take astronomically long times.

many-body physics in driven-dissipative systems. Single-mode cavities provide
strong, infinite-range photon-mediated interactions among intracavity atoms.
However, these global all-to-all couplings are limiting from the perspective of
exploring quantum many-body physics beyond the mean-field approximation. The
present work demonstrates that local couplings can be created using multimode
cavity QED. This is established through measurements of the threshold of a
superradiant, self-organization phase transition versus atomic position.
Specifically, we experimentally show that the interference of near-degenerate
cavity modes leads to both a strong and tunable-range interaction between
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped within the cavity. We exploit the
symmetry of a confocal cavity to measure the interaction between real BECs and
their virtual images without unwanted contributions arising from the merger of
real BECs. Atom-atom coupling may be tuned from short range to long range. This
capability paves the way toward future explorations of exotic, strongly
correlated systems such as quantum liquid crystals and driven-dissipative spin
glasses.

four possible models for Chariklo (sphere, Maclaurin spheroid, tri-axial
ellipsoid and Jacobi ellipsoid) and we use a Bayesian approach to estimate the
corresponding parameters. The spherical model has a radius $R=129\pm3$ km. The
Maclaurin model has equatorial and polar radii $a=b=143^{+3}_{-6}$ km and
$c=96^{+14}_{-4}$ km, respectively, with density $970^{+300}_{-180}$ kg
m$^{-3}$. The ellipsoidal model has semiaxes $a=148^{+6}_{-4}$ km,
$b=132^{+6}_{-5}$ km and $c=102^{+10}_{-8}$ km. Finally, the Jacobi model has
semiaxes $a$=157$\pm$4 km, $b$=139$\pm$ 4 km and $c$=86$\pm$1 km, and density
$796^{+2}_{-4}$ kg m$^{-3}$ . Depending on the model, we obtain topographic
features of 6-11 km, typical of Saturn icy satellites with similar size and

4.9\% (ellipsoid), while the ring $I/F$ reflectivity is less constrained
between 0.6\% (Jacobi) and 8.9\% (sphere). The ellipsoid model explains both
the optical light curve and the long-term photometry variation of the system,
giving a plausible value for the geometric albedo of the ring particles of
$10-15\%$. The derived Chariklo's mass of 6-8$\times10^{18}$ kg places the
rings close to the 3:1 resonance between the ring mean motion and Chariklo's

structure of the molecular gas in the central galaxy of the cluster Abell 1795.
The molecular gas lies in two filaments that extend 5 - 7 kpc to the N and S
from the nucleus and project exclusively around the outer edges of two inner
radio bubbles. Radio jets launched by the central AGN have inflated bubbles
filled with relativistic plasma into the hot atmosphere surrounding the central
galaxy. The N filament has a smoothly increasing velocity gradient along its
length from the central galaxy's systemic velocity at the nucleus to -370 km/s,
the average velocity of the surrounding galaxies, at the furthest extent. The S
filament has a similarly smooth but shallower velocity gradient and appears to
have partially collapsed in a burst of star formation. The close spatial
association with the radio lobes, together with the ordered velocity gradients
and narrow velocity dispersions, show that the molecular filaments are gas
flows entrained by the expanding radio bubbles. Assuming a Galactic
$X_{\mathrm{CO}}$ factor, the total molecular gas mass is
$3.2\pm0.2\times10^{9}$M$_{\odot}$. More than half lies above the N radio
bubble. Lifting the molecular clouds appears to require an infeasibly efficient
coupling between the molecular gas and the radio bubble. The energy required
also exceeds the mechanical power of the N radio bubble by a factor of two.
Stimulated feedback, where the radio bubbles lift low entropy X-ray gas that
becomes thermally unstable and rapidly cools in situ, provides a plausible
model. Multiple generations of radio bubbles are required to lift this
substantial gas mass. The close morphological association then indicates that
the cold gas either moulds the newly expanding bubbles or is itself pushed
aside and shaped as they inflate.

to investigate the kinematics and spatial distributions of dust emission (870
$\mu$m continuum), $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2), strong optical emission lines, and
visible stars. Dynamical modelling of the optical emission lines suggests that
ALESS67.1 is not a pure rotating disk but a merger, consistent with the
apparent tidal features revealed in the HST imaging. Our sub-arcsecond
resolution dataset allow us to measure half-light radii for all the tracers,
and we find a factor of 4-6 smaller sizes in dust continuum compared to all the
other tracers, including $^{12}$CO, and UV and H$\alpha$ emission is
significantly offset from the dust continuum. The spatial mismatch between UV
continuum and the cold dust and gas reservoir supports the explanation that
geometrical effects are responsible for the offset of dusty galaxy on the
IRX-$\beta$ diagram. Using a dynamical method we derive an $\alpha_{\rm
CO}=1.8\pm1.0$, consistent with other SMGs that also have resolved CO and dust
measurements. Assuming a single $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ value we also derive resolved
gas and star-formation rate surface densities, and find that the core region of
the galaxy ($\lesssim5$ kpc) follows the trend of mergers on the
Schmidt-Kennicutt relationship, whereas the outskirts ($\gtrsim5$ kpc) lie on
the locus of normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting different star-formation
efficiencies within one galaxy. Our results caution against using single size
or morphology for different tracers of the star-formation activity and gas
content of galaxies, and therefore argue the need to use spatially-resolved,
multi-wavelength observations to interpret the properties of SMGs, and perhaps
even for $z>1$ galaxies in general.

transiting planets close to the star, as well as occurring during in-situ
formation of such planets from embryos. Previous N-body studies of instability
amongst transiting planets have assumed that collisions result in perfect
merging. Here, we explore the effects of implementing a more realistic
collision prescription on the outcomes of instability and in-situ formation at
orbital radii of a few tenths of an au. There is a strong effect on the outcome
of the growth of planetary embryos, so long as the debris thrown off in
collisions is rapidly removed from the system (which happens by collisional
processing to dust, and then removal by radiation forces) and embryos are small
($< 0.1\mathrm{\,M}_\oplus$). If this is the case, then systems form fewer
detectable ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{\,M}_\oplus$) planets than systems evolved under
the assumption of perfect merging in collisions. This provides some
contribution to the ""Kepler Dichotomy"": the observed over-abundance of
single-planet systems. The effects of changing the collision prescription on
unstable mature systems of super-Earths are less pronounced. Perfect mergers
only account for a minority of collision outcomes in such systems, but most
collisions resulting in mass loss are grazing impacts in which only a few per
cent. of mass is lost. As a result, there is little impact on the final masses
and multiplicities of the systems after instability when compared to systems
evolved under the assumption that collisions always result in perfect merging.

Predictions for haloes are based on the non-local bias model, employing linear
($b_1$) and non-linear ($c_2$, $g_2$) bias parameters, which have been
constrained previously from the bispectrum in Fourier space. We also study
predictions from two other bias models, one local ($g_2=0$) and one in which
$c_2$ and $g_2$ are determined by $b_1$ via an approximately universal
relation. Overall, measurements and predictions agree when $Q$ is derived for
triangles with $(r_1r_2r_3)^{1/3} \gtrsim 60 h^{-1}\text{Mpc}$, where $r_{1-3}$
are the sizes of the triangle legs. Predictions for $Q_{matter}$, based on the
linear power spectrum, show significant deviations from the measurements at the
BAO scale (given our small measurement errors), which strongly decrease when
adding a damping term or using the non-linear power spectrum, as expected.
Predictions for $Q_{halo}$ agree best with measurements at large scales when
considering non-local contributions. The universal bias model works well for
haloes and might therefore be also useful for tightening constraints on $b_1$
from $Q$ in galaxy surveys. Such constraints are independent of the amplitude
of matter density fluctuation ($\sigma_8$) and hence break the degeneracy
between $b_1$ and $\sigma_8$, present in galaxy two-point correlations.

we estimate metallicities for each cluster in the sample. We find that the
abundance gradient in the inner regions of M83 is flat, with a central
metallicity of [Z] = 0.21$\pm$0.11 relative to a Solar value of
$Z_\odot$=0.014, which is in excellent agreement with the results from an
analysis of luminous hot stars in the same regions. Compiling this latest study
with our other recent work, we construct a mass-metallicity relation for nearby
galaxies based entirely on the analysis of RSGs. We find excellent agreement
with the other stellar-based technique, that of blue supergiants, as well as
with temperature-sensitive (`auroral' or `direct') \hii-region studies. Of all
the HII-region strong-line calibrations, those which are empirically calibrated
to direct-method studies (N2 and O3N2) provide the most consistent results.

solution of Boolean truth tables ""in reverse,"" i.e., it is able to satisfy the
logical proposition of gates regardless to which terminal(s) the truth value is
assigned (""terminal-agnostic logic""). It can be realized if time non-locality
(memory) is present. A practical realization of self-organizing logic gates
(SOLGs) can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory. By
employing one such realization, we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit
elementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons are classical
trajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and
connect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear
analysis at those points, we show that these instantons connect the initial
critical point of the dynamics, with at least one unstable direction, directly
to the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these gates
only affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution.
Finally, we demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential
equations, that since instantons connect critical points, noise and
perturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space, but not
the initial and final critical points. Therefore, even for extremely large
noise levels, the gates self-organize to the correct solution. Our work
provides a physical understanding of, and can serve as an inspiration for, new
models of bi-directional logic gates that are emerging as important tools in
physics-inspired, unconventional computing.

This theorem demonstrates the existence of one-to-one mappings between particle

quantities, and quantify how far apart in metric space the approximated and
exact ones are. We apply our method to the one-dimensional Hubbard model for
different types of external potentials, and assess its validity on one of the
most used approximations in density-functional theory, the local density
approximation (LDA). We find that the potential distance may have a very
different behaviour from the density and wave function distances, in some cases
even providing the wrong assessments of the LDA performance trends. We
attribute this to the systems reaching behaviours which are borderline for the
applicability of the one-to-one correspondence between density and external
potential. On the contrary the wave function and density distances behave
similarly and are always sensitive to system variations. Our metric-based
method correctly predicts the regimes where the LDA performs fairly well and
the regimes where it fails. This suggests that our method could be a practical
tool for testing the efficiency of density-functional approximations.

compared with the theoretical predictions of the linearized theory. For small
Mach numbers up to $M_s \sim 0.1$ we find that both results are in good

significant. In particular, many initial conditions that look stable according

transition is a smooth crossover, violent fluid motions are not expected. Thus,

observations performed in the z=0.89 absorber toward the lensed quasar PKS
1830-211 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Two
independent lines of sight were observed, to the southwest (SW) and northeast
(NE) images of the quasar, with OPR values found to be $3.15 \pm 0.13$ and $3.1
\pm 0.5$ in each region, respectively, in agreement with a spin statistical
weight of 3:1. An OPR of 3:1 for a molecule containing two identical hydrogen
nuclei can refer to either a statistical result or a high-temperature limit
depending on the reaction mechanism leading to its formation. It is thus
crucial to identify rigorously how OPRs are produced in order to constrain the
information that these probes can provide. To understand the production of the
H$_2$Cl$^+$ OPR, we undertook a careful theoretical study of the reaction
mechanisms involved with the aid of quasi-classical trajectory calculations on
a new global potential energy surface fit to a large number of high-level ab
initio data. Our study shows that the major formation reaction for H$_2$Cl$^+$
produces this ion via a hydrogen abstraction rather than a scrambling
mechanism. Such a mechanism leads to a 3:1 OPR, which is not changed by
destruction and possible thermalization reactions for H$_2$Cl$^+$ and is thus
likely to be the cause of observed 3:1 OPR ratios, contrary to the normal
assumption of scrambling.

$\approx 10M_\odot$ black hole. The recent detection of black hole mergers by
the gravitational wave detector ALIGO indicates that black holes with masses $>
10 M_\odot$ do indeed exist. Motivated by this, we explore a scenario where
ULXs consist of black holes formed by the collapse of high-mass,
low-metallicity stars, and that these ULXs become binary black holes (BBHs)
that eventually merge. We use empirical relations between the number of ULXs
and the star formation rate and host galaxy metallicity to estimate the ULX
formation rate and the BBH merger rate at all redshifts. This assumes the ULX
rate is directly proportional to the star formation rate for a given
metallicity, and that the black hole accretion rate is distributed as a
log-normal distribution. We include an enhancement in the ULX formation rate at
earlier epochs due to lower mean metallicities. With simplified assumptions,
our model is able to reproduce both the rate and mass distribution of BBH
mergers in the nearby universe inferred from the detection of GW 150914, LVT
151012, GW 151226, and GW 170104 by ALIGO if the peak accretion rate of ULXs is
a factor $\approx$1 --- 300 greater than the Eddington rate. Our predictions of
the BBH merger rate, mass distribution, and redshift evolution can be tested by
ALIGO in the near future, which in turn can be used to explore connections
between the ULX formation and BBH merger rates over cosmic time.

calls for pricing decisions that intelligently trade off between maximizing

However, making a graph highly sparse can split the graph into several
disconnected components, leading to several separate networks. The main
difficulty is that connectedness is often treated as a combinatorial property,
making it hard to enforce in e.g. convex optimization problems. In this

analytical property and can be enforced as a convex constraint. We especially
show how the constraint relates to the distributed consensus problem and graph

explanation for this disparity wherein the likelihood of formation of a given
polymorph under near-equilibrium conditions can be estimated on the basis of
mean field isothermal-isobaric (N, p, T) ensemble statistics. The probability
that a polymorph will be experimentally realized is shown to depend upon both
the hypervolume of that structure's potential energy basin of attraction and a
Boltzmann factor weight containing the polymorph's potential enthalpy per

parameters. Even without building an explicit state-space plant model, our
novel approach still allows the filter gain design for stabilization and
suboptimal $\mathcal{H}_2$ performance. This design freedom cannot be achieved
by other existing data-driven fault estimation filter designs so far. Another
benefit of our proposed design is the convenience of determining the state
order: a higher state order of the filter leads to better estimation
performance, at the cost of heavier computational burden. In contrast, order
determination is cumbersome when using an identified state-space plant model
for the filter design, because of the complicated propagation of the model
mismatch into the fault estimation errors. Simulations using an unstable
aircraft system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new method.

survey, we present the characterization of JO204, a jellyfish galaxy in A957, a
relatively low-mass cluster with $M=4.4 \times10^{14}M_\odot$. This galaxy
shows a tail of ionized gas that extends up to 30 kpc from the main body in the
opposite direction of the cluster center. No gas emission is detected in the
galaxy outer disk, suggesting that gas stripping is proceeding outside-in. The
stellar component is distributed as a regular disk galaxy; the stellar
kinematics shows a symmetric rotation curve with a maximum radial velocity of
200km/s out to 20 kpc from the galaxy center. The radial velocity of the gas
component in the central part of the disk follows the distribution of the
stellar component; the gas kinematics in the tail retains the rotation of the
galaxy disk, indicating that JO204 is moving at high speed in the intracluster
medium. Both the emission and radial velocity maps of the gas and stellar
components indicate ram-pressure as the most likely primary mechanism for gas
stripping, as expected given that JO204 is close to the cluster center and it
is likely at the first infall in the cluster. The spatially resolved star
formation history of JO204 provides evidence that the onset of ram-pressure
stripping occurred in the last 500 Myr, quenching the star formation activity
in the outer disk, where the gas has been already completely stripped. Our
conclusions are supported by a set of hydrodynamic simulations.

(usually gas), they give rise to highly energetic phenomena named Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). A number of physical processes have been proposed to
account for the funneling of gas towards the galaxy centers to feed the AGN.
There are also several physical processes that can strip gas from a galaxy, and
one of them is ram pressure stripping in galaxy clusters due to the hot and
dense gas filling the space between galaxies. We report the discovery of a
strong connection between severe ram pressure stripping and the presence of AGN
activity. Searching in galaxy clusters at low redshift, we have selected the
most extreme examples of jellyfish galaxies, which are galaxies with long
tentacles of material extending for dozens of kpc beyond the galaxy disk. Using
the MUSE spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, we find that 6 out of
the 7 galaxies of this sample host a central AGN, and two of them also have
galactic-scale AGN ionization cones. The high incidence of AGN among the most
striking jellyfishes may be due to ram pressure causing gas to flow towards the
center and triggering the AGN activity, or to an enhancement of the stripping
caused by AGN energy injection, or both. Our analysis of the galaxy position
and velocity relative to the cluster strongly supports the first hypothesis,
and puts forward ram pressure as another, yet unforeseen, possible mechanism
for feeding the central supermassive black hole with gas.

and is part of a poor group. Exploiting the exquisite quality of the MUSE/VLT
data, we present the spatially resolved kinematics and physical properties of
gas and stars of this object and describe its evolutionary history. An old
(luminosity weighted age ~2x10^9yr), gas poor, early-type-like galaxy is
merging with a younger (luminosity weighted age ~2.5x10^8 yr), gas rich,
late-type galaxy . The system has a quite strong metallicity gradient,
indicative of an early-stage phase. Comparing the spatial extension of the star
formation at different epochs, we date the beginning of the merger between
~10^7 yr<t<5.7x10^8 yr ago. The gas kinematic pattern reflects that of the
late-type object and is distorted in correspondence to the location of the
impact. The stellar kinematic instead is more chaotic, as expected for mergers.
The gas redistribution in the system induces high levels of star formation
between the two components, where we indeed detect the birth of the TDG. This
stellar structure has a mass of ~6x10^9 M_sun, a radius of ~2 kpc and, even
though it has already accreted large quantities of gas and stars, it is still
located within the disk of the progenitor, is characterized by a high velocity
dispersion, indicating that it is still forming, is dusty and has high levels
of star formation SFR~0.3 M_sun/yr). This TDG is originated in an early-stage
merger, while these structures usually form in more evolved systems.

signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches,
constitute evidences of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro
studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some
specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a
basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack
of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous
avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches.
Here we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling
exponent $\beta$ of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a
neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). We find
that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and
tends to the value $\beta = 1$ for a percentage of about 30%. More
specifically, $\beta$ is close to $2$, namely brownian noise, for purely
excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval $[1,1.4]$ as
the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20 and 30%, in agreement
with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition
affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the
analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological
conditions.

  Wavefront Sensor at Low Strehl Ratio","9 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most adaptive optics (AO) systems using pyramid wavefront sensors (PyWFS) to
estimate the phase of the pupil field use mechanical modulation of the beam in
order to increase the dynamic range in low-order modes so the PyWFS can
usefully operate at low Strehl ratio. The tradeoff for this approach is reduced
sensitivity, which, in turn, makes it difficult to attain a high Strehl ratio
once the loop has been closed. We propose an algorithm that increases the
dynamic range of the PyWFS without modulation. The proposed algorithm achieves
this in two ways: 1) it allows the PyWFS to be treated with any desired optical
modeling algorithms, and 2) it employs Newton's method for nonlinear
optimization to create an estimator that is more accurate than the
corresponding linear estimator. Numerical simulations show that nonlinear
optimization can make more accurate estimates of the phase of the wavefront
than the corresponding linear estimator for Strehl ratios of the input beam
that are greater than about 0.2. As the input Strehl ratio increases, so does
the advantage of the nonlinear estimator over the linear one. For example, when
the input beam had a Strehl ratio of 0.4 (corresponding to a standard deviation
of the phase of about 0.96 radians), the linear estimator error had a standard
deviation of about 0.65 radians, while the nonlinear estimator error had a
standard deviation of about 0.27 radians (this depends only weakly on the noise
level, assuming there is enough signal for the PyWFS to work in the linear
regime). The new algorithm can be implemented in massively parallel modes,
since the required calculations have almost no inter-dependencies. It is
suggested that the required computations can be performed quickly enough for
the purposes of AO on modern computer systems.

density environment. We interpret this trend as a pure environmental effect,
independent of the mass bias, due to a slower galaxy build-up in the rarefied
regions of voids. We confirm previous findings about a clear segregation in
galaxy morphology, with galaxies of a later type being found at smaller
void-centric distances with respect to the early-type galaxies. We also show,
for the first time, that the radius of the void has an impact on the
evolutionary history of the galaxies that live within it or in its
surroundings. In fact, an enhanced fraction of late-type galaxies is found in
the proximity of voids larger than the median void radius. Likewise, an excess
of early-type galaxies is observed within or around voids of a smaller size. A
significant difference in galaxy properties in voids of different sizes is
observed up to 2 Rvoid, which we define as the region of influence of voids.
The significance of this difference is greater than 3sigma for all the
volume-complete samples considered here. The fraction of star-forming galaxies
shows the same behavior as the late-type galaxies, but no significant
difference in stellar mass is observed in the proximity of voids of different

significant time impact on digital forensic laboratories in law enforcement.
Backlogs have become commonplace and increasingly more time is spent in the
acquisition and preparation steps of an investigation as opposed to detailed
evidence analysis and reporting. There is generally little room for increasing
digital investigation capacity in law enforcement digital forensic units and
the allocated budgets for these units are often decreasing. In the context of
developing an efficient investigation process, one of the key challenges
amounts to how to achieve more with less. This paper proposes a workflow
management automation framework for handling common digital forensic tools. The
objective is to streamline the digital investigation workflow - enabling more
efficient use of limited hardware and software. The proposed automation
framework reduces the time digital forensic experts waste conducting
time-consuming, though necessary, tasks. The evidence processing time is
decreased through server-side automation resulting in 24/7 evidence
preparation. The proposed framework increases efficiency of use of forensic
software and hardware, reduces the infrastructure costs and license fees, and
simplifies the preparation steps for the digital investigator. The proposed
approach is evaluated in a real-world scenario to evaluate its robustness and

Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with light higgsinos and relatively heavy
electroweak gauginos. In our analysis, we assume that stops decay to higgsinos
via ${\tilde t}_1 \to t {\tilde{Z}}_1$, $\tilde{t}_1 \to t\tilde{Z}_2$ and
$\tilde{t}$$_1 \to b\tilde{W}_1$ with branching fractions in the ratio 1:1:2
(expected if the decay occurs dominantly via the superpotential Yukawa

decays to third generation quarks plus higgsinos. These decay patterns are
motivated by models of natural supersymmetry where higgsinos are expected to be
close in mass to $m_Z$, but gluinos may be as heavy as $5 - 6$ TeV and stops
may have masses up to $\sim 3 $ TeV. We devise cuts to optimize the signals
from stop and gluino pair production at LHC33. We find that experiments at
LHC33 should be able to discover stops with $> 5\sigma$ significance if
$m_{\tilde{t}_1} < 2.3 \ (2.8) \ [3.2]$ TeV for an integrated luminosity of 0.3

at least one of the stop or gluino pair signals even with an integrated
luminosity of 0.3 ab$^{-1}$ for natural SUSY models with no worse than 3%

  Artery via Medial Axis","36 pages, 18 figures, submitted to Journal of Information Fusion",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronary arteries and their branches supply blood to myocardium. The
obstruction of coronary arteries results in significant loss of myocardium,
called acute myocardial infarction, and the number one cause of death globally.
Hence, quantification of the regional amount of heart muscle subtended by
obstructed coronary arteries is of critical value in clinical medicine.
However, the conventional methods are inaccurate and frequently disagree with
clinical practices. This study proposes a novel algorithm to segment regional
myocardium-at-risk subtended by any potentially obstructed coronary artery.
Assuming the geometric triangular mesh models of coronary artery and myocardium
derived from an individual cardiac computed tomography image, the proposed
algorithm performs (i) computation of the medial axis of the coronary artery
and (ii) segmentation of the coronary artery and myocardium using the medial
axis. The algorithm provides the fused segmentation of coronary artery and
myocardium via the medial axis. The computed result provides a robust
mathematical linkage between myocardium-at-risk and supplying coronary arteries
so that ischemic myocardial regions can be accurately identified, and both the
extent and severity of myocardial ischemia can be quantified effectively and
efficiently. Furthermore, the correspondence between segmented coronary artery
and myocardium can be more importantly used for building optimization models of
cardiac systems for various applications. We believe that the proposed
algorithm and implemented VoroHeart program, which is freely available at
http://voronoi.hanyang.ac.kr/software/voroheart, will be an invaluable tool for
patient-specific risk predictions and the treatment of obstructed coronary
artery disease in clinical medicine. The algorithmic accuracy and efficiency
are theoretically asserted and experimentally verified.

  Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share

leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages

completely mixed state. We also study trade-off relations between quantum

topological insulator. It exhibits band inversions at two time reversal
symmetry points of the bulk band which classify it as a weak topological
insulator with metallic states on its (010) 'side' surfaces. Additional mirror
symmetry of the crystal structure concurrently classifies it as a topological
crystalline insulator. Bi2TeI is therefore predicted to host a pair of Dirac
cones protected by time reversal symmetry on its 'side' surfaces and three
pairs of Dirac cones protected by mirror symmetry on its 'top' and 'bottom'
(001) surfaces. We spectroscopically map the top cleaved surface of Bi_2TeI,

dimensional surface states which are susceptible to mirror symmetry breaking,
as well as one dimensional channels that reside along the step edges. Their
mutual coexistence on the step edge where both facets join is facilitated by
momentum and energy segregation. Our observations of a dual topological

hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation have also produced star
clusters with this structure. We argue analytically that this type of mass
distribution arises naturally in the relaxation from a hierarchically-clustered
distribution of stars into a monolithic star cluster through hierarchical
merging. We show that arbitrary initial profiles will tend to converge to a
universal profile under hierarchical merging, owing to phase-space mixing
obeying certain conservation constraints. We perform $N$-body simulations of a
pairwise merger of model star clusters and find that mergers readily produce
the shallow surface brightness profiles observed in young massive clusters.
Finally, we simulate the relaxation of a hierarchically-clustered mass
distribution constructed from an idealized fragmentation model. Assuming only
power-law spatial and kinematic scaling relations, these numerical experiments
are able to reproduce the surface density profiles of observed young massive
star clusters. Thus we provide physical motivation for the structure of young
massive clusters within the paradigm of hierarchical star formation. This has
important implications for the structure of nascent globular clusters.

tuned to repeating spike-patterns concealed in high rates of overall
presynaptic activity. One-shot construction of neurons with synapse weights
calculated as estimates of converged STDP outcomes results in immediate
selective detection of hidden spike-patterns. The capability of continual
learning is demonstrated through the successful one-shot detection of new sets
of spike-patterns introduced after long intervals in the simulation time.
Simulation expansion (Lightheart et al., 2013) has been proposed as an approach
to the development of constructive algorithms that are compatible with
simulations of biological neural networks. A simulation of a biological neural
network may have orders of magnitude fewer neurons and connections than the
related biological neural systems; therefore, simulated neural networks can be
assumed to be a subset of a larger neural system. The constructive algorithm is
developed using simulation expansion concepts to perform an operation
equivalent to the exchange of neurons between the simulation and the larger
hypothetical neural system. The dynamic selection of neurons to simulate within
a larger neural system (hypothetical or stored in memory) may be a starting
point for a wide range of developments and applications in machine learning and

$Z=0.169^{+0.164+0.009+0.018 }_{-0.150-0.004-0.015 }$ solar, where the first,
second, and third errors are statistical, cosmic X-ray background systematic,
and non X-ray background systematic, respectively, at the virial radius in the
filament, our results are still consistent with the former results of other
clusters ($Z \sim 0.3$ solar) within errors. Therefore, our results are also
consistent with the early enrichment scenario. We estimated Compton $y$
parameters only from X-ray results in the region between Abell 3391 and 3395
assuming a simple geometry. They are smaller than the previous SZ results with
Planck satellite. The difference could be attributed to a more elaborate
geometry such as a filament inclined to the line-of-sight direction, or
underestimation of the X-ray temperature because of the unresolved
multi-temperature structures or undetected hot X-ray emission of the shock
heated gas.

properties can be tailored according to the stacking of its constituents,
remains an attractive research area. In this article we have employed a
transfer matrix treatment to study the propagation of light waves in Fibonacci
quasiperiodic dieletric multilayers with graphene embedded. We calculated their
dispersion and transmission spectra in order to investigate the effects of the
graphene monolayers and quasiperiodic disorder on the system physical behavior.
The quasiperiodic dieletric multilayer is composed of two building blocks,
silicon dioxide (building block A = SiO2) and titanium dioxide (building block
B = TiO2). Our numerical results show that the presence of graphene monolayers
reduces the transmissivity on the whole range of frequency and induces a
transmission gap in the low frequency region. Regarding the polarization of the
light wave, we found that the transmission coefficient is higher for the
transverse magnetic (TM) case than for the transverse electric (TE) one. We
also conclude from our numerical results that the graphene induced photonic
bandgaps (GIPBGs) do not depend on the polarization (TE or TM) of the light
wave nor on the Fibonacci generation index n. Moreover, the GIPBGs are
omnidirectional photonic band gaps, therefore light cannot propagate in this
structures for frequencies lower than a certain value, whatever the incidence
angle. Finally, a plot of the transmission spectra versus chemical potential
shows that one can, in principle, adjust the width of the photonic band gap by
tuning the chemical potential via a gate voltage.

characterizing large networks. While powerful, they suffer from the slow mixing
problem when the graph is loosely connected, which results in poor estimation
accuracy. Random walk with jumps (RWwJ) can address the slow mixing problem but
it is inapplicable if the graph does not support uniform vertex sampling (UNI).
In this work, we develop methods that can efficiently sample a graph without
the necessity of UNI but still enjoy the similar benefits as RWwJ. We observe
that many graphs under study, called target graphs, do not exist in isolation.
In many situations, a target graph is related to an auxiliary graph and a
bipartite graph, and they together form a better connected {\em two-layered
network structure}. This new viewpoint brings extra benefits to graph sampling:
if directly sampling a target graph is difficult, we can sample it indirectly
with the assistance of the other two graphs. We propose a series of new graph
sampling techniques by exploiting such a two-layered network structure to
estimate target graph characteristics. Experiments conducted on both synthetic
and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these
new techniques.

comparing our model's grid cell estimates aggregated at a county-level to

directly interpreting the model's predictions in terms of the satellite image
inputs. We find that aggregating our model's estimates gives comparable results
to the Census county-level population projections and that the predictions made
by our model can be directly interpreted, which give it advantages over
traditional population disaggregation methods. In general, our model is an

group suppression protocol is proven to be stable when the file is broken into

for arbitrary number of pieces. We define and simulate a decentralized version
of this protocol for practical applications. Straightforward incorporation of
the group suppression protocol into BitTorrent while retaining most of
BitTorrent's core mechanisms is also presented. Subsequent simulations show
that under certain assumptions, BitTorrent with the official protocol cannot

recommendation strategies, collaborative filtering has shown good performance
by using rating patterns of users. Matrix factorization and random walk with
restart are the most representative collaborative filtering methods. However,

devise an RWR method using global bias term which corresponds to a matrix
factorization method using biases. We describe details of the two methods in
various aspects of recommendation quality such as how those methods handle
cold-start problem which typically happens in collaborative filtering. We
extensively perform experiments over real-world datasets to evaluate the
performance of each method in terms of various measures. We observe that matrix
factorization performs better with explicit feedback ratings while RWR is
better with implicit ones. We also observe that exploiting global popularities
of items is advantageous in the performance and that side information produces
positive synergy with explicit feedback but gives negative effects with
implicit one.

that some videos or hashtags suddenly go viral through people's sharing on
online social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a
common structure? All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user
interactions in networks, which we call ""bursts"" in this work. We uncover that
the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in some
properly defined networks. This finding motivates us to propose a new and
robust method to detect bursts on OSNs. We first introduce a new measure,
""triadic cardinality distribution"", corresponding to the fractions of nodes
with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic cardinalities, in a network.
We show that this distribution not only changes when a burst occurs, but it
also has a robustness property that it is immunized against common spamming
social-bot attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we
can more reliably detect bursts than simply counting interactions on OSNs. To
avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN users during the triadic
tracking, we design an efficient ""sample-estimate"" framework to provide maximum
likelihood estimate on the triadic cardinality distribution. We propose several
sampling methods, and provide insights about their performance difference,

via its dual, which can be reformulated as a multi-block unconstrained convex
composite minimization problem, is considered. Motivated by the success of the
accelerated block coordinate descent (ABCD) method for solving large scale
convex minimization problems in finite dimensional space, we consider extending
this method to $L^1$-EOCP. Hence, an efficient inexact ABCD method is
introduced for solving $L^1$-EOCP. The design of this method combines an
inexact 2-block majorized ABCD and the recent advances in the inexact symmetric
Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique for solving a multi-block convex composite
quadratic programming whose objective contains a nonsmooth term involving only
the first block. The proposed algorithm (called sGS-imABCD) is illustrated at
two numerical examples. Numerical results not only confirm the finite element
error estimates, but also show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient
than (a) the ihADMM (inexact heterogeneous alternating direction method of
multipliers), (b) the APG (accelerated proximal gradient) method.

one of the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and
correlation coefficient are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to
calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear that these functions
are optimal for profile alignment methods. At least, by definition, these
functions cannot capture non-linear relationships between profiles. Therefore,
in this study, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was
more suitable for the profile comparison method than the existing ones. Firstly
we implemented a new derivative free neural network by combining the
conventional neural network with evolutionary strategy optimization method.
Next, using the framework, the scoring function was optimized for aligning
remote sequence pairs. Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel
scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and
precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved
alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and
increasing the expressive power of similarity score. The novel scoring function
can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into
other aligners. With our scoring function, the performance of homology
detection and/or multiple sequence alignment for remote homologous sequences
would be further improved.

its feasible execution paths, and fingerprints their emissions using an

We confirm that the opacities from bound-bound transitions of open f-shell,
Lanthanide elements (Nd and Er) are higher than those of the other elements
over a wide wavelength range. The opacities of open s-shell (Ba), p-shell (Se

elements and their transitions are concentrated in the ultraviolet wavelengths.
We show that the optical brightness can be different by >2 mag depending on the
element abundances in the ejecta such that post-merger, Lanthanide-free ejecta
produce brighter and bluer optical emission. Such blue emission from
post-merger ejecta can be observed from the polar directions if the mass of the
preceding dynamical ejecta in these regions is small. For the ejecta mass of
0.01 Msun, observed magnitudes of the blue emission will reach 21.0 mag (100
Mpc) and 22.5 mag (200 Mpc) in g and r bands within a few days after the
merger, which are detectable with 1m or 2m-class telescopes.

therefore unknown to an adversary. We then propose a protocol that uses covert
communication where the amount of key consumed in the protocol is smaller than
the transmitted key, thus leading to secure secret key expansion. We derive
precise conditions showing that secret key expansion from covert communication

mutual information of color image and depth image to enhance each other in

train this generative network in order to keep generated images close to the

demonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality color image and

feature, its openness and expandability, is also its weakness, and attacks such

a vector for compromise. Fundamentally, it is virtually impossible to know

the challenges of doing so. We develop targeting algorithms and use domain

(any L transmitters can collectively store the database just once), we propose
a cyclic caching strategy so that each of every L consecutive transmitters
caches a distinct part of each file; the delivery strategy exploits coded
multicasting and interference alignment by introducing virtual receivers. The
obtained NDT is within a multiplicative gap of 2 to the optimum in the entire
cache size region, and optimal in certain region. For large transmitter cache
size (any L transmitters can collectively store the database for multiple
copies), we propose a modified caching strategy so that every bit is repeatedly
cached at consecutive transmitters; the delivery strategy exploits
self-interference cancellation and interference neutralization. By combining
these schemes, the NDT is optimal in a larger region. We also extend our
results to linear networks with heterogeneous receiver connectivity and
partially connected circular networks.

with location-dependent and time-sensitive tasks, which generalizes the
existing models in the literature. We focus on the task scheduling in the
user-centric PS system, where each participating user will make his individual
task scheduling decision (including both the task selection and the task
execution order) distributively. Specifically, we formulate the interaction of
users as a strategic game called Task Scheduling Game (TSG) and perform a
comprehensive game-theoretic analysis. First, we prove that the proposed TSG
game is a potential game, which guarantees the existence of Nash equilibrium
(NE). Then, we analyze the efficiency loss and the fairness index at the NE.
Our analysis shows the efficiency at NE may increase or decrease with the
number of users, depending on the level of competition. This implies that it is
not always better to employ more users in the user-centric PS system, which is
important for the system designer to determine the optimal number of users to
be employed in a practical system.

widely applied to face recognition, data augmentation for emotion recognition

labeled facial expression data, making it difficult for algorithms to
disambiguate changes due to identity and changes due to expression. In this
paper, we propose the conditional difference adversarial autoencoder, CDAAE,
for facial expression synthesis. The CDAAE takes a facial image of a previously
unseen person and generates an image of that human face with a target emotion
or facial action unit label. The CDAAE adds a feedforward path to an
autoencoder structure connecting low level features at the encoder to features
at the corresponding level at the decoder. It handles the problem of
disambiguating changes due to identity and changes due to facial expression by
learning to generate the difference between low-level features of images of the
same person but with different facial expressions. The CDAAE structure can be
used to generate novel expressions by combining and interpolating between
facial expressions/action units within the training set. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the CDAAE can preserve identity information when
generating facial expression for unseen subjects more faithfully than previous
approaches. This is especially advantageous when training with small databases.

Wong","Randomized Load-balanced Routing for Fat-tree Networks","13 pages, 1 table, 6 figure,",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fat-tree networks have been widely adopted to High Performance Computing
(HPC) clusters and to Data Center Networks (DCN). These parallel systems
usually have a large number of servers and hosts, which generate large volumes
of highly-volatile traffic. Thus, distributed load-balancing routing design
becomes critical to achieve high bandwidth utilization, and low-latency packet
delivery. Existing distributed designs rely on remote congestion feedbacks to
address congestion, which add overheads to collect and react to network-wide
congestion information. In contrast, we propose a simple but effective
load-balancing scheme, called Dynamic Randomized load-Balancing (DRB), to
achieve network-wide low levels of path collisions through local-link
adjustment which is free of communications and cooperations between switches.
First, we use D-mod-k path selection scheme to allocate default paths to all
source-destination (S-D) pairs in a fat-tree network, guaranteeing low levels
of path collision over downlinks for any set of active S-D pairs. Then, we
propose Threshold-based Two-Choice (TTC) randomized technique to balance uplink
traffic through local uplink adjustment at each switch. We theoretically show
that the proposed TTC for the uplink-load balancing in a fat-tree network have
a similar performance as the two-choice technique in the area of randomized
load balancing. Simulation results show that DRB with TTC technique achieves a
significant improvement over many randomized routing schemes for fat-tree
networks.

Current choreography practices, however, are not yet used extensively in the
embedded systems domain even though SOA is increasingly used in this domain.
The objective of this study is to identify current features of the use of
choreography in the embedded systems domain for practitioners and researchers
by systematically analysing current developments in the scientific literature,
strategies for choreography adaption, choreography specification and execution
types, and implicit assumptions about choreography. To fulfil this objective, a
systematic literature review of scientific publications that focus on the use
of choreography in the embedded systems domain was carried out. After
screening, 48 publications were selected as primary studies and analysed using
thematic synthesis. The main results of the study showed that there are
differences in how choreography is used in embedded and non-embedded systems
domain. In the embedded systems domain, it is used to capture the service
interactions of a single organisation, while, for example, in the enterprise
systems domain it captures the service interactions among multiple
organisations. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of choreography
can lead to improvements in system performance and that the languages that are
used for choreography modelling in the embedded systems domain are
insufficiently expressive to capture the complexities that are typical in this
domain. The study results facilitate the work of practitioners by allowing them
to make informed decisions about the applicability of choreography in their
organisations.

include: the gravitational field is sourced by dust and cosmological constant
only, both rotation and magnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanish, and the shear
is diagnosable. This paper describes the code simsilun (free software
distributed under the terms of the reposi General Public License), which
implements the equations of the Silent Universe. The paper also discusses
applications of the Silent Universe and it uses the Millennium simulation to
set up the initial conditions for the code simsilun. The simulation obtained
this way consists of 16,777,216 worldlines, which are evolved from z=80 to z=0.
Initially, the mean evolution (averaged over the whole domain) follows the

cosmic structures becomes nonlinear, the spatial curvature evolves from
$\Omega_K =0$ to $\Omega_K \approx 0.1$ at the present day. The emergence of
the spatial curvature is associated with $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ being

from information theory, computability theory, and complex networks. One key
studied question is how much emergent complexity (or information) arises when a
population of computable systems is networked compared with when this
population is isolated. First, we define a general model for networked
theoretical machines, which we call algorithmic networks. Then, we narrow our
scope to investigate algorithmic networks that optimize the average fitnesses
of nodes in a scenario in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the
randomly generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show
that there are graph-topological conditions that cause these algorithmic
networks to have the property of expected emergent open-endedness for large
enough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic
complexity of a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to
infinity. Given a dynamic network, we show that these conditions imply the
existence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness.
Moreover, we show that networks with small diameter compared to the network
size meet these conditions. We also discuss future research based on how our
results are related to some problems in network science, information theory,
computability theory, distributed computing, game theory, evolutionary biology,
and synergy in complex systems.

while guaranteeing harmonious coexistence between the LTE-U and Wi-Fi systems.
For a small cell with multiple antennas at the base station (SBS), some spatial
degrees of freedom (DoFs) are used to serve small cell users (SUEs) while the
rest are employed to mitigate the interference to the Wi-Fi users by applying
zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). As a result, the LTE-U and Wi-Fi throughput
can be balanced by carefully allocating the spatial DoFs. Due to the channel
state information (CSI) estimation and feedback errors, ZFBF cannot eliminate
the interference completely. We first analyze the residual interference among
SUEs, called intra-RAT interference, and the interference to the Wi-Fi users,
called inter-RAT interference after ZFBF, due to imperfect CSI. Based on the
analysis, we derive the throughputs of the small cell and the Wi-Fi systems,
respectively. Accordingly, a spatial DoF allocation scheme is proposed to
balance the throughput between the small cell and the Wi-Fi systems. Our
theoretical analysis and the proposed scheme are verified by simulation
results.

even for quantum computation. Given the numerous applications of classical FHE
(zero-knowledge proofs, secure two-party computation, obfuscation, etc.) it is
reasonable to hope that quantum FHE (or QFHE) will lead to many new results in
the quantum setting. However, a crucial ingredient in almost all applications
of FHE is circuit verification. Classically, verification is performed by
checking a transcript of the homomorphic computation. Quantumly, this strategy
is impossible due to no-cloning. This leads to an important open question: can
quantum computations be delegated and verified in a non-interactive manner? In
this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, by constructing a scheme
for QFHE with verification (vQFHE). Our scheme provides authenticated
encryption, and enables arbitrary polynomial-time quantum computations without
the need of interaction between client and server. Verification is almost
entirely classical; for computations that start and end with classical states,
it is completely classical. As a first application, we show how to construct
quantum one-time programs from classical one-time programs and vQFHE.

galaxies and with the intra-group medium enable and accelerate galaxy
transitions from actively star forming to quiescent. Galaxies in transition
from active to quiescent can be selected, by their infrared (IR) colors, as
canyon or infrared transition zone (IRTZ) galaxies. We used a sample of CG
galaxies with IR data from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
allowing us to calculate the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) for
each galaxy. Furthermore, we present new CO(1-0) data for 27 galaxies and
collect data from the literature to calculate the molecular gas mass for a
total sample of 130 galaxies. This data set allows us to study the difference
in the molecular gas fraction (Mmol/Mstar) and star formation efficiency
(SFE=SFR/Mmol) between active, quiescent, and transitioning (i.e., canyon and
IRTZ) galaxies. We find that transitioning galaxies have a mean molecular gas
fraction and a mean SFE that are significantly lower than those of actively
star-forming galaxies. The molecular gas fraction is higher than that of
quiescent galaxies, whereas the SFE is similar. These results indicate that the
transition from actively star-forming to quiescent in CG galaxies goes along
with a loss of molecular gas, possibly due to tidal forces exerted from the
neighboring galaxies or a decrease in the gas density. In addition, the
remaining molecular gas loses its ability to form stars efficiently, possibly
owing to turbulence perturbing the gas, as seen in other, well-studied examples
such as Stephan's Quintet and HCG~57. Thus, the amount and properties of
molecular gas play a crucial role in the environmentally driven transition of
galaxies from actively star forming to quiescent.

potential are as large as half of the band gap. The gapless surface, in
contrast, is sensitive to small fluctuations but the potential is strongly
suppressed due to the additional screening channel provided by metallic surface
carriers. To study the quantitative relationship between the properties of bulk
puddles and surface puddles, we performed infrared transmittance measurements
as well as scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the same sample of

Explorer observations of the system and confirm that almost all the bursts took
place during the hard persistent state of the system. This allows us to use the
recently developed direct cooling tail method to estimate the NS mass and
radius. However, because of the very short, about a second, duration of the
cooling tail phases that can be described by the theoretical atmosphere models,
the obtained constraints on the NS radius are not very strict. Assuming a pure
helium NS atmosphere we found that the NS radius is in the range 10-12 km, if
the NS mass is below 1.7 $M_\odot$, and in a wider range of 8-12 km for a
higher 1.7-2.0 $M_\odot$ NS mass. The method also constrains the distance to

d'Alambertian and solution of the geodesic equations for null geodesics. For
calculation of Hawking radiation it is essential to determine the behavior of
both the eigenmodes and geodesics in the vicinity of horizon. The equation for
the eigenmodes is solved, first, perturbatively in the ratio $O(C)/M$ of the
supertranslation field to the mass of black hole, and, next, non-perturbatively
in the near- horizon region. It is shown that in any order of perturbation
theory solution for the eigenmodes in the metric containing supertranslation
field differs from solution in the pure Schwarzschild metric by terms of order
$L^{1/2}= (1-2M/r)^{1/2}$. In the non-perturbative approach, solution for the

$L^{1/2}$ which vanish on horizon. Using the simplified form of geodesic
equations in vicinity of horizon, it is shown that in vicinity of horizon the

result, the density matrices of thermal radiation in both cases are the same.

high spin-orbit torques (SOTs) efficiency are the key to fabricate nonvolatile
magnetic memory and logic devices. In this work, PMA and SOTs are
systematically studied in Pt/Co/Cr stacks as a function of Cr thickness. An
enhanced perpendicular anisotropy field around 10189 Oe is obtained and is
related to the interface between Co and Cr layers. In addition, an effective
spin Hall angle up to 0.19 is observed due to the improved antidamping-like
torque by employing dissimilar metals Pt and Cr with opposite signs of spin
Hall angles on opposite sides of Co layer. Finally, we observed a nearly linear
dependence between spin Hall angle and longitudinal resistivity from their
temperature dependent properties, suggesting that the spin Hall effect may
arise from extrinsic skew scattering mechanism. Our results indicate that 3d
transition metal Cr with a large negative spin Hall angle could be used to
engineer the interfaces of trilayers to enhance PMA and SOTs.

optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield
reproducible results, outperforming lin- ear approaches. Specifically, the
Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all

other points in one of several possible locations $\{P_{i,1},\dots,

the latter task is very high. We propose a greedy part assignment algorithm
that exploits the inherent structure of the human body to achieve a lower
complexity, compared to any of the prior published works. This is accomplished
by (i) reducing the number of part-candidates using the estimated number of
people in the image, (ii) doing a greedy sequential assignment of part-classes,
following the kinematic chain from head to ankle (iii) doing a greedy
assignment of parts in each part-class set, to person-clusters (iv) limiting
the candidate person clusters to the most proximal clusters using human
anthropometric data and (v) using only a specific subset of pre-assigned parts
for establishing pairwise structural constraints. We show that, these steps
result in a sparse body parts relationship graph and reduces the complexity. We
also propose methods for improving the accuracy of pose-estimation by (i)
spawning person-clusters from any unassigned significant body part and (ii)
suppressing hallucinated parts. On the MPII multi-person pose database,
pose-estimation using the proposed method takes only 0.14 seconds per image. We

crucial distinction among magnetosphere models, and contains key parameters
determining the high energy emission of pulsar binaries. In this work, a direct
method is proposed, which might probe the properties of the wind from one
pulsar in a double-pulsar binary. When the radio signals from the first-formed
pulsar travel through the relativistic $e^\pm$ flow in the pulsar wind from the
younger companion, the components of different radio frequencies will be
dispersed. It will introduce an additional frequency-dependent time-of-arrival
delay of pulses, which is function of the orbital phase. In this paper, we
formulate the above-mentioned dispersive delay with the properties of the
pulsar wind. As examples, we apply the formula to the double pulsar system PSR
J0737-3039A/B and the pulsar-neutron star binary PSR B1913+16. For PSR
J0737-3039A/B, the time delay in 300\,MHz is $\lesssim10\mu$s near the
superior-conjunction, under the optimal pulsar wind parameters, which is $\sim$
half of the current timing accuracy. For PSR B1913+16, with the assumption that
the neutron star companion has a typical spin down luminosity of
$10^{33}$\,ergs/s, the time delay is as large as $10\sim20\mu$s in 300\,MHz.
The best timing precision of this pulsar is $\sim5\mu$s in 1400\,MHz.
Therefore, it is possible that we can find this signal in archival data.
Otherwise, we can set an upper-limit on the spin down luminosity. Similar
analysis can be apply to other eleven known pulsar-neutron star binaries

architecture composing of two stages. The first stage advances the recently
proposed DispNet by equipping it with extra up-convolution modules, leading to
disparity images with more details. The second stage explicitly rectifies the
disparity initialized by the first stage; it couples with the first-stage and
generates residual signals across multiple scales. The summation of the outputs
from the two stages gives the final disparity. As opposed to directly learning
the disparity at the second stage, we show that residual learning provides more
effective refinement. Moreover, it also benefits the training of the overall
cascade network. Experimentation shows that our cascade residual learning
scheme provides state-of-the-art performance for matching stereo

identical with the period of early superhumps, is exceptionally long for a WZ
Sge-type dwarf nova. The mass ratio ($q$ = $M_2/M_1$) estimated from the period
of developing (stage A) superhumps is 0.166(2), which is also very large for a
WZ Sge-type dwarf nova. This suggests that the 2:1 resonance can be reached in
such high-$q$ systems, contrary to our expectation. Such conditions are
considered to be achieved if the mass-transfer rate is much lower than those in
typical SU UMa-type dwarf novae that have comparable orbital periods to
ASASSN-16eg and a resultant accumulation of a large amount of matter on the

basic concepts and definitions, we first explain the relations between TN and
physical problems, including the TN representations of classical partition
functions, quantum many-body states (by matrix product state, tree TN, and
projected entangled pair state), time evolution simulations, etc. These
problems, which are challenging to solve, can be transformed to TN contraction
problems. We present then several paradigm algorithms based on the ideas of the
numerical renormalization group and/or boundary states, including density
matrix renormalization group, time-evolving block decimation,
coarse-graining/corner tensor renormalization group, and several distinguished
variational algorithms. Finally, we revisit the TN approaches from the
perspective of multi-linear algebra (also known as tensor algebra or tensor
decompositions) and quantum simulation. Despite the apparent differences in the
ideas and strategies of different TN algorithms, we aim at revealing the
underlying relations and resemblances in order to present a systematic picture

exponentially and the entropy shows an area law behavior. The distance up to

The amplification of other bosonic excitations, like phonons in solids, is
likely to open up new remarkable physical phenomena. Here, we report on an
experimental demonstration of optical phonon amplification. A coherent
mid-infrared optical field is used to drive large amplitude oscillations of the
Si-C stretching mode in silicon carbide. Upon nonlinear phonon excitation, a
second probe pulse experiences parametric optical gain at all wavelengths
throughout the reststrahlen band, which reflects the amplification of
optical-phonon fluctuations. Starting from first principle calculations, we
show that the high-frequency dielectric permittivity and the phonon oscillator
strength depend quadratically on the lattice coordinate. In the experimental
conditions explored here, these oscillate then at twice the frequency of the
optical field and provide a parametric drive for lattice fluctuations.
Parametric gain in phononic four wave mixing is a generic mechanism that can be
extended to all polar modes of solids, as a new means to control the kinetics
of phase transitions, to amplify many body interactions or to control
phonon-polariton waves.

  MNRASL",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galaxy-wide star formation can be quenched by a number of physical processes
such as environmental effects (e.g., ram pressure stripping) and supernova
feedback. Using numerical simulations, we here demonstrate that star formation
can be severely suppressed in disk galaxies with their gas disks
counter-rotating with respect to their stellar disks. This new mechanism of
star formation suppression (or quenching) does not depend so strongly on model
parameters of disk galaxies, such as bulge-to-disk- ratios and gas mass
fractions. Such severe suppression of star formation is due largely to the
suppression of the gas density enhancing mechanism i.e spiral arm formation in
disk galaxies with counter-rotating gas. Our simulations also show that
molecular hydrogen and dust can be rather slowly consumed by star formation in
disk galaxies with counter-rotating gas disks (i.e., long gas depletion
timescale). Based on these results, we suggest that spiral and S0 galaxies with
counter-rotation can have rather low star formation rate for their gas
densities. Also we suggest that a minor fraction of S0 galaxies have no
prominent spiral arms, because they have a higher fraction of counter-rotating
gas. We predict that poststarburst E+A disk galaxies with cold gas could have
counter-rotating gas.

various oxide substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without utilizing

limit mainly due to short-range scattering caused by S vacancies formed during
CVD growth. If the upper limit for the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 on oxide
substrates is determined by the MoS2/substrate interaction during growth, it
will hinder the advantage. In this study, we investigated the interaction
between monolayer MoS2 and a SiO2/Si substrate and the difference in
crystallinity between the top and bottom S surfaces due to the MoS2/substrate
interaction. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that doping and
strain were induced in MoS2 from the substrate, but they could be removed by
transferring MoS2 to a new substrate using polymers. The newly developed
polymer-transfer technique enabled selective transfer of the bottom or top
surface of CVD-MoS2 onto a new SiO2/Si substrate. The metal-insulator
transition was clearly observed for both the normal and inverse transfers,
suggesting that the crystallinity of CVD-MoS2 is high and that the
crystallinity of the bottom surface interacting with the substrate was similar

the further improvement of the crystallinity of MoS2 on oxide substrates by

rotation-supported (tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between

capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include terms up to
second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting IA
contributions to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial

linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections to the
total intrinsic alignment signal at $k\sim0.1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, depending on
the source redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant
biases on inferred cosmological parameters in Stage IV photometric weak lensing
surveys. We perform forecasts for an LSST-like survey, finding that use of the

aerosols and leads to the appearance of a more clear atmosphere than on
HD189733b. The aerosol distribution also depends on the particle composition,
the photochemical production, and the atmospheric mixing. Due to degeneracies
among these inputs, current data cannot constrain the aerosol properties in
detail. Instead, our work highlights the role of different factors in
controlling the aerosol distribution that will prove useful in understanding
different observations, including those from future missions. For the
atmospheric mixing efficiency suggested by general circulation models (GCMs) we
find that aerosol particles are small ($\sim$nm) and probably spherical. We
further conclude that composition based on complex hydrocarbons (soots) is the
most likely candidate to survive the high temperatures in hot Jupiter
atmospheres. Such particles would have a significant impact on the energy
balance of HD189733b's atmosphere and should be incorporated in future studies
of atmospheric structure. We also evaluate the contribution of external sources
in the photochemical aerosol formation and find that their spectral signature
is not consistent with observations.

transition rates is considered. Given a non-negative reward function on the
state space, we are interested in the expected stationary performance. Since a
direct derivation of the stationary probability distribution is not available
in general, the performance is approximated by a perturbed random walk, whose
transition rates on the boundaries are changed such that its stationary
probability distribution is known in closed form.
  A perturbed random walk for which the stationary distribution is a sum of
geometric terms is considered and the perturbed transition rates are allowed to
be inhomogeneous. It is demonstrated that such rates can be constructed for any
sum of geometric terms that satisfies the balance equations in the interior of
the state space. The inhomogeneous transitions relax the pairwise-coupled
structure on these geometric terms that would be imposed if only homogeneous
transitions are used.
  An explicit expression for the approximation error bound is obtained using
the Markov reward approach, which does not depend on the values of the
inhomogeneous rates but only on the parameters of the geometric terms.
Numerical experiments indicate that inhomogeneous perturbation can give smaller
error bounds than homogeneous perturbation.

analogous iron-based superconductors. However, careful annealing of these

crucial to the determination of the pairing symmetry. We found that the
crystallographic defects are a significant source of pair-breaking in the

slower pair-breaking rate (measured in mK/$\mu \Omega cm$) than expected due to
non-magnetic crystallographic defects, together with a faster pair-breaking

mobilities are primarily determined by membrane shear and that bending does not
play a significant role. In the quasi-steady limit of vanishing frequency, the
particle self- and pair mobilities near a no-slip hard cylinder are recovered
only if the membrane possesses a non-vanishing shear rigidity. We further
compute the membrane deformation, finding that deformation is generally more
pronounced in the axial (radial) directions, for the motion along

quantum bits (qubits) are anticipated to be operational by 2020
[googlemachine,gambetta2015building], and several-hundred-qubit machines are
around the corner. Machines of this scale have the capacity to demonstrate
quantum supremacy, the tipping point where QC is faster than the fastest
classical alternative for a particular problem. Because error correction
techniques will be central to QC and will be the most expensive component of
quantum computation, choosing the lowest-overhead error correction scheme is
critical to overall QC success. This paper evaluates two established quantum
error correction codes---planar and double-defect surface codes---using a set
of compilation, scheduling and network simulation tools. In considering
scalable methods for optimizing both codes, we do so in the context of a full
microarchitectural and compiler analysis. Contrary to previous predictions, we
find that the simpler planar codes are sometimes more favorable for
implementation on superconducting quantum computers, especially under
conditions of high communication congestion.

calibrate DC Voltage generators, mainly top-level calibrators from 1 mV to 1 kV

ratios DC Voltage divider. The significant achievement of this setup is the
possibility to interconnect the divider, a DMM characterized in linearity, a DC
Voltage Standard and a DC Voltage generator under calibration and automatically
to manage the calibration process. This calibration method allows to save a lot
of time, to improve the reliability and to increase the accuracy of the
calibration of generators. The relative uncertainties of the system span from
0.6x10-6 to 1.2x10-4 improving the previous capabilities of the INRIM
laboratory for calibration of programmable multifunction instruments. In
addition, this system allows to avoid the employment of several Standards (some
of them still manually operating) carrying out the entire process without
changing the setup configuration and without the presence of operators. The
concept of this setup can be transferred to secondary high-level electrical
calibration Laboratories that could be consider it useful for their calibration
activities.

decades to describe an assortment of small-scale phenomena, from instabilities
and turbulence, to dust dynamics and planet formation. For the most part, they
have been derived in a physically motivated but essentially ad hoc fashion,
with some of the mathematical assumptions never made explicit nor checked for
consistency. This approach is susceptible to error, and it is easy to derive
local models that support spurious instabilities or fail to conserve key
quantities. In this paper we present rigorous derivations, based on an
asympototic ordering, and formulate a hierarchy of local models
(incompressible, Boussinesq, and compressible), making clear which is best
suited for a particular flow or phenomenon while spelling out explicitly the
assumptions and approximations of each. We also discuss the merits of the
anelastic approximation, emphasising that anelastic systems struggle to
conserve energy unless strong restrictions are imposed on the flow. The
problems encountered by the anelastic approximation are exacerbated by the
disk's differential rotation, but also attend non-rotating systems such as
stellar interiors. We conclude with a defence of local models and their
continued utility in astrophysical research.

polarization behind seven 36 to 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ targets was measured with a
polarimeter based on the $^{3}{\rm He}(\vec{d},p)^{4}{\rm He}$ reaction. Due to
the chosen relation between the areal target densities and the initial beam
energies $E_{\rm in}$, the seven sets of $p_{zz}(E_{\rm in})$ can be combined
in a common plot as a function of $E_{\rm in}$. This allows one to understand
$p_{zz}$, measured behind the 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ target at $E_{\rm
in}$=18.6\,MeV, as resulting from the sequence of differential polarization
production $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta E$ during energy degradation in the target
from $E$=18.60 to 9.50\,MeV. The rapid fluctuations of $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta
E$$p_{zz}$ are described by 51 Gaussian-distributed cross-sections removing
deuterons either in the $m=0$ or in the $m=\pm 1$ state from the beam. The 51
fitted central energies $E_{0}$ with a single exception agree with the energies
of the narrow peaks in the excitation functions of the weak, isospin-breaking

deuterons in the $m=0$ ($m=\pm 1$) state from the beam leads to the formation
of $^{14}$N states of established positive (negative) parity. As an
application, the removal cross-section functions allow to calculate $p_{zz}$
achievable with carbon targets for initial beam energies $E_{\rm in}$ between
18.60 and 9.50\,MeV and $E_{\rm out}$ given by the areal target density. Carbon
layers in a sandwich technique would enable $p_{zz}$ between -0.4 and +0.3.

two possible directions via spontaneous symmetry breaking and forms a
cylindrical arc, a phenomenon well known as Euler buckling. When this
cylindrical section is pushed in the other direction, the bending direction can
suddenly reverse. This instability is called snap-through buckling and is one
of the elementary shape transitions in a prestressed thin structure. Combining
experiments and theory, we study snap-buckling of an elastic strip with one end
hinged and the other end clamped. These asymmetric boundary constraints break
the intrinsic symmetry of the strip, generating rich exotic mechanical
behaviors including largely hysteretic but reproducible force responses and
switch-like discontinuous shape changes. We establish the set of exact
analytical solutions that fully explain all of our major experimental and
numerical findings. Asymmetric boundary conditions arise naturally in diverse
situations when a thin object is in contact with a solid surface at one end,

discovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are
relatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause white
dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially
occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single
and/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions
have different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar
mass explosions. Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic
chemical signatures. Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected to be
rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar
neighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker
metallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution of metalpoor
systems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution
model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Results. The model predicts a
butterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity
and - at the same time - a decrease of [alpha/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than
in the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed
abundances in stars of Ursa Minor. Conclusions. The surprising agreement
between our models and available observations provides a strong indication of
the origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia. This outcome requires
confirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in stars of other
satellite galaxies of ourMilkyWay. It will be vital for this project to measure
not the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the
opposite; the metal-rich end of dwarf spheroidals.

dynamical systems theory are often used to model these networks, but the size
and complexity of these models mean that their behaviour is not always
intuitive and the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to decipher. For this
reason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are
necessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori
projection. By first converting a thermodynamic state ensemble model of gene
regulation into mass action reactions we derive a general method that produces
a set of time evolution equations for a subset of components of a network. The
influence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions
that describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in
the bulk. These memory functions provide probes of near-steady state dynamics,
revealing information not easily accessible otherwise. We illustrate the method
on a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif to show that memory
functions not only simplify the analysis of the subnetwork but also have a
natural interpretation. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate
neural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network
composed of four interacting transcription factors. The memory functions reveal
the function of specific links within the neural tube network and identify
features of the regulatory structure that specifically increase the robustness
of the network to initial conditions. Taken together, the study provides
evidence that Zwanzig-Mori projections offer powerful and effective tools for
simplifying and exploring the behaviour of GRNs.

distribution of atomic entangled states beyond qubits. In our scheme, imperfect
noisy entangled pairs of two qudits, i.e., two discrete-variable $d$-level
systems, each of, in principle, arbitrary dimension $d$, are initially shared
between the intermediate stations of the channel. This is achieved via local,
sufficiently strong light-matter interactions, involving optical coherent
states and their transmission after these interactions, and optical
measurements on the transmitted field modes, especially (but not restricted to)
efficient continuous-variable homodyne detections (""hybrid"" here refers to the
simultaneous exploitation of discrete and continuous variable degrees of

their non-local distribution, respectively). For qutrits we quantify the
light-matter entanglement that can be effectively shared through an elementary
lossy channel, and for a repeater spacing of up to 10 km we show that the
realistic (lossy) qutrit entanglement is even larger than any ideal (loss-free)
qubit entanglement. After including qudit entanglement purification and
swapping procedures, we calculate the long-distance entangled-pair distribution
rates and the final entangled-state fidelities for total communication

direct-adjoint iterations of the Navier-Stokes equations linearized around
inviscid, steady ISWs obtained from the Dubreil-Jacotin-Long (DJL) equation.
Optimal perturbations are found as a function of the ISW phase velocity $c$
(alternatively amplitude) for one representative stratification. These
disturbances are found to be localized wave-like packets that originate just
upstream of the ISW self-induced zone (for large enough $c$) of potentially
unstable Richardson number, $Ri < 0.25$. They propagate through the base wave
as coherent packets whose total energy gain increases rapidly with $c$. The
optimal disturbances are also shown to be relevant to DJL solitary waves that
have been modified by viscosity representative of laboratory experiments. The
optimal disturbances are compared to the local WKB approximation for spatially
growing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves through the $Ri < 0.25$ zone. The WKB
approach is able to capture properties (e.g., carrier frequency, wavenumber and
energy gain) of the optimal disturbances except for an initial phase of
non-normal growth due to the Orr mechanism. The non-normal growth can be a
substantial portion of the total gain, especially for ISWs that are weakly
unstable to K-H waves. The linear evolution of Gaussian packets of linear free
waves with the same carrier frequency as the optimal disturbances is shown to
result in less energy gain than found for either the optimal perturbations or
the WKB approximation due to non-normal effects that cause absorption of
disturbance energy into the leading face of the wave.

duo is any two consecutive characters in a string and it is preserved in the
mapping if its two consecutive characters in $s_1$ are mapped to same two
consecutive characters in $s_2$. The MDSM problem is known to be NP-hard and
there are approximation algorithms for this problem [3, 5, 13], but all of them
consider only the ""unweighted"" version of the problem in the sense that a duo
from $s_1$ is preserved by mapping to any same duo in $s_2$ regardless of their
positions in the respective strings. However, it is well-desired in comparative
genomics to find mappings that consider preserving duos that are ""closer"" to

generalized version of the problem, called the Maximum-Weight Duo-preservation

molecular dynamics simulation, and a reduction of dimensionality suitable for
DNA. We show that the conformational response of the DNA proceeds along a
single collective coordinate that represents the relative orientation of two
consecutive base pairs, namely, a combination of helical parameters shift and
tilt. The structure of DNA relaxes on time scales reaching nanoseconds,
contributing marginally to the relaxation of energies, which is dominated by
the modes of motion of the aqueous solvent. The concept of reaction path
averaging (RPA), conveniently exploited in this context, makes it possible to
filter out any undesirable noise from the nonequilibrium data, and is
applicable to any chemical process in general.

finite, realistic, locally causal theory where gravity plays a vital role not
only during decoherent measurement but also during non-decoherent unitary
evolution. Invariant set theory is built on geometric properties of a compact
fractal-like subset $I_U$ of cosmological state space on which the universe is
assumed to evolve and from which the laws of physics are assumed to derive.
Consistent with the primacy of $I_U$, a non-Euclidean (and hence non-classical)
state-space metric $g_p$ is defined, related to the $p$-adic metric of number
theory where $p$ is a large but finite Pythagorean prime. Uncertain states on
$I_U$ are described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared
amplitudes are rational and corresponding complex phase angles are rational
multiples of $2 \pi$. Such Hilbert states are necessarily $g_p$-distant from
states with either irrational squared amplitudes or irrational phase angles.
The gappy fractal nature of $I_U$ accounts for quantum complementarity and is
characterised numerically by a generic number-theoretic incommensurateness
between rational angles and rational cosines of angles. The Bell inequality,
whose violation would be inconsistent with local realism, is shown to be
$g_p$-distant from all forms of the inequality that are violated in any
finite-precision experiment. The delayed-choice paradox is resolved through the
computational irreducibility of $I_U$. The Schr\""odinger and Dirac equations
describe evolution on $I_U$ in the singular limit at $p=\infty$. By contrast,
an extension of the Einstein field equations on $I_U$ is proposed which reduces
smoothly to general relativity as $p \rightarrow \infty$. Novel proposals for
the dark universe and the elimination of classical space-time singularities are

scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with the
atoms in the sample, which emit secondary electrons that contain information
about the surface topography and composition. The sample is scanned by the
electron beam point by point, until an image of the surface is formed. Since
its invention in 1942, SEMs have become paramount in the discovery and
understanding of the nanometer world, and today it is extensively used for both
research and in industry. In principle, SEMs can achieve resolution better than
one nanometer. However, for many applications, working at sub-nanometer
resolution implies an exceedingly large number of scanning points. For exactly
this reason, the SEM diagnostics of microelectronic chips is performed either
at high resolution (HR) over a small area or at low resolution (LR) while
capturing a larger portion of the chip. Here, we employ sparse coding and
dictionary learning to algorithmically enhance LR SEM images of microelectronic
chips up to the level of the HR images acquired by slow SEM scans, while
considerably reducing the noise. Our methodology consists of two steps: an
offline stage of learning a joint dictionary from a sequence of LR and HR
images of the same region in the chip, followed by a fast-online
super-resolution step where the resolution of a new LR image is enhanced. We
provide several examples with typical chips used in the microelectronics
industry, as well as a statistical study on arbitrary images with
characteristic structural features. Conceptually, our method works well when
the images have similar characteristics. This work demonstrates that employing
sparsity concepts can greatly improve the performance of SEM, thereby

tried to combine surface electromyography with modalities that are less
affected by the amputation and environment, such as accelerometry or gaze
information. In the latter case, the hypothesis is that a subject looks at the
object he or she intends to manipulate and that knowing this object's
affordances allows to constrain the set of possible grasps. In this paper, we
develop an automated way to detect stable fixations and show that gaze
information is indeed helpful in predicting hand movements. In our multimodal
approach, we automatically detect stable gazes and segment an object of
interest around the subject's fixation in the visual frame. The patch extracted
around this object is subsequently fed through an off-the-shelf deep
convolutional neural network to obtain a high level feature representation,
which is then combined with traditional surface electromyography in the
classification stage. Tests have been performed on a dataset acquired from five
intact subjects who performed ten types of grasps on various objects as well as

increases the classification accuracy considerably. Further analysis

optical galaxy observations. Gamma-ray astronomy has emerged in the past few
years as a powerful tool for the study of the EBL: very-high-energy (VHE)
photons traversing cosmological distances can interact with EBL photons to
produce e$^+$e$^-$ pairs, resulting in an energy-dependent depletion of the
gamma-ray flux of distant sources that can be used to set constraints on the
EBL density. The study of the EBL is one of the key scientific programs
currently carried out by the MAGIC collaboration. We present here the results
of the analysis of 32 VHE spectra of 12 blazars in the redshift range 0.03 -
0.94, obtained with over 300 hours of observations with the MAGIC telescopes
between 2010 and 2016. A combined likelihood maximization approach is used to
evaluate the density and spectrum of the EBL most consistent with the MAGIC
observations. The results are compatible with state-of-the-art EBL models, and
constrain the EBL density to be roughly within $\simeq 20\%$ of the nominal
value in such models. The study reveals no anomalies in gamma-ray propagation
in the large optical depth regime - contrary to some claims based on
meta-analyses of published VHE spectra.

Schroedinger's temporally independent equation in cartesian coordinates x,y,z,

The properties of angular momentum are thus achieved with no angular variable.
Several plots of surfaces of constant psi(x,y,z) are presented to illustrate
the resemblance of the shapes of these surfaces to the shapes of surfaces of
psi(r,theta,phi) with the corresponding quantum numbers.

  manipulation","Written for Work17 Conference",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The reproducibility issue in science has come under increased scrutiny. One
consistent suggestion lies in the use of scripted methods or workflows for data
analysis. Image analysis is one area in science in which little can be done in
scripted methods. The SWIIM Project (Scripted Workflows to Improve Image
Manipulation) is designed to generate workflows from popular image manipulation
tools. In the project, 2 approaches are being taken to construct workflows in
the image analysis area. First, the open-source tool GIMP is being enhanced to
produce an active log (which can be run on a stand-alone basis to perform the
same manipulation). Second, the R system Shiny tool is being used to construct
a graphical user interface (GUI) which works with EBImage code to modify
images, and to produce an active log which can perform the same operations.
This process has been successful to date, but is not complete. The basic method
for each component is discussed, and example code is shown.

  complex fluids: from phosphate buffer solution to human serum",,,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.app-ph physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in techniques for monitoring pH in complex fluids could have
significant impact on analytical and biomedical applications ranging from water
quality assessment to in vivo diagnostics. We developed flexible graphene
microelectrodes (GEs) for rapid (< 5 seconds), very low power (femtowatt)
detection of the pH of complex biofluids. The method is based on real-time
measurement of Faradaic charge transfer between the GE and a solution at zero
electrical bias. For an idealized sample of phosphate buffer solution (PBS),
the Faradaic current varied monotonically and systematically with the pH with
resolution of ~0.2 pH unit. The current-pH dependence was well described by a
hybrid analytical-computational model where the electric double layer derives
from an intrinsic, pH-independent (positive) charge associated with the
graphene-water interface and ionizable (negative) charged groups described by
the Langmuir-Freundlich adsorption isotherm. We also tested the GEs in more
complex bio-solutions. In the case of a ferritin solution, the relative
Faradaic current, defined as the difference between the measured current
response and a baseline response due to PBS, showed a strong signal associated
with the disassembly of the ferritin and the release of ferric ions at pH ~
2.0. For samples of human serum, the Faradaic current showed a reproducible
rapid (<20s) response to pH. By combining the Faradaic current and real time
current variation, the methodology is potentially suitable for use to detect
tumor-induced changes in extracellular pH.
