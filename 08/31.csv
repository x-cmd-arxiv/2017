  heuristic","Submitted to TRB 2018",,"10.1177/0361198118787803","Transportation Research Record, 2672(48), 1--11","math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the school bus scheduling problem, the main contributing factor to the
cost is the number of buses needed for the operations. However, in the case of
subcontracting the transportation of pupils, unbalanced tours can increase the
costs significantly as the lengths of some tours can exceed the daily fixed
driving goal and will result in over-hour charges. This paper proposes a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and a matching-based heuristic algorithm to
solve the balanced school bus scheduling problem in a multi-school setting. The
heuristic is guaranteed to find the minimum number of buses. The effectiveness
of the heuristic algorithm is tested by comparing its solutions with the
solutions obtained from the MIP whenever the MIP could find a good solution.
For larger cases where the MIP cannot find a good solution, we illustrate the
performance of the heuristic by showing how it affects the durations of the
tours. To illustrate the performance of the MIP and heuristic, we examine 12
different problems with different numbers of trips which are all based on two
real-world problems. A California case study with 54 trips and the Howard
County Public School System (HCPSS) with 994 trips. The numerical results of
testing our approach indicate that the proposed algorithm can find reasonable
solutions in a significantly shorter time. The balanced solutions of our
algorithm can save up to 16% of school bus operation costs compared to the best
solution found from the MIP model after 40 hours. The balancing stage of the
heuristic decreases the Standard Deviation of the tour durations by up to 47%.

the undisturbed state and the total force. There is a monotone relation between
the height of the centre and the wetting angle. We study the number of
equilibria, the floating configurations and their stability for all parameter
values. We find that the system admits at most two equilibrium points for
arbitrary contact angle, the one with smaller wetting angle is stable and the
one with larger wetting angle is unstable. The initial model has a limitation
that the fluid interfaces may intersect. We show that the stable equilibrium
point never lies in the intersection region, while the unstable equilibrium
point may lie in the intersection region.

their outer radius. In this paper, the feedback of realistic dust grain size

difference of dust and gas extents as traced by CO is primarily caused by
differences in the optical depth of lines vs continuum. The main effect of
radial drift is the sharp decrease in the intensity profile at the outer edge.
The gas radial extent can easily range within a factor of 2 for models with
different turbulence. A combination of grain growth and vertical settling leads
to thermal de-coupling between gas and dust at intermediate scale-heights. A
proper treatment of the gas thermal structure within dust gaps will be
fundamental to disentangle surface density gaps from gas temperature gaps.

different solutions. Using these techniques, we scan the parameter space of the
problem so as to study various effects governing formation of curved flames.
These include the thermal gas expansion and the finite-front-thickness effects,
namely, the flame stretch, curvature, and compression. In particular, the flame
compression is demonstrated to have a profound influence on the flame, strongly
affecting the dependence of its propagation speed on the channel width b.
Specifically, the solutions found exhibit a sharp increase of the flame speed
with the channel width. Under a weak flame compression, this increase commences
at b/lambda_c = 2 - 3, where lambda_c is the cutoff wavelength, but this ratio
becomes significantly larger as the flame compression grows. The results
obtained are also used to identify limitations of the analytical approach based
on the weak-nonlinearity assumption, and to revise the role of noise in the
flame evolution.

sequences to minimize an objective, this paper derives a closed-form expression
for individual control actions, i.e., control values that can be applied for
short duration, that optimally improve a tracking objective over a long time
horizon. Under mild assumptions, actions become linear feedback laws near
equilibria that permit stability analysis and performance-based parameter
selection. Globally, optimal actions are guaranteed existence and uniqueness.
By sequencing these actions on-line, in receding horizon fashion, the proposed
controller provides a min-max constrained response to state that avoids the
overhead typically required to impose control constraints. Benchmark examples

scaling behavior of R\'enyi entanglement entropies in the TDS. At finite

their associated pulsation modes. Firstly, we theoretically model the sequences
using linear, radial, non-adiabatic pulsation models and a population synthesis
model of the LMC red giants. Then, we use a semi-empirical approach to assign
modes to the pulsation sequences by exploiting observed multi-mode pulsators.
As a result of the combined approaches, we consistently find that sequences B
and C$^{\prime}$ both correspond to first overtone pulsation, although there
are some fundamental mode pulsators at low luminosities on both sequences. The
masses of these fundamental mode pulsators are larger at a given luminosity
than the mass of the first overtone pulsators. These two sequences B and
C$^{\prime}$ are separated by a small period interval in which large amplitude
pulsation in a long secondary period (sequence D variability) occurs, meaning
that the first overtone pulsation is not seen as the primary mode of pulsation.
Observationally, this leads to the splitting of the first overtone pulsation
sequence into the two observed sequences B and C$^{\prime}$. Our two
independent examinations also show that sequences A$^{\prime}$, A and C
correspond to third overtone, second overtone and fundamental mode pulsation,

essential role in biochemical networks. Spatial-stochastic simulations have
become a prominent tool for understanding how stochasticity at the microscopic
level influences the macroscopic behavior of such systems. However, while
particle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately
describe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used
to simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency
and accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact
algorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system
into M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical
solutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven
particle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and
space while retaining access to their state variables at any moment. Here we
present ""eGFRD2"", a new eGFRD version that implements the principle of eGFRD in
all dimensions, enabling efficient simulation of biochemical reaction-diffusion
processes in the 3D cytoplasm, on 2D planes representing membranes, and on 1D
elongated cylinders representative of, e.g., cytoskeletal tracks or DNA; in 1D,
it also incorporates convective motion used to model active transport. We find
that, for low particle densities, eGFRD2 is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster

  Our SPU outperforms the state-of-the-art implicit authentication mechanisms
in three main aspects: 1) SPU automatically learns the user's behavioral
pattern without requiring a large amount of training data (especially those of
other users) as previous methods did, making it more deployable. Towards this
end, we propose a weighted multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

computational power, making SPU efficient and usable even without network
access; and 3) our system can adaptively update a user's authentication model
to accommodate user's behavioral drift over time with negligible overhead.
  Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that SPU
can achieve authentication accuracy up to 96.3% with a very low latency of 2.4
milliseconds. It reduces the number of times a user has to do explicit

random class constitutes the liquid phase domain. In V-T theory, the liquid
atomic motion consists of prescribed vibrations in a random valley, plus
parameterized transit motions between valleys. The theory has been strongly
verified at 395.1K, a bit above melting. Our goal here is to test this theory
for its ability to explain the temperature ($T$) dependence of the mean square
displacement (MSD) at $T\leq395.1$K. The test results are positive at 204.6K,
where the time evolution equations, controlled by a transit rate decreasing
with $T$, accurately account for MD data for the MSD. To test at significantly
lower $T$, where the MD system does not remain in the liquid phase, the
theoretical liquid MSD is calibrated for $T\leq$ 204.6K. The Kob-Andersen (K-A)
dynamic slowing down graph is shown for liquid Na at $T\leq395.1$K. The
following observations are discussed in terms of the atomic motion. (a) The
agreement between pure vibrational motion and MD data for time correlation
functions in the vibrational interval is so far highly accurate. (b) The ""bump""
ahead of the plateau in the MSD at low $T$ is attributed to the vibrational
excess. (c) The K-A graph from theory for liquid Na, and the same graphs from
MD data for a liquid Lennard-Jones binary mixture (BMLJ) and liquid silica, are
identical in the ballistic period and in the purely diffusive time interval.
(d) The glass transition proceeds in the symmetric manifold. These and other

one dimensional PDE system and proving that they may become singular in finite
time for properly chosen initial data. We then prove local well-posedness for
the $3D$ Euler equations in a natural regularity class which includes
scale-invariant solutions. While these solutions have uniformly bounded
vorticity from time zero until right before the blow-up time, they do not have
finite energy. To remedy this, we cut off the scale-invariant data to ensure
finite energy and prove that the corresponding local solution must also become
singular in finite time. This paper focuses only on the analysis of the
scale-invariant solutions themselves and the proof that they can become
singular in finite time. The local well-posedness theorem and the cut-off
argument are very close to those in [JSI] and [EJB] and are left for the

without swirl in the exact same regularity classes and in the same domain. It
is quite possible that the methods we use can be adapted to establish

related to reductions of particular two-dimensional integrable lattice

the cluster algebra structure of the bilinear equations, allow a direct
construction of Poisson brackets, Lax pairs and first integrals for the

computed the corresponding quark condensates, meson spectra and their decay

their counterparts obtained using light-cone gauge, thus numerically verified
the gauge and Poincar\'{e} invariance of the 't Hooft model. Moreover, we have
explicitly confirmed that, as the meson gets more and more boosted, the large

The system models a Bose-Einstein condensate with a negative scattering length,
loaded in a double-pancake trap, combined with the in-plane HO potential. In
addition to that, the 1D version applies to the light transmission in a
dual-core waveguide with the Kerr nonlinearity and in-core confinement

symmetry breaking in 2D and 1D ground-state (GS, alias fundamental) modes, as
well as in 2D vortices and 1D dipole modes (the latter ones do not exist
without the HO potential). By means of the variational approximation and
numerical analysis, it is found that both the 2D and 1D systems give rise to a
symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB) of the supercrtical type. Stability of
symmetric states and asymmetric ones, produced by the SBB, is analyzed through
the computation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes, and verified by direct
simulations. The asymmetric GSs are always stable, while the stability region
for vortices shrinks and eventually disappears with the increase of the
linear-coupling constant, $ \kappa $. The SBB in the 2D system does not occur
if $\kappa $ is too large (at $\kappa >\kappa_{\max }$); in that case, the
two-component system behaves, essentially, as its single-component counterpart.
In the 1D system, both asymmetric and symmetric dipole modes feature an
additional oscillatory instability, unrelated to the symmetry breaking. This
instability occurs in several regions, which expand with the increase of
$\kappa $.

to Goldstone excitations on the boundary$-$the phonons of the solid. We derive
the quadratic action for the boundary phonons in the probe limit and show that,
when the mixed boundary conditions preserve conformal symmetry, the
longitudinal and transverse sound speeds are related to each other as expected
from effective field theory arguments. We then include backreaction and
calculate the free energy of the solidon for a particular choice of mixed
boundary conditions, corresponding to a relevant multi-trace deformation of the
boundary theory. We find such free energy to be lower than that of thermal AdS.

excite oscillatory modes in the other during a pericenter passage, resulting in
energy exchange between the modes and the binary orbit. These modes exhibit one
of three behaviors over multiple passages: low-amplitude oscillations, large
amplitude oscillations corresponding to a resonance between the orbital
frequency and the mode frequency, and chaotic growth. We study these phenomena
with an iterative map, fully exploring how the mode evolution depends on the
pericenter distance and other parameters. In addition, we show that the
dissipation of mode energy results in a quasi-steady state, with gradual
orbital decay punctuated by resonances, even in systems where the mode
amplitude would initially grow stochastically. A newly captured star around a
black hole can experience significant orbital decay and heating due to the

stellar mass growth over cosmic time. Recent observational work hints at the
possibility that the overall contribution of `major' mergers (mass ratios
$\gtrsim$1:4) to cosmic stellar mass growth may be small, because they enhance
star formation rates by relatively small amounts at high redshift, when much of
today's stellar mass was assembled. However, the heterogeneity and relatively
small size of today's datasets, coupled with the difficulty in identifying
genuine mergers, makes it challenging to $\textit{empirically}$ quantify the
merger contribution to stellar mass growth. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to comprehensively quantify the
contribution of mergers to the star formation budget over the lifetime of the
Universe. We show that: (1) both major and minor mergers enhance star formation
to similar amounts, (2) the fraction of star formation directly attributable to
merging is small at all redshifts (e.g. $\sim$35 and $\sim$20 per cent at
z$\sim$3 and z$\sim$1 respectively) and (3) only $\sim$25 per cent of today's
stellar mass is directly attributable to galaxy mergers over cosmic time. Our
results suggest that smooth accretion, not merging, is the dominant driver of
stellar mass growth over the lifetime of the Universe.

analytically the physical properties of ultra-spinning exotic compact objects
with dimensionless angular momenta in the complementary regime ${\bar a}>1$. It
is proved that ultra-spinning reflecting compact objects with dimensionless

$\sqrt{1-[{{m}/{(l+2)}}]^2}\leq|{\bar a}|^{-1}<1$ are characterized by a finite

between dark matter and radiation suppresses the matter power spectrum at small
scales and can explain the apparent discrepancies between $\Lambda$CDM
predictions of the matter power spectrum and direct measurements of Large Scale

we enlarge the parameter space of our previous model and allow for an arbitrary
fraction of the dark matter to be interacting and 2. we update the data sets
used in our fits, most importantly we include LSS data with full $k$-dependence
to explore the sensitivity of current data to the shape of the matter power

are not yet precise enough to clearly distinguish two limits of the model with
different predicted shapes for the linear matter power spectrum. In two

  We analyzed the BCG Tololo 1937-423 using optical integral field spectroscopy
with VIMOS at the Very Large Telescope to probe its morphology, stellar
content, nebular excitation and ionization properties, and the kinematics of
its warm ionized gas.
  We found that Tololo 1937-423 is currently undergoing an extended starburst,
with nine major $H\alpha$ clumps. The galaxy presents a single continuum peak
that is not cospatial with any knot in emission lines, indicating at least two
relatively recent episodes of SF. The inhomogeneous dust distribution reaches
its maximum roughly at the position of the continuum peak. We found shocked
regions in the galaxy outer regions and at the edges of the SF knots. The
oxygen abundance is similar in all the SF regions, suggesting a chemically
homogeneous ionized interstellar medium over spatial scales of several kpc. The
ionized gas kinematics displays an overall regular rotation around a
northwest-southeast axis.
  The morphology of the galaxy and the two different episodes of SF suggest a
scenario of triggered (induced by supernova shock waves) SF acting in Tololo
1937-423. The inferred ages for the different SF episodes (~13-80 Myr for the
central post-starburst and 5-7 Myr for the ongoing SF) are consistent with
triggered SF, with the most recent SF episode caused by the collective effect
of stellar winds and supernova explosions from the central post-starburst. The
velocity dispersion pattern, with higher velocity dispersions found at the
edges of the SF regions, and shocked regions in the galaxy, also favor this
scenario.

this context, the stability region of the two-user BC is characterized for the
general decoding case. Then, assuming two different decoding schemes the

maximizing the saturated throughput of the queue, whose packets does not

comprehension of the mechanisms affecting their population dynamic is of
fundamental importance. As experimentally documented, the proper development of
a colony is related to the nest temperature, whose value is maintained around
the optimal value if the colony population is sufficiently large. Then, the
environmental temperature, the way in which this influence the nest temperature
and the colony population size, are variables closely linked to each other and
deserve to be taken into account in a model that aims to describe the
population dynamics. In the present study, as first step, the continuous-time
autonomous system proposed by Khoury, Myerscoug and Barron (KMB) in 2011 was
approximated by means a Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme in order to
obtain a set of autonomous difference equations. Subsequently, with the aim to
introduce the seasonal effects, a nonautonomous version (NAKMB) was proposed
and formulated in discrete-time domain via a NSFD scheme, by introducing a
time-dependent formulation for the queen bee laying rate and the recruitment
rate coefficients. By means the phase-plane analysis was possible to deduce
that, with an appropriate choice of the parameters, the NAKMB model admits both
a limit cycle at nonzero population size and an equilibrium point marking the
colony collapse, depending on the initial population size.

the large-scale projected sky distribution of $g$-dropout galaxies over an area
of $121\,\mathrm{deg^2}$, and identify 216 large-scale overdense regions
($>4\sigma$ overdensity significance) that are good protocluster candidates. Of
these, 37 are located within $8\,\mathrm{arcmin}$ ($3.4\,\mathrm{physicalMpc}$)
from other protocluster candidates of higher overdensity, and are expected to
merge into a single massive structure by $z=0$. Therefore, we find 179 unique
protocluster candidates in our survey. A cosmological simulation that includes
projection effects predicts that more than 76\% of these candidates will evolve
into galaxy clusters with halo masses of at least $10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$ by
$z=0$. The unprecedented size of our protocluster candidate catalog allowed us
to perform, for the first time, an angular clustering analysis of the
systematic sample of protocluster candidates. We find a correlation length of
$35.0\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. The relation between correlation length and
number density of $z\sim3.8$ protocluster candidates is consistent with the
prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the correlation length is similar to
that of rich clusters in the local universe. This result suggests that our
protocluster candidates are tracing similar spatial structures as those
expected of the progenitors of rich clusters and enhances the confidence that
our method to identify protoclusters at high redshifts is robust. In the coming
years, our protocluster search will be extended to the entire HSC-SSP Wide sky

galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their mildly-relativistic speeds (~0.1-0.3c) and
are thought to significantly contribute to galactic evolution via AGN feedback.
Their nature and launching mechanism are however not well understood. Recently,
we have discovered the presence of a variable UFO in the narrow-line Seyfert 1
IRAS 13224-3809. The UFO varies in response to the brightness of the source. In
this work we perform flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy to study the variability
of the UFO and found that the ionisation parameter is correlated with the
luminosity. In the brightest states the gas is almost completely ionised by the
powerful radiation field and the UFO is hardly detected. This agrees with our
recent results obtained with principal component analysis. We might have found
the tip of the iceberg: the high ionisation of the outflowing gas may explain
why it is commonly difficult to detect UFOs in AGN and possibly suggest that we
may underestimate their actual feedback. We have also found a tentative
correlation between the outflow velocity and the luminosity, which is expected
from theoretical predictions of radiation-pressure driven winds. This trend is
rather marginal due to the Fe XXV-XXVI degeneracy. Further work is needed to
break such degeneracy through time-resolved spectroscopy.

the effect of its application to intrinsically non-spherical objects. For this
purpose we use a model of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy formed in a numerical
simulation of a major merger of two disky dwarfs. The shape of the stellar
component of the merger remnant is axisymmetric and prolate which allows us to
identify and measure the bias caused by observing the spheroidal galaxy along
different directions, especially the longest and shortest principal axis. The
modelling is based on mock data generated from the remnant that are
observationally available for dwarfs: projected positions and line-of-sight
velocities of the stars. In order to obtain a reliable tool while keeping the
number of parameters low we parametrize the total mass distribution as a
radius-dependent mass-to-light ratio with just two free parameters we aim to
constrain. Our study shows that if the total density profile is known, the
true, radially increasing anisotropy profile can be well recovered for the
observations along the longest axis whereas the data along the shortest axis
lead to the inference an incorrect, isotropic model. On the other hand, if the
density profile is derived from the method as well, the anisotropy is always
underestimated but the total mass profile is well recovered for the data along
the shortest axis whereas for the longest axis the mass content is
overestimated.

strongly influenced by photoionization by Ly-alpha emission. The emission in
the C I 135.58 line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line
forming region is optically thick. The Doppler shift of the line correlates
strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is
typically located at 1.5 Mm height. With IRIS the C I 135.58 line is usually
observed together with the O I 135.56 line, and from the Doppler shift of both
lines, we obtain the velocity difference between the line forming regions of
the two lines. From the ratio of the C I/O I line core intensity, we can
determine the distance between the C I and the O I forming layers. Combined
with the velocity difference, the velocity gradient at mid-chromospheric

for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in
comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film

improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1%, specificity: 80.1%). On a

INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning
and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These
findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to
attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold
tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) frequency bands provide an opportunity for much
wider channel bandwidth compared with the traditional sub-6 GHz band.
Communication at mm-Waves is, however, quite challenging due to the severe
propagation path loss. To cope with this problem, directional beamforming both
at the Base Station (BS) side and at the user side is necessary in order to
establish a strong path conveying enough signal power. Finding such beamforming
directions is referred to as the Beam Alignment (BA) and is known to be a
challenging problem. This paper presents a new scheme for efficient BA, based
on the estimated second order channel statistics. As a result, our proposed
algorithm is highly robust to variations of the channel time-dynamics compared
with other proposed approaches based on the estimation of the channel
coefficients, rather than of their second-order statistics. In the proposed
scheme, the BS probes the channel in the Downlink (DL) letting each user to
estimate its own path direction. All the users within the BS coverage are
trained simultaneously, without requiring ""beam refinement"" with multiple
interactive rounds of Downlink/Uplink (DL/UL) transmissions, as done in other
schemes. Thus, the training overhead of the proposed BA scheme is independent
of the number of users in the system. We pose the channel estimation at the
user side as a Compressed Sensing (CS) of a non-negative signal and use the
recently developed Non-Negative Least Squares(NNLS) technique to solve it
efficiently. The performance of our proposed algorithm is assessed via computer
simulation in a relevant mm-Wave scenario. The results illustrate that our
approach is superior to the state-of-the-art BA schemes proposed in the
literature in terms of training overhead in multi-user scenarios and robustness
to variations in the channel dynamics.

overestimation. The analyses are based on the 50th percentile queue lengths for
data collected at four signalized intersections along a corridor in 4 time
periods (off peak period and AM, Noon and PM peak periods). Based on the
statistical test results, arrival type did not play a role in overestimations.
However, there is a significant relationship between the overestimations on
minor and major street and different ranges of X. On minor streets, about 59%
of the overestimations are at X values less than half; while near 23% of the
overestimations are at oversaturation condition with X values greater than 1.
The relationship between amount of overestimations and degree of saturation
should be established based on the numerical amount of overestimations versus X

between the relative amount of overestimations and X values, resulted in a
wrong idea of the real world condition. There was a significant correlation

Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission among Men who have Sex with Men

Quebec HIV genotyping program sequence database now includes viral sequences
from close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as MSMs. In this paper,
we investigate clustering in those data by comparing results from several
methods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods,
and two more recent algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces
a measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast
distance-based approach. We estimate cluster growth by focusing on recent cases
in the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage. Results. The analyses reveal
considerable overlap between cluster estimates obtained from conventional
methods. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus rely on different cluster definitions
and as a result, suggest moderately different partitions. All estimates lead to
similar conclusions about cluster expansion: several large clusters have
experienced sizeable growth, and a few new transmission clusters are likely
emerging. Conclusions. The lack of a gold standard measure for clustering
quality makes picking a best estimate among those proposed difficult. Work
aiming to refine clustering criteria would be required to improve estimates.
Nevertheless, the results unanimously stress the role that clusters play in
promoting HIV incidence among MSMs.

The observations detected $\sim$ 23$\%$ more flux than previous ATCA
observations. We fit a tilted ring model to the HI velocity field to derive the
rotation curve (RC). The KAT-7 observations allow the measurement of the
rotation curve of NGC 6822 out to 5.8 kpc, $\sim$ 1 kpc further than existing
measurements.
  NGC 6822 is seen to be dark matter dominated at all radii. The
observationally motivated pseudo-isothermal dark matter (DM) halo model
reproduces well the observed RC while the Navarro Frank-White DM model gives a
poor fit to the data. We find the best fit mass to light ratio (M/L) of 0.12
$\pm$ 0.01 which is consistent with the literature. The Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) gives a poor fit to our data.
  We derive the star formation threshold in NGC 6822 using the HI and H$\alpha$
data. The critical gas densities were calculated for gravitational
instabilities using the Toomre-Q criterion and the cloud-growth criterion. We
found that in regions of star formation, the cloud-growth criterion explains
star formation better than the Toomre-Q criterion. This shows that the local
shear rate could be a key player in cloud formation for irregular galaxies such

between datasets that is directly applicable to HEP classification problems.
The most common HEP classification task is to use $n$ values (variables) for an
object (event) to estimate the probability that it is signal vs. background.
Most techniques first use known samples to identify differences in how signal
and background events are distributed throughout the $n$-dimensional variable
space, then use those differences to classify events of unknown type.
Qualitatively, the greater the differences, the more effectively one can
classify events of unknown type. We will show that the Mutual Information (MI)
between the $n$-dimensional signal-background mixed distribution and the
answers for the known events, tells us the upper-limit of separation for that
set of $n$ variables. We will then compare that value to the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence between the output distributions from a classifier to test whether
it has extracted all possible information from the input variables. We will
also discuss speed improvements to a standard method for calculating MI.
  Our approach will allow one to: a) quickly measure the maximum possible
effectiveness of a large number of potential discriminating variables
independent of any specific classification algorithm, b) identify potential
discriminating variables that are redundant, and c) determine whether a
classification algorithm has achieved the maximum possible separation. We test
these claims first on simple distributions and then on Monte Carlo samples
generated for Supersymmetry and Higgs searches. In all cases, we were able to
a) predict the separation that a classification algorithm would reach, b)
identify variables that carried no additional discriminating power, and c)
identify whether an algorithm had reached the optimum separation. Our code is
publicly available.

Einstein's theory of general relativity. This is motivated by the ongoing
advance in development of quantum sensors for applications in geodesy including
quantum gravimeters and gradientometers, atomic clocks and fiber optics for
making ultra-precise measurements of the geoid and multipolar structure of the
Earth's gravitational field. At the same time, VLBI, SLR, and GNSS have
achieved an unprecedented level of accuracy in measuring coordinates of the
reference points of the ITRF and the world height system. The main geodetic
reference standard is a normal gravity field represented in the Newtonian
gravity by the field of a Maclaurin ellipsoid. The present paper extends the
concept of the normal gravity field to the realm of general relativity. We
focus our attention on the calculation of the first post-Newtonian
approximation of the normal field that is sufficient for applications. We show
that in general relativity the level surface of the uniformly rotating fluid is
no longer described by the Maclaurin ellipsoid but is an axisymmetric spheroid
of the forth order. We parametrize the mass density distribution and derive the
post-Newtonian normal gravity field of the rotating spheroid which is given in
a closed form by a finite number of the ellipsoidal harmonics. We employ
transformation from the ellipsoidal to spherical coordinates to deduce the
post-Newtonian multipolar expansion of the metric tensor given in terms of
scalar and vector gravitational potentials of the rotating spheroid. We compare
these expansions with that of the normal gravity field generated by the Kerr
metric and demonstrate that the Kerr metric has a fairly limited application in
relativistic geodesy. Finally, we derive the post-Newtonian generalization of
the Somigliana formula for the gravity field on the reference ellipsoid.

activity, with large spin-ups interrupting its decelerating rotation every ~100
days. We present nearly 13 years of timing data from this pulsar, obtained with
the {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}. We discovered 22 new glitches and
performed a consistent analysis of all 45 glitches detected in the complete
data span. Our results corroborate the previously reported strong correlation
between glitch spin-up size and the time to the next glitch, a relation that
has not been observed so far in any other pulsar. The spin evolution is
dominated by the glitches, which occur at a rate ~3.5 per year, and the
post-glitch recoveries, which prevail the entire inter-glitch intervals. This
distinctive behaviour provides invaluable insights into the physics of
glitches. The observations can be explained with a multi-component model which
accounts for the dynamics of the neutron superfluid present in the crust and
core of neutron stars. We place limits on the moment of inertia of the
component responsible for the spin-up and, ignoring differential rotation, the
velocity difference it can sustain with the crust. Contrary to its rapid
decrease between glitches, the spin-down rate increased over the 13 years, and
we find the long-term braking index $n_{\rm l}=-1.22(4)$, the only negative
braking index seen in a young pulsar. We briefly discuss the plausible
interpretations of this result, which is in stark contrast to the predictions
of standard models of pulsar spin-down.

infection in the presence of combination therapy that includes within-host
infectious dynamics. The deterministic model requires us to analyze asymptotic
stability of two distinct steady states, disease-free and endemic equilibria.
Previous results have focused on investigating the global asymptotic stability
of the trivial steady state using an implicit finite-difference method which
generates a system of difference equations. We, instead, provide analytic
solutions and long term attractive behavior for the endemic steady state using
the theory of difference equations. The dynamics of estimated model is
appropriately determined by a certain quantity threshold maintaining the immune
response to a sufficient level. The result also indicates that a forward
bifurcation in the model happens when the disease-free equilibrium loses its
stability and a stable endemic equilibrium appears as the basic reproduction
number exceeds unity. In this scenario, the classical requirement of the
reproduction number being less than unity becomes a necessary and sufficient
condition for disease mitigation. When the associated reproduction number is in
excess of unity, a stable endemic equilibrium emerges with an unstable
disease-free equilibrium (leading to the persistence and existence of HIV
within the infected individuals). The attractivity of the model reveals that
the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under certain
assumptions. A comparison between the continuous and estimated discrete models
is also provided to have a clear perception in understanding the behavioral
dynamics of disease modelling. Finally, we show that the associated estimation
method is very robust in the sense of numerical stability since the equilibria
and the stability conditions are independent of the time step.

Dust mass and mass accretion rate in Chamaeleon I are correlated with a slope
close to linear, similar to the one recently identified in Lupus. We
investigate the effect of stellar mass and find that the intrinsic scatter
around the best-fit Mdust-Mstar and Macc-Mstar relations is uncorrelated. Disks
with a constant alpha viscosity can fit the observed relations between dust
mass, mass accretion rate, and stellar mass, but over-predict the strength of
the correlation between disk mass and mass accretion rate when using standard
initial conditions. We find two possible solutions. 1) The observed scatter in
Mdust and Macc is not primoridal, but arises from additional physical processes
or uncertainties in estimating the disk gas mass. Most likely grain growth and
radial drift affect the observable dust mass, while variability on large time
scales affects the mass accretion rates. 2) The observed scatter is primordial,
but disks have not evolved substantially at the age of Lupus and Chamaeleon I
due to a low viscosity or a large initial disk radius. More accurate estimates
of the disk mass and gas disk sizes in a large sample of protoplanetary disks,
either through direct observations of the gas or spatially resolved
multi-wavelength observations of the dust with ALMA, are needed to discriminate
between both scenarios or to constrain alternative angular momentum transport
mechanisms such as MHD disk winds.

naturally a correlation between mass accretion rate and disc mass that is

all k clusters in fewer than O(n^2ln(n)) operations. This is a marked
improvement over the classic spectral clustering algorithm, which is unable to
find a single cluster at a time and takes approximately O(n^3) operations to
find all k clusters. Moreover, we are able to provide robust guarantees of
success for the case where G is drawn at random from the Stochastic Block
Model, a popular model for graphs with clusters. Extensive numerical results
are also provided, showing the efficacy of our algorithm on both synthetic and
real-world data sets.

undirected graphical model, which is based on an $l_1$ regularization
technique. The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy
GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply
thresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of
sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is
shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the
thresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and
inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the
smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too
small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method---as a
conic optimization problem---has an explicit closed-form solution if the
thresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is
then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found
to obtain an approximate solution of GL. Furthermore, it is shown that the
approximation error of the derived explicit formula decreases exponentially
fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity
graph. The developed results are demonstrated on synthetic data, functional MRI
data, traffic flows for transportation networks, and massive randomly generated
data sets. We show that the proposed method can obtain an accurate
approximation of the GL for instances with the sizes as large as $80,000\times
80,000$ (more than 3.2 billion variables) in less than 30 minutes on a standard
laptop computer running MATLAB, while other state-of-the-art methods do not

new observations of TRAPPIST-1 Ly-$\alpha$ line during the transit of
TRAPPIST-1c show an evolution of the star emission over three months,
preventing us from assessing the presence of an extended hydrogen exosphere.
Based on the current knowledge of the stellar irradiation, we investigated the
likely history of water loss in the system. Planets b to d might still be in a
runaway phase, and planets within the orbit of TRAPPIST-1g could have lost more
than 20 Earth oceans after 8 Gyr of hydrodynamic escape. However, TRAPPIST-1e
to h might have lost less than 3 Earth oceans if hydrodynamic escape stopped
once they entered the habitable zone. We caution that these estimates remain
limited by the large uncertainty on the planet masses. They likely represent
upper limits on the actual water loss because our assumptions maximize the
XUV-driven escape, while photodissociation in the upper atmospheres should be
the limiting process. Late-stage outgassing could also have contributed
significant amounts of water for the outer, more massive planets after they
entered the habitable zone. While our results suggest that the outer planets
are the best candidates to search for water with the JWST, they also highlight
the need for theoretical studies and complementary observations in all

convert the proposed problem into a form that allows us to bring current
advances in deep learning to bear upon this problem. We describe two specific
applications to demonstrate this approach: prediction of probability
distributions for multi-class image classification, and prediction of
illumination-invariant subspaces from a single face-image via regression on the
Grassmannian. These applications show the generality of the proposed framework,
and result in improved performance over baselines that ignore the geometry of
the output space. In addition to solving this specific problem, we believe this
paper opens new lines of enquiry centered on the implications of Riemannian
geometry on deep architectures.

size-consistency corrections of the initiator adaptation (i-MSQMC) in three

IRAS 12112+0305, 14348-1447, and 22491-1808. The outflows are mapped on scales
of 0.7-1.6 kpc, show typical outflow velocities of 300-500 km/s, and appear to
originate from the nuclear region. The outflows comprise hot molecular gas
masses of ~6-8x10$^3$ M(sun). Assuming a hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio
of 6x10$^{-5}$, as found in nearby luminous IR galaxies, the total (hot+cold)
molecular gas mass in these outflows is expected to be ~1x10$^{8}$ M(sun). This
translates into molecular mass outflow rates of ~30-85 M(sun)/yr, which is a
factor of a few lower than the star formation rate in these ULIRGs. In
addition, most of the outflowing molecular gas does not reach the escape
velocity of these merger systems, which implies that the bulk of the outflowing
molecular gas is re-distributed within the system and thus remains available
for future star formation. The fastest H$_{2}$ outflow is seen in the
Compton-thick AGN of IRAS 14348-1447, reaching a maximum outflow velocity of
~900 km/s. Another ULIRG, IRAS 17208-0014, shows asymmetric H$_{2}$ line
profiles different from the outflows seen in the other three ULIRGs. We discuss
several alternative explanations for its line asymmetries, including a very
gentle galactic wind, internal gas dynamics, low-velocity gas outside the disk,
or two superposed gas disks. We do not detect the hot molecular counterpart to
the outflow previously detected in CO(2-1) in IRAS 17208-0014, but we note that
our SINFONI data are not sensitive enough to detect this outflow if it has a
small hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio of < 9x10$^{-6}$.

Condition (WEC) is preserved in all well-defined regions of the spacetime. (The

but it is never explicitly violated.) Parallel to the wire, ""effective""
superluminal travel is possible, in that the wire may be used as a shortcut
between distant regions of spacetime. Our purpose in presenting the
superluminal aspects of the wire is to dispel the commonly held view that
explicit WEC violation is necessary for effective superluminal travel, whereas
in truth the strictures against superluminal travel are more complicated. We
also demonstrate how the existence of such ""wires"" could create CTCs. We
present a model spacetime which contains two wires which are free to move
relative to each other. This spacetime is asymptotically flat: It becomes a
Minkowski spacetime a finite distance away from each of the wires. The CTCs
under investigation do not need to enter the wires' singularities, and can be
confined to regions that are weak-field: This means that if these wires were
physically possible, they would present causality problems even in nonsingular,
energetically realistic regions of the spacetime. We conclude that the Weak
Energy Condition alone is not sufficient to prevent superluminal travel in
asymptotically flat spacetimes.

takes into account the unbound nucleon states are considered self-consistently.
The mean field potentials obtained in the FTDHB calculations are fit by
Woods-Saxon (WS) potentials to examine how the WS parameters are related to the
energy splitting of the pseudospin pairs as the temperature increases. We find
that the nuclear potential surface diffuseness is the main driver for the

conclude that pseudospin symmetry is better realized when the nuclear
temperature increases. The results confirm the findings of previous works using
RMF theory at $T=0$, namely that the correlation between the pseudospin
splitting and the parameters of the Woods-Saxon potentials implies that
pseudospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in nuclei. We show that the

causes a substantial change of the Maxwell stress tensor and, under certain
circumstances, may cause the electromagnetic stresses to act effectively as
""negative pressure."" The paper describes a model where this negative pressure
imitates gravitational pull and may produce forces comparable to gravity and
even become dominant. The effect is associated with the random magnetic fields
in the galactic disk with a scale exceeding the photon Compton wavelength. The
presence of a weaker regular field does not affect the forces under
consideration. The stresses act predominantly on the interstellar gas and cause
an additional force pulling the gas towards the center and towards the galactic
plane. The stars do not experience any significant direct force but get
involved in this process via a ""recycling loop"" where rapidly evolving massive
stars are formed from the gas undergoing galactic rotation and then lose their
masses back to the gas within a time shorter than roughly 1/6 of the rotation
period. This makes their dynamics inseparable from that of the rotating gas.
The lighter, slowly evolving stars, as soon as they are formed, lose connection
to the gas and are confined within the galaxy only gravitationally. Numerical
examples based on the parameters of our galaxy reveal both opportunities and
challenges of this model and motivate further analysis. The critical issue is
the plausibility of formation of the irregular magnetic field that would be
force free. Another challenge is developing a predictive model of the evolution
of the gaseous and stellar population of the galaxy under the aforementioned

  Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2017)",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computing a minimum-area planar straight-line drawing of a graph is known to
be NP-hard for planar graphs, even when restricted to outerplanar graphs.
However, the complexity question is open for trees. Only a few hardness results
are known for straight-line drawings of trees under various restrictions such
as edge length or slope constraints. On the other hand, there exist
polynomial-time algorithms for computing minimum-width (resp., minimum-height)
upward drawings of trees, where the height (resp., width) is unbounded.
  In this paper we take a major step in understanding the complexity of the
area minimization problem for strictly-upward drawings of trees, which is one
of the most common styles for drawing rooted trees. We prove that given a
rooted tree $T$ and a $W\times H$ grid, it is NP-hard to decide whether $T$
admits a strictly-upward (unordered) drawing in the given grid.

relying on supervised machine learning algorithms. Because data can often be
unseen, and because traditional machine learning algorithms are trained in a
supervised manner, unsupervised adaptation techniques must be used to adapt the
model to the unseen data conditions. However, unsupervised adaptation is often
challenging, as one must generate some hypothesis given a model and then use
that hypothesis to bootstrap the model to the unseen data conditions.
Unfortunately, reliability of such hypotheses is often poor, given the mismatch
between the training and testing datasets. In such cases, a model hypothesis
confidence measure enables performing data selection for the model adaptation.
Underlying this approach is the fact that for unseen data conditions, data
variability is introduced to the model, which the model propagates to its
output decision, impacting decision reliability. In a fully connected network,
this data variability is propagated as distortions from one layer to the next.
This work aims to estimate the propagation of such distortion in the form of
network activation entropy, which is measured over a short- time running window
on the activation from each neuron of a given hidden layer, and these
measurements are then used to compute summary entropy. This work demonstrates
that such an entropy measure can help to select data for unsupervised model
adaptation, resulting in performance gains in speech recognition tasks. Results
from standard benchmark speech recognition tasks show that the proposed
approach can alleviate the performance degradation experienced under unseen
data conditions by iteratively adapting the model to the unseen datas acoustic
condition.

achieved with an acquisition sampling rate that preserves the underlying
physiological information on the millisecond time scale (1000 Hz rather than 4
Hz). For such acquisition, fetal ECG (fECG) is required, rather than the
ultrasound to derive FHR. We tested one recently developed algorithm, SAVER,
and two widely applied algorithms to extract fECG from a single channel
maternal ECG signal recorded over the xyphoid process rather than the routine
abdominal signal. Approach: At 126dG, ECG was attached to near-term ewe and
fetal shoulders, manubrium and xyphoid processes (n=12). FECG served as the
ground-truth to which the fetal ECG signal extracted from the
simultaneously-acquired maternal ECG was compared. All fetuses were in good
health during surgery (pH 7.29+/-0.03, pO2 33.2+/-8.4, pCO2 56.0+/-7.8, O2Sat

single lead fECG extraction algorithm could not extract fECG from the maternal
ECG signal over the xyphoid process with the F1 less than 50%. Significance:
The applied fECG extraction algorithms might be unsuitable for the maternal ECG
signal over the xyphoid process, or the latter does not contain strong enough
fECG signal, although the lead is near the mother's abdomen. Fetal sheep model
is widely used to mimic various fetal conditions, yet ECG recordings in a
public data set form are not available to test the predictive ability of fECG
and FHR. We are making this data set openly available to other researchers to
foster non-invasive fECG acquisition in this animal model.

polarization obtained from the gas correction show that the polarimetric
properties of the dust in this low-polarization comet are not different from
those in high-polarization comets. In this process, the cometocentric distance
dependence of polarization has disappeared. We also find that the $R_{\rm

clusters by comparing deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry with suitable
multimass dynamical models. For a subset of 29 clusters with available radial
velocity information we were also able to determine dynamical parameters,
mass-to-light ratios and the mass fraction of dark remnants. The derived global
mass functions are well described by single power-laws in the mass range $0.2 <
m/M_\odot < 0.8$ with mass function slopes $\alpha>-1$. Less evolved clusters
show deviations from a single-power law, indicating that the original shape of
their mass distribution was not a power-law. We find a tight anticorrelation
between the present-day mass function slopes and the half-mass relaxation
times, which can be understood if clusters started from the same universal IMF
and internal dynamical evolution is the main driver in shaping the present-day
mass functions. Alternatively, IMF differences correlated with the present-day
half-mass relaxation time are needed to explain the observed correlation. The
large range of mass function slopes seen for our clusters implies that most
globular clusters are dynamically highly evolved, a fact that seems difficult
to reconcile with standard estimates for the dynamical evolution of clusters.
The mass function slopes also correlate with the dark remnant fractions
indicating a preferential retention of massive remnants in clusters subject to
high mass-loss rates.

functions (IMFs), black hole retention fractions and orbital parameters in the
parent galaxy. We find that the present-day mass functions of globular clusters
agree well with those expected for star clusters starting with Kroupa or
Chabrier IMFs, and are incompatible with clusters starting with single
power-law mass functions for the low-mass stars. The amount of mass segregation
seen in the globular clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt (2017) can be
fully explained by two-body relaxation driven mass segregation from initially
unsegregated star clusters. Based on the present-day global mass functions, we
expect that a typical globular cluster in our sample has lost about 75% of its
mass since formation, while the most evolved clusters have already lost more
than 90% of their initial mass and should dissolve within the next 1 to 2 Gyr.
Most clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt also show a large difference
between their central and global MF slopes, implying that the majority of
Galactic globular clusters is either near or already past core collapse. The
strong mass segregation seen in most clusters also implies that only a small
fraction of all black holes formed in globular clusters still reside in them.

Sigma and shear-constrained model. Wall-resolved LES simulations of channel
flows are performed with a finite volume code at shear Reynolds number Re_\tau

sensitive to the SGS model. Through the analysis of the mean velocity, the

attention for its great theoretical and practical applications in many fields.
Traditional methods, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality,
closeness centrality, and coreness centrality, have more or less disadvantages
in detecting influential nodes, which have been illustrated in related
literatures. Recently, the h-index, which is utilized to measure both the
productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar,
has been introduced to the network world to evaluate a node's spreading
ability. However, this method assigns too many nodes with the same value, which
leads to a resolution limit problem in distinguishing the real influence of
these nodes. In this paper, we propose a local h-index centrality (LH-index)
method for identifying and ranking influential nodes in networks. The LH-index
method simultaneously takes into account of h-index values of the node itself
and its neighbors, which is based on the idea that a node connects to more
influential nodes will also be influential. According to the simulation results

proposed model as ArtGAN. One of the key innovation of ArtGAN is that, the
gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the label (randomly assigned to each
generated image) is back-propagated from the categorical discriminator to the
generator. With the feedback from the label information, the generator is able
to learn more efficiently and generate image with better quality. Inspired by
recent works, an autoencoder is incorporated into the categorical discriminator
for additional complementary information. Last but not least, we introduce a
novel strategy to improve the image quality. In the experiments, we evaluate
ArtGAN on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 via ablation studies. The empirical results
showed that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art results on
CIFAR-10 in terms of Inception score. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that ArtGAN
is able to generate plausible-looking images on Oxford-102 and CUB-200, as well
as able to draw realistic artworks based on style, artist, and genre. The

deep learning systems. In the prevailing architecture, the convolution
operation is performed with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) electronically in
GPUs. The parallelism of GPUs provides an efficiency over CPUs, however both
approaches being electronic are bound by the speed and power limits of the
interconnect delay inside the circuits. Here we present a silicon photonics
based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses the phase
property of light to perform FFTs efficiently. Our all-optical FFT is based on
nested Mach-Zender Interferometers, directional couplers, and phase shifters,
with backend electro-optic modulators for sampling. The FFT delay depends only
on the propagation delay of the optical signal through the silicon photonics
structures. Designing and analyzing the performance of a convolutional neural
network deployed with our on-chip optical FFT, we find dramatic improvements by
up to 10^4 when compared to state-of-the-art GPUs when exploring a compounded
figure-of-merit given by power per convolution over area. At a high level, this
performance is enabled by mapping the desired mathematical function, an FFT,
synergistically onto hardware, in this case optical delay interferometers.

the scheme not only protects the watermark information but also the embedding
positions. To achieve a higher level of security, we propose a sub key
generation mechanism based on the singular value decomposition and hash
function, where sub keys depend on both the main key and the feature codes of
the original image. The different sub keys ensure that the embedding positions
are randomly selected for different original images. Watermark is embedded in
the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the scrambled original
image. Simulation results show that such embedded method resolves well the
contradiction of imperceptibility and robustness. Based on good correlation
properties of chaotic sequences, we design a detection method, which can
accurately compute geometric transformation (rotation and translation
transformations) parameters. The security analysis, including key space
analysis, key sensitivity analysis, cryptanalysis, and the comparison results
demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme also achieves high security.

increasingly popular human-computer interaction method, and have turned various
systems into voice controllable systems(VCS). Prior work on attacking VCS shows
that the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control
the systems. Hidden voice commands, though hidden, are nonetheless audible. In
this work, we design a completely inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that
modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers (e.g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve
inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the
modulated low frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated,
recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems.
We validate DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including
Siri, Google Now, Samsung S Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By
injecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few
proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime
call on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode,
and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose
hardware and software defense solutions. We validate that it is feasible to
detect DolphinAttack by classifying the audios using supported vector machine
(SVM), and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to
inaudible voice command attacks.

We present upper and lower bounds on the time required to complete the
estimation within a prescribed tolerance $\delta$. The lower bound is given on
the basis of the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, where the quantum Fisher information
is bounded by the squared evolution time. The upper bound is obtained by an
explicit construction of estimation procedures. By comparing the cases with
different numbers of Hamiltonian channels, we also find that the few-channel

entanglement are equivalent in that they require the same amount of time
resource up to a constant factor.

matrix polynomial (LMP). Such a polynomial is known as determinantal
polynomial. Determinantal polynomials can characterize the feasible sets of
semidefinite programming problems that motivates us to deal with this problem.
We introduce the notion of generalized mixed discriminant of matrices which
translates the determinantal representation problem into computing a point of a
real variety of a specified ideal. We develop an algorithm to determine such a
determinantal representation of a bivariate polynomial of degree $d$. Then we
propose a heuristic method to obtain a monic symmetric determinantal

new classes of Cech closure structures on metric spaces, graphs, and simplicial
complexes, and we show how each of these cases gives rise to an interesting
homotopy theory. In particular, we show that there exists a natural family of
Cech closure structures on metric spaces which produces a non-trivial homotopy
theory for finite metric spaces, i.e. point clouds, the spaces of interest in
topological data analysis. We then give a Cech closure structure to graphs and
simplicial complexes which may be used to construct a new combinatorial (as
opposed to topological) homotopy theory for each skeleton of those spaces. We
further show that there is a Seifert-van Kampen theorem for closure spaces, a
well-defined notion of persistent homotopy, and an associated interleaving
distance. As an illustration of the difference with the topological setting, we
calculate the fundamental group for the circle, `circular graphs', and the
wedge of circles endowed with different closure structures. Finally, we produce
a continuous map from the topological circle to `circular graphs' which, given
the appropriate closure structures, induces an isomorphism on the fundamental
groups.

Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the population of reactants at the top of the
free energy barrier separating them from the products. While energy dissipation
and quantum effects at the barrier top can potentially affect the transmission
coefficient entering the rate preexponential factor, much stronger dynamical
effects on the reaction barrier are caused by the breakdown of ergodicity for
populating the reaction barrier (violation of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics).
When the spectrum of medium modes coupled to the reaction coordinate includes
fluctuations slower than the reaction rate, such nuclear motions dynamically
freeze on the reaction time-scale and do not contribute to the activation
barrier. Here we consider the consequences of this scenario for electrode
reactions in slowly relaxing media. Changing electrode overpotential speeds
electrode electron transfer up, potentially cutting through the spectrum of
nuclear modes coupled to the reaction coordinate. The reorganization energy of
electrochemical electron transfer becomes a function of the electrode
overpotential, switching between the thermodynamic value at low rates to the
nonergodic limit at higher rates. The sharpness of this transition depends of
the relaxation spectrum of the medium. The reorganization energy experiences a
sudden drop with increasing overpotential for a medium with a Debye relaxation,
but becomes a much shallower function of the overpotential for media with
stretched exponential dynamics. The latter scenario characterizes electron
transfer in ionic liquids. The analysis of electrode reactions in
room-temperature ionic liquids shows that the magnitude of the free energy of
nuclear solvation is significantly below its thermodynamic limit.

(MRD) of short-period binaries from an observed sample of single-lined
spectroscopic binaries (SB1). The algorithm considers a class of parameterized
MRDs and finds the set of parameters that best fits the observed sample. The
algorithm consists of four parts. First, we define a new observable, the
`modified mass function', that can be calculated for each binary in the sample.
We show that the distribution of the modified mass function follows the shape
of the underlying MRD, turning it more advantageous than the previously used
mass function, reduced mass function or reduced mass function logarithm.
Second, we derive the likelihood of the sample of modified mass functions to be
observed given an assumed MRD. An MCMC search enables the algorithm to find the
parameters that best fit the observations. Third, we suggest to express the
unknown MRD by a linear combination of a basis of functions that spans the
possible MRDs. We suggest two such bases. Fourth, we show how to account for
the undetected systems that have an RV amplitude below a certain threshold.
Without the correction, this observational bias suppresses the derived MRD for
low mass ratios. Numerous simulations show that the algorithm works well with
either of the two suggested bases. The four parts of the algorithm are

create arbitrarily high center-of-mass (CM) energy if certain critical
conditions are satisfied. Most studies so far are confined in four-dimensional
spacetimes. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis on five-dimensional
Myers-Perry black holes and find some novel properties compared to
four-dimensional Kerr black holes. Firstly, we give a rigorous proof that
untrhigh energy collisions cannot occur near a five-dimensional nonextremal
black hole. Secondly, For extremal black holes, we find a critical condition on
the particles' parameters causing ultraenergetic collisions. Thirdly, when the
spacetime contains a naked singularity, we show that the CM energy could
diverge at the singularity if one of the particle just bounces back at the
singularity. Finally, we explore a special and important case where the naked
singularity just begins to form. Surprisingly, the ultraenergetic collisions do
not need any fine-turning in that case. However, we find that one of the
conserved angular momentums must be nonzero.

holistic faces, the proposed approach considers 3D facial components. It
segments a 2D gallery face into components, reconstructs the 3D surface for

segmentation is based on the landmarks located by a hierarchical algorithm that
combines the Faster R-CNN for face detection and the Reduced Tree Structured

revised VGG network. We study the performances with different settings on the

real-life data from an in-the-wild database, and both types of data combined.
We investigate the performances of the network when it is employed as a

results are completely equivalent to the well known ones, found by standard
field theoretical expansion around the fully connected model (Bray and Roberts

starting point is the original Hamiltonian of the model, with no need to define
an associated field theory, nor to know the initial values of the couplings,

new method can also be applied in the case of zero temperature, when the Bethe
model has a transition in field, contrary to the fully connected model that is
always in the spin glass phase. Sharing with finite dimensional model the
finite connectivity properties, the Bethe lattice is clearly a better starting
point for an expansion with respect to the fully connected model. The present
work is a first step towards the generalization of this new expansion to more
difficult and interesting cases as the zero-temperature limit, where the
expansion could lead to different results with respect to the standard one.

$K$ transmitter-receiver pairs are sharing spectrum with each other. We propose
a novel but simple binary scheduling scheme for this network to maximize the
average sum rate of the pairs. According to the scheme, each receiver predicts
its Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), assuming \emph{all} other
user pairs are active, and compares it to a preassigned threshold to decide
whether its corresponding transmitter to be activated or not. For our proposed
scheme, the optimal threshold that maximizes the expected sum rate is obtained
analytically for the two user-pair case and empirically in the general $K$
user-pair case. Simulation results reveal that our proposed SINR-threshold
scheduling scheme outperforms ITLinQ \cite{navid}, FlashLinQ \cite{flash} and
the method presented in \cite{G} in terms of the expected sum rate (network
throughput). In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme
is $O(K)$, outperforming both ITLinQ and FlashLinQ that have $O(K^2)$
complexity requirements. Moreover, we also discuss the application of our
proposed new scheme into an operator-assisted cellular D2D heterogeneous
network.

well described by quark stars in the ICQM model if the isospin dependence of

a real current profile from the Columbia River, and model ships with dimensions
and Froude numbers typical of three classes of vessels operating in these

free-surface sources on shear current to date, which we derive and present
here. Expressions are derived for ship waves which satisfy an arbitrary
dispersion relation and are generated by a wave source acting on the free

Practical calculation procedures for numerically calculating dispersion on a
shear current which may vary arbitrarily with depth both in direction and
magnitude, are indicated.
  For ships travelling at oblique angle to a shear-current, the ship wave
pattern is asymmetrical, and wave-making radiation forces have a lateral
component in addition to the conventional wave resistance, the sternward
component. No corresponding lateral force exists in the absence of shear. We
consider the dependence of wave resistance and lateral force for upstream,
downstream and cross-stream motion on the Columbia River current, both in
steady motion and during two different maneouvres: a ship suddenly set in
motion, and a ship turning through 360 deg. We find that for smaller ships
(tugboats, fishing-boats) the wave resistance can differ drastically from that
in quiescent water, and depends strongly on Froude number and direction of
motion. For Froude numbers typical of such boats, wave resistance can vary by a
factor 3 between upstream and downstream motion, and the strong Froude number

order to test these predictions, it is necessary to identify these systems,
which may be difficult if the signatures of accretion become too weak to be
detected. The only chance to identify such ""dead"" CVs is by exploiting their
close binary nature. We have therefore searched the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Stripe 82 area for apparently isolated white dwarfs that undergo
eclipses by a dark companion. We found no such eclipses in either the SDSS or
Palomar Transient Factory data sets among our sample of 2264 photometrically
selected white dwarf candidates within Stripe 82. This null result allows us to
set a firm upper limit on the space density, $\rho_0$, of dead CVs. In order to
determine this limit, we have used Monte-Carlo simulations to fold our
selection criteria through a simple model of the Galactic CV distribution.
Assuming a $T_{WD}=7,500$ K, the resulting 2$\sigma$ limit on the space density
of dead CVs is $\rho_0 \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-5}$ pc$^{-3}$, where $T_{WD}$ is
the typical effective temperature of the white dwarf in such systems.

high priority in the particle- and neutrino-physics communities. The
detectability of this decay mode is strongly influenced by the value of the
weak axial-vector coupling constant $g_{\rm A}$. The recent nuclear-model
analyses of $\beta$ and $\beta\beta$ decays suggest that the value of $g_{\rm
A}$ could be dramatically quenched, reaching ratios of $g^{\rm free}_{\rm
A}/g_{\rm A}\approx 4$, where $g^{\rm free}_{\rm A}=1.27$ is the free,
neutron-decay, value of $g_{\rm A}$. The effects of this quenching appear
devastating for the sensitivity of the present and future $0\nu\beta\beta$
experiments since the 4$th$ power of this ratio scales the $0\nu\beta\beta$
half-lives. This, in turn, could lead to some two orders of magnitude less
sensitivity for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments. In the present Letter it is
shown that by using a consistent approach to both the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$

approximation (pnQRPA), the feared two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the
sensitivity of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments actually shrinks to a reduction
by factors in the range $2-6$. This certainly has dramatic consequences for the
potential to detect the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay.

intermediate-mass stars -- the so-called `retired A-stars'. The high masses of
these red-giant planet hosts, derived using spectroscopic information and
stellar evolution models, have been called into question. Here we address the
controversy by determining the masses of eight evolved planet-hosting stars
using asteroseismology. We compare the masses with spectroscopic-based masses
from the Exoplanet Orbit Database that were previously adopted to infer
properties of the exoplanets and their hosts. We find a significant one-sided
offset between the two sets of masses for stars with spectroscopic masses above
roughly 1.6Msun, suggestive of an average 15--20% overestimate of the adopted
spectroscopic-based masses. The only star in our sample well below this mass
limit is also the only one not showing this offset. Finally, we note that the
scatter across literature values of spectroscopic-based masses often exceed
their formal uncertainties, making it comparable to the offset we report here.

Specifically, the intertwined problem of photoionization, radiative, and

e.g., when molecules are exposed to XUV light or x rays from free electron
lasers or attosecond light sources, but the approach is equally useful in
optical strong-field physics. The coherent interaction of the molecule with the
light in a specific charge state is also treated. I set out from an abstract
formulation in terms of the quantum optical notion of system-reservoir
interaction using a master equation in Lindblad form and analyze its short-time
approximation. First, I express it in a direct sum rigged Hilbert space for an
efficient solution with numerical methods for systems of differential
equations. Second, I derive a treatment via quantum Monte Carlo wave packet
(MCWP) propagation. The formalism is concretized to diatomic molecules in
Born-Oppenheimer approximation whereby molecular rotation is disregarded. The
numerical integration of the master equation is carried out with a suitably
factored density matrix that exploits the locality of the Hamiltonian and the
Lindblad superoperator with respect to the internuclear distance. The
formulation of the MCWP for molecules requires a thorough analysis of the
quantum jump process; namely, the dependence on the continuous distance renders
a straight wave packet promotion useless and, instead, a projected outer
product needs to be employed involving an integrated quantum jump operator.

CT scanners. The aim of our study was to compare the noise reduction properties
of the two IR algorithms using objective methods. Methods and Materials: The
homogeneous module of the Catphan phantom was scanned on a Siemens AS+ and a
Siemens Flash CT scanner using an axial abdomen protocol with fixed tube
current at two dose levels. The images were reconstructed with an abdomen
filter (B30) using filtered back projection (FBP) and a low, medium, and high
level of SAFIRE or ADMIRE. Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) curves were calculated
using these images. Then, an anthropomorphic abdomen phantom (Kyoto Kagaku
PH-5) was scanned using the same setup and exposure parameters. Fifty axial
images at the same slice location were used to calculate inter-image standard
deviation maps. Results: At full dose, the median values of the NPS curves were
similar for both scanners at all IR levels. At low dose the median values of
the NPS curves were generally shifted towards lower spatial frequencies,
usually resulting in a more blotchy image texture. This shift was more
prominent for ADMIRE compared to SAFIRE for all IR levels. Based on the
inter-image standard deviation maps of the anthropomorphic phantom, ADMIRE
removed noise near edges more efficiently than SAFIRE. Conclusion: No
significant improvement in maintaining noise structure were found for the
ADMIRE algorithm. Based on the inter-image standard deviation maps, ADMIRE
removed noise near edges more efficiently than SAFIRE.

Mbol~-6.7. It is surprising to find a variable of this sort in Sgr dIG, given
their rarity in other dwarf irregulars. Despite its long period the star is
relatively blue and is fainter, at all wavelengths shorter than 4.5microns,
than anticipated from period-luminosity relations that describe hot bottom

Mi~5 times solar and that it is now near the end of its AGB evolution. The

sphere theorems via Ricci flow.
  For intrinsic case, we show that a closed simply connected $n(\ge

  manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$
  if one of the following
  conditions holds pointwisely: $$
  (i)\ R_0>\left(1-\frac{24(\sqrt{10}-3)}{n(n-1)}\right)K_{max};\quad
  \ (ii)\
\frac{Ric^{[4]}}{4(n-1)}>\left(1-\frac{6(\sqrt{10}-3)}{n-1}\right)K_{max}.$$
  Here $K_{max}$, $Ric^{[k]}$ and $R_0$ stand for the maximal sectional
curvature,
  the $k$-th weak Ricci curvature and
  the normalized scalar curvature.
  For extrinsic case, i.e., when $M$ is a closed simply connected $n(\ge
4)$-dimensional submanifold immersed in $\bar{M}$.
  We prove that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$ if it satisfies some pinching
curvature conditions. The only involved extrinsic quantities in our pinching
conditions are the maximal sectional curvature $\bar K_{max}$ and the squared
norm of mean curvature vector $\vert H\vert^2$. More precisely,
  we show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$
  if one of the following conditions
  holds: \begin{itemize}
  \item[(1)] $R_0\ge \left(1-\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)\bar{K}_{max}

  It is worth pointing out that, in the proof of extrinsic case, we apply
suitable complex orthonormal frame
  and simplify the calculations considerably.
  We also emphasize that both of the pinching constants in (2) and (3) are
optimal for $n=4$.

radio telescope situated some 40 km from the city of Canberra, Australia. Its

communications, making radio astronomy challenging. We describe how the
deployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) based filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs
(Graphics Processing Units) has transformed MOST into a versatile new
instrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky on millisecond
timescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The
filterbanks, servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a
hybrid solution to the observatory's signal processing requirements. The
emphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware has enabled rapid
deployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal
processing. The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST
and double the sampling of the line feed, which doubles the field of view. The
UTMOST can simultaneously excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse
pulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams for dispersed
single pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar
timing and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have
been made. The telescope operates as a robotic facility, deciding how to
efficiently target pulsars and how long to stay on source, via feedback from
real-time pulsar folding. The regular timing of over 300 pulsars has resulted
in the discovery of 7 pulsar glitches and 3 FRBs. The UTMOST demonstrates that
if sufficient signal processing can be applied to the voltage streams it is
possible to perform innovative radio science in hostile radio frequency
environments.

subjected to lateral variations in heat flux through the outer boundary imposed
by creeping flow in the overlying silicate mantles. Boundary anomalies can
significantly influence global diagnostics of core convection when the Rayleigh
number, $Ra$, is weakly supercritical; however, little is known about the
strongly supercritical regime appropriate for planets. We perform numerical
simulations of rapidly rotating convection in a spherical shell geometry and
impose two patterns of boundary heat flow heterogeneity: a hemispherical
$Y_1^1$ spherical harmonic pattern; and one derived from seismic tomography of
Earth's lower mantle. We consider Ekman numbers $10^{-4} \le E \le 10^{-6}$,
flux-based Rayleigh numbers up to $\sim800$ times critical, and Prandtl number
unity. The amplitude of the lateral variation in heat flux is characterised by
$q_{\rm L}^*=0, 2.3, 5.0$, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the outer boundary
heat flux divided by its mean. We find that the Nusselt number, $Nu$, can be
increased by up to $\sim25$\% relative to the equivalent homogeneous case due
to boundary-induced correlations between the radial velocity and temperature
anomalies near the top of the shell. The $Nu$ enhancement tends to become
greater as the amplitude and length scale of the boundary heterogeneity are
increased and as the system becomes more supercritical. This $Ra$ dependence
can steepen the $Nu \propto Ra^\gamma$ scaling in the rotationally dominated
regime, with $\gamma$ for our most extreme case approximately $20\%$ greater
than the equivalent homogeneous scaling. Therefore, it may be important to
consider boundary heterogeneity when extrapolating numerical results to
planetary conditions.

is assumed non-autonomous with a nonzero control input, which allows changing

learning-based control protocol is presented to find optimal solutions to the

designed to prevent propagating the effects of attacks on sensors and actuators
throughout the network, as well as to attenuate the effect of these attacks on
the compromised agent itself. Non-homogeneous game algebraic Riccati equations
are derived to solve the H_infinity optimal synchronization problem and
off-policy reinforcement learning is utilized to learn their solution without
requiring any knowledge of the agent's dynamics. A trust-confidence based
distributed control protocol is then proposed to mitigate attacks that hijack
the entire node and attacks on communication links. A confidence value is
defined for each agent based solely on its local evidence. The proposed
resilient reinforcement learning algorithm employs the confidence value of each
agent to indicate the trustworthiness of its own information and broadcast it
to its neighbors to put weights on the data they receive from it during and
after learning. If the confidence value of an agent is low, it employs a trust
mechanism to identify compromised agents and remove the data it receives from

lets us learn to detect objects and estimate their 3D pose under challenging

normalization parameters should adapt to the input image. In particular, we
realized this via a Convolutional Neural Network trained to predict the

diffusivity is obtained from a scaling Green-Kubo relation, which connects the
scale invariant non-stationary velocity correlation function with the transport
coefficient. Here we obtain the relation between time averaged diffusivity,
usually recorded in single particle tracking experiments, and the underlying
scale invariant velocity correlation function. The time averaged mean squared
displacement is given by $\overline{\delta^2} \sim 2 D_\nu
t^{\beta}\Delta^{\nu-\beta}$ where $t$ is the total measurement time and
$\Delta$ the lag time. Here $\nu>1$ is the anomalous diffusion exponent
obtained from ensemble averaged measurements $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t^\nu$

v^2 \rangle \sim t^\beta$. Thus we establish a connection between exponents
which can be read off the asymptotic properties of the velocity correlation
function and similarly for the transport constant $D_\nu$. We demonstrate our
results with non-stationary scale invariant stochastic and deterministic
models, thereby highlighting that systems with equivalent behavior in the
ensemble average can differ strongly in their time average. This is the case,

narrow down the wealth of possible solutions for a given many-body problem,

for the compatibility of the marginal properties with those of the joint state.
While the equality holds both for pure and mixed states, the pure-state version

relation for entanglement. These findings have interesting implications in
terms of conservation laws for correlations, and also with respect to topology.

determined via the DCM procedure for the range of time-steps used in such

called SI model) on random graphs. Social interactions often follow bursty
patterns, which are usually modelled with i.i.d.~heavy-tailed passage times on
edges. On the other hand, random graphs are often locally tree-like, and
spreading on trees with leaves might be very slow, because of bottleneck edges
with huge passage times. Here we consider the SI model with passage times
following a power law distribution $\mathbb{P}(\xi>t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$, with
infinite mean. For any finite connected graph $G$ with a root $s$, we find the
largest number of vertices $\kappa(G,s)$ that are infected in finite expected
time, and prove that for every $k \leq \kappa(G,s)$, the expected time to
infect $k$ vertices is at most $O(k^{1/\alpha})$. Then, we show that adding a
single edge from $s$ to a random vertex in a random tree $\mathcal{T}$
typically increases $\kappa(\mathcal{T},s)$ from a bounded variable to a
fraction of the size of $\mathcal{T}$, thus severely accelerating the process.
We examine this acceleration effect on some natural models of random graphs:
critical Galton-Watson trees conditioned to be large, uniform spanning trees of
the complete graph, and on the largest cluster of near-critical
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. In particular, at the upper end of the critical
window, the process is already much faster than exactly at criticality.

unbiased risk estimate (SURE) can be useful for risk estimation and for tuning
the amount of shrinkage towards low rank matrices. This was demonstrated by
Cand\`es et al. (2013) for singular value soft thresholding, which is a
Lipschitz continuous estimator. SURE provides an unbiased risk estimate for an
estimator whenever the differentiability requirements for Stein's lemma are
satisfied. Lipschitz continuity of the estimator is sufficient, but it is
emphasized that differentiability Lebesgue almost everywhere isn't. The reduced
rank estimator, which gives the best approximation of the observation with a
fixed rank, is an example of a discontinuous estimator for which Stein's lemma
actually applies. This was observed by Mukherjee et al. (2015), but the proof
was incomplete. This brief note gives a sufficient condition for Stein's lemma
to hold for estimators with discontinuities, which is then shown to be
fulfilled for a class of spectral function estimators including the reduced
rank estimator. Singular value hard thresholding does, however, not satisfy the
condition, and Stein's lemma does not apply to this estimator.

generation wireless network. However, MTC applications have different
characteristics and requirements compared with the services provided by legacy
cellular networks. For instance, an MTC device sporadically requires to
transmit a small data packet containing information generated by sensors. At
the same time, due to the massive deployment of MTC devices, it is inefficient
to charge their batteries manually and thus a long battery life is required for
MTC devices. In this sense, legacy networks designed to serve human-driven
traffics in real time can not support MTC efficiently. In order to improve the
availability and battery life of MTC devices, context-aware device-to-device
(D2D) communication is exploited in this paper. By applying D2D communication,
some MTC users can serve as relays for other MTC users who experience bad
channel conditions. Moreover, signaling schemes are also designed to enable the
collection of context information and support the proposed D2D communication
scheme. Last but not least, a system level simulator is implemented to evaluate
the system performance of the proposed technologies and a large performance
gain is shown by the numerical results.

propose a new method belonging to the class of hidden Markov models (HMM) that
accounts for autocorrelation in time along the fishing events and offers a good
trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. We carry out
an objective comparison between this method and two competing approaches on a
set of VMS data from Denmark for which the true activity is known from on-board
sensors. The DMKMG approach proposed outperformed the competitors approach with
6% and 15% more accurate estimates in the vessel-by-vessel and trip-by-trip
case, respectively. In addition, these better performances are not paid in
terms of computation time. We also showcase our method on an extensive dataset
from Sweden. A quick (real-time) data processing has the potential to change
how fisheries can be better harmonized to other utilisation of the seas and
fill the gap between the local scales at which fishing pressure and stock
depletion occurs with the large temporal and spatial scales of traditional
fisheries assessment and management. The computer code developped in this work

intrinsically more complicated than images in two aspects. First, videos cover
a broader range of topics, such as news, music, sports and so on. Second,
multiple topics could coexist in the same video. In this paper, we propose a
novel caption model, topic-guided model (TGM), to generate topic-oriented
descriptions for videos in the wild via exploiting topic information. In
addition to predefined topics, i.e., category tags crawled from the web, we
also mine topics in a data-driven way based on training captions by an

better topic schema than the predefined topics. As for testing video topic
prediction, we treat the topic mining model as teacher to train the student,
the topic prediction model, by utilizing the full multi-modalities in the video
especially the speech modality. We propose a series of caption models to

unsupervised fashion from data and guides the caption decoder with these
topics. Compared to pre-defined topics, the mined multimodal topics are more
semantically and visually coherent and can reflect the topic distribution of
videos better. We formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task
learning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in
addition to the caption task. For the topic prediction task, we use the mined
topics as the teacher to train a student topic prediction model, which learns
to predict the latent topics from multimodal contents of videos. The topic
prediction provides intermediate supervision to the learning process. As for
the caption task, we propose a novel topic-aware decoder to generate more
accurate and detailed video descriptions with the guidance from latent topics.
The entire learning procedure is end-to-end and it optimizes both tasks
simultaneously. The results from extensive experiments conducted on the MSR-VTT

M&M TGM not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple

universe. We confirm that both $f_\mathrm{H_2}$ and SFE have strong positive
correlations with the SFR offset from the star-forming main sequence
($\Delta$MS), and most importantly, we find that these correlations are
universal across all environments. Our result demonstrates that star-formation
activity within individual galaxies is primarily controlled by their molecular
gas content, regardless of their global environment. Therefore, we claim that
one always needs to be careful about the $\Delta$MS distribution of the sample
when investigating the environmental effects on the H$_2$ gas content in
galaxies.

imbalanced classification. However, boosting methods are yet to be
satisfactorily immune to class imbalance, especially for multi-class problems.
This is because most of the existing solutions for handling class imbalance
rely on expensive cost set tuning for determining the proper level of
compensation. We show that the assignment of weights to the component
classifiers of a boosted ensemble can be thought of as a game of Tug of War
between the classes in the margin space. We then demonstrate how this insight
can be used to attain a good compromise between the rare and abundant classes
without having to resort to cost set tuning, which has long been the norm for
imbalanced classification. The solution is based on a lexicographic linear
programming framework which requires two stages. Initially, class-specific
component weight combinations are found so as to minimize a hinge loss
individually for each of the classes. Subsequently, the final component weights
are assigned so that the maximum deviation from the class-specific minimum loss
values (obtained in the previous stage) is minimized. Hence, the proposal is
not only restricted to two-class situations, but is also readily applicable to
multi-class problems. Additionally,we also derive the dual formulation
corresponding to the proposed framework. Experiments conducted on artificial
and real-world imbalanced datasets as well as on challenging applications such
as hyperspectral image classification and ImageNet classification establish the
efficacy of the proposal.

some structural properties of biclique graphs which are necessary conditions

sciences including biomedical or reliability applications and clinical trial
analyses. Testing the significance of statistical hypotheses is crucial in such
analyses to get conclusive inference but the existing likelihood based tests,
under a fully parametric model, are extremely non-robust against outliers in
the data. Although, there exists a few robust parameter estimators (e.g.,
M-estimators and minimum density power divergence estimators) given randomly
censored data, there is hardly any robust testing procedure available in the
literature in this context. One of the major difficulties in this context is
the construction of a suitable consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance
of M estimators; the latter is a function of the unknown censoring
distribution. In this paper, we take the first step in this direction by
proposing a consistent estimator of asymptotic variance of the M-estimators
based on randomly censored data without any assumption on the form of the
censoring scheme. We then describe and study a class of robust Wald-type tests
for parametric statistical hypothesis, both simple as well as composite, under
such set-up, along with their general asymptotic and robustness properties.
Robust tests for comparing two independent randomly censored samples and robust
tests against one sided alternatives are also discussed. Their advantages and
usefulness are demonstrated for the tests based on the minimum density power
divergence estimators with specific attention to clinical trial analyses.

tracial noncommutative polynomial optimization. We construct a hierarchy of

a bipartite correlation. This hierarchy converges to a new parameter: the
minimal average entanglement dimension, which measures the amount of
entanglement needed to reproduce a quantum correlation when access to shared
randomness is free. For synchronous correlations, we show a correspondence
between the minimal entanglement dimension and the completely positive
semidefinite rank of an associated matrix. We then study optimization over the
set of synchronous correlations by investigating quantum graph parameters. We
unify existing bounds on the quantum chromatic number and the quantum stability
number by placing them in the framework of tracial optimization. In particular,
we show that the projective packing number, the projective rank, and the
tracial rank arise naturally when considering tracial analogues of the Lasserre
hierarchy for the stability and chromatic number of a graph. We also introduce
semidefinite programming hierarchies converging to the commuting quantum
chromatic number and commuting quantum stability number.

While previous algorithmic advances for many-core hardware focused on

to map the full $\mathcal{H}$ matrix construction and the fast matrix-vector

to be x-monotone or, even stronger, both x- and y-monotone gives rise to three
natural variants of EPG-representations, one where edges have no monotonicity
requirements and two with the aforementioned monotonicity requirements. The
focus of this paper is understanding how small a grid can be achieved for such
EPG-representations with respect to various graph parameters.
  We show that there are $m$-edge graphs that require a grid of area
$\Omega(m)$ in any variant of EPG-representations. Similarly there are
pathwidth-$k$ graphs that require height $\Omega(k)$ and area $\Omega(kn)$ in

are required to be both x- and y-monotone. Thus in this strongest model, the
result implies, for example, $O(n)$, $O(n \log n)$ and $O(n^{3/2})$ area bounds
for bounded pathwidth graphs, bounded treewidth graphs and all classes of
graphs that exclude a fixed minor, respectively. For the model with no
restrictions on the monotonicity of the edges, stronger results can be achieved

the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also

using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the
QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of

training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this
concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well

backward differentiation formula and the other uses Crank-Nicolson method to
discretize linear terms. In both schemes, the nonlinear bulk forces are treated
explicitly with two second-order stabilization terms. This treatment leads to
linear elliptic systems with constant coefficients, for which lots of robust
and efficient solvers are available. The discrete energy dissipation properties
are proved for both schemes. Rigorous error analysis is carried out to show
that, when the time step-size is small enough, second order accuracy in time is
obtained with a prefactor controlled by a fixed power of $1/\varepsilon$, where
$\varepsilon$ is the characteristic interface thickness. Numerical results are
presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of proposed schemes.

  One way to present this new class is by a type of regular expressions. The
new expressions are an extension of $\omega$-regular expressions where two new
variants of the Kleene star $L^*$ are added: $L^B$ and $L^S$. These new
exponents are used to say that parts of the input word have bounded size, and
that parts of the input can have arbitrarily large sizes, respectively. For
instance, the expression $(a^Bb)^\omega$ represents the language of infinite
words over the letters $a,b$ where there is a common bound on the number of
consecutive letters $a$. The expression $(a^Sb)^\omega$ represents a similar
language, but this time the distance between consecutive $b$'s is required to
tend toward the infinite.
  We develop a theory for these languages, with a focus on decidability and
closure. We define an equivalent automaton model, extending B\""uchi automata.
The main technical result is a complementation lemma that works for languages
where only one type of exponent---either $L^B$ or $L^S$---is used.

results for the logic MSOLB, a logic obtained by extending monadic second-order

meridian axis and zero times around the major longitude axis. We provide an
algorithm for finding the two fundamental cycles of a canonical rectangular
schema in a supergraph that enforces this topological constraint. The polygonal
schema is then used to produce a straight-line drawing of the lace graph inside
a rectangular frame. We argue that such a polygonal schema always exists for
combinatorial embeddings satisfying the conditions of bobbin lace patterns, and
that we can therefore create a pattern, given a graph with a fixed

in particular, quantum annealing on quantum annealing machines, has the
potential to outperform current classical optimization algorithms implemented
on CMOS technologies. The benchmarking of these devices has been controversial.
Initially, random spin-glass problems were used, however, these were quickly
shown to be not well suited to detect any quantum speedup. Subsequently,
benchmarking shifted to carefully crafted synthetic problems designed to
highlight the quantum nature of the hardware while (often) ensuring that
classical optimization techniques do not perform well on them. Even worse, to
date a true sign of improved scaling with the number of problem variables
remains elusive when compared to classical optimization techniques. Here, we
analyze the readiness of quantum annealing machines for real-world application
problems. These are typically not random and have an underlying structure that
is hard to capture in synthetic benchmarks, thus posing unexpected challenges
for optimization techniques, both classical and quantum alike. We present a
comprehensive computational scaling analysis of fault diagnosis in digital
circuits, considering architectures beyond D-wave quantum annealers. We find
that the instances generated from real data in multiplier circuits are harder
than other representative random spin-glass benchmarks with a comparable number
of variables. Although our results show that transverse-field quantum annealing
is outperformed by state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms, these
benchmark instances are hard and small in the size of the input, therefore
representing the first industrial application ideally suited for testing
near-term quantum annealers and other quantum algorithmic strategies for

the distribution of produced entropy that holds universally in non-equilibrium
steady states with Markovian dynamics. However, in systems with slow degrees of
freedom that are hidden from the observer, it is not possible to infer the
amount of produced entropy exactly. Previous work suggested that a relation
similar to the fluctuation theorem may hold at least approximately for such
systems if one considers an apparent entropy production. By extending the
notion of apparent entropy production to discrete bipartite systems, we
investigate which criteria have to be met for such a modified fluctuation
theorem to hold in the large deviation limit. We use asymptotic approximations
of the large deviation function to show that the probabilities of extreme
events of apparent entropy production always obey a modified fluctuation
theorem and, moreover, that it is possible to infer otherwise hidden
properties. For the paradigmatic case of two coupled colloidal particles on
rings the rate function of the apparent entropy production is calculated to
illustrate this asymptotic behavior and to show that the modified fluctuation
theorem observed experimentally for short observation times does not persist in
the long time limit.

further investigate this reported anti-correlation here using a dataset
comprising exoplanets discovered with both the RV and transit methods,
searching for hints of its causes by exploring the connection between the
number of planets and the dynamical state of the exosystems. To examine the
correlation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity, for every
multiplicity case considered (1<M<7), we computed the weighted average
eccentricities instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The
average eccentricities were calculated using the inverse of the uncertainty on
the eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic state of the
exosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), a
diagnostic parameter used in the study of solar system and recently applied to
exosystems. Our results confirm the reported multiplicity-eccentricity
anti-correlation and show that the use of the uncertainties on the orbital
eccentricities in the analysis allows for a better agreement between data and
fits. Our best fit reproduces well the behaviour of average eccentricities for
all systems with M>1, including the additional cases of TRAPPIST-1 (M=7) and
solar system (M=8). The AMD analysis, while not conclusive due to the limited
number of exosystems that could be analysed, also suggests the existence of an
anti-correlation between the multiplicity and the AMD of exosystems. This
second anticorrelation, if confirmed by future studies, raises the possibility
that the population of low-multiplicity exosystems is contaminated by former
high-multiplicity systems that became dynamically unstable and lost some of
their planets.

$w_x \leq -1$ and $\xi \leq 0$, where $w_x$ is the dark energy equation of
state and $\xi$ is the coupling strength of the interaction. Due to this
separation, crucial information about the cosmology and phenomenology of these
models may be lost. In a recent study it has been shown that one can unify the
two regions with a coupling function which depends on the dark energy equation
of state. In this work we introduce a new coupling function which also unifies
the two regions of the parameter space and generalises the previous proposal.
We analyse this scenario considering the equation of state of DE to be either
constant or dynamical. We study the cosmology of such models and constrain both
scenarios with the use of latest astronomical data from both background
evolution as well as large scale structures. Our analysis shows that a non-zero
value of the coupling parameter $\xi$ as well as the dark energy equation of
state other than `$-1$' are allowed. However, within $1\sigma$ confidence
level, $\xi = 0$, and the dark energy equation of state equal to `$-1$' are
compatible with the current data. In other words, the observational data allow
a very small but nonzero deviation from the $\Lambda$-cosmology, however,
within $1\sigma$ confidence-region the interacting models can mimick the
$\Lambda$-cosmology. In fact we observe that the models both at background and
perturbative levels are very hard to distinguish form each other and from
$\Lambda$-cosmology as well. Finally, we offer a rigorous analysis on the
current tension on $H_0$ allowing different regions of the dark energy equation
of state which shows that interacting dark energy models reasonably solve the

Thus, they offer an interesting and viable example where the cosmological
principle does not follow from the isotropy of observational data. In this
paper we extract the linear dynamics of tensor perturbations in two classes of
cosmologies with anisotropic spatial curvature. Two difficulties arise in
comparison to the same computation in isotropic cosmologies. First, the two
tensor polarizations do not behave as a spin-2 field, but rather as the spin-0
and spin-1 irreducible components of a symmetric, traceless and transverse
tensor field, each with its own dynamics. Second, because metric perturbations
are algebraically coupled, one cannot ignore scalar and vector modes and focus
just on tensors --- even if one is only interested in the latter --- under the
penalty of obtaining the wrong equations of motion. We illustrate our results
by finding analytical solutions and evaluating the power-spectra of tensor
polarizations in a radiation dominated universe. We conclude with some comments
on how these models could be constrained with future experiments on CMB
polarization.

chain defining each CI's performance state and a Bayesian network modeling the
probability of failure are introduced to infer each CI's resilience index.
Then, to maximize the resilience of a system of CIs, a novel approach for
allocating resources, such as drones or maintenance personnel, is proposed. In
particular, a comprehensive resource allocation framework, based on the tools
of contract theory, is proposed enabling the system operator to optimally
allocate resources, such as, redundant components or monitoring devices to each
individual CI based on its economic contribution to the entire system. The
optimal solution of the contract-based resilience resource allocation problem
is analytically derived using dynamic programming. The proposed framework is
then evaluated using a case study pertaining to hydropower dams and their
interdependence to the power grid. Simulation results, within the case study,
show that the system operator can economically benefit from allocating the
resources while dams have a 60% average improvement over their initial
resilience indices.

expressed through the integral over two gluon form factor which was measured in

induced correlation enhance large $p_\perp$ and $ 0.001 < x < 0.1$ typically
enhance the cross section by a factor of 1.5 -- 2 explaining the current data.
We argue that in the small x kinematics ($10^{-4} \le x \le 10^{-3}$) where
effects of perturbative correlations diminish, the nonperturbative mechanism
kicks in and generates positive correlations comparable in magnitude with the
perturbative ones. We explain how our technique can be used for calculations of

setting of part detector number heavily relies on prior knowledge as well as
experimental validation. As is known to all, when we describe the object of an

several distributed algorithms have been proposed, which frame the
signal/object labelling problem in terms of cluster analysis after extracting
source-specific features, however, the number of clusters is assumed to be
known. We propose a new method called Gravitational Clustering (GC) to
adaptively estimate the time-varying number of clusters based on a set of
feature vectors. The key idea is to exploit the physical principle of
gravitational force between mass units: streaming-in feature vectors are
considered as mass units of fixed position in the feature space, around which
mobile mass units are injected at each time instant. The cluster enumeration
exploits the fact that the highest attraction on the mobile mass units is
exerted by regions with a high density of feature vectors, i.e., gravitational
clusters. By sharing estimates among neighboring nodes via a
diffusion-adaptation scheme, cooperative and distributed cluster enumeration is
achieved. Numerical experiments concerning robustness against outliers,
convergence and computational complexity are conducted. The application in a
distributed cooperative multi-view camera network illustrates the applicability
to real-world problems.

localised and applied to specific concurrent actors, thereby only causing a
temporary disruption to the parts of the system requiring mitigation, while
leaving the rest of the system intact. We make the application of localised
adaptations efficient through incremental synchronisation, whereby the
specifier can strategically suspend specific parts of the system, whenever this
is strictly required for ensuring that adaptations are effectively applied. We
also study static analysis techniques to determine whether the specified
incremental synchronisation is in some sense adequate for local adaptations to
be carried out.
  We thus identify a number of generic adaptations that can be applied to any
actor system, regardless of its design and the code that it executes. We
implement the identified adaptations as an extension of an existing Runtime
Verification tool for actor-systems, thereby creating a RA framework for
monitoring and mitigating actor systems. In parallel to our implementation we
also develop a formal model of our RA framework that further serves to guide
our implementation. This model also enables us to better understand the subtle
errors that erroneously specified adaptation scripts may introduce. We thus
develop a static type system for detecting and rejecting erroneous adaptation
scripts prior to deployment, thereby providing the specifier with assistance
for writing valid scripts. Although the static typesystem analyses scripts with
respect to certain assumptions, we do not assume that the monitored system
abides by these assumptions. We therefore augment our RA framework with dynamic
checks for halting monitoring whenever the system deviates from our assumption.
Based on this dynamically checked model of our RA framework, we prove type
soundness for our static type system.

evolutions of the semantic web to adapt to the IoT constraints are described as
well, in order to give a twofold view of the convergence between the IoT and
the semantic web toward the SWoT.

  using Australian national personal health records system",,,,,"cs.CY cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale national level Personal Health Record (PHR) has been implemented
in Australia. However, usability, data quality and poor functionalities have
resulted in low utility affecting enrollment and participation rates by both
patients and clinicians alike. Development of new applications deriving
secondary utility of data can enhance use of PHRs but there is limited
understanding on processes involved in development of third-party applications
with nationally run PHRs. This paper prsents an analysis of processes and
regulatory requirements for developing applications of data from My Health
Record, Australian nationally run PHR and subsequently implementation of a
patient oriented software application using data sourced from My Health Record.

  Liquid Helium under Continuous Driving",,"Phys. Rev. B 96, 205438 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevB.96.205438",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate low-frequency fluctuations in the transport characteristics of
a quasi-1D Wigner solid (WS) moving along a liquid helium substrate in response
to a sinusoidal driving voltage. The fluctuations occur between distinct
transport modes in which the decoupling of the WS from ripplonic polarons (or
'dimple lattice', DL) formed on the helium surface does, or does not, occur
during each ac cycle. We demonstrate that a Gaussian-like distribution in the
decoupling threshold force gives rise to this bistability, as the low-frequency
switching occurs when the probability of decoupling during each ac cycle is
small but finite. We attribute the distribution in the decoupling threshold
force to the range of structural configurations allowed for the quasi-1D
electron lattice, which influences the strength of the WS-DL coupling. Hence,
the switching rate between the ac transport modes is extremely sensitive to the
microscopic properties of the electron solid.

  Imbalance",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In-phase/quadrature-phase Imbalance (IQI) is considered a major
performance-limiting impairment in direct-conversion transceivers. Its effects
become even more pronounced at higher carrier frequencies such as the
millimeter-wave frequency bands being considered for 5G systems. In this paper,
we quantify the effects of IQI on the performance of different modulation
schemes under multipath fading channels. This is realized by developing a
general framework for the symbol error rate (SER) analysis of coherent phase
shift keying, noncoherent differential phase shift keying and noncoherent
frequency shift keying under IQI effects. In this context, the moment
generating function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is first
derived for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems suffering from
transmitter (TX) IQI only, receiver (RX) IQI only and joint TX/RX IQI.
Capitalizing on this, we derive analytic expressions for the SER of the
different modulation schemes. These expressions are corroborated by comparisons
with corresponding results from computer simulations and they provide insights
into the dependence of IQI on the system parameters. We demonstrate that the
effects of IQI differ considerably depending on the considered system as some
cases of single-carrier transmission appear robust to IQI, whereas
multi-carrier systems experiencing IQI at the RX require compensation in order
to achieve a reliable communication link.
