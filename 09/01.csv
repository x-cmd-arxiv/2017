of Leray in his celebrated work on the Navier--Stokes equations from 1934.
Although the importance of his work is widely acknowledged, the precise
contents of his paper are perhaps less well known. The purpose of this article
is to fill this gap. We follow Leray's results in detail: we prove local
existence of strong solutions starting from divergence-free initial data that
is either smooth, or belongs to $H^1$, $L^2\cap L^p$ (with $p\in(3,\infty]$),
as well as lower bounds on the norms $\| \nabla u (t) \|_2$, $\| u(t) \|_p$
($p\in(3,\infty]$) as $t$ approaches a putative blow-up time. We show global
existence of a weak solution and weak-strong uniqueness. We present Leray's
characterisation of the set of singular times for the weak solution, from which
we deduce that its upper box-counting dimension is at most $\tfrac{1}{2}$.
Throughout the text we provide additional details and clarifications for the
modern reader and we expand on all ideas left implicit in the original work,
some of which we have not found in the literature. We use some modern
mathematical tools to bypass some technical details in Leray's work, and thus
expose the elegance of his approach.

rod length on the photon absorption and subsequent excitation transport to the

decreases with increasing rod length, we find an optimal length for which the
average rod efficiency is maximal. Combining this study with experimental
structural measurements, we propose models for the arrangement of the
phycobiliproteins inside the thylakoid membranes, evaluate the importance of

puzzles. In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some
participants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in
proportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks
threaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH)
attack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants
receive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools
launch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a
Nash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack
called selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by
deliberately generating forks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called
a fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The
reward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH
attacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH
attack. When considering multiple pools - the current state of the Bitcoin
network - the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a
BWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the
miner's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can
consistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional
forks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also
discuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and
efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see
FAW attacks among mining pools.

Recently, the Planck Collaboration released the estimated convergence map, an
integrated measure of the large-scale matter distribution that produced the
weak gravitational lensing (WL) phenomenon observed in Planck CMB data. We
perform exhaustive analyses of this convergence map calculating the variance in
small and large regions of the sky, but excluding the area masked due to
galactic contaminations, and compare them with the features expected in the set
of simulated convergence maps, also released by the Planck collaboration. Our
goal is to search for sky directions or regions where the WL imprints anomalous
signatures to the variance estimator revealed through a $\chi^2$ analyses at a
statistically significant level. In the local analysis of the Planck
convergence map we identified 8 patches of the sky in disagreement, in more
than 2$\sigma$, with what is observed in the average of the simulations. In
contrast, in the large regions analysis we found no statistically significant
discrepancies, but, interestingly, the regions with the highest $\chi^2$ values
are surrounding the ecliptic poles. Thus, our results show a good agreement
with the features expected by the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model, as given by
the simulations. Yet, the outliers regions found here could suggest that the
data still contain residual contamination, like noise, due to over- or
under-estimation of systematic effects in the simulation data set.

low-mass planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disc with finite thermal
diffusivity. When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, the
main effect of thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the
planet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes on either
side of the orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes
exert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to
the one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the
lobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the `cold'
thermal torque, which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the
distance to corotation to the size of the lobes $\sim\sqrt{\chi/\Omega_p}$,
$\chi$ being the thermal diffusivity and $\Omega_p$ the orbital frequency. We
believe that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named `cold finger'
recently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes
the dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is
luminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional
disturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes. They give a torque,
named heating torque in previous work, that has an expression similar, but of
opposite sign, to the cold thermal torque.

90^\circ$ in the lepton mixing matrix $V$, arises as a consequence of $S V =
V^\ast \mathcal{P}$, where $S$ is the permutation matrix that interchanges the
second and third rows of $V$ and $\mathcal{P}$ is a diagonal matrix of phase
factors. We prove that any such $V$ may be written in the form $V = U R P$,
where $U$ is any predefined unitary matrix satisfying $S U = U^\ast$, $R$ is an
orthogonal, i.e. real, matrix, and $P$ is a diagonal matrix satisfying $P^2 =
\mathcal{P}$. Using this theorem, we demonstrate the equivalence of two ways of
constructing models for cobimaximal mixing---one way that uses a standard $CP$
symmetry and a different way that uses a $CP$ symmetry including $\mu$--$\tau$
interchange. We also present two simple seesaw models to illustrate this
equivalence; those models have, in addition to the $CP$ symmetry, flavour
symmetries broken softly by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed
neutrino singlets. Since each of the two models needs four scalar doublets, we
investigate how to accommodate the Standard Model Higgs particle in them.

often in prediction with expert advice, designing an algorithm that achieves
near-optimal regret guarantees is straightforward, using aggregation of
experts. However, when the comparison class is sufficiently rich, for instance
when the best expert and the set of experts itself changes over time, such
strategies naively require to maintain a prohibitive number of weights
(typically exponential with the time horizon). By contrast, designing
strategies that both achieve a near-optimal regret and maintain a reasonable
number of weights is highly non-trivial. We consider three increasingly
challenging objectives (simple regret, shifting regret and sparse shifting
regret) that extend existing notions defined for a fixed expert ensemble; in
each case, we design strategies that achieve tight regret bounds, adaptive to
the parameters of the comparison class, while being computationally
inexpensive. Moreover, our algorithms are anytime, agnostic to the number of
incoming experts and completely parameter-free. Such remarkable results are
made possible thanks to two simple but highly effective recipes: first the
""abstention trick"" that comes from the specialist framework and enables to
handle the least challenging notions of regret, but is limited when addressing
more sophisticated objectives. Second, the ""muting trick"" that we introduce to
give more flexibility. We show how to combine these two tricks in order to
handle the most challenging class of comparison strategies.

constraints on $H_0$ from five different methods and find that the IOI drops
from 2.85 to 0.88 (on Jeffreys' scales) when the local $H_0$ measurements is
removed. This seems to indicate that the local measurement is an outlier, thus
favoring a systematics-based explanation. We find a moderate inconsistency
(IOI=2.61) between Planck temperature and polarization. We find that current
LSS data sets including WiggleZ, SDSS RSD, CFHTLenS, CMB lensing and SZ cluster
count, are consistent one with another and when all combined. However, we find
a persistent moderate inconsistency between Planck and individual or combined
LSS probes. For Planck TT+lowTEB versus individual LSS probes, the IOI spans
the range 2.92--3.72 and increases to 3.44--4.20 when the polarization data is
added in. The joint LSS versus the combined Planck temperature and polarization
has an IOI of 2.83 in the most conservative case. But if Planck lowTEB is added
to the joint LSS to constrain $\tau$ and break degeneracies, the inconsistency
between Planck and joint LSS data increases to the high-end of the moderate
range with IOI=4.81. Whether due to systematic effects in the data or to the
underlying model, these inconsistencies need to be resolved. Finally, we
perform forecast calculations using LSST and find that the discordance between

development, there is a need for statisticians to have tools to develop robust
and defensible informative prior distributions. Whilst relevant empirical data
should, where possible, provide the basis for such priors, it is often the case
that limitations in data and/or our understanding may preclude direct
construction of a data-based prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key
technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), we have adopted a structured approach to prior
elicitation based on the SHELF elicitation framework, and routinely use this in
conjunction with calculation of probability of success (assurance) of the next
study(s) to inform internal decision making at key project milestones. The aim
of this paper is to share our experiences of embedding the use of prior
elicitation within a large pharmaceutical company, highlighting both the
benefits and challenges of prior elicitation through a series of case studies.
We have found that putting team beliefs into the shape of a quantitative
probability distribution provides a firm anchor for all internal decision
making, enabling teams to provide investment boards with formally appropriate
estimates of the probability of trial success as well as robust plans for
interim decision rules where appropriate. As an added benefit, the elicitation
process provides transparency about the beliefs and risks of the potential
medicine, ultimately enabling better portfolio and company-wide decision
making.

methods assume that the optimal values of calibration parameters are invariant
to the model inputs. In several real world applications where models involve
complex parametrizations whose optimal values depend on the model inputs, such
an assumption can be too restrictive and may lead to misleading results. We
propose a fully Bayesian methodology that produces input dependent optimal
values for the calibration parameters, as well as it characterizes the
associated uncertainties via posterior distributions. Central to methodology is
the idea of formulating the calibration parameter as a step function whose
uncertain structure is modeled properly via a binary treed process. Our method
is particularly suitable to address problems where the computer model requires
the selection of a sub-model from a set of competing ones, but the choice of
the `best' sub-model may change with the input values. The method produces a
selection probability for each sub-model given the input. We propose suitable
reversible jump operations to facilitate the challenging computations. We
assess the performance of our method against benchmark examples, and use it to
analyze a real world application with a large-scale climate model.

onto a planar solid-state target, a slightly superluminal field structure is
formed near the target surface due to the incident and reflected waves
superposition. This field structure can both extract the electrons from the
target and accelerate them. It is theoretically shown that the acceleration is
possible and stable for a wide range of electron initial conditions. PIC

GeV-level energy can be produced using a laser intensity $10^{21}-10^{22}$

Consequently, standard vision pipelines for 3D mapping, visual localization,
obstacle detection, etc. need to be adapted to take full advantage of the
availability of multiple cameras rather than treat each camera individually. In
addition, processing of fisheye images has to be supported. In this paper, we
describe the camera calibration and subsequent processing pipeline for

including finance. In this paper, we develop a new tractable procedure for
multilayer aggregation based on statistical validation, which we apply to
investor networks. Moreover, we propose two other improvements to their
analysis: transaction bootstrapping and investor categorization. The
aggregation procedure can be used to integrate security-wise and time-wise
information about investor trading networks, but it is not limited to finance.
In fact, it can be used for different applications, such as gene,
transportation, and social networks, were they inferred or observable.
Additionally, in the investor network inference, we use transaction
bootstrapping for better statistical validation. Investor categorization allows
for constant size networks and having more observations for each node, which is
important in the inference especially for less liquid securities. Furthermore,
we observe that the window size used for averaging has a substantial effect on
the number of inferred relationships. We apply this procedure by analyzing a
unique data set of Finnish shareholders during the period 2004-2009. We find
that households in the capital have high centrality in investor networks,

an implementation of the BW method. As opposed to other conventional use, SPIPS
combines all observables, i.e. radial velocities, multi-band photometry and
interferometry into a consistent physical modeling to estimate the parameters
of the stars. The large number and their redundancy insure its robustness and
improves the statistical precision. We successfully estimated the p-factor of
several MC Cepheids. Combined with our previous Galactic results, we find the
following P-p relation: -0.08(log P-1.18)+1.24. We find no evidence of a
metallicity dependent p-factor. We also derive a new calibration of the P-R
relation, logR=0.684(log P-0.517)+1.489, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.020.
We detect an IR excess for all stars at 3.6 and 4.5um, which might be the
signature of circumstellar dust. We measure a mean offset of $\Delta
m_{3.6}=0.057$mag and $\Delta m_{4.5}=0.065$mag. We provide a new P-p relation
based on a multi-wavelengths fit, and can be used for the distance scale
calibration from the BW method. The dispersion is due to the MCs width we took
into account because individual Cepheids distances are unknown. The new P-R
relation has a small intrinsic dispersion, i.e. 4.5% in radius. Such precision
will allow us to accurately apply the BW method to nearby galaxies. Finally,
the IR excesses we detect raise again the issue on using mid-IR wavelengths to
derive P-L relation and calibrate the $H_0$. These IR excesses might be the
signature of circumstellar dust, and are never taken into account when applying
the BW method at those wavelengths. Our measured offsets may give an average
bias of 2.8% on the distances derived through mid-IR P-L relations.

function (SMF) spanning a wide range of galaxy densities from the field up to
dense cores of massive galaxy clusters. Data are drawn from a sample of eight
fields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments
(ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of
galaxies down to 10^9 Msol. Taking advantage of >4000 secure spectroscopic
redshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct
3-dimensional density maps between 0.55<z<1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation
approach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local
environment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers
of high- to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward
implication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency
of (a) destroying lower-mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher-mass
galaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs
of star-forming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the
quiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMF of field
galaxies and that of denser environments we devise a simple semi-empirical
model. The model begins with a sample of ~10^6 galaxies at z_start=5 with
stellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then
evolve down to z_final=0.8 following empirical prescriptions for
star-formation, quenching, and galaxy-galaxy merging. We run the simulation
multiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts
of merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to
reproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of
these mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e.g.
galaxy groups).

destroyed by the presence of fluctuating surface magnetic charges, leading to a
classical Z_2 spin liquid. Building on this understanding, we discuss other

  Magic states are quantum resources critical for practically achieving
universal quantum computation. They exhibit the standard form of contextuality
that is known to enable probabilistic advantages in a variety of computational
and communicational tasks. Strong contextuality is an extremal form of
contextuality describing systems that exhibit logically paradoxical behaviour.
  Here, we consider special magic states that deterministically enable quantum
computation. After introducing number-theoretic techniques for constructing
exotic quantum paradoxes, we present large classes of strongly contextual magic
states that enable deterministic implementation of gates from the Clifford

relaxation and seeks stable equilibrium. However, the details of this evolution
are not fully understood. Using Illustris simulation, we probe two physically
related processes, mixing and relaxation. Though the two are driven by the same
dynamics---global time-varying potential for the energy, and torques caused by
asymmetries for angular momentum---we measure them differently. We define
mixing as the redistribution of energy and angular momentum between particles
of the two merging galaxies. We assess the degree of mixing as the difference
between the shapes of their N(E)s, and their N(L^2)s. We find that the
difference is decreasing with time, indicating mixing. To measure relaxation,
we compare N(E) of the newly merged system to N(E) of a theoretical prediction
for relaxed collisionless systems, DARKexp, and witness the system becoming
more relaxed, in the sense that N(E) approaches DARKexp N(E). Because the
dynamics driving mixing and relaxation are the same, the timescale is similar
for both. We measure two sequential timescales: a rapid, 1 Gyr phase after the
initial merger, during which the difference in N(E) of the two merging halos
decreases by ~80%, followed by a slow phase, when the difference decreases by
~50% over ~8.5 Gyrs. This is a direct measurement of the relaxation timescale.
Our work also draws attention to the fact that when a galaxy has reached Jeans
equilibrium it may not yet have reached a fully relaxed state given by DARKexp,
in that it retains information about its past history. This manifests itself
most strongly in stars being centrally concentrated. We argue that it is
particularly difficult for stars, and other tightly bound particles, to mix
because they have less time to be influenced by the fluctuating potential, even
across multiple merger events.

optical spectrum characteristic of low-excitation galaxies. Their 1.4-GHz radio
luminosities range $10^{38} \lesssim \nu L_{1.4} \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s. The
FR0CAT hosts are mostly (86%) luminous ($-21 \gtrsim M_r \gtrsim -23$) red
early-type galaxies with black hole masses $10^8 \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim
10^9 M_\odot$: similar to the hosts of FRI radio galaxies, but they are on
average a factor $\sim$1.6 less massive. The number density of FR0CAT sources
is $\sim$5 times higher than that of FRIs, and thus they represent the dominant
population of radio sources in the local Universe. Different scenarios are
considered to account for the smaller sizes and larger abundance of FR0s with
respect to FRIs. An age-size scenario that considers FR0s as young radio
galaxies that will all eventually evolve into extended radio sources cannot be
reconciled with the large space density of FR0s. However, the radio activity
recurrence, with the duration of the active phase covering a wide range of
values and with short active periods strongly favored with respect to longer
ones, might account for their large density number. Alternatively, the jet
properties of FR0s might be intrinsically different from those of the FRIs, the
former class having lower bulk Lorentz factors, possibly due to lower black
hole spins. Our study indicates that FR0s and FRI/IIs can be interpreted as two
extremes of a continuous population of radio sources that is characterized by a
broad distribution of sizes and luminosities of their extended radio emission,
but shares a single class of host galaxies.

active galactic nucleus (AGN) with its host galaxy and, besides being
responsible for feeding the black hole, provides important information on the
feedback that nuclear activity produces on the galaxy. In this review we
summarize our current understanding of the close environment of accreting
supermassive black holes obtained from studies of local AGN carried out in the
infrared and X-ray band. The structure of this circumnuclear material is
complex, clumpy and dynamical, and its covering factor depends on the accretion
properties of the AGN. From the infrared point of view, this obscuring material
is a transition zone between the broad- and narrow-line region, and at least in
some galaxies, it consists of two structures: an equatorial disk/torus and a
polar component. In the X-ray regime, the obscuration is produced by multiple
absorbers on various spatial scales, mostly associated with the torus and the
broad-line region. In the next decade the new generation of infrared and X-ray
facilities will greatly contribute to our understanding of the structure and
physical properties of nuclear obscuration in AGN.

isolation of a single, time-reversal broken running-wave mode of a

a round-trip geometrical (Pancharatnam) polarization rotation, breaking the
inversion symmetry of the photonic modes. The residual time-reversal symmetry
between forward-$\sigma^+$/ backwards-$\sigma^-$ modes is broken through an
atomic Faraday rotation induced by an optically pumped ensemble of $^{87}$Rb
atoms residing in the resonator. We observe a splitting of 6.3 linewidths
between time-reversal partners and a corresponding optical isolation of $\sim$
20.1(4) dB, with 83(1)% relative forward cavity transmission. Finally, we
explore the impact of twisted resonators on T-breaking of intra-cavity Rydberg
polaritons, a crucial ingredient of photonic materials and specifically

neural network methods to question answering (QA). These approaches have
achieved state of the art results in simplified closed-domain settings such as
the SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) dataset, which provides a pre-selected
passage, from which the answer to a given question may be extracted. More
recently, researchers have begun to tackle open-domain QA, in which the model
is given a question and access to a large corpus (e.g., wikipedia) instead of a
pre-selected passage (Chen et al., 2017a). This setting is more complex as it
requires large-scale search for relevant passages by an information retrieval
component, combined with a reading comprehension model that ""reads"" the
passages to generate an answer to the question. Performance in this setting
lags considerably behind closed-domain performance. In this paper, we present a
novel open-domain QA system called Reinforced Ranker-Reader $(R^3)$, based on
two algorithmic innovations. First, we propose a new pipeline for open-domain
QA with a Ranker component, which learns to rank retrieved passages in terms of
likelihood of generating the ground-truth answer to a given question. Second,
we propose a novel method that jointly trains the Ranker along with an
answer-generation Reader model, based on reinforcement learning. We report
extensive experimental results showing that our method significantly improves
on the state of the art for multiple open-domain QA datasets.

novel state-space approach to perform dynamic NMF (D-NMF). In the proposed
probabilistic framework, the NMF coefficients act as the state variables and
their dynamics are modeled using a multi-lag nonnegative vector autoregressive
(N-VAR) model within the process equation. We use expectation maximization and
propose a maximum-likelihood estimation framework to estimate the basis matrix
and the N-VAR model parameters. Interestingly, the N-VAR model parameters are
obtained by simply applying NMF. Moreover, we derive a maximum a posteriori
estimate of the state variables (i.e., the NMF coefficients) that is based on a
prediction step and an update step, similarly to the Kalman filter. We
illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach using different numerical
simulations where D-NMF significantly outperforms its static counterpart.
Experimental results for three different applications show that the proposed
approach outperforms two state-of-the-art NMF approaches that exploit temporal
dependencies, namely a nonnegative hidden Markov model and a frame stacking
approach, while it requires less memory and computational power.

constraint of a fixed average spectral power density using an analytical
approximation. The results are compared with generalized on-off keying (OOK)

on longitudinal data has drawn great interest from computer vision researchers.
The current state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks are
based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, a key challenge in
applying CNN to biological problems is that the available labeled training
samples are very limited. Another issue for CNN to be applied in computer aided
diagnosis applications is that to achieve better diagnosis and prognosis
accuracy, one usually has to deal with the longitudinal dataset, i.e., the
dataset of images scanned at different time points. Here we argue that an
enhanced CNN model with transfer learning for the joint analysis of tasks from
multiple time points or regions of interests may have a potential to improve
the accuracy of computer aided diagnosis. To reach this goal, we innovate a CNN
based deep learning multi-task dictionary learning framework to address the
above challenges. Firstly, we pre-train CNN on the ImageNet dataset and
transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model to the medical imaging
progression representation, generating the features for different tasks. Then,
we propose a novel unsupervised learning method, termed Multi-task Stochastic
Coordinate Coding (MSCC), for learning different tasks by using shared and
individual dictionaries and generating the sparse features required to predict
the future cognitive clinical scores. We apply our new model in a publicly
available neuroimaging cohort to predict clinical measures with two different
feature sets and compare them with seven other state-of-the-art methods. The

nanoparticle and CO2 as a base fluid. No experimental data are available on the
thermal conductivity of CO2 based nanofluid. In this study, the effect of the
formation of a nanolayer (or molecular layering) at the gas-solid interface on
thermal conductivity is investigated using equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD)

bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various
formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency.
Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison between programming
concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented
programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process
algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on
the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS workshop series has
run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly
construed. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future
investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the
specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the
concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and
practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an
annual combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical

tension, intermolecular effects and evaporative fluxes. Parameter ranges for
evaporation- dominated and condensation-dominated regimes and a critical case
are identified. Interfacial instabilities driven by the competition between the
disjoining pressure and evaporative effects are studied via linear stability
analysis. Transient pattern formation in nearly-flat evolving films in the

We analyze how RON-Gauss benefits from the DFM effect, and present multiple
algorithms for a range of machine learning applications, including both
unsupervised and supervised learning. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that (a)
our algorithms satisfy the strong $\epsilon$-differential privacy guarantee,

show that (a) RON-Gauss outperforms previous approaches by up to an order of

small. Thus, RON-Gauss can serve as a key enabler for real-world deployment of

interacting spins. The interaction leads to Cooper instability and pairing of
CS fermions, and to CS superconductivity which spontaneously violates the
continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry generating a linearly-dispersing gapless
Nambu-Goldstone mode due to phase fluctuations. We evaluate this mode and show
that it is in high-precision agreement with magnons of the corresponding
N\'{e}el antiferromagnet irrespective to the lattice symmetry. Using the
fermion formulation of a system with competing interactions, we show that the
frustration gives raise to nontrivial long-range four, six, and higher-leg
interaction vertices mediated by the CS gauge field, which are responsible for
restoring of the continuous symmetry at sufficiently strong frustration. We
identify these new interaction vertices and discuss their implications to
unconventional phase transitions. We also apply the proposed theory to a model
of anyons that can be tuned continuously from fermions to bosons.

bright regions that are less biased, we do not find $\mathcal{R}$ on (sub)kpc
scales correlate with galactocentric distance, velocity dispersion or the star
formation rate. The lack of correlation between SFR and $\mathcal{R}$ indicates
that the CO optical depth is not sensitive to stellar energy input, or that any
such sensitivity is easily masked by other factors. Extending the analysis to
all regions with $\rm ^{12}CO$ emission by spectral stacking, we find that 5

image data. Breakthroughs in computer vision technology are often marked by
advances in inference techniques. This thesis proposes novel inference schemes
and demonstrates applications in computer vision. We propose inference
techniques for both generative and discriminative vision models. The use of
generative models in vision is often hampered by the difficulty of posterior
inference. We propose techniques for improving inference in MCMC sampling and
message-passing inference. Our inference strategy is to learn separate
discriminative models that assist Bayesian inference in a generative model.
Experiments on a range of generative models show that the proposed techniques
accelerate the inference process and/or converge to better solutions. A main
complication in the design of discriminative models is the inclusion of prior
knowledge. We concentrate on CNN models and propose a generalization of
standard spatial convolutions to bilateral convolutions. We generalize the
existing use of bilateral filters and then propose new neural network
architectures with learnable bilateral filters, which we call `Bilateral Neural
Networks'. Experiments demonstrate the use of the bilateral networks on a wide
range of image and video tasks and datasets. In summary, we propose techniques
for better inference in several vision models ranging from inverse graphics to
freely parameterized neural networks. In generative models, our inference
techniques alleviate some of the crucial hurdles in Bayesian posterior
inference, paving new ways for the use of model based machine learning in
vision. In discriminative CNN models, the proposed filter generalizations aid
in the design of new neural network architectures that can handle sparse
high-dimensional data as well as provide a way to incorporate prior knowledge

graph structures, graph dynamics, and behaviours of replicators have been
explored. These models have primarily been studied in the framework of
facilitation of cooperation, and much previous research has shed light on this
field of study. However, there has been little attention devoted to truncation
selection as most models employ proportional selection (such as in the
replicator equation) or `imitate the best.' Here we systematically explore
truncation selection on periodic square lattices, where replicators below a
fitness threshold are culled and the reproduction probabilities are equal for
all survivors. We employ two variations of this method: independent truncation,
where the threshold is fixed; and dependent truncation, which is a
generalization of `imitate the best.' Further, we explore the effects of
diffusion in our networks in the following orders of operation:
contest-diffusion-offspring (CDO), and diffusion-contest-offspring (DCO). CDO
and DCO frequently facilitate and diminish cooperation, respectively. For
independent truncation, we find three regimes determined by the fitness
threshold: cooperation decreases as we raise the threshold; polymorphisms and
extinction can occur; and the entire population goes extinct. Further, we show
how an intermediate sucker's payoff maximizes cooperation in the DCO
independent truncation model. We find that dependent truncation affects games
differently; lower levels reduce cooperation for the Hawk Dove game and
increase it for the Stag Hunt, and higher levels produce the opposite effects.
We compare these truncation methods to proportional selection, and show that
they can facilitate cooperation. We conclude that truncation selection can
impact the prevalence of cooperation in complex ways, and therefore merit
further study.

samples from two domains and nothing else, learn a mapping between the two,
which preserves semantics. Due to the lack of paired samples and without any
definition of the semantic information, the problem might seem ill-posed.
Specifically, in typical cases, it seems possible to build infinitely many
alternative mappings from every target mapping. This apparent ambiguity stands
in sharp contrast to the recent empirical success in solving this problem.
  We identify the abstract notion of aligning two domains in a semantic way
with concrete terms of minimal relative complexity. A theoretical framework for
measuring the complexity of compositions of functions is developed in order to
show that it is reasonable to expect the minimal complexity mapping to be
unique. The measured complexity used is directly related to the depth of the
neural networks being learned and a semantically aligned mapping could then be
captured simply by learning using architectures that are not much bigger than
the minimal architecture.
  Various predictions are made based on the hypothesis that semantic alignment
can be captured by the minimal mapping. These are verified extensively. In
addition, a new mapping algorithm is proposed and shown to lead to better
mapping results.

that an effect in the vector boson sector of Nature due to strong interactions

effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. When the instruments,
exposure and outcome are not measured in the same sample, Angrist and Krueger
(1992) suggested to use two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimators that
use sample moments from an instrument-exposure sample and an instrument-outcome
sample. However, this method is biased if the two samples are from
heterogeneous populations so that the distributions of the instruments are
different. In linear structural equation models, we derive a new class of TSIV
estimators that are robust to heterogeneous samples under the key assumption
that the structural relations in the two samples are the same. The widely used
two-sample two-stage least squares estimator belongs to this class. It is
generally not asymptotically efficient, although we find that it performs
similarly to the optimal TSIV estimator in most practical situations. We then
attempt to relax the linearity assumption. We find that, unlike one-sample
analyses, the TSIV estimator is not robust to misspecified exposure model.
Additionally, to nonparametrically identify the magnitude of the causal effect,
the noise in the exposure must have the same distributions in the two samples.
However, this assumption is in general untestable because the exposure is not
observed in one sample. Nonetheless, we may still identify the sign of the
causal effect in the absence of homogeneity of the noise.

moving away from the ideal case, we suggest the modified model-free knockoffs
method called graphical nonlinear knockoffs (RANK) to accommodate the unknown
covariate distribution. We provide theoretical justifications on the robustness
of our modified procedure by showing that the false discovery rate (FDR) is
asymptotically controlled at the target level and the power is asymptotically
one with the estimated covariate distribution. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first formal theoretical result on the power for the knockoffs
procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to existing approaches,
our method performs competitively in both FDR control and power. A real data
set is analyzed to further assess the performance of the suggested knockoffs
procedure.

model for the LUX detector. The detector took data during two periods of
searching for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) searches. After the
first period completed, a time-varying non-uniform negative charge developed in
the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) panels that define the radial boundary of
the detector's active volume. This caused electric field variations in the
detector in time, depth and azimuth, generating an electrostatic
radially-inward force on electrons on their way upward to the liquid surface.
To map this behavior, 3D electric field maps of the detector's active volume
were built on a monthly basis. This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL
Multiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected
on a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the
course of the exposure from -3.6 to $-5.5~\mu$C/m$^2$. From our studies, we
deduce that the electric field magnitude varied while the mean value of the
field of $\sim200$~V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure. As a result
of this work the varying electric fields and their impact on event
reconstruction and discrimination were successfully modeled.

  Detonation: Genetic Algorithm and Optimization Procedure","Manuscript has been submitted to a journal and is under review",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most important and difficult parts of constructing a
multidimensional numerical simulation of flame acceleration and
deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a reacting flow is finding a
reliable and affordable model of the chemical and diffusive properties. For
simulations of realistic scenarios, full detailed chemical models are
computationally prohibitive. In addition, they are usually inaccurate for
high-temperature and high-pressure shock-laden flows. This paper presents a
general approach for developing an automated procedure to determine the
reaction parameters for a simplified chemical-diffusive model to simulate flame
acceleration and DDT in stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen
mixtures. The procedure uses a combination of a genetic algorithm and
Nelder-Mead optimization scheme to find the optimal reaction parameters for a
reaction rate based on an Arrhenius form for conversion of reactants to
products. The model finds six optimal reaction parameters that reproduce six
target flame and detonation properties. Results from the optimization procedure
show that the optimal reaction parameters, when used in 1-D reactive
Navier-Stokes simulations, closely reproduce the target flame and detonation
properties for the stoichiometric methane-air and ethylene-oxygen mixtures.
When the reaction parameters are used as input in a 2-D simulation of flame
acceleration and DDT in an obstacle-laden channel containing stoichiometric
methane-air, the simulation results closely follow the transition to detonation
observed in experiments. This automated procedure for finding parameters for a
proposed reaction model makes it possible to simulate the behavior of flames
and detonations in large, complex scenarios, which would otherwise be an
incalculable problem.

central region of the ATLAS detector at the LHC. It is a sampling calorimeter
consisting of alternating thin steel plates and scintillating tiles. Wavelength
shifting fibers coupled to the tiles collect the produced light and are read
out by photomultiplier tubes. Currently, an analog sum of the processed signal
of several photomultipliers serves as input to the first level of trigger.
Photomultiplier signals are then digitized and stored on detector and are only
transferred off detector once the first trigger acceptance has been confirmed.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has envisaged a series of upgrades towards a
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) delivering five times the LHC nominal
instantaneous luminosity. The ATLAS Phase II upgrade, in 2024, will accommodate
the detector and data acquisition system for the HL-LHC. In particular, TileCal
will undergo a major replacement of its on- and off-detector electronics. All
signals will be digitized and then transferred directly to the off-detector
electronics, where the signals will be reconstructed, stored, and sent to the
first level of trigger at a rate of 40 MHz. This will provide better precision
of the calorimeter signals used by the trigger system and will allow the
development of more complex trigger algorithms. Changes to the electronics will
also contribute to the reliability and redundancy of the system. Three
different front-end options are presently being investigated for the upgrade.
Results of extensive laboratory tests and with beams of the three options will
be presented, as well as the latest results on the development of the power

sampling calorimeter and it covers the region of $|\eta| < 1.7$. The
scintillation light produced in the scintillator tiles is transmitted by
wavelength shifting fibers to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The analog signals
from the PMTs are amplified, shaped and digitized by sampling the signal every
25 ns. The TileCal frontend electronics reads out the signals produced by about
10000 channels measuring energies ranging from ~30 MeV to ~2 TeV. Each stage of
the signal production from scintillation light to the signal reconstruction is
monitored and calibrated. The performance of the calorimeter has been studied
in-situ employing cosmic ray muons and a large sample of proton-proton
collisions acquired during the operations of the LHC. Prompt isolated muons of
high momentum from electroweak bosons decays are employed to study the energy
response of the calorimeter at the electromagnetic scale. The calorimeter
response to hadronic particles is evaluated with a sample of isolated hadrons
and the modelling of the response by the Monte Carlo simulation is discussed.
The calorimeter timing calibration and resolutions are studied with jets.
Results on the calorimeter operation and performance are presented, including
the calibration, stability, absolute energy scale, uniformity and time
resolution. These results show that the TileCal performance is within the
design requirements and has given essential contribution to reconstructed
objects and physics results.

the benefits of a full-scale likelihood approach with the tractability of the

builds upon the quadratic delenser by taking into account all order lensing and

of prior side information. The problem setup includes a database of $K$
independent messages possibly replicated on several servers, and a user that
needs to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior
side information in the form of a subset of $M$ messages, not containing the
desired message and unknown to the servers. This problem is motivated by
practical settings in which the user can obtain side information
opportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages
using classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the
required message without revealing its identity while minimizing the amount of
data downloaded from the servers.
  We focus on achieving information-theoretic privacy in two scenarios: (i) the
user wants to protect jointly its demand and side information; (ii) the user
wants to protect only the information about its demand, but not the side
information. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the
case of a single server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that
the minimum download cost is $K-M$ messages, and in the second scenario it is
$\lceil \frac{K}{M+1}\rceil$ messages, which should be compared to $K$
messages, the minimum download cost in the case of no side information. Then,
we extend some of our results to the case of the database replicated on
multiple servers. Our proof techniques relate PIR with side information to the
index coding problem. We leverage this connection to prove converse results, as
well as to design achievability schemes.

F606W and F814W (B, V and I) passbands were measured at 1 pixel intervals along
the major axes and fitted to sech^2 functions convolved with the instrument
line spread function (LSF). The LSF was determined from the average point
spread function (PSF) of ~20 stars in each passband and field, convolved with a
line of uniform brightness to simulate disk blurring. A spread function for a
clumpy disk was also used for comparison. The resulting scale heights were
found to be proportional to galactic mass, with the average height for a
10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun galaxy at z=1.5-2.5 equal to 0.63+-0.24 kpc. This value is
probably the result of a blend between thin and thick disk components that
cannot be resolved. Evidence for such two-component structure is present in an
inverse correlation between height and midplane surface brightness. Models
suggest that the thick disk is observed best between the clumps, and there the
average scale height is 1.06+-0.43 kpc for the same mass and redshift. A
0.63+-0.68 mag V-I color differential with height is also evidence for a
mixture of thin and thick components.

for nearby galaxy clusters. Both X-ray to optical flux/luminosity properties,
($X/O$, $L_{X}$/$L_{B}$, $L_{X}$/$L_{K}$), were investigated for optically
identified member galaxies. X-ray luminosity values of our point sources are
found to be faint (40.08 $\leq$ log($L_{X}$) $\leq$ 42.39 erg s$^{-1}$). The
luminosity range of point sources reveals possible contributions to X-ray
emission from LLAGNs, X-ray Binaries and star formation. We estimated $\sim$ 2
times higher X-ray overdensities from galaxies within galaxy clusters compared
to fields. Our results demonstrate that optical overdensities are much higher
than X-ray overdensities at the cluster's centre, whereas X-ray overdensities
increase through the outskirts of clusters. We conclude that high pressure from
the cluster's centre affects the balance of galaxies and they lose a
significant amount of their fuels; as a result, clustering process quenches
X-ray emission of the member galaxies. We also find evidence that the existence
of X-ray bright sources within cluster environment can be explained by two main
phenomena: contributions from off-nuclear sources and/or AGN triggering caused
by galaxy interactions rather than AGN fuelling.

bit-flipping operation, and the linear microwave elements. The QND detector is
composed of several cross-Kerr effect systems which can be realized by coupling
two superconducting transmission line resonators to a superconducting molecule

protocol has good applications in long-distance quantum communication assisted

and are specific to aspect ratios where the liquid film mean thickness is
several orders of magnitude less than the substrate characteristic dimension.
In the absence of stabilizing gravitational acceleration, the growth rate of
thermocapillary instabilities is further intensified, driving the film to
rupture at an even earlier time. Numerical simulations of zero gravity dynamics
of Newtonian liquid films on a solid, horizontal, isothermal substrate are
conducted. When the solid, isothermal substrate is replaced with one that
possesses one- dimensional porosity, is fully saturated with the same fluid as
that of the liquid film and is deep enough to accommodate all of the liquid on

preventing rupture and the film lifespan is prolonged. This nonlinear evolution
is visualized and quantified using recurrence plots.

the ""permutation-rank"" of a matrix. We first describe how the classical
non-negative rank model enforces restrictions that may be undesirable in

With balanced on-site potential, a flat band can be detected by asymmetric

able to retrieve the contents in shorter time periods. However, caching in the
network did not always consider secure storage (due to the compromise between
time performance and security). In this paper, a novel decentralized secure
coded caching approach is proposed. In this solution, nodes only transmit coded
files to avoid eavesdropper wiretapping and protect the user contents. In this
technique random vectors are used to combine the contents using XOR operation.
We modeled the proposed coded caching scheme by a Shannon cipher system to show
that coded caching achieves asymptotic perfect secrecy. The proposed coded
caching scheme significantly simplifies the routing protocol in cached networks
while it reduces over-caching and achieves a higher throughput capacity
compared to uncoded caching in reactive routing. It is shown that with the
proposed coded caching scheme any content can be retrieved by selecting a
random path while achieving asymptotic optimum solution. We have also studied
the cache hit probability and shown that the coded cache hit probability is
significantly higher than uncoded caching. A secure caching update algorithm is
also presented.

provide insights into the general process of knowledge acquisition. Recent
methods from network science applied to language learning have advanced the
field, particularly by noting associations between densely connected words and
acquisition. However, the importance of sparse areas of the network, or
knowledge gaps, remains unexplored. Here we create a semantic feature network
in which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to
semantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles
of applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose
manifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of
multiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16
to 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained
null model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections.
Furthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers
with differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word
level, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains
comparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with
filling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length
and frequency of the corresponding word. Finally, we show that the large-scale
architecture of the semantic feature network is topologically accommodating to
many node orders. We discuss the importance of topology in language learning,
and we speculate that the formation and filling of knowledge gaps may be a
robust feature of knowledge acquisition.

spectra with linearly vanishing density-of-state (DOS) at the Dirac point,
whereas, the others reported spectra with a gap of 60 meV pinned to the Fermi
level in the quasi-free-standing graphene monolayer. Here we systematically
studied the two contradicted tunnelling spectra of the quasi-free-standing
graphene monolayer on several different substrates and provided a consistent
interpretation about the result. The gap in the spectra arises from the
out-of-plane phonons in graphene, which mix the Dirac electrons at the
Brillouin zone corners with the nearly free-electron states at the zone center.
Our experiment indicated that interactions with substrates could effectively
suppress effects of the out-of-plane phonons in graphene and enable us to
detect only the DOS of the Dirac electrons in the spectra. We also show that it
is possible to switch on and off the out-of-plane phonons of graphene at the
nanoscale, i.e., the tunnelling spectra show switching between the two distinct

the support vectors and their corresponding Lagrange multiplier $\alpha_i$'s
are automatically selected and determined in each iteration. It can be seen
that the complexity of our algorithm in each iteration is only $O(k^2)$, where
$k$ is the number of support vectors. Experimental results on some real data

whether $\nu_p(H)$ divides $\nu_p(G)$ for every $H\leq G$ to almost simple
groups. This result substantially generalizes the previous result by G. Navarro
and also provides an alternative proof for the Navarro theorem.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ""ConvNets"") have demonstrated the

environment. Such information is manipulated for a wide range of purposes
spanning from basic object and material perception to complex gesture
interpretations. There have been novel studies in cognitive science for
in-depth understanding of visual information manipulation, which lead to answer
questions such as: how we infer 2D/3D motion from a sequence of 2D images? how
we understand a motion from a single image frame? how we see forest avoiding
trees?
  Leveraging on congruence, linear mapping transformation determination between
a set of shapes facilitate motion perception. Present study methodizes recent
discoveries of human cognitive ability for scene understanding. The proposed
method processes images hierarchically, that is an iterative analysis of scene
abstractions using a rapidly converging heuristic iterative method. The method
hierarchically abstracts images; the abstractions are represented in polar
coordinate system, and any two consecutive abstractions have incremental level
of details. The method then creates a graph of approximated linear mapping
transformations based on circular shift permutations of hierarchical
abstractions. The graph is then traversed in best-first fashion to find best
linear mapping transformation. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed
using normal, noisy, and deformed images. Additionally, the present study
deduces (i) the possibility of determining optimal mapping linear
transformations in logarithmic iterations with respect to the precision of
results, and (ii) computational cost is independent from the resolution of
input shapes.

Mid-infrared observations suggest that we are witnessing dust formation and
grain evolution. Semi-regular oscillatory variability in the star's light curve
is observed during the current outburst. Absorption lines develop a second blue
component on a timescale twice that length. The variability may consist of one
(quasi-)periodic component with P ~ 425/850 d with additional variations
superimposed. During its current S Doradus outburst, R71 occupies a region in
the HR diagram at the high-luminosity extension of the Cepheid instability
strip and exhibits similar irregular variations as RV Tau variables. LBVs do
not pass the Cepheid instability strip because of core evolution, but they
develop comparable cool, low-mass, extended atmospheres in which convective
instabilities may occur. As in the case of RV Tau variables, the occurrence of
double absorption lines with an apparent regular cycle may be due to shocks
within the atmosphere and period doubling may explain the factor of two in the

logical argument that rules out the possibility of describing quantum phenomena
within the framework of a local and realistic model of hidden variables in
which the observers are free to choose their own experimental settings. In this
paper we show, however, that the GHZ argument implicitly relies on an
additional crucial assumption, which is not required by fundamental physical
principles and had gone unnoticed. Namely, we note that the argument implicitly
assumes the existence of an absolute angular frame of reference with respect to
which the polarization properties of the hypothetical hidden configurations of
the entangled particles as well as the orientation of the measurement apparatus
that test the system can be defined. We further note that such an absolute
frame of reference would not exist if the hidden configurations of the
entangled particles spontaneously break the gauge rotational symmetry. Indeed,
by skipping this unnecessary additional assumption we are able to build an

that objects are small and crowded in remote sensing imagery. To tackle with

The LFE module is based on our findings that aggressively increasing dilation
factors fails to aggregate local features due to sparsity of the kernel, and
detrimental to small objects. The proposed LFE module solves this problem by
aggregating local features with decreasing dilation factor. We tested our
network on three remote sensing datasets and acquired remarkably good results

Pauli-Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the itinerant electrons. The Rashba
interaction considered is derived from the violation of inversion symmetry at
interfaces between ferromagnets and heavy metals. In equilibrium, the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction gives rise to a torque corresponding to the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. When there is a current flowing, the
spin-orbit torque experienced by the itinerant electrons in short domain walls
has both field-like and damping-like components. However, when the domain wall
width is increased, the damping-like component, which is the counterpart of the
non-adiabatic spin transfer torque, decreases rapidly at the domain wall
center. In contrast to the non-adiabatic spin transfer torque, the damping-like
spin-orbit torque does not approach to zero far away from the domain wall
center, even in the adiabatic limit. The scattering of spin-up and spin-down
wave functions, which is caused by the Rashba spin-orbit interaction and the
spatial variation of magnetization profile in the domain wall, gives rise to
the finite damping-like spin-orbit torque.

minimal unified EoS functional able to describe the smooth part of the nuclear

large variety of models, and interpolate continuously between them. The
parameter space is sampled and filtered through the constraint of nuclear mass
reproduction. We show that this simple analytical meta-modeling has a
predictive power on masses, radii, and skins comparable to full HF or ETF

that the covariant representations with unique spin are equivalent with

anti-prenex normal forms of pure first-order logic (FOLDNFs) that do not
contain $\vee$ within the scope of quantifiers. The disjuncts of these FOLDNFs
are equivalent to prenex normal forms whose quantifier-free parts are
conjunctions of atomic and negated atomic formulae (= Herbrand formulae). In
contrast to the usual algorithms for Herbrand formulae, neither skolemization
nor unification algorithms with function symbols are applied. Instead, a
procedure is described that rests on nothing but equivalence transformations
within pure first-order logic (FOL). This procedure involves the application of
a calculus for negative normal forms (the NNF-calculus) with $A \dashv\vdash A
\wedge A$ (= $\wedge$I) as the sole rule that increases the complexity of given
FOLDNFs. The described algorithm illustrates how, in the case of Herbrand
formulae, decision problems can be solved through a systematic search for
proofs that reduce the number of applications of the rule $\wedge$I to a
minimum in the NNF-calculus. In the case of Herbrand formulae, it is even
possible to entirely abstain from applying $\wedge$I. Finally, it is shown how
the described procedure can be used within an optimized general search for
proofs of contradiction and what kind of questions arise for a
$\wedge$I-minimal proof strategy in the case of a general search for proofs of
contradiction.

simultaneously, has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. Unfortunately,
due to the hardware limitations, the hyperspectral image (HSI) is vulnerable to
various degradations, such noises (random noise, HSI denoising), blurs
(Gaussian and uniform blur, HSI deblurring), and down-sampled (both spectral
and spatial downsample, HSI super-resolution). Previous HSI restoration methods
are designed for one specific task only. Besides, most of them start from the
1-D vector or 2-D matrix models and cannot fully exploit the structurally
spectral-spatial correlation in 3-D HSI. To overcome these limitations, in this
work, we propose a unified low-rank tensor recovery model for comprehensive HSI
restoration tasks, in which non-local similarity between spectral-spatial cubic
and spectral correlation are simultaneously captured by 3-order tensors.
Further, to improve the capability and flexibility, we formulate it as a
weighted low-rank tensor recovery (WLRTR) model by treating the singular values
differently, and study its analytical solution. We also consider the exclusive
stripe noise in HSI as the gross error by extending WLRTR to robust principal
component analysis (WLRTR-RPCA). Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
WLRTR models consistently outperform state-of-the-arts in typical low level
vision HSI tasks, including denoising, destriping, deblurring and
super-resolution.

occur, and (c) protocols whose ballot secrecy depends on fresh data coming from
other phases. The second advantage is that it can significantly improve
verification efficiency, as the individual conditions are often simpler to
verify. E.g., for the LEE protocol, we obtain a speedup of over two orders of

the electronic structure is changed at the quantum phase transition, which

introduced a new ad format called ""Incentivized Advertising"" or ""Rewarded
Advertising"", whereby users receive rewards in exchange for watching ads. There
is much debate in the industry regarding its' effectiveness. On the one hand,
incentivized advertising is less intrusive and annoying, but on the other hand,
users might be more interested in the rewards rather than the ad content. Using
a large dataset of 1 million impressions from a mobile advertising platform,
and in three separate quasi-experimental approaches, we find that incentivized
advertising leads to lower users' click-through rates, but a higher overall
install rate of the advertised app.
  In the second part, we study the mechanism of how incentivized advertising
affects users' behavior. We test the hypothesis that incentivized advertising
causes a temptation effect, whereby users prefer to collect and enjoy their
rewards immediately, instead of pursuing the ads. We find the temptation effect
is stronger when (i) users have to wait longer before receiving the rewards and
when (ii) the value of the reward is relatively larger. We further find support
that incentivized advertising has a positive effect of reducing ad annoyance --
an effect that is stronger for small-screen mobile devices, where advertising
is more annoying. Finally, we take the publisher's perspective and quantify the
overall effect on ad revenue. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest
switching to incentivized advertising would increase the publisher's revenue by
$3.10 per 1,000 impressions.

revisit the random phone call model and show that it is possible to disseminate
a rumor to all processes with high probability using $\Theta(\ln n)$ rounds of
communication and only $n+o(n)$ messages of size $b$, all of which are
asymptotically optimal and achievable with pull and push-then-pull algorithms.
This contradicts two highly-cited lower bounds of Karp et al. stating that any
algorithm in the random phone call model running in $\mathcal{O}(\ln n)$ rounds
with communication peers chosen uniformly at random requires at least
$\omega(n)$ messages to disseminate a rumor with high probability, and that any
address-oblivious algorithm needs $\Omega(n \ln \ln n)$ messages regardless of
the number of communication rounds. The reason for this contradiction is that
in the original work, processes do not have to share the rumor once the
communication is established. However, it is implicitly assumed that they
always do so in the proofs of their lower bounds, which, it turns out, is not
optimal. Our algorithms are strikingly simple, address-oblivious, and robust
against $\epsilon n$ adversarial failures and stochastic failures occurring
with probability $\delta$ for any $0 \leq \{\epsilon,\delta\} < 1$.
Furthermore, they can handle multiple rumors of size $b \in \omega(\ln n \ln
\ln n)$ with $nb + o(nb)$ bits of communication per rumor.

quantum channel, which improve the previous bound from [Tomamichel/Berta/Renes,
Nat. Commun. 7, 2016]. As applications, we study quantum communication over
depolarizing channels and amplitude damping channels with finite resources.
Second, we find an SDP strong converse bound for the quantum capacity of an
arbitrary quantum channel, which means the fidelity of any sequence of codes
with a rate exceeding this bound will vanish exponentially fast as the number
of channel uses increases. Furthermore, we prove that the SDP strong converse
bound improves the partial transposition bound introduced by Holevo and Werner.
Third, we prove that this SDP strong converse bound is equal to the so-called
max-Rains information, which is an analog to the Rains information introduced
in [Tomamichel/Wilde/Winter, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63:715, 2017]. Our SDP
strong converse bound is weaker than the Rains information, but it is
efficiently computable for general quantum channels.

expansive path to get high resolution output. But differently, the DeepUNet
uses DownBlocks instead of convolution layers in the contracting path and uses
UpBlock in the expansive path. The two novel blocks bring two new connections
that are U-connection and Plus connection. They are promoted to get more
precise segmentation results. To verify our network architecture, we made a new

particle rearrangement and fluid redistribution. An increased packing density
inhibits particle rearrangement and only leaves fluid redistribution as the

chiral magnetic field in the early universe. We are interested in the
temperature dependent term in the chiral vortical effect. There are no changes
in the magnetic energy spectrum at large lengthscales but in the Kolmogorov
regime we do find a difference. Our numerical results show that the Gaussian
peak in the magnetic spectrum becomes negatively skewed. The negatively skewed
peak can be fitted with a beta distribution. Analytically one can relate the
non-Gaussianity of the distribution to the temperature dependent vorticity
term. The vorticity term is therefore responsible for the beta distribution in
the magnetic spectrum. Since the beta distribution has already been used to
model turbulent dispersion in fluids, hence it seems that the presence of
hotter or colder particles may lead to turbulence in the magnetized plasma.

the assumption of so-called commuting towers, we show that taking crossed
products by such actions preserves a number of relevant classes of C*-algebras,
including: $D$-absorbing C*-algebras, where $D$ is a strongly self-absorbing
C*-algebra, stable C*-algebras, C*-algebras with finite nuclear dimension (or
decomposition rank), C*-algebras with finite stable rank (or real rank), and
C*-algebras whose K-theory is either trivial, rational, or $n$-divisible for
$n\in\mathbb{N}$. The combination of nuclearity and the UCT is also shown to be
preserved by these actions. Some of these results are new even in the
well-studied case of the Rokhlin property. Additionally, and under some
technical assumptions, we show that finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting
towers implies the (weak) tracial Rokhlin property.

one-forms to those that are co-closed, effectively implementing a gauge
invariance by exact distributional one-forms of the vector potential. In order
to obtain also the Maxwell dynamics in the limit, one has to restrict the
initial data such that the Lorenz constraint is well behaved. With this, we
naturally find conservation of current. For the quantum problem we first
construct the generally covariant quantum Proca field theory in curved

the theory is local. We define a precise notion of continuity of the quantum
Proca field with respect to the mass. With this notion we investigate the zero

limit exists if and only if the class of test one-forms is restricted to
co-closed ones, again implementing a gauge equivalence relation by exact

are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the

these results to the complete unit-demand, additive, and XOS setting, to i.i.d.
subadditive bidders, and to the max-min setting.

deterioration in the presence of small-size pedestrians that are relatively far
from the camera. Motivated by the observation that pedestrians of disparate
spatial scales exhibit distinct visual appearances, we propose in this paper an
active pedestrian detector that explicitly operates over multiple-layer
neuronal representations of the input still image. More specifically,
convolutional neural nets such as ResNet and faster R-CNNs are exploited to
provide a rich and discriminative hierarchy of feature representations as well
as initial pedestrian proposals. Here each pedestrian observation of distinct
size could be best characterized in terms of the ResNet feature representation
at a certain layer of the hierarchy; Meanwhile, initial pedestrian proposals
are attained by faster R-CNNs techniques, i.e. region proposal network and
follow-up region of interesting pooling layer employed right after the specific
ResNet convolutional layer of interest, to produce joint predictions on the
bounding-box proposals' locations and categories (i.e. pedestrian or not). This
is engaged as input to our active detector where for each initial pedestrian
proposal, a sequence of coordinate transformation actions is carried out to
determine its proper x-y 2D location and layer of feature representation, or
eventually terminated as being background. Empirically our approach is
demonstrated to produce overall lower detection errors on widely-used
benchmarks, and it works particularly well with far-scale pedestrians. For
example, compared with 60.51% log-average miss rate of the state-of-the-art
MS-CNN for far-scale pedestrians (those below 80 pixels in bounding-box height)
of the Caltech benchmark, the miss rate of our approach is 41.85%, with a
notable reduction of 18.68%.

convective overturn with high convective Mach numbers. Although the highest
convective Mach numbers of up to 0.3 are reached in the oxygen shells of
low-mass progenitors, convection is typically dominated by small-scale modes in
these shells, which implies a more modest role of initial perturbations in the
explosion mechanism. Convective silicon burning rarely provides the high Mach
numbers and large-scale perturbations required for perturbation-aided
explosions. We also find that about $40\%$ of progenitors between 16 and 26
solar masses exhibit simultaneous oxygen and neon burning in the same

is proposed for cognitive radio networks. We formulate the problem of finding a
spectrum sensing policy for multi-band dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic
restless multi-armed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward
distributions. In cognitive radio networks the multi-armed bandit problem
arises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies
that could be efficiently exploited for data transmission. We consider two
models for the dynamics of the frequency bands: 1) the independent model where
the state of the band evolves randomly independently from the past and 2) the
Gilbert-Elliot model, where the states evolve according to a 2-state Markov
chain. It is shown that in these conditions the proposed sensing policy attains
asymptotically logarithmic weak regret. The policy proposed in this paper is an
index policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample
mean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes
spectrum exploitation whereas the exploration bonus encourages for further
exploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency
based approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it
will grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a
suboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing
weak regret. Simulation results confirming logarithmic weak regret are
presented and it is found that the proposed policy provides often improved
performance at low complexity over other state-of-the-art policies in the
literature.

rejecting background. We describe the design of a detector that could also have

hysteretic behavior akin to a first-order transition. Both the temperature at
which the transition occurs and the associated resistivity change are extremely
sensitive to doping and therefore to off-stoichiometry issues that may arise
during thin film growth. Here we report that strong deviations in the transport
properties of NdNiO$_3$ films can arise in films grown consecutively under
nominally identical conditions by pulsed laser deposition; some samples show a
well-developed transition with a resistivity change of up to five orders of
magnitude while others are metallic down to low temperatures. Through a
detailed analysis of \textit{in-situ} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, we
relate this behavior to large levels of cationic off-stoichoimetry that also
translate in changes in the Ni valence and bandwidth. Finally, we demonstrate
that this lack of reproducibility can be remarkably alleviated by using
single-phase NdNiO$_3$ targets.

gas of inelastic and rough hard spheres in the homogeneous cooling state is
studied. Specifically, the breakdown of energy equipartition as characterized
by the tracer/host ratios of translational and rotational temperatures is
analyzed by exploring a wide spectrum of values of the control parameters of
the system (masses, moments of inertia, sizes, and coefficients of
restitution). Three complementary approaches are considered. On the theoretical
side, the Boltzmann and Boltzmann--Lorentz equations (both assuming the
molecular chaos ansatz) are solved by means of a multitemperature Maxwellian
approximation for the velocity distribution functions. This allows us to obtain
explicit analytical expressions for the temperature ratios. On the
computational side, two different techniques are used. First, the kinetic
equations are numerically solved by the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method. Second, molecular dynamics simulations for dilute gases are performed.
Comparison between theory and simulations shows a general good agreement. This
means that (i) the impact of the molecular chaos ansatz on the temperature
ratios is not significant (except at high inelasticities and/or big impurities)
and (ii) the simple Maxwellian approximation yields quite reliable predictions.

continuum emission maps and scattered light images. These features are often
associated with possible young planets in these disks. Many non-planetary
explanations have also been suggested, including snow lines, dead zones and
secular gravitational instabilities in the dust. In this paper we suggest
another potential origin. The presence of copious amounts of dust tends to
strongly reduce the conductivity of the gas, thereby inhibiting the
magneto-rotational instability, and thus reducing the turbulence in the disk.
From viscous disk theory it is known that a disk tends to increase its surface
density in regions where the viscosity (i.e. turbulence) is low. Local maxima
in the gas pressure tend to attract dust through radial drift, increasing the
dust content even more. We investigate mathematically if this could potentially
lead to a feedback loop in which a perturbation in the dust surface density
could perturb the gas surface density, leading to increased dust drift and thus
amplification of the dust perturbation and, as a consequence, the gas
perturbation. We find that this is indeed possible, even for moderately small
dust grain sizes, which drift less efficiently, but which are more likely to
affect the gas ionization degree. We speculate that this instability could be
triggered by the small dust population initially, and when the local pressure
maxima are strong enough, the larger dust grains get trapped and lead to the
familiar ring-like shapes. We also discuss the many uncertainties and
limitations of this model.

I05463+2652) to study star formation mechanisms. A shell-like structure around
I05463+2652 is evident in the Herschel column density map, which is not
associated with any ionized emission. Based on the Herschel sub-millimeter
images, several parsec-scale filaments (including two elongated filaments,
""s-fl"" and ""nw-fl"" having lengths of ~6.4 pc and ~8.8 pc, respectively) are
investigated in I05463+2652 site. Herschel temperature map depicts all these
features in a temperature range of ~11-13 K. 39 clumps are identified and have
masses between ~70-945 M$_\odot$. A majority of clumps (having M_clump >= 300
M$_\odot$) are distributed toward the shell-like structure. 175 young stellar
objects (YSOs) are selected using the photometric 1-5 microns data and a
majority of these YSOs are distributed toward the four areas of high column
density >= 5 x 10^{21} cm^{-2}; A_V ~5.3 mag) in the shell-like structure,
where massive clumps and a spatial association with filament(s) are also
observed. The knowledge of observed masses per unit length of elongated
filaments and critical mass length reveals that they are supercritical. The
filament ""nw-fl"" is fragmented into five clumps (having M_clump ~100-545
M$_\odot$) and contains noticeable YSOs, while the other filament ""s-fl"" is
fragmented into two clumps (having M_clump ~170-215 M$_\odot$) without YSOs.
Together, these observational results favor the role of filaments in star
formation process in I05480+2545. This study also reveals the filament ""s-fl"",
containing two starless clumps, at an early stage of fragmentation.

considering perturbatively decaying inflaton. Important difference with the
existing analysis is the inclusion of explicit decaying dynamics of inflaton
during reheating. One of the important findings of our analysis is the possible
existence of maximum reheating temperature $T_{re}^{max}$ considering
perturbative reheating scenario. For all the models under consideration the
value of this temperature turned out to be $T_{re}^{max} \sim 10^{15}$ GeV.
Corresponding to this value of reheating temperature the duration of reheating
period assumes naturally small value, $N_{re} \simeq 0.3$ which indicates
instantaneous reheating. Most importantly, maximum reheating temperature
$T^{max}_{re}$ also leads to a maximum values of scalar spectral index
$n^{max}_s$ and inflationary e-folding number $N^{max}_{cmb}$ in association
with the observed CMB scale. Based on our general analysis, we have studied
four different inflationary models, and discuss their predictions and
constraints.

and techniques that is often suggested as solution to cope with the challenges
of engineering complex systems. Although many practitioners agree with the
arguments on the potential benefits of the techniques, companies struggle with
the adoption of MBSE. [Goal] In this paper, we investigate the forces that
prevent or impede the adoption of MBSE in companies that develop embedded
software systems. We contrast the hindering forces with issues and challenges
that drive these companies towards introducing MBSE. [Method] Our results are
based on 20 interviews with experts from 10 companies. Through exploratory
research, we analyze the results by means of thematic coding. [Results] Forces
that prevent MBSE adoption mainly relate to immature tooling, uncertainty about
the return-on-investment, and fears on migrating existing data and processes.
On the other hand, MBSE adoption also has strong drivers and participants have
high expectations mainly with respect to managing complexity, adhering to new
regulations, and reducing costs. [Conclusions] We conclude that bad experiences
and frustration about MBSE adoption originate from false or too high
expectations. Nevertheless, companies should not underestimate the necessary
efforts for convincing employees and addressing their anxiety.

more primitive forms. The speed at which this happens, however, has sometimes
defied formal explanations when based on random (uniformly distributed)
mutations. Here we investigate the application of a simplicity bias based on a
natural but algorithmic distribution of mutations (no recombination) in various
examples, particularly binary matrices in order to compare evolutionary
convergence rates. Results both on synthetic and on small biological examples
indicate an accelerated rate when mutations are not statistical uniform but
\textit{algorithmic uniform}. We show that algorithmic distributions can evolve
modularity and genetic memory by preservation of structures when they first
occur sometimes leading to an accelerated production of diversity but also
population extinctions, possibly explaining naturally occurring phenomena such
as diversity explosions (e.g. the Cambrian) and massive extinctions (e.g. the
End Triassic) whose causes are currently a cause for debate. The natural
approach introduced here appears to be a better approximation to biological
evolution than models based exclusively upon random uniform mutations, and it
also approaches a formal version of open-ended evolution based on previous
formal results. These results validate some suggestions in the direction that
computation may be an equally important driver of evolution. We also show that
inducing the method on problems of optimization, such as genetic algorithms,
has the potential to accelerate convergence of artificial evolutionary
algorithms.

promising technique to deliver videos with lower cost and higher quality. The
key idea is to cache video contents on edge networks (e.g., femtocells and WiFi
access points) in advance and deliver the cached contents to local video users
directly (without involving cellular data cost for users). In this work, we aim
to study how the edge caching will affect the CP's data sponsoring strategy as
well as the users' behaviors and the data market. Specifically, we consider a
single CP who offers both the edge caching service and the data sponsoring
service to a set of heterogeneous mobile video users (with different mobility
and video request patterns). We formulate the interactions of the CP and the
users as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the CP (leader) determines the
budgets (efforts) for both services in Stage I, and the users (followers)
decide whether and which service(s) they would like to subscribe to. We analyze
the sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically. Our
analysis and experimental results show that by introducing the edge caching,
the CP can increase his revenue by 105%.

ground-state phase diagram is triggered by several energy scales, i.e., the
electron hopping $t$, the on-site electron-electron interaction $U$, the phonon
energy $\omega_0$, and the electron-phonon coupling $g$. At half filling, the
ground state is an antiferromagnetic insulator for $U \gtrsim 2g^2/\omega_0$,
while it is a charge-density-wave (or bi-polaronic) insulator for $U \lesssim
2g^2/\omega_0$. In addition to these phases, we find a superconducting phase
that intrudes between them. For $\omega_0/t=1$, superconductivity emerges when
both $U/t$ and $2g^2/t\omega_0$ are small; then, by increasing the value of the
phonon energy $\omega_0$, it extends along the transition line between
antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave insulators. Away from half filling,
phase separation occurs when doping the charge-density-wave insulator, while a
uniform (superconducting) ground state is found when doping the superconducting
phase. In the analysis of finite-size effects, it is extremely important to
average over twisted boundary conditions, especially in the weak-coupling limit

Among the already known SNRs, Cassiopea A (Cas A) appears as one of the best
candidates for such studies, because it is relatively young (about 300 years)
and it has been largely studied in radio and X-ray bands, which constrains
essential parameters for testing emission models. Here we present the results
of a multi-year campaign of Cas A observations with the MAGIC Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes between December 2014 and October 2016, for a

from $\sim$100GeV to $\sim$10TeV and fit it assuming it follows a power-law
distribution, with and without exponential cut-off. We found, for the first

evidence for the present of a cut-off in Cas A: an exponential cut-off at about
3.5 TeV is preferred with 4.6 $\sigma$ significance over a pure power-law
scenario. Assuming that TeV gamma rays are produced by hadronic processes and
that there is no significant cosmic ray diffusion, this indicates that Cas A is

position of the star relative to its system barycentre. The $\chi^2$ statistic
for parallax estimation is calculated analytically, leading to expressions that
relate the decrease in detectability and accompanying parallax bias to the
position correlation function. The impact of the Earth's motion critically
depends on the exoplanet's orbital period, diminishing rapidly as the period
deviates from one year. Selection effects against one-year period systems is
therefore expected. Statistical estimation shows that the corresponding loss of
sensitivity results in a typical 10 per cent increase in detection threshold.
Consideration of eccentric orbits shows that the Earth's motion has no effect
on detectability for $e\ge0.5$. Dependence of detectability on other
parameters, such as orbital phases and inclination of the orbit plane to the
ecliptic, are smooth and monotonic because they are described by simple
trigonometric functions.

in fundamental research as well as in industry and medicine. This steadily
growing interest motivated the construction of several facilities aiming at the
realisation of sources of intense X- and gamma-ray pulses. To date, free
electron lasers and synchrotrons provide intense sources of photons with
energies up to 10-100 keV. Facilities under construction based on incoherent
Compton back scattering of an optical laser pulse off an electron beam are
expected to yield photon beams with energy up to 19.5 MeV and peak brilliance
in the range 10$^{20}$-10$^{23}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mrad$^{-2}$ mm$^{-2}$ per
0.1% bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism based on the strongly
amplified synchrotron emission which occurs when a sufficiently dense electron
beam interacts with a millimetre thickness solid target. For electron beam
densities exceeding approximately $3\times10^{19}\text{ cm$^{-3}$}$
filamentation instability occurs with the self-generation of 10$^{7}$-10$^{8}$
gauss magnetic fields where the electrons of the beam are trapped. This results
into a giant amplification of synchrotron emission with the production of
collimated gamma-ray pulses with peak brilliance above $10^{25}$ photons
s$^{-1}$ mrad$^{-2}$ mm$^{-2}$ per 0.1% bandwidth and photon energies ranging
from 200 keV up to several hundreds MeV. These findings pave the way to
compact, high-repetition-rate (kHz) sources of short (30 fs), collimated (mrad)
and high flux ($>10^{12}$ photons/s) gamma-ray pulses.

derived, as are their relative abundances in rho Oph A. Using radiative
transfer models, we examine the infall status of the cold dense cores from
their resolved line profiles of the ground state lines of H2O and NH3, where
for the latter no contamination from the VLA 1623 outflow is observed and line
overlap of the hyperfine components is explicitly taken into account. The
stratified structure of this photon dominated region (PDR), seen edge-on, is
clearly displayed. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and OI are seen
throughout the region around the exciting star S1. At the interface to the
molecular core 0.05 pc away, atomic hydrogen is rapidly converted into H2,
whereas OI protrudes further into the molecular core. This provides oxygen
atoms for the gas-phase formation of O2 in the core SM1, where X(O2)~ 5.e-8.
There, the ratio of the O2 to H2O abundance [X(H2O)~ 5.e-9] is significantly
higher than unity. Away from the core, O2 experiences a dramatic decrease due
to increasing H2O formation. Outside the molecular core, on the far side as
seen from S1, the intense radiation from the 0.5 pc distant early B-type star
HD147889 destroys the molecules. Towards the dark core SM1, the observed
abundance ratio X(O2)/X(H2O)>1, which suggests that this object is extremely
young, which would explain why O2 is such an elusive molecule outside the solar

a vision-based bionic recommender system model, which understands users from

DNN subnetworks simulate cerebral cortex to understand users' interest based on
the activations generated from browsed items. In practice, the Telepath model
has been launched to JD's recommender system and advertising system. For one of

larger than the perimeter of the nanowire, the conductance and the Fano factor
are sensitive to disorder only when the Fermi energy is close to an opening of
a transverse mode. In the limit of a large number of transverse modes,
transport properties are insensitive to the geometry of the nanowire or the
nature and strength of the disorder but, instead, are dominated by the
properties of the interface between the ohmic contact and the nanowire. In the
case of a heavily doped Dirac metallic contact, the conductance is proportional
to the energy with an average transmission $\mathcal{T}=\pi/4$ and a Fano
factor of $F\simeq 0.13$. Those results can be generalized to a much broader
class of contacts, the exact values of $\mathcal{T}$ and $F$ depending on the

one-dimensional configuration-coordinate model. The former results indicate
that the $4f-5d$ crossover cannot be the dominant mechanism for the thermal
quenching behavior of Eu$^{2+}$-doped phosphors and the latter results are

Intrigued by the recent result by Dai et al.\ that combines real algebraic
geometry and SDP optimization in synthesis of polynomial interpolants, the
current paper contributes its enhancement that yields sharper and simpler
interpolants. The enhancement is made possible by: theoretical observations in
real algebraic geometry; and our continued fraction-based algorithm that rounds
off (potentially erroneous) numerical solutions of SDP solvers. Experiment
results support our tool's effectiveness; we also demonstrate the benefit of
sharp and simple interpolants in program verification examples.

importance to natural photosynthesis gained popularity when, a decade ago,
slowly dephasing quantum beats were observed in the two-dimensional electronic
spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex at 77 K. These were assigned to
quantum superpositions of excitonic states; a controversial interpretation, as
the spectral linewidths suggested fast dephasing arising from strong
interactions with the environment. While it has been pointed out that
vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, concrete assignment of
these coherences to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we
revisit the coherence dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex using
polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by
theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived quantum beats originate
exclusively from vibrational coherences, whereas electronic coherences dephase
entirely within 240 fs even at 77 K - a timescale too short to play a
significant role in light harvesting. Additionally, we demonstrate that
specific vibrational coherences are excited via vibronically coupled states.
The detection of vibronic coupling indicates the relevance of this phenomenon
for photosynthetic energy transfer.

Reflecting the reduced symmetry at the surface, the bulk bands are strongly
modified. This leads to the creation of two-dimensional floating bands, which
are distinct from Shockley states, quantum well states or topologically
protected surface states. We focus on the layered semimetal ZrSiS to clarify
the origin of its surface states. We demonstrate an excellent agreement between
DFT calculations and ARPES measurements and present an effective four-band
model in which similar surface bands appear. Finally, we emphasize the role of
the surface chemical potential by comparing the surface density of states in
samples with and without potassium coating. Our findings can be extended to
related compounds and generalized to other crystals with nonsymmorphic

couples the large-momentum antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the so-called
""hot-spots"" at the Fermi surface and also of an effective higher-order
composite operator in the theory. The latter operator provides a scattering
mechanism such that the momentum transfer for the fermions close to the Fermi
surface can be small. We also include weak disorder that couples to both the
bosonic order-parameter field and the fermionic degrees of freedom. Since the
quasiparticle excitations were shown in recent works to be destroyed at the
""hot-spots"" in the low-energy limit of the model, we employ the Mori-Zwanzig
memory-matrix approach that permits the evaluation of all transport
coefficients without assuming well-defined Landau quasiparticles in the system.
We then apply this transport theory to discuss universal metallic-state
properties as a function of temperature and magnetic field of the cuprates from
the perspective of their fermiology, which turn out to be in qualitative
agreement with key experiments in those materials.

has been one of the most popular approximations in ruin theory and its
application to insurance. Surprisingly, only heuristic and numerical evidence
has supported it, to some extent. Finding a mathematical estimate for its
accuracy has remained an open problem, going from the original paper by De
Vylder (1978) through an attempt of justification by Grandell (2000). The
present paper consists of a mathematical and critical treatment of the problem.
We more generally consider De Vylder type approximations of any order k, based
on fitting the k first moments of the classical risk reserve process. Moreover,
we not only deal with the ruin probability, but also with the moments of the
time of ruin, of the deficit at ruin and of the surplus before ruin. We
estimate the approximation errors in terms of the safety loading coefficient,
the initial reserve and the approximation order. We show their different
behaviours, and the extent to which each relative error remains small or blows
up, so that one has to be careful when using this approximation. Our estimates
are confirmed by numerical examples. Besides, it turns out that De Vylder type
approximations become paradoxically inaccurate when applied to the moments of
the deficit at ruin and of the surplus before ruin.

interacting quantum theory, associated with violation of Weyl (conformal)
symmetry by quantum effects, can be amended if one endows the theory with a
dilatation current coupled to a vector field that is the gauge connection of
local Weyl symmetry transformations. The natural candidate for this Weyl
connection is the trace of the geometric torsion tensor, especially if one
recalls that pure (Cartan-Einstein) gravity with torsion is conformal. We first
point out that both canonical and path integral quantisation respect Weyl
symmetry. The only way quantum effects can violate conformal symmetry is by the
process of regularization. However, if one calculates an effective action from
a conformally invariant classical theory by using a regularisation procedure
that is conform with Weyl symmetry, then the conformal Ward identities will be
satisfied. In this sense Weyl symmetry is not broken by quantum effects. This
work suggests that Weyl symmetry can be treated on equal footing with gauge
symmetries and gravity, for which an infinite set of Ward identities guarantees
that they remain unbroken by quantum effects.

Hubble and Spitzer data, the retrieval outcomes are found to be
prior-dominated. When the prior distributions of the molecular abundances are
assumed to be log-uniform, the volume mixing ratio of HCN is found to be
implausibly high. A VULCAN chemical kinetics model of WASP-12b suggests that
chemical equilibrium is a reasonable assumption even when atmospheric mixing is
implausibly rigorous. Guided by (exo)planet formation theory, we set Gaussian
priors on the elemental abundances of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen with the
Gaussian peaks being centered on the measured C/H, O/H and N/H values of the
star. By enforcing chemical equilibrium, we find substellar O/H and stellar to
slightly superstellar C/H for the dayside atmosphere of WASP-12b. The
superstellar carbon-to-oxygen ratio is just above unity, regardless of whether
clouds are included in the retrieval analysis, consistent with Madhusudhan et
al. (2011). Furthermore, whether a temperature inversion exists in the
atmosphere depends on one's assumption for the Gaussian width of the priors.
Our retrieved posterior distributions are consistent with the formation of
WASP-12b in a solar-composition protoplanetary disk, beyond the water iceline,
via gravitational instability or pebble accretion (without core erosion) and
migration inwards to its present orbital location via a disk-free mechanism,
and are inconsistent with both in-situ formation and core accretion with disk
migration, as predicted by Madhusudhan et al. (2017). We predict that the
interpretation of James Webb Space Telescope WASP-12b data will not be
prior-dominated.

Planck energy or lower is predicted by many quantum gravity theories, implying
non-trivial dispersion relations for the photon in vacuum. Consequently,
gamma-rays of different energies, emitted simultaneously from astrophysical
sources, could accumulate measurable differences in their time of flight until
they reach the Earth. Such tests have been carried out in the past using fast
variations of gamma-ray flux from pulsars, and more recently from active
galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. We present new constraints studying the
gamma-ray emission of the galactic Crab Pulsar, recently observed up to TeV
energies by the MAGIC collaboration. A profile likelihood analysis of pulsar
events reconstructed for energies above 400GeV finds no significant variation
in arrival time as their energy increases. Ninety-five percent~CL limits are
obtained on the effective Lorentz invariance violating energy scale at the
level of $E_{\mathrm{QG}_1} > 5.5\cdot 10^{17}$GeV ($4.5\cdot 10^{17}$GeV) for
a linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG}_2} > 5.9\cdot 10^{10}$GeV ($5.3\cdot 10^{10}$GeV)
for a quadratic scenario, for the subluminal and the superluminal cases,
respectively. A substantial part of this study is dedicated to calibration of
the test statistic, with respect to bias and coverage properties. Moreover, the
limits take into account systematic uncertainties, found to worsen the
statistical limits by about 36--42\%. Our constraints would have resulted much
more competitive if the intrinsic pulse shape of the pulsar between 200GeV and
400GeV was understood in sufficient detail and allowed inclusion of events well
below 400GeV.

investigate the atypical properties of the companion, which has the reddest
near-infrared colours among all known substellar objects, either orbiting a
star or isolated, and we provide a comprehensive characterisation of the host
star-disc-companion system.
  We conducted a follow-up of the companion with adaptive optics imaging and
spectro-imaging with SPHERE, and a multiinstrument follow-up of its host star.
We obtain a R=30 spectrum from 0.95 to 1.64 micron of the companion and
additional photometry at 2.11 and 2.25 micron. We carried out extensive
atmosphere model fitting for the companions and the host star in order to
derive their age, mass, and metallicity.
  We found no additional companion in the system in spite of exquisite
observing conditions resulting in sensitivity to 6MJup (2MJup) at 0.5"" for an
age of 300 Myr (50 Myr). We detect orbital motion over more than one year and
characterise the possible Keplerian orbits. We constrain the age of the system
to a minimum of 50 Myr and a maximum of 700 Myr, and determine that the
host-star metallicity is nearly solar. The comparison of the companion spectrum
and photometry to model atmospheres indicates that the companion is an
extremely dusty late L dwarf, with an intermediate gravity (log g 4.5-5.0)
which is compatible with the independent age estimate of the system.
  Though our best fit corresponds to a brown dwarf of 15-30 MJup aged 100-300

a 50 Myr 12MJup planetary-mass object to a 50 MJup Hyades-age brown dwarf...

order to search for Lorentz invariance. The covariant form of the set of
iterative equations for the joint coordinate and momentum distribution function
$Q(x,p)$ is derived and expanded in power series of the charge of the particle.
Then, solutions of the zeroth order in the charge of the iterative equations
for $Q(x,p)$ are considered. For them, it follows that the space-time
probability density $\rho(x)$ and the function $S(x)$ which gradient defines
the mean value of the momentum at the space time point $x$, define a complex
function $\psi(x)$ which exactly satisfies the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation. It
is argued that when the KG solution is either of positive or negative energy,
the total number of particles conserves in the random motion. It follows that
the total number of particles conserves when $\psi(x)$ composed alternatively
of pure positive or negative energy modes. In addition, solutions for the joint
distribution function in lowest order, satisfying the positive condition are
also found. They suggests a possible link with the Couder's experiments on

importance. Examples of this include the classical problem of assigning
computing tasks to nodes in a distributed computing environment, as well as the
more recent problem of crowdsourcing where a broad array of tasks are slated to
be completed by human workers. Extensive research into this problem generally
addresses important issues such as uncertainty and, in crowdsourcing,
incentives. However, the problem of adversarial tampering with the task
allocation process has not received as much attention. We are concerned with a
particular adversarial setting in task allocation where an attacker may target
a specific worker in order to prevent the tasks assigned to this worker from
being completed. We consider two attack models: one in which the adversary
observes only the allocation policy (which may be randomized), and the second
in which the attacker observes the actual allocation decision. For the case
when all tasks are homogeneous, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for both
settings. When tasks are heterogeneous, however, we show the adversarial
allocation problem to be NP-Hard, and present algorithms for solving it when
the defender is restricted to assign only a single worker per task. Our
experiments show, surprisingly, that the difference between the two attack
models is minimal: deterministic allocation can achieve nearly as much utility

and drift barriers in planetesimal formation, catalyzing the aggregation of
dust on kyr timescales to grow km-sized cores. However there remains a lack of
consensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One
potential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of
relatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc
lifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in
the depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a
local pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then
become susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional
viscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,
we explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range
of parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals
is often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We
conclude that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of
debris discs, rather than a common mechanism for the formation of planetary
cores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar investigation that
considered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation of
tens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily
a consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until
observations more tightly constrain photoevaporation models, the relevance of
this process to the formation of planets remains uncertain.

field theories with replicated permutational symmetry $\mathbb{S}_q$. After
sending to zero the number of replicas they correspond to the renormalization
group fixed points of the $q$-state Potts model with quenched disorder. We find
that all solutions with non-zero disorder possess $q$-independent sectors,
pointing to superuniversality (i.e. symmetry independence) of some critical
exponents. The solution corresponding to the random bond ferromagnet, for which
disorder vanishes as $q\to 2$, allows for superuniversality of the correlation
length exponent $\nu$ [PRL 118 (2017) 250601]. Of the two solutions which are
strongly disordered for all values of $q$, one is completely $q$-independent
and accounts for the zero-temperature percolation fixed point of the randomly

Nishimori-like fixed point of the Potts model with $\pm J$ disorder, and leaves
room for superuniversality of the magnetic exponent $\eta$, a possibility not
yet excluded by available numerical data.

trigger the formation of spiral arms that can fragment into bound clumps under
the right conditions. Two dimensional simulations of self-gravitating disks are
useful starting points for studying fragmentation, allowing for high-resolution
simulations of thin disks. However, convergence issues can arise in 2D from
various sources. One of these sources is the 2D approximation of self-gravity,
which exaggerates the effect of self-gravity on small scales when the potential
is not smoothed to account for the assumed vertical extent of the disk. This
effect is enhanced by increased resolution, resulting in fragmentation at
longer cooling timescales $\beta$. If true, it suggests that the 3D simulations
of disk fragmentation may not have the same convergence problem and could be
used to examine the nature of fragmentation without smoothing self-gravity on
scales similar to the disk scale height. To that end, we have carried out local
3D self-gravitating disk simulations with simple $\beta$ cooling with fixed
background irradiation to determine if 3D is necessary to properly describe
disk fragmentation. Above a resolution of $\sim 40$ grid cells per scale
height, we find that our simulations converge with respect to the cooling
timescale. This result converges in agreement with analytic expectations which
place a fragmentation boundary at $\beta_\mathrm{crit} = 3$.

applied to the qubits, and two types of problem misspecification, determining
the optimal hybrid algorithm for each case. Our results reveal a rich structure

how the brain uses feedback to guide goal-directed behavior. The ventral
striatum (VS) appears to be a key structure in this function, responding
strongly to explicit reward feedback. However, recent results have also shown
striatal activity following correct task performance even in the absence of
feedback. This raises the possibility that, in addition to processing external
feedback, the dopamine-centered reward circuit might regulate endogenous
reinforcement signals, like those triggered by satisfaction in accurate task
performance. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test
this idea. Participants completed a simple task that garnered both reward
feedback and feedback about the precision of performance. Importantly, the
design was such that we could manipulate information about the precision of
performance within different levels of reward magnitude. Using parametric
modulation and functional connectivity analysis we identified brain regions
sensitive to each of these signals. Our results show a double dissociation:
frontal and posterior cingulate regions responded to explicit reward but were
insensitive to task precision, whereas the dorsal striatum - and putamen in
particular - was insensitive to reward but responded strongly to precision
feedback in reward-present trials. Both types of feedback activated the VS, and
sensitivity in this structure to precision feedback was predicted by
personality traits related to approach behavior and reward responsiveness. Our
findings shed new light on the role of specific brain regions in integrating
different sources of feedback to guide goal-directed behavior.

of data in terms of a small number of common relevant factors. This problem,
which is of fundamental importance in many disciplines, is usually reformulated
in mathematical terms as follows. We are given the covariance matrix Sigma of
the available data. Sigma must be additively decomposed as the sum of two
positive semidefinite matrices D and L: D | that accounts for the idiosyncratic
noise affecting the knowledge of each component of the available vector of data
| must be diagonal and L must have the smallest possible rank in order to
describe the available data in terms of the smallest possible number of
independent factors.
  In practice, however, the matrix Sigma is never known and therefore it must
be estimated from the data so that only an approximation of Sigma is actually
available. This paper discusses the issues that arise from this uncertainty and
provides a strategy to deal with the problem of robustly estimating the number
of factors.

components of short- and mediumreach interconnects in data-center networks.
Besides small footprint and cost-efficient large-scale production, small drive
voltages and ultra-low power consumption are of paramount importance for such
devices. Here we demonstrate that the concept of silicon-organic hybrid (SOH)
integration is perfectly suited for meeting these challenges. The approach
combines the unique processing advantages of large-scale silicon photonics with
unrivalled electro-optic (EO) coefficients obtained by molecular engineering of
organic materials. In our proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate
generation and transmission of OOK signals with line rates of up to 100 Gbit/s
using a 1.1 mm-long SOH Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) which features a
{\pi}-voltage of only 0.9 V. This experiment represents not only the first
demonstration of 100 Gbit/s OOK on the silicon photonic platform, but also
leads to the lowest drive voltage and energy consumption ever demonstrated at
this data rate for a semiconductor-based device. We support our experimental
results by a theoretical analysis and show that the nonlinear transfer
characteristic of the MZM can be exploited to overcome bandwidth limitations of
the modulator and of the electric driver circuitry. The devices are fabricated
in a commercial silicon photonics line and can hence be combined with the full
portfolio of standard silicon photonic devices. We expect that high-speed
power-efficient SOH modulators may have transformative impact on short-reach
optical networks, enabling compact transceivers with unprecedented energy
efficiency that will be at the heart of future Ethernet interfaces at Tbit/s
data rates.

consisting of two populations of agents (dealers and speculators) expressing
the same preferences for two goods, but applying different strategies in their
exchanges. We describe the trading of the goods by means of some fundamental
rules in price theory, in particular by using Cobb-Douglas utility functions
for the exchange. The strategy of the speculators is to recover maximal utility
from the trade by suitably acting on the percentage of goods which are
exchanged. This microscopic description leads to a system of linear
Boltzmann-type equations for the probability distributions of the goods on the
two populations, in which the post-interaction variables depend from the
pre-interaction ones in terms of the mean quantities of the goods present in
the market. In this case, it is shown analytically that the strategy of the
speculators can drive the price of the two goods towards a zone in which there
is a marked utility for their group. Also, the general system of nonlinear
kinetic equations of Boltzmann type for the probability distributions of the
goods on the two populations is described in details. Numerical experiments
then show how the policy of speculators can modify the final price of goods in
this nonlinear setting.

is significantly different from the linear scaling described by Homes' law,
which is well known as a mean-field result. More recently, Bozovic et al. have
observed such a parabolic scaling in the overdoped copper oxides with a
sufficiently low transition temperature T_c [Nature 536 (2016) 309-311]. They
further point out that this experimental finding is incompatible with the
standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) description. Here we report that if
T_c is sufficiently low, applying the renormalization group approach into the
BCS action at zero temperature will naturally lead to the parabolic scaling.
Our result indicates that when T_c sufficiently approaches zero, quantum
fluctuations will be overwhelmingly amplified so that the mean-field
