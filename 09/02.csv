particular composition elements using dominants, subdominants, higher

harmonic development in a composition based on these elements. 2:3:4-harmony

reduction of $\alpha_{\phi\phi}$ in advance of the reduced surface activity,
and enhanced downward turbulent pumping during the event to confine some of the
magnetic field at the bottom of the convection zone, where local maximum of

samples of all embedded stages of high-mass star formation. Here we present the
first detailed census of the properties (velocities, distances, luminosities
and masses) and spatial distribution of a complete sample of ~8000 dense clumps
located in the Galactic disk. We derive highly reliable velocities and
distances to ~97% of the sample and use mid- and far-infrared survey data to
develop an evolutionary classification scheme that we apply to the whole
sample. Comparing the evolutionary subsamples reveals trends for increasing
dust temperatures, luminosities and line-widths as a function of evolution
indicating that the feedback from the embedded proto-clusters is having a
significant impact on the structure and dynamics of their natal clumps. We find
88\,per\,cent are already associated with star formation at some level. We also
find the clump mass to be independent of evolution suggesting that the clumps
form with the majority of their mass in-situ. We estimate the statistical
lifetime of the quiescent stage to be ~5 x 10^4 yr for clump masses ~1000 Msun
decreasing to ~1 x 10^4 yr for clump masses >10000 Msun. We find a strong
correlation between the fraction of clumps associated with massive stars and
peak column density. The fraction is initially small at low column densities
but reaching 100\,per\,cent for column densities above 10^{23} cm^{-2}; there
are no clumps with column density clumps above this value that are not already
associated with massive star formation. All of the evidence is consistent with
a dynamic view of star formation wherein the clumps form rapidly and are
initially very unstable so that star formation quickly ensues.

counter-rotating circularly polarized pulses at different frequencies - results
in a series of short-wavelength XUV harmonics with alternating circular
polarizations, and experiments show that there is an asymmetry in the emission
between the two helicities: a slight one in helium, and a larger one in neon
and argon, where the emission is carried out by p-shell electrons. Here we
analyze this asymmetry by switching to a rotating frame in which the field is
linearly polarized; this induces an effective magnetic field which lowers the
ionization potential of the $p_+$ orbital that co-rotates with the
lower-frequency driver, enhancing its harmonic emission and the overall
helicity of the generated harmonics, while also introducing nontrivial effects
from the transformation to a non-inertial frame in complex time. In addition,

with and without the electroweak gauge fields coupled to the Higgs. We assume a
minimal scenario in which inflation and reheating are caused by chaotic
inflation with a quadratic potential, and no additional new physics is relevant
below the Planck scale. By using classical real-time lattice simulations with a
renormalisation group improved effective Higgs potential and by demanding the
stability of the Higgs vacuum after inflation, we obtain upper bounds for
$\xi$, taking into account the experimental uncertainty of the top-Yukawa
coupling. We compare the bounds in the absence and presence of the electroweak
gauge bosons, and conclude that the addition of gauge interactions has a rather
minimal impact. In the unstable cases, we parametrize the time when such
instability develops. For a top-quark mass $m_t \approx173.3 {\rm GeV}$, the
Higgs vacuum instability is triggered for $\xi \gtrsim 4 -5$, although a
slightly lower mass of $m_t \approx 172.1 {\rm GeV}$ pushes up this limit to
$\xi \gtrsim 11 - 12$. This, together with the estimation $\xi \gtrsim 0.06$

useful for planning and policy-making, especially in India where the economy is
heavily reliant on monsoon rainfall. However, such simulations should be able
to preserve the known spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall over
India. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are unable to do so, and various
rainfall generators designed by hydrologists using stochastic processes like
Gaussian Processes are also difficult to apply over the vast and highly diverse
landscape of India. In this paper, we explore a series of Bayesian models based
on conditional distributions of latent variables that describe weather
conditions at specific locations and over the whole country. During parameter
estimation from observed data, we use spatio-temporal smoothing using Markov
Random Field so that the parameters learnt are spatially and temporally
coherent. Also, we use a nonparametric spatial clustering based on Chinese
Restaurant Process to identify homogeneous regions, which are utilized by some
of the proposed models to improve spatial correlations of the simulated
rainfall. The models are able to simulate daily rainfall across India for
years, and can also utilize contextual information for conditional simulation.
We use two datasets of different spatial resolutions over India, and focus on
the period 2000-2015. We propose a large number of metrics to study the
spatio-temporal properties of the simulations by the models, and compare them
with the observed data to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the models.

of at least one of two nuisance regression parameters. In moderate to large
dimensions, the use of flexible data-adaptive regression estimators may aid in
achieving this consistency. However, $n^{1/2}$-consistency of doubly robust
estimators is not guaranteed if one of the nuisance estimators is inconsistent.
In this paper we present a doubly robust estimator for survival analysis with
the novel property that it converges to a Gaussian variable at $n^{1/2}$-rate
for a large class of data-adaptive estimators of the nuisance parameters, under
the only assumption that at least one of them is consistently estimated at a
$n^{1/4}$-rate. This result is achieved through adaptation of recent ideas in
semiparametric inference, which amount to: (i) Gaussianizing (i.e., making
asymptotically linear) a drift term that arises in the asymptotic analysis of
the doubly robust estimator, and (ii) using cross-fitting to avoid entropy
conditions on the nuisance estimators. We present the formula of the asymptotic
variance of the estimator, which allows computation of doubly robust confidence
intervals and p-values. We illustrate the finite-sample properties of the
estimator in simulation studies, and demonstrate its use in a phase III
clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment

Our main results are as follows: (a) The innermost regions of galaxies assemble
their mass at an earlier time than regions located in the outer parts; this
happens at any given M$_{\star}$, $\Sigma_{\star}$, or Hubble type, including
the lowest mass systems. (b) Galaxies present a significant diversity in their

strong dependence of the mass assembly time scales on $\Sigma_{\star}$ and
Hubble type in the lower-mass range (10$^{8.4}$ to 10$^{10.4}$), but a very
mild dependence in higher-mass bins. (c) All galaxies show negative
$\langle$log age$\rangle_{M}$ gradients in the inner 1 HLR. The profile
flattens with increasing values of $\Sigma_{\star}$. There is no significant
dependence on M$_{\star}$ within a particular $\Sigma_{\star}$ bin, except for

AU) and 1.6"" (200 AU) and investigate the diagnostic potential of such data
with model simulations. The polarized flux contrast ratio for the disk is
$F_{pol}/F_\ast= (5.5 \pm 0.9) 10^{-4}$. The surface brightness reaches a
maximum of 16.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at a separation of $0.2""-0.5""$ along the disk
spine with a maximum surface brightness contrast of 7.64 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The
polarized flux has a minimum near the star $<0.2""$ because no or only little
polarization is produced by forward or backward scattering in the disk section
lying in front of or behind the star. The data are modeled as a circular dust
belt with an inclination $i=85(\pm 1.5)^\circ$ and a radius between $r_0$ = 60
AU and 90 AU. The radial density dependence is described by $(r/r_0)^{\alpha}$
with a steep power law index $\alpha=5$ inside $r_0$ and a more shallow index
$\alpha=-2.5$ outside $r_0$. The scattering asymmetry factor lies between $g$ =
0.2 and 0.6 adopting a scattering angle-dependence for the fractional
polarization as for Rayleigh scattering. Our data are qualitatively very
similar to the case of AU Mic and they confirm that edge-on debris disks have a
polarization minimum at a position near the star and a maximum near the
projected separation of the main debris belt. The comparison of the polarized
flux contrast ratio $F_{pol}/F_{\ast}$ with the fractional infrared excess
provides strong constraints on the scattering albedo of the dust.

explore variations in star formation history to explain the colour gradients.
As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular

necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We
explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out

gradients in NUV-u and u-i colours. We further distinguish them using an
additional constraint provided by the u-i colour gradient distribution, under
the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by
most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which
the inner region has a shorter e-folding time scale in the growth phase than

accretion-related mechanical heating and energetic stellar irradiation (FUV and
X-rays) on the thermal-chemical properties of disk atmospheres at planet
formation distances. We find that stellar FUV irradiation (Lyman alpha and
continuum), through its role in heating and photodissociation, affects much of
the upper warm (400-2000 K) molecular layer of the atmosphere, and the
properties of the layer are generally in good agreement with the observed
molecular emission features of disks at UV, near-infrared, and mid-infrared
wavelengths. At the same time, the effect of FUV irradiation is restricted to
the upper molecular layer of the disk, even when irradiation by Ly alpha is
included. The region immediately below the FUV-heated layer is potentially
dominated by accretion-related mechanical heating. As cooler (90-400 K) CO,
water, and other molecules are potential diagnostics of the mechanically-heated
layer, emission line studies of these diagnostics might be used to search for

we study the dynamics of the Loschmidt echo in the three dimensional O(N) model

separating two phases with a finite and vanishing order parameter, that is

not well understood in most of the suggested progenitor models. Nevertheless,
direct head-on collisions of two WDs were shown to give rise to detonations and
produce Ia-SNe - like explosions, and were suggested as possible progenitors.
The rates of such collisions in dense globular clusters are far below the

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/sty2045",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) are
strongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical
mechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central
stellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)
binaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity
anisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,
and other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations
to theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show
that SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst
preference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive
fine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the
observed DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the
initial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\rho(r)$, is
exceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the
post-starburst preference requires $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma
\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium
profile of $\gamma = 7/4$. For ""ultrasteep"" density cusps ($\gamma \ge 9/4$),
we show that the TDE rate decays with time measured since the starburst as
$\dot{N} \propto t^{-(4\gamma-9)/(2\gamma-3)} / \ln t$. Radial anisotropies
also represent a promising explanation, provided that initial anisotropy
parameters of $\beta_0 \approx 0.5$ are sustainable against the radial orbit
instability. TDE rates in initially anisotropic cusps will decay roughly as
$\dot{N} \propto t^{-\beta_0}$. As the sample of TDEs with well-studied host
galaxies grows, the DTD will become a powerful tool for constraining the
exceptional dynamical properties of post-starburst galactic nuclei.

measure a molecular-gas-depletion timescale of 0.43 Gyr, near the peak of the

therefore in contradiction with the proposed molecular gas deficiency in GRB
host galaxies. We argue that the reported molecular gas deficiency for GRB
hosts could be the artifact of improper comparisons or neglecting the effect of
the typical low metallicities of GRB hosts on the CO-to-molecular-gas
conversion factor. We also compare the kinematics of the CO(3-2) emission line
to that of the H$\alpha$ emission line from the host galaxy. We find the
H$\alpha$ emission to have contributions from two separate components, a narrow

separated by $+390$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$ in velocity space from the narrow

steps of planet formation in cold and low-mass disk conditions. The
radial-drift velocities of dust particles in BD disks are higher than in disks
around more massive stars. Therefore, BD disks are expected to be more depleted
in millimeter-sized grains compared to disks around T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be
stars. However, recent millimeter observations of BD disks revealed low
millimeter spectral indices, indicating the presence of large grains in these
disks and challenging models of dust evolution. We present 3\,mm photometric
observations carried out with the IRAM/Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) of
three BD disks in the Taurus star forming region, which have been observed with
ALMA at 0.89\,mm. The disks were not resolved and only one was detected with
enough confidence ($\sim3.5\sigma$) with PdBI. Based on these observations, we
obtain the values and lower limits of the spectral index and find low values
($\alpha_{\rm{mm}}\lesssim 3.0$). We compare these observations in the context
of particle trapping by an embedded planet, a promising mechanism to explain
the observational signatures in more massive and warmer disks. We find,
however, that this model cannot reproduce the current millimeter observations
for BD disks, and multiple-strong pressure bumps globally distributed in the
disk remain as a favorable scenario to explain observations. Alternative
possibilities are that the gas masses in BD disk are very low

low probability $( < 5 \%)$ star-forming solutions. We verify the effects of
including nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at
different redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically depends on the
models used in the SED fitting. Without including emission lines and with
photometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS estimate, we single out 30
candidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission reduces the sample to 10
objects; allowing for solutions at different redshifts, only 2 galaxies survive
as robust candidates. Most of the candidates are not far-infrared emitters,
corroborating their association with passive galaxies. Our results translate
into an upper limit in the number density of $\sim 0.173$ arcmin$^2$ above the

Differential Item Functioning. The combination of these methods highlights six

metallicity gradients and sSFR consistent with observations, on average. Strong
gas inflows produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong
local instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution
of the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR. Our
simulations show that, during these events, a correlation between the
metallicity gradients and the sSFR can be set up if strong gas inflows are
triggered in the central regions in short timescales. Simulated galaxies
without experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the
metallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the
correlation. The dispersion in the observed relation could be interpreted as
produced by the combination of galaxies with different gas-richness and/or

expanding them to model further passwords is a laborious task that requires
specialized expertise. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce
PassGAN, a novel approach that replaces human-generated password rules with
theory-grounded machine learning algorithms. Instead of relying on manual
password analysis, PassGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to
autonomously learn the distribution of real passwords from actual password
leaks, and to generate high-quality password guesses. Our experiments show that
this approach is very promising. When we evaluated PassGAN on two large
password datasets, we were able to surpass rule-based and state-of-the-art
machine learning password guessing tools. However, in contrast with the other
tools, PassGAN achieved this result without any a-priori knowledge on passwords
or common password structures. Additionally, when we combined the output of
PassGAN with the output of HashCat, we were able to match 51%-73% more
passwords than with HashCat alone. This is remarkable, because it shows that
PassGAN can autonomously extract a considerable number of password properties

interval and is needed for reliable detection. In this paper, we develop
several symbol synchronization schemes for molecular communication (MC) systems
where we consider some practical challenges which have not been addressed in
the literature yet. In particular, we take into account that in MC systems, the
transmitter may not be equipped with an internal clock and may not be able to
emit molecules with a fixed release frequency. Such restrictions hold for
practical nanotransmitters, e.g. modified cells, where the lengths of the
symbol intervals may vary due to the inherent randomness in the availability of
food and energy for molecule generation, the process for molecule production,
and the release process. To address this issue, we develop two
synchronization-detection frameworks which both employ two types of molecule.
In the first framework, one type of molecule is used for symbol synchronization
and the other one is used for data detection, whereas in the second framework,
both types of molecule are used for joint symbol synchronization and data
detection. For both frameworks, we first derive the optimal maximum likelihood
(ML) symbol synchronization schemes as performance upper bounds. Since ML
synchronization entails high complexity, for each framework, we also propose
three low-complexity suboptimal schemes, namely a linear filter-based scheme, a
peak observation-based scheme, and a threshold-trigger scheme which are
suitable for MC systems with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore,
we study the relative complexity and the constraints associated with the
proposed schemes and the impact of the insertion and deletion errors that arise
due to imperfect synchronization.

past studies of the thick discs of edge-on galaxies in the Spitzer Survey of
Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) we modelled the point spread function as
a Gaussian. We re-examine our results using a revised point spread function
model that accounts for extended wings out to more than 2.5arcmin. We study the
$3.6\mu{\rm m}$ images of 141 edge-on galaxies from the S$^4$G. We decompose
the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies perpendicular to their
mid-planes assuming that discs are made of two stellar discs in hydrostatic
equilibrium. We decompose the axial surface brightness profiles of galaxies to
model the central mass concentration - described by a S\'ersic function - and
the disc - described by a broken exponential disc. Our improved treatment
confirms the ubiquity of thick discs. The main difference between our current
fits and those presented before is that now the scattered light from the thin
disc dominates the surface brightness at levels below $\mu\sim26\,{\rm
mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$. This does not affect drastically any of our previously
presented results: 1) Thick discs are nearly ubiquitous. They are not an
artefact caused by scattered light as has been suggested elsewhere. 2) Thick
discs have masses comparable to those of thin discs in low-mass galaxies -
circular velocities $v_{\rm c}<120\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ - whereas they are
typically less massive than the thin discs in high-mass galaxies. 3) Thick
discs and central mass concentrations seem to have formed at the same epoch
from a common material reservoir. 4) Roughly 60% of the up-bending breaks in
face-on galaxies are caused by the superposition of a thin and a thick disc
where the scale-length of the latter is the largest. (Abridged)

The step sizes used in stochastic approximation are generally taken to be

of urn models with random replacement matrices motivates us to consider
stochastic approximation in a setup where both the step sizes and the drift are
random, but the sequence is uniformly bounded. The problem becomes interesting
when the negligibility conditions on the errors hold only in probability. We
first prove a result on stochastic approximation in this setup, which is new in
the literature. Then, as an application, we study urn models with random
replacement matrices.
  In the urn model, the replacement matrices need neither be independent, nor
identically distributed. We assume that the replacement matrices are only
independent of the color drawn in the same round conditioned on the entire
past. We relax the usual second moment assumption on the replacement matrices
in the literature and require only first moment to be finite. We require the
conditional expectation of the replacement matrix given the past to be close to
an irreducible matrix, in an appropriate sense. We do not require any of the
matrices to be balanced or nonrandom. We prove convergence of the proportion
vector, the composition vector and the count vector in $L^1$, and hence in

efficient on-lattice simulation of spatially resolved stochastic chemical

Dynamics (BD) or Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD) the RDME can be
orders of magnitude faster if the lattice spacing can be chosen coarse enough.
However, strongly diffusion-controlled reactions mandate a very fine mesh
resolution for acceptable accuracy. It is common that reactions in the same
model differ in their degree of diffusion control and therefore require
different degrees of mesh resolution. This renders mesoscopic simulation
inefficient for systems with multiscale properties. Mesoscopic-microscopic
hybrid methods address this problem by resolving the most challenging reactions
with a microscale, off-lattice simulation. However, all methods to date require
manual partitioning of a system, effectively limiting their usefulness as

scales from a frog sitting on a lily pad to a volcano supported by the Earth's
tectonic plates. The load is supported by a combination of the stresses within
the sheet (which may include applied tensions from, for example, surface
tension) and the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid. At the same time, the
sheet deforms, and may wrinkle, because of the load. We study this problem in
terms of the (relatively weak) applied tension and the indentation depth. For
small indentation depths, we find that the force--indentation curve is linear
with a stiffness that we characterize in terms of the applied tension and
bending stiffness of the sheet. At larger indentations the force--indentation
curve becomes nonlinear and the sheet is subject to a wrinkling instability. We
study this wrinkling instability close to the buckling threshold and calculate
both the number of wrinkles at onset and the indentation depth at onset,
comparing our theoretical results with experiments. Finally, we contrast our

that mass was so low that it created several astrophysical puzzles. Using new
astrometric measurements, the binary-star group at the U.S. Naval Observatory
has revised the dynamical mass upward, to $0.573\pm0.018\,M_\odot$. In this
paper we use model-atmosphere analysis to update other parameters of the WD,
including effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, and luminosity. We
then compare these results with WD interior models. Within the observational
uncertainties, theoretical cooling tracks for CO-core WDs of its measured mass
are consistent with the position of 40 Eri B in the H-R diagram; equivalently,
the theoretical mass-radius relation (MRR) is consistent with the star's
location in the mass-radius plane. This consistency is, however, achieved only
if we assume a ""thin"" outer hydrogen layer, with $q_{\rm H}=M_{\rm H}/M_{\rm
WD}\simeq10^{-10}$. We discuss other evidence that a significant fraction of DA
WDs have such thin H layers, in spite of expectation from canonical
stellar-evolution theory of ""thick"" H layers with $q_{\rm H}\simeq10^{-4}$. The
cooling age of 40 Eri B is $\sim$122 Myr, and its total age is $\sim$1.8 Gyr.
We present the MRRs for 40 Eri B and three other nearby WDs in visual binaries

limited aggregation (MDLA) model: the initial number of particles at each
positive integer site has Poisson distribution with mean $\mu$, independently
of all other sites. Particles perform independent continuous-time simple
symmetric random walks until they come to the site neighbouring the sticky
aggregate, which initially consists only of the origin. If a particle tries to
jump on the aggregate, the size of the aggregate increases by one, i.e., its
rightmost point moves to the right by one unit. All particles which are present
at the site neighbouring the aggregate at the moment when the aggregate
advances, are immediately deleted. The $d-$dimensional MDLA model, $d \geq 1$,
was introduced in 1980 by Rosenstock and Marquardt, and studied numerically by
Voss (1984). The one dimensional model exhibits a phase transition for the rate
of growth of the aggregate: it was proven by Kesten and Sidoravicius (2008)
that if $\mu<1$ then the size $R(t)$ of the aggregate grows like $\sqrt{t}$ and
Sly (2016+) proved that if $\mu>1$ then $R(t)$ grows linearly. In this note we
give heuristic predictions about the constant $c(\mu)$ for which $R(t)\approx
c(\mu)\sqrt{t}$ in the subcritical case $\mu<1$, $R(t)\approx
c(1+\varepsilon)t$ in the barely supercritical case $\mu=1+\varepsilon$ and
$R(t) \approx c(1) t^{2/3}$ in the critical case $\mu=1$. We compare our

random exploration as made possible by multi-RRT based logic and immediate
exploitation of opportunities to connect two states as made possible by sRMPD.

these distinct structures. This suggests the existence of collective disk
oscillations that can plausibly be traced all the way to asymmetries seen in
the stellar velocity distribution around the Sun. There are multiple
interesting implications of these findings: they promise new perspectives on
the process of disk heating, they provide direct evidence for a stellar halo
formation mechanism in addition to the accretion and disruption of satellite
galaxies, and, they motivate searches of current and near-future surveys to
trace these oscillations across the Galaxy. Such maps could be used as
dynamical diagnostics in the emerging field of ""Galactoseismology"", which
promises to model the history of interactions between the Milky Way and its
entourage of satellites, as well examine the density of our dark matter halo.
As sensitivity to very low surface brightness features around external galaxies
increases, many more examples of such disk oscillations will likely be
identified. Statistical samples of such features not only encode detailed
information about interaction rates and mergers, but also about long

that these spectra give results superior to those obtained by co-addition in
small phase intervals. The RRc abundances are in good agreement with those
derived for the RRab stars of Chadid et al. (2017). We used radial velocity
measurements of metal lines and H{\alpha} to construct variations of velocity
with phase, and center-of-mass velocities. We used these to construct
radial-velocity templates for use in low-medium resolution radial velocity
surveys of RRc stars. Additionally, we calculated primary accelerations, radius
variations, metal and H{\alpha} velocity amplitudes, which we display as
regressions against primary acceleration. We employ these results to compare
the atmosphere structures of metal-poor RRc stars with their RRab counterparts.
Finally, we use the radial velocity data for our Blazhko stars and the Blazhko
periods of Szczygie l & Fabrycky (2007) to falsify the Blazhko oblique rotator
hypothesis.

coherent relative entropy---which accounts for the Gibbs weight of each

We consider practical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations at
both transmitters, the sizes of which are assumed to be not necessarily
identical. We propose to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance of the
received sum-constellation with a maximum likelihood (ML) detector by adjusting
the scaling factors (i.e., instantaneous transmitted powers and phases) of both
users. The formulated problem is a mixed continuous-discrete optimization
problem, which is nontrivial to resolve in general. By carefully observing the
structure of the objective function, we discover that Farey sequence can be
applied to tackle the formulated problem. However, the existing Farey sequence
is not applicable when the constellation sizes of the two users are not the
same. Motivated by this, we define a new type of Farey sequence, termed punched
Farey sequence. Based on this, we manage to achieve a closed-form optimal
solution to the original problem by first dividing the entire feasible region
into a finite number of Farey intervals and then taking the maximum over all
the possible intervals. The resulting sum-constellation is proved to be a
regular QAM constellation of a larger size. Moreover, the superiority of NOMA
over time-division multiple access (TDMA) in terms of minimum Euclidean
distance is rigorously proved. Furthermore, the optimal rate allocation among
the two users is obtained in closed-form to further maximize the obtained
minimum Euclidean distance of the received signal subject to a total rate
constraint. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical
analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed NOMA over existing

settling, bidisperse particles in isotropic turbulence. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that without gravity (i.e. $Fr=\infty$, where $Fr$ is
the Froude number), bidispersity leads to an enhancement of the relative
velocities, and a suppression of their spatial clustering. For $Fr<1$, the
relative velocities in the direction of gravity are enhanced by the
differential settling velocities of the bidisperse particles, as expected.
However, we also find that gravity can strongly enhance the relative velocities
in the ""horizontal"" directions (i.e. in the plane normal to gravity). This
non-trivial behavior occurs because fast settling particles experience rapid
fluctuations in the fluid velocity field along their trajectory, leading to
enhanced particle accelerations and relative velocities. Indeed, the results
show that even when $Fr\ll1$, turbulence can still play an important role, not
only on the horizontal motion, but also on the vertical motion of the
particles, with significant implications for understanding the mixing rates of
settling bidisperse particles in turbulence. We also find that gravity
drastically reduces the clustering of bidisperse particles. These results are
strikingly different to the monodisperse case, for which recent results have
shown that when $Fr<1$, gravity strongly suppresses the relative velocities in
all directions, and can enhance clustering. We then consider the implications
of these results for the collision rates of settling, bidisperse particles in
turbulence. We find that for $Fr=0.052$, the collision kernel is almost
perfectly predicted by the collision kernel for bidisperse particles settling
in quiescent flow, such that the effect of turbulence may be ignored...

named the perturbed compositional gradient flow. By introducing a separation of
fast and slow scales of the two equations, we show that the limit of the slow
motion is given by an averaged ordinary differential equation. We then
demonstrate that the deviation of the slow motion from the averaged equation,
after proper rescaling, converges to a stochastic process with Gaussian inputs.
This indicates that the slow motion can be approximated in the weak sense by a
standard perturbed gradient flow or the continuous-time stochastic gradient
descent algorithm that solves the optimization problem for a composition of two
functions. As an application, the perturbed compositional gradient flow
corresponds to the diffusion limit of the Stochastic Composite Gradient Descent
(SCGD) algorithm for minimizing a composition of two expected-value functions
in the optimization literatures. For the strongly convex case, such an analysis
implies that the SCGD algorithm has the same convergence time asymptotic as the
classical stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Thus it validates, at the
level of continuous approximation, the effectiveness of using the SCGD
algorithm in the strongly convex case.

antennas and the presence of blockages, which significantly alter the path-loss
and small-scale fading parameters. The received power of each interferer
depends on the direction it points and whether it is line-of-sight (LOS),
non-LOS (i.e., partially blocked), or completely blocked. While interferers
that are sufficiently far away will almost certainly be completely blocked, a
finite number of interferers in close proximity will be subject to random
partial blockages. Previous attempts to characterize mmWave networks have made
the simplifying assumption that all interferers within some radius, called the
LOS ball, are unblocked, while interferers beyond that radius are non-LOS.
However, compared to simulation results, the LOS ball assumption tends to
overestimate outage. In this paper, we present an accurate yet tractable
analysis of finite mmWave networks that dispenses with the LOS ball assumption.
In the analysis, each interferer has a distribution that is selected randomly
from several possibilities, each representing different blockage and
directivity states. First, the exact outage probability is found for a finite
network with interferers in fixed locations. Then, the spatially averaged
outage probability is found by averaging over the interferer locations. While
the focus is on device-to-device networks, the analysis is general enough to
find applications outside of the present mmWave framework.

spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a
promising building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper,
primary users (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and
secondary users (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control
between PUs and SUs, SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to
ensure sufficient operation of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing
latency and poses new challenges on the reliability of IoT communications.
  To guarantee operations of primary systems while simultaneously optimizing
system performance in cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), this paper
proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout and
vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by
packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the
proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via
epidemic models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire
system. The simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the
complicated data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end
transmission reliability and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on
analysis of recovery-assisted flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides
performance evaluation of cognitive IoT services built upon CRAHNs.

Theoretically, we prove that the estimation error of the proposed algorithm

Elements of
this structure include the root (that could also be composite), prefixes and
suffixes with which various nuances and relations to other words can be
expressed. Thus, in order to build a proper word representation one must take
into account its internal structure. From a corpus of texts we extract a set of
frequent subwords and from the latter set we select patterns, i.e. subwords
which encapsulate information on character $n$-gram regularities. The selection
is made using the pattern-based Conditional Random Field model with $l_1$
regularization. Further, for every word we construct a new sequence over an
alphabet of patterns. The new alphabet's symbols confine a local statistical
context stronger than the characters, therefore they allow better
representations in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ and are better building blocks for word
representation. In the task of subword-aware language modeling, pattern-based
models outperform character-based analogues by 2-20 perplexity points. Also, a
recurrent neural network in which a word is represented as a sum of embeddings
of its patterns is on par with a competitive and significantly more

it requires (i) ensuring collision avoidance and (ii) minimizing the motion
time, while continuously predicting where to go next. Previous approaches to
on-line motion planning assume that a rough map of the environment is
available, thereby simplifying the problem. This paper presents a reactive
on-line motion planner, Robust Autonomous Waypoint generation (RAW), for mobile
robots navigating in unknown and unstructured environments. RAW generates a
locally maximal ellipsoid around the robot, using semi-definite programming,
such that the surrounding obstacles lie outside the ellipsoid. A reinforcement
learning agent then generates a local waypoint in the robot's field of view,
inside the ellipsoid. The robot navigates to the waypoint and the process
iterates until it reaches the goal. By following the waypoints the robot
navigates through a sequence of overlapping ellipsoids, and avoids collision.
Robot's safety is guaranteed theoretically and the claims are validated through
rigorous numerical experiments in four different experimental setups.
Near-optimality is shown empirically by comparing RAW trajectories with the
global optimal trajectories.

isolated vertices, the set of partial isometries $\mathcal{E}=\{S_e:e\in E\}$
is hyperrigid.
  In addition, we define and examine a closely related notion: the property of
rigidity at $0$. A generating subset $\mathcal{G}$ of a $C^*$-algebra $A$ is
said to be rigid at $0$ if for every sequence of contractive positive maps

  We show that, when combined, hyperrigidity and rigidity at $0$ are equivalent
to a somewhat stronger notion of hyperrigidity, and we connect this to the
unique extension property. This, however, is not the case for the generating
set $\mathcal{E}$. More precisely, we show that for any graph $G$, subsets of
the Cuntz-Krieger family generating $\mathcal{O}(G)$ are rigid at $0$ if and
only if they contain every vertex projection.

dephasing due to interaction with an environment, separable qubit-environment
states generated during the evolution also have zero quantum discord with
respect to the environment. What follows is that the set of separable states
which can be reached during the evolution has zero volume and hence, such
effects as sudden death of qubit-environment entanglement are very unlikely. In
case of the discord with respect to the qubit, a vast majority of separable
states qubit-environment is discordant, but in specific situations zero-discord
states are possible. This is conceptually important since there is a connection
between the discordance with respect to a given subsystem and the possibility
of describing the evolution of this subsystem using completely positive maps.
Finally, we use the formalism to find an exemplary evolution of an entangled
state of two qubits that is completely positive, occurs solely due to
interaction of only one of the qubits with its environment (so one could guess
that it corresponds to a local operation, since it is local in a physical
sense), but which nevertheless causes the enhancement of entanglement between
the qubits. While this simply means that the considered evolution is completely
positive, but does not belong to LOCC, it shows how much caution has to be
exercised when identifying evolution channels that belong to that class.

plausible mechanism for material exchange between two planetary bodies. We have
modeled the spallation process during vertical impacts over a range of impact
velocities from 6 to 21 km/s using both grid- and particle-based hydrocode
models. The Tillotson equations of state, which are able to treat the nonlinear
dependence of density on pressure and thermal pressure in the strongly shocked
matter, were used to study the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic response after
impacts. The effects of material strength and gravitational acceleration were
not considered. A two-dimensional time-dependent pressure field within a
1.5-fold projectile radius from the impact point was investigated in
cylindrical coordinates to address the generation of spalled material. A
resolution test was also performed to reject ejected materials with peak
pressures that were too low due to artificial viscosity. The relationship
between ejection velocity veject and peak pressure Ppeak was also derived. Our
approach shows that late stage acceleration in an ejecta curtain occurs due to
the compressible nature of the ejecta, resulting in an ejection velocity that
can be higher than the ideal maximum of the resultant particle velocity after
passage of a shock wave. We also calculate the ejecta mass that can escape from
a planet like Mars (i.e., veject higher than 5 km/s) that matches the
petrographic constraints from Martian meteorites, and which occurs when Ppeak
from 30-50 GPa. Although the mass of such ejecta is limited to from 0.1-1
percent of the projectile mass in vertical impacts, this is sufficient for
spallation to have been a plausible mechanism for the ejection of Martian
meteorites. Finally, we propose that impact spallation is a plausible mechanism
for the generation of tektites.

ionic liquid assisted grinding combined with gradient centrifugation is an
efficient method to exfoliate bulk WS2 to nanosheets with a thickness of a few
atomic layers and lateral size dimensions in the range of 100 nm to 2 nm. These
WS2 nanosheets decorated with scattered nanodots exhibited highly enhanced
catalytic performance for HER with an onset potential of -130 mV vs. RHE, an
overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec-1 in 0.5 M
H2SO4. Secondly, we found a strong aging effect on the electrocatalytic
performance of WS2 stored in high boiling point organic solvents such as
dimethylformamide (DMF). Importantly, the HER ability could be recovered by
removing the organic (DMF) residues, which obstructed the electron transport,
with acetone. Thirdly, we established that the HER performance of WS2
nanosheets/nanodots could be significantly enhanced, by activating the
electrode surface at a positive voltage for a very short time (60 s),
decreasing the kinetic overpotential by more than 80 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The
performance enhancement was found to arise primarily from the ability of a
formed proton-intercalated amorphous tungsten trioxide (a-WO3) to provide
additional active sites and favourably modify the immediate chemical
environment of the WS2 catalyst, rendering it more favorable for local proton
delivery and/or transport to the active edge site of WS2. Our results provide
new insights into the effects of organic solvents and electrochemical
activation on the catalytic performance of two-dimensional WS2 for HER.

beyond both of those generalities, giving rise to many new sequences with the
Laurent property possessing rich groups of symmetries. Some special cases of

3-space with rotational symmetry that satisfy a linear relationship between
their principal curvatures. In this paper we investigate conditions under which
evolving a smooth rotationally symmetric sphere by a linear combination of its
radii of curvature yields a Hopf sphere. When the coefficients of the flow have
certain integer values, the fate of an initial sphere is entirely determined by
the local geometry of its isolated umbilic points. A surprising variety of
behaviours is uncovered: convergence to round spheres and non-round Hopf
spheres, as well as divergence to infinity.
  The critical quantity is the rate of vanishing of the astigmatism - the
difference of the radii of curvature - at the isolated umbilic points. It is
proven that the size of this quantity versus the coefficient in the flow
function determines the fate of the evolution.
  The geometric setting for the equation is Radius of Curvature space, viewed
as a pair of hyperbolic/AdS half-planes joined along their boundary, the
umbilic horizon. A rotationally symmetric sphere determines a parameterized
curve in this plane with end-points on the umbilic horizon. The slope of the
curve at the umbilic horizon is linked by the Codazzi-Mainardi equations to the
rate of vanishing of astigmatism, and for generic initial conditions can be
used to determine the outcome of the flow.
  The slope can jump during the flow, and a number of examples are given:
instant jumps of the initial slope, as well as umbilic circles that contract to
points in finite time and 'pop' the slope. Finally, we present soliton-like
solutions: curves that evolve under linear flows by mutual hyperbolic/AdS
isometries (dilation and translation) of Radius of Curvature space. A
forthcoming paper will apply these geometric ideas to non-linear curvature
flows.

transmission in multi-hop wireless networks. As a BATS code consists of an
outer code and an inner code that typically is a random linear network code,
one main research topic for BATS codes is to design an inner code with good
performance in transmission efficiency and complexity. In this paper, this
issue is addressed with a focus on the problem of minimizing the total number
of packets transmitted by the source and intermediate nodes. Subsequently, the
problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem
that is NP-hard in general. By exploiting the properties of inner codes and the
incomplete beta function, we construct a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem
that gives a valid upper bound on the best performance that can be achieved by
any feasible solutions. Moreover, both centralized and decentralized real-time
optimization strategies are developed. In particular, the decentralized
approach is performed independently by each node to find a feasible solution in
linear time with the use of look-up tables. Numerical results show that the gap
in performance between our proposed approaches and the upper bound is very
small, which demonstrates that all feasible solutions developed in the paper
are near-optimal with a guaranteed performance bound.

lower by a factor of two or more than that around the pure exponent. The shapes
of the abundance gradients and surface brightness profiles within the optical

profile may be accompanied by a broken abundance gradient and vise versa. There

and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle;
after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing
metrics of failure (so-called ""loss"" or ""win"") used in textual or visual
classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori
information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a
skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to
distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed
possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any
given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a
classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called
ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from
the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the
standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent
with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as
much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize
the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as
an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to
minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful
metric of success of a classifier.

of hadron partonic structure appear as the building blocks in a factorized
description of hard exclusive reactions. The nucleon GPDs have been accessed by
deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production with
lepton beam. A complementary probe with hadron beam is shown to be the
exclusive pion-induced Drell-Yan process, $\pi^- p \to \mu^+ \mu^- n$, as
demonstrated by recent theoretical advances on describing this process in terms
of QCD factorization as the partonic subprocess convoluted with the nucleon
GPDs and the pion distribution amplitudes, and by the feasibility study for its
measurement via a spectrometer at the High Momentum Beamline being constructed
at J-PARC in Japan. We also discuss the possible soft partonic mechanisms
beyond the QCD factorization framework, and present an estimate of the soft
mechanisms at J-PARC kinematics, making use of dispersion relations and
quark-hadron duality. Realization of the measurement of the exclusive
pion-induced Drell-Yan process at J-PARC will provide a new test of QCD
descriptions of a novel class of hard exclusive reactions, and also offer the
possibility of experimentally accessing nucleon GPDs at large timelike
virtuality.

in terms of ambient affine distance functions, and as a consequence we
characterize minimal surfaces as the solutions of a certain differential
equation. We also investigate in which cases it is possible that the affine
normal and the Birkhoff normal vector fields of an immersion coincide, proving
that this only happens when the geometry is Euclidean.

symmetrical uniform structure when dynamic properties are in question. Among
other to stay in a balance, the external force applied to the system should not
be the same but depend on the seed of the crack propagating as the result of
the force action. Moreover, in the supersonic regime there is a bang gap in the
velocity where the crack of that speed cannot propagate at all. However, having
such theoretical prediction, a question still remains where and how those
dynamical regimes can be achieved in real structure. We answering on this
question by providing tailored numerical simulations demonstrating that various
predicted steady-state regimes can be reached after rather short transient
states. Among other, we analise how position of applied loading influence the
