  Empirical Risk Minimization",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems for large-scale
datasets and incorporates the idea of adaptive sample size methods to improve
the guaranteed convergence bounds for first-order stochastic and deterministic
methods. In contrast to traditional methods that attempt to solve the ERM
problem corresponding to the full dataset directly, adaptive sample size
schemes start with a small number of samples and solve the corresponding ERM
problem to its statistical accuracy. The sample size is then grown
geometrically -- e.g., scaling by a factor of two -- and use the solution of
the previous ERM as a warm start for the new ERM. Theoretical analyses show
that the use of adaptive sample size methods reduces the overall computational
cost of achieving the statistical accuracy of the whole dataset for a broad
range of deterministic and stochastic first-order methods. The gains are
specific to the choice of method. When particularized to, e.g., accelerated
gradient descent and stochastic variance reduce gradient, the computational
cost advantage is a logarithm of the number of training samples. Numerical
experiments on various datasets confirm theoretical claims and showcase the
gains of using the proposed adaptive sample size scheme.

the Przybylski's star where superheavy elements up to Z=99 have been possibly

of King plot non-linearity in a search for hypothetical new light bosons. On
the other hand, one can find the non-linear corrections to the King-plot
arising already in the Standard Model framework. We investigate contributions
to the non-linearity arising from relativistic effects in the isotope
field-shift, the nuclear polarizability and many-body effects. It is found that
the nuclear polarizability contribution can lead to the significant deviation
of the King plot from linearity. Therefore, the measurements of the
non-linearity of King plots may be applied to obtain the nuclear polarizability
change between individual isotopes. We then proceed with providing a rough
analytical estimate of the non-linearity arising solely from the effect of a
hypothetical scalar boson. Our predictions give theoretical limitations on the
sensitivity of the search for new interactions and should help to identify the
most suitable atoms for corresponding experiments.

(WSN) deployment for environmental monitoring is full of challenges. This is
because the severe resource constraints on small battery-operated motes (e.g.,
bandwidth, memory, power, and computing capacity), the big data acquisition
volume from the large-scale WSN,and the highly dynamic wireless link conditions
in an outdoor communication environment. We present a novel compressed sensing
approach which can recover the sensing data at the sink with high fidelity when
very few data packets are collected, leading to a significant reduction of the
net-work transmissions and thus an extension of the WSN lifetime. Interplaying
with the dynamic WSN routing topology, the proposed approach is efficient and
simple to implement on the resource-constrained motes without a mote's storing
of any part of the random projection matrix, as opposed to other existing
compressed sensing based schemes. We propose a systematic method via machine
learning to find a suitable representation basis, for any given WSN deployment
and data field, which is both sparse and incoherent with the random projection
matrix in the compressed sensing for data acquisition. We validate our approach
and evaluate its performance using a real-world multi-hop WSN testbed

outperforms existing compressed sensing approaches by reducing data recovery
errors by an order of magnitude for the entire WSN observation field, while
drastically reducing wireless communication costs at the same time.

at the interface between two-dimensional topological insulators. They are
modeled by continuous Hamiltonians as systems of Dirac equations that are
amenable to a large class of random perturbations. We consider general as well
as fermionic time reversal symmetric models. In the former case, Hamiltonians
are classified using the index of a Fredholm operator. In the latter case, the
classification involves a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ index. These indices dictate the
number of topologically protected edge states.
  A remarkable feature of topological insulators is the asymmetry (chirality)
of the edge states, with more modes propagating, say, up than down. In some
cases, backscattering off imperfections is prevented when no mode can carry
signals backwards. This is a desirable feature from an engineering perspective,
which raises the question of how back-scattering is protected topologically. A
major motivation for the derivation of continuous models is to answer such a
question.
  We quantify how backscattering is affected but not suppressed by the
non-trivial topology by introducing a scattering problem along the edge and
describing the effects of topology and randomness on the scattering matrix.
Explicit macroscopic models are then obtained within the diffusion
approximation of field propagation to show the following: the combination of
topology and randomness results in un-hindered transport of the protected modes
while all other modes (Anderson) localize.

communication infrastructure requires a multi-layer network architecture. The
devices in the overlay network are required to provide coverage to the underlay
devices as well as to remain connected to other overlay devices. The
coordination, planning, and design of such two-layer heterogeneous networks is
an important problem to address. Moreover, the mobility of the nodes and their
vulnerability to adversaries pose new challenges to the connectivity. For
instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the
network, e.g., the mobility of the underlay devices or the unavailability of
overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work
proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework
for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network
to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Our
results show that if sufficient overlay devices are available, the framework
leads to a connected configuration that ensures a high coverage of the mobile
underlay network. Moreover, the framework can actively reconfigure itself in
the event of varying levels of device failure.

estimation of a time-dependent growth curve from experiments where larvae have
been exposed to a relatively small number of constant temperature profiles.
Since the temperature influences the developmental speed, a crucial step is the
time alignment of the curves at different temperatures. We propose a model for
time varying temperature profiles based on the local growth rate estimated from
the experimental data. This allows us to estimate the most likely hatching time
for a sample of larvae from the crime scene. Asymptotic properties are provided
for the estimators of the growth curves and the hatching time. We explore via
simulations the robustness of the method to errors in the estimated temperature
profile. We also apply the methodology to data from two criminal cases from the

  under the new name ""Unitarizability in Corank Three for Classical p-adic
  Groups "" ID 2006.12609",,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an earlier paper we propose an approach to the unitarizability problem in
the case of classical groups over a p-adic field of characteristic zero based
on cuspidal reducibility points. We have reduced earlier the unitarizability
for these groups to the case of so called weakly real representations.
Following C. Jantzen, to an irreducible weakly real representation $\pi$ of a
classical group one can attach a sequence ($\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k)$ of irreducible
representations of classical groups, each of them supported by a line of
cuspidal representations $X_\rho$ of general linear groups containing a
selfcontragredient representation $\rho$, and an irreducible cuspidal
representation $\sigma$ of a classical group. The first question is if $\pi$ is
unitarizable if and only if all $\pi_i$ are unitarizable.
  Further, the pair $\rho,\sigma$ determines the non-negative reducibility
exponent $\alpha_{\rho,\sigma}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$ among $\rho$ and $\sigma$.
The question is if the unitarizability of irreducible representations supported
by $X_\rho\cup \sigma$ depends only on $\alpha_{\rho,\sigma}$.
  Following the above proposed strategy, in this paper we solve the
unitarizability problem for irreducible subquotients of representations
Ind$_P^G(\tau)$, where G is a classical group over a p-adic field of
characteristic zero, P is a parabolic subgroup of G of the generalized rank (at
most) 3 and $\tau$ is an irreducible cuspidal representation of a Levi factor M
of P. As a consequence, this gives also a solution of the unitarizability
problem for classical p-adic groups of the split rank (at most) three. This
paper also provides some very limited support for the possibility of the above
approach to the unitarizability could work in general.

policy. After she announces a menu of products and prices, each agent $x$ will
choose to buy that product $y(x)$ which maximizes his own utility, if positive.
The principal's profits are the sum of the net earnings produced by each
product sold. These are determined by the costs of production and the
distribution of products sold, which in turn are based on the distribution of
anonymous agents and the choices they make in response to the principal's price
menu. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the
convexity or concavity of the principal's (bilevel) optimization problem,
assuming each agent's disutility is a strictly increasing but not necessarily
affine (i.e. quasilinear) function of the price paid. Concavity when present,
makes the problem more amenable to computational and theoretical analysis; it
is key to obtaining uniqueness and stability results for the principal's
strategy in particular. Even in the quasilinear case, our analysis goes beyond
previous work by addressing convexity as well as concavity, by establishing
conditions which are not only sufficient but necessary, and by requiring fewer

two different techniques yields a relation between $\beta$ and

original operator need not be run at all. The trained network operates at full
resolution and runs in constant time. We investigate the effect of network
architecture on approximation accuracy, runtime, and memory footprint, and
identify a specific architecture that balances these considerations. We
evaluate the presented approach on ten advanced image processing operators,
including multiple variational models, multiscale tone and detail manipulation,
photographic style transfer, nonlocal dehazing, and nonphotorealistic
stylization. All operators are approximated by the same model. Experiments
demonstrate that the presented approach is significantly more accurate than
prior approximation schemes. It increases approximation accuracy as measured by
PSNR across the evaluated operators by 8.5 dB on the MIT-Adobe dataset (from
27.5 to 36 dB) and reduces DSSIM by a multiplicative factor of 3 compared to
the most accurate prior approximation scheme, while being the fastest. We show
that our models generalize across datasets and across resolutions, and
investigate a number of extensions of the presented approach. The results are

operation. Traditionally, load curtailment techniques such as Demand Response
(DR) have been used for this purpose. However, these cannot be the only
component of a net-load balancing framework for Smart Grids with high PV
penetration. These grids can sometimes exhibit supply surplus causing
over-voltages. Supply curtailment techniques such as Volt-Var Optimizations are
complex and computationally expensive. This increases the complexity of
net-load balancing systems used by the grid operator and limits their
scalability. Recently new technologies have been developed that enable the
rapid and selective connection of PV modules of an installation to the grid.
Taking advantage of these advancements, we develop a unified optimal net-load
balancing framework which performs both load and solar curtailment. We show
that when the available curtailment values are discrete, this problem is
NP-hard and develop bounded approximation algorithms for minimizing the
curtailment cost. Our algorithms produce fast solutions, given the tight timing
constraints required for grid operation. We also incorporate the notion of
fairness to ensure that curtailment is evenly distributed among all the nodes.
Finally, we develop an online algorithm which performs net-load balancing using
only data available for the current interval. Using both theoretical analysis
and practical evaluations, we show that our net-load balancing algorithms
provide solutions which are close to optimal in a small amount of time.

Unfortunately, existing RPCA based methods assume static or quasi-static

introduce two techniques to fill in the gap. First, instead of using the raw
pixel-value as features that are brittle in the presence of dynamic background,
we devise a so-called Gaussian max-pooling operator to estimate a
""stable-value"" for each pixel. Those stable-values are robust to various
background changes and can therefore distinguish effectively the foreground
objects from the background. Then, to obtain more accurate results, we further
propose a Segmentation Constrained RPCA (SC-RPCA) model, which incorporates the
temporal and spatial continuity in images into RPCA. The inference process of
SC-RPCA is a group sparsity constrained nuclear norm minimization problem,
which is convex and easy to solve. Experimental results on seven videos from

from some novel classes are absent in the training data but other information
such as natural language descriptions or attribute vectors of the classes are
available. This setting is important in the real world since one may not be
able to obtain images of all the possible classes at training. While previous
approaches have tried to model the relationship between the class attribute
space and the image space via some kind of a transfer function in order to
model the image space correspondingly to an unseen class, we take a different
approach and try to generate the samples from the given attributes, using a
conditional variational autoencoder, and use the generated samples for
classification of the unseen classes. By extensive testing on four benchmark
datasets, we show that our model outperforms the state of the art, particularly
in the more realistic generalized setting, where the training classes can also
appear at the test time along with the novel classes.

  Small-Cell Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous works on cache-enabled small-cell networks (SCNs) with probabilistic
caching often assume that each user is connected to the nearest small base
station (SBS) among all that have cached its desired content. The user may,
however, suffer strong interference from other SBSs which do not cache the
desired content but are geographically closer. In this work, we investigate
this issue by deploying multiple antennas at each SBS. We first propose a
user-centric SBS clustering model where each user chooses its serving SBS only
from a cluster of $K$ nearest SBSs with $K$ being a fixed cluster size. Two
beamforming schemes are considered. One is coordinated beamforming, where each
SBS uses zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer to null out the interference within the
coordination cluster. The other is uncoordinated beamforming, where each SBS
simply applies matched-filter (MF) beamformer. Using tools from stochastic
geometry, we obtain tractable expressions for the successful transmission
probability (STP) of a typical user for both cases in the high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) region. Tight approximations in closed-form expressions are also
obtained. We then formulate and solve the optimal probabilistic caching problem
to maximize the STP. Numerical results reveal interesting insights on the
choices of ZF and MF beamforming in multi-antenna cache-enabled SCNs.

heterostructures of strained graphene monolayer on 2D transition metal
dichalcogenide (GrTMD) substrate are reported in this communication. The
substrate induced interactions (SII) involve sub-lattice-resolved, and enhanced
intrinsic spin-orbit couplings, the extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(RSOC), and the orbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic charge
from graphene to the substrate. Furthermore, magnetic impurity atoms are
deposited to the graphene surface and the corresponding exchange field is
included in the band dispersion. A Rashba coupling dependent pseudo Zeeman term
arising due to the interplay of SIIs was found to be responsible for the spin
degeneracy lifting and the spin polarization. The latter turns out to be
electrostatic doping and the exchange field tunable and inversely proportional
to the square root of the carrier concentration. The strain field, on the other
hand, brings about the valley polarization. The intra-band plasmon dispersion
for the finite doping and the long wavelength limit has also been obtained. The
dispersion involves the q2/3 behavior and not the well known q1/2 behavior. The
uniform, uniaxial strain does not bring about any change in this behavior.
However, the plasmon dispersion gets steeper for the wavevector perpendicular
to the direction of strain and is flattened for wave vectors along the
direction of the strain with the term responsible for the flattening
proportional to the strain field. The stronger confinement capability of GrTMD
Plasmon compared to that of standalone, doped graphene is an important outcome
of the present work. One finds that whereas the intra-band absorbance of GrTMD
is decreasing function of the frequency at a given strain field, it is an
increasing function of the strain field at a given frequency.

in this paper, by jointly modeling the distribution of data and latent features
in a manner that explicitly assigns zero probability to unobserved data. Rather
than maximizing the marginal probability of observed data, we maximize the
joint probability of the data and the latent features using a two step EM-like
procedure. To prevent the model from overfitting to our initial selection of
latent features, we use adversarial regularization. Depending on the task, we
allow the latent features to be one-hot or real-valued vectors and define a
suitable prior on the features. For instance, one-hot features correspond to
class labels and are directly used for the unsupervised and semi-supervised
classification task, whereas real-valued feature vectors are fed as input to
simple classifiers for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks. The proposed
model, which we dub discriminative encoder (or DisCoder), is flexible in the
type of latent features that it can capture. The proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several challenging tasks.

However, to accurately model such lightcurves the observations need to cover
the entire transit, especially ingress and egress, as well as an out-of-transit
baseline. Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where
the transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the
shape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings
cover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).
These line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,
obliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,
this mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for
fast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line
distortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring
parameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover
ring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a
small part of the transit. Substructure in the rings, e.g. gaps, can be
recovered if the width of the features ($\delta W$) relative to the size of the
star is similar to the intrinsic velocity resolution (set by the width of the
local stellar profile, $\gamma$) relative to the stellar rotation velocity ($v$
sin$i$, i.e. $\delta W / R_* \gtrsim v$sin$i$/$\gamma$). This opens up a new
way to study the ring systems around planets with long orbital periods, where
observations of the full transit, covering the ingress and egress, are not
always feasible.

Instead, semantically rich higher-level methods of the underlying cds like

unimportant lower level read/write conflicts and allow better concurrency. In
this paper, we adapt transaction tree model in databases to propose OSTM which
enables efficient composition in cds. We extend the traditional notion of
conflicts and legality to higher level methods of cds using STMs and lay down
detailed correctness proof to show that it is co-opaque. We implement OSTM with

Further,list-OSTM incurred negligible aborts in comparison to other techniques

element of the spin operator $S^-_j$ ($S^-_{j}S^+_{j'}$) between two
eigenstates with numbers of excitations $n$ and $n+1$ ($n$ and $n$) can be
expressed as the determinant of an appropriate $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ matrix whose
entries involve the coefficients of the canonical transformations diagonalizing
the model. In the special case of a homogeneous periodic XX chain, the matrix
element of $S^-_j$ reduces to a variant of the Cauchy determinant that can be
evaluated analytically to yield a factorized expression. The obtained compact
representations of these matrix elements are then applied to two physical
scenarios: (i) Nonlinear optical response of molecular aggregates, for which
the determinant representation of the transition dipole matrix elements between
eigenstates provides a convenient way to calculate the third-order nonlinear
responses for aggregates from small to large sizes compared with the optical
wavelength, and (ii) real-time dynamics of an interacting Dicke model
consisting of a single bosonic mode coupled to a one-dimensional XX spin bath.
In this setup, full quantum calculation up to $N\leq 16$ spins for vanishing
intrabath coupling shows that the decay of the reduced bosonic occupation
number approaches a finite plateau value (in the long-time limit) that depends
on the ratio between the number of excitations and the total number of spins.

applications in the fields of science and engineering. Among different types of
random number generators (RNG), quantum random number generator (QRNG) is a
kind of promising RNG as it can provide provable true random numbers based on
the inherent randomness of fundamental quantum processes. Nevertheless, the
randomness from a QRNG can be diminished (or even destroyed) if the devices
(especially the entropy source devices) are not perfect or ill-characterized.
To eliminate the practical security loopholes from the source,
source-independent QRNGs, which allow the source to have arbitrary and unknown
dimensions, have been introduced and become one of the most important
semi-device-independent QRNGs. Herein a method that enables ultra-fast
unpredictable quantum random number generation from quadrature fluctuations of
quantum optical field without any assumptions on the input states is proposed.
Particularly, to estimate a lower bound on the extractable randomness that is
independent from side information held by an eavesdropper, a new security
analysis framework is established based on the extremality of Gaussian states,
which can be easily extended to design and analyze new semi-device-independent
continuous variable QRNG protocols. Moreover, the practical imperfections of
the QRNG including the effects of excess noise, finite sampling range, finite
resolution and asymmetric conjugate quadratures are taken into account and
quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally
demonstrated to obtain high secure random number generation rates of 15.07
Gbits/s in off-line configuration and can potentially achieve 6 Gbits/s by
real-time post-processing.

single magnetic electrode has been investigated by first-principles
calculations. The calculations show that the MPT-TMR of FeRh/MgO/Cu tunnel
junction can be as high as hundreds of percent when the magnetic structure of
FeRh changes from G-type antiferromagnetic (GAFM) to ferromagnetic order. This
new type of MPT-TMR may be superior to the tunnel anisotropic magnetoresistance
because of its huge magneto-resistance effect and similar structural
simplicity. The main mechanism for the giant MPT-TMR can be attributed to the
formation of interface resonant states at GAFM-FeRh/MgO interface. A direct
FeRh/MgO interface is found to be necessary for achieving high MPT-TMR
experimentally. Moreover, we find the FeRh/MgO interface with FeRh in
ferromagnetic phase has nearly full spin-polarization due to the negligible
majority transmission and significantly different Fermi surface of two spin
channels. Thus, it may act as a highly efficient and tunable spin-injector. In
addition, electric field driven MPT of FeRh-based hetero-magnetic
nanostructures can be utilized to design various energy efficient tunnel
junction structures and the corresponding lower power consumption devices. Our
results will stimulate further experimental investigations of MPT-TMR and other
fascinating phenomenon of FeRh-based tunnel junctions that may be promising in
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

combined with a possible left-right symmetry within the famous Pati-Salam (PS)
model. In the conventional PS model, a spontaneous breaking of the PS gauge
group down to the SM one can only take place at very high scales (above the PeV
scale) due to the stringent bounds from $K_L\to\mu e$ and $K\to\pi\mu e$
induced by the resulting vector leptoquarks. In this paper, we show that these
constraints can be avoided once additional vector-like fermions are introduced
and thus a breaking at the TeV scale is possible. We consider the flavor
phenomenology of this model in the context of the intriguing hints for new
physics in semileptonic $B$ decays. The necessary violation of lepton flavor
universality is induced by mixing SM and vector-like fermions. Concerning
$R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ we find that sizable effects are possible while respecting
the bounds from other flavor observables but predicting a large enhancement of
$B_s\to\tau^+\tau^-$. Furthermore, also in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions the
observed deviations from the SM predictions (including $R(K)$ and $R(K^*)$) can
be explained with natural values for the free parameters of the model without
any fine-tuning, predicting sizable decay rates for $b\to s\tau\mu$. Finally,
the anomaly in anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be accounted for by a
loop-contribution involving the vector leptoquark and vector-like leptons.

unknown. In particular Durand showed that under Neumann boundary conditions
networks, that minimize dissipation should be trees. Yet many real transport
networks, including capillary beds, are not simply connected. Previously
multiconnectedness in a network has been assumed to provide evidence that the
network is not simply minimizing dissipation. Here we show that if the boundary
conditions on the flows within the network are enlarged to include physical
reasonable Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e. constraints on
either pressure or flow) then minimally dissipative networks need not be trees.
To get to this result we show that two methods of producing optimal networks,
namely enforcing constraints via Lagrange multipliers or via penalty methods,
are equivalent for tree networks.

parameterization relies on a notion of strongly decentralized stabilization,
and sufficient conditions are discussed to guarantee this notion. Then, chordal
decomposition allows us to decompose the convex restriction into a problem with
partially coupled constraints, and the framework of ADMM enables us to solve
the decomposed problem in a distributed fashion. Consequently, the subsystems
only need to share their model data with their direct neighbours, not needing a

DM-heavy quark interactions. Since there is no valence $c,t$ quark inside
nucleons at $\mu_{\rm had}\sim 1$ GeV, $y_2,y_3$ interactions are manifested in
DM-gluon scattering at loop level. We find that renormalization group equation

magnet-free non-reciprocity has inspired several exciting opportunities for
photonic technology. Here, we investigate a scheme to realize free-space
isolators and highly non-reciprocal mirrors with weak modulation imparted by an
acoustic wave. Conventional optical mirrors are reciprocal: in a given plane of
incidence, reflection is independent of the sign of the angle of incidence,
which enables two people to simultaneously look at each other through their
reflection. In contrast, we propose a strategy to dramatically break this
symmetry by exploiting resonant interactions between a travelling acoustic wave
and highly resonant guided optical modes, inducing total reflection of an
optical beam at a given angle, and no reflection at the negative angle.
Different from conventional acousto-optic isolators, which are based on
non-resonant frequency conversion and filtering, our proposal operates at the
frequency of the optical signal by tailoring the resonant properties of the
structure as well as the acoustic wave frequency and intensity, enabling 50 dB
isolation with modest modulation requirements. Operation in reflection allows
for close-to-zero insertion loss, enabling disruptive opportunities in our
ability to control and manipulate photons.

non-adsorbing polymers will move towards regions of lower polymer
concentration, in order to reduce the free energy of the interface between the
surface of the particle and the solution. This phenomenon is known as
diffusiophoresis. Treating the polymer as penetrable hard spheres, as in the
Asakura-Oosawa model, a simple analytic expression for the diffusiophoretic
drift velocity can be obtained. In the context of drying films we show that
diffusiophoresis by this mechanism can lead to stratification under easily

formation of a layer of polymer on top of a layer of the colloid. Transposed to
the case of binary colloidal mixtures, this offers an explanation for the
stratification observed recently in these systems [A. Fortini et al, Phys. Rev.

solvent dynamics explicitly in these problems, and caution against the neglect
of hydrodynamic interactions or the use of implicit solvent models in which the
absence of solvent backflow results in an unbalanced osmotic force which gives
rise to large but unphysical effects.

variability in the X-ray domain, widely ascribed to the accretion from a clumpy
stellar wind. In this paper we performed a systematic and homogeneous analysis
of sufficiently bright X-ray flares from the SFXTs observed with XMM-Newton to
probe spectral variations on timescales as short as a few hundred of seconds.
Our ultimate goal is to investigate if SFXT flares and outbursts are triggered
by the presence of clumps and eventually reveal whether strongly or mildly
dense clumps are required. For all sources, we employ a technique developed by
our group, making use of an adaptive rebinned hardness ratio to optimally
select the time intervals for the spectral extraction. A total of twelve
observations performed in the direction of five SFXTs are reported. We show
that both strongly and mildly dense clumps can trigger these events. In the
former case, the local absorption column density may increase by a factor of
>>3, while in the latter case, the increase is only by a factor of 2-3 (or
lower). Overall, there seems to be no obvious correlation between the dynamic
ranges in the X-ray fluxes and absorption column densities in SFXTs, with an
indication that lower densities are recorded at the highest fluxes. This can be
explained by the presence of accretion inhibition mechanism(s). We propose a
classification of the flares/outbursts from these sources to drive future
observational investigations. We suggest that the difference between the
classes of flares/outbursts is related to the fact that the mechanism(s)
inhibiting accretion can be overcome more easily in some sources compared to
others. We also investigate the possibility that different stellar wind
structures, rather than clumps, could provide the means to temporarily overcome
the inhibition of accretion in SFXTs.

constraints were identified and solved through the introduction of
prepotentials, enjoying both linearized generalized diffeomorphism and
linearized generalized Weyl rescaling gauge invariance, motivating our study of
conformal invariants for higher spins. We built these with the Cotton tensor,
whose properties (tracelessness, symmetry, divergencelessness; completeness,
invariance) we established. With these geometric tools, a first order action
was written down in terms of the prepotentials. It is manifestly invariant
under electric-magnetic duality which, with the gauge freedom of the
prepotentials, completely fixes the action. This action is associated to
twisted self-duality conditions.
  With an interest in supersymmetric extensions, we began to extend this study
to fermions, similarly analyzing the spin $5/2$ massless free field, whose
prepotential also enjoys conformal gauge invariance. The spin $2$-spin $5/2$
supermultiplet was considered, and a rigid symmetry of its action (a
chirality-duality rotation) was built to commute with supersymmetry. We also
investigated the properties of a mixed symmetry field on a flat six-dimensional
space-time, the so-called chiral $(2,2)$-form: Hamiltonian analysis,
prepotentials, and a first order action associated to self-duality conditions.
  Finally, we studied both fermionic and bosonic higher spin surface charges
over a constantly curved background space-time. The Hamitonian constraints are
the generators of gauge transformations. Plugging into them appropriate values
of the gauge parameters (imposing a physical variation of the fields), their
finite and non-vanishing on-shell values were computed and recognized as
conserved charges of the theory. Their algebra was checked to be abelian.

at 400 nm and 800 nm wavelength are considered, with arbitrary molecular
alignment and polarization (linear and elliptic). Calculations reveal
significant excited state channel contributions that are, at certain molecular
orientations, an order of magnitude larger than the ground state channel in the
rescattering plateau. Partial wash out of the multiphoton structure in the ATI
spectra and of the nodal features in angle resolved spectra is observed due to
ionization to excited state channels. The qualitative nature of the spectra is
determined by ionization thresholds, orbital symmetries and interchannel
coupling in the order of precedence.

the fractional Laplacian is a nonlocal operator in its standard form, however

This adds a complexity of an extra spacial dimension and a singular/degenerate

show that these corrections are able to be truncated to design a
computationally efficient scheme with optimal convergence rates. A key
ingredient of this method is the use of quasi-interpolation operators to
construct the fine scale spaces. Since the solution of the extended problem on
the critical boundary is of main interest, we construct a projective
quasi-interpolation that has both $d$ and $d+1$ dimensional averages over

($L^1$-EOCP) are considered. To solve $L^1$-EOCP, the primal-dual active set
(PDAS) method, which is a special semismooth Newton (SSN) method, used to be a
priority. However, in general solving Newton equations is expensive. Motivated
by the success of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we
consider extending the ADMM to $L^1$-EOCP. To discretize $L^1$-EOCP, the
piecewise linear finite element (FE) is considered. However, different from the
finite dimensional $l^1$-norm, the discretized $L^1$-norm does not have a
decoupled form. To overcome this difficulty, an effective approach is utilizing
nodal quadrature formulas to approximately discretize the $L^1$-norm and
$L^2$-norm. It is proved that these approximation steps will not change the
order of error estimates. To solve the discretized problem, an inexact
heterogeneous ADMM (ihADMM) is proposed. Different from the classical ADMM, the
ihADMM adopts two different weighted inner product to define the augmented
Lagrangian function in two subproblems, respectively. Benefiting from such
different weighted techniques, two subproblems of ihADMM can be efficiently
implemented. Furthermore, theoretical results on the global convergence as well
as the iteration complexity results $o(1/k)$ for ihADMM are given. In order to
obtain more accurate solution, a two-phase strategy is also presented, in which
the primal-dual active set (PDAS) method is used as a postprocessor of the
ihADMM. Numerical results not only confirm error estimates, but also show that
the ihADMM and the two-phase strategy are highly efficient.

Specifying these results to control of semi-explicit DAEs we obtain necessary
optimality conditions for control of semi-explicit DAEs with index higher than
one.

between the running vacuum and a non-conserving baryon current may dynamically
break CPT and trigger baryogenesis through an effective chemical potential. By
assuming a non-singular class of running vacuum cosmologies which provides a
complete cosmic history (from an early inflationary de Sitter stage to the
present day quasi-de Sitter acceleration), it is found that an acceptable
baryon asymmetry is generated for many different choices of the model
parameters. It is interesting that the same ingredient (running vacuum energy
density) addresses several open cosmological questions/problems: avoids the
initial singularity, provides a smooth exit for primordial inflation,
alleviates both the coincidence and the cosmological constant problems, and,
finally, is also capable of explaining the generation of matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the very early Universe.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1704.02107",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The network Lasso is a recently proposed convex optimization method for
machine learning from massive network structured datasets, i.e., big data over
networks. It is a variant of the well-known least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso), which is underlying many methods in learning and
signal processing involving sparse models. Highly scalable implementations of
the network Lasso can be obtained by state-of-the art proximal methods, e.g.,
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By generalizing the
concept of the compatibility condition put forward by van de Geer and Buehlmann
as a powerful tool for the analysis of plain Lasso, we derive a sufficient
condition, i.e., the network compatibility condition, on the underlying network
topology such that network Lasso accurately learns a clustered underlying graph
signal. This network compatibility condition relates the location of the
sampled nodes with the clustering structure of the network. In particular, the
NCC informs the choice of which nodes to sample, or in machine learning terms,
which data points provide most information if labeled.

reliable, replicable and have the least dissimilarity between the samples
obtained. Majority of the applications of sampling use randomized sampling,
albeit with stratification where applicable. The randomized technique is not
consistent, and may provide different samples each time, and the different
samples themselves may not be similar to each other. In this paper, we
introduce a novel non-statistical no-replacement sampling technique called
Wobbly Center Algorithm, which relies on building clusters iteratively based on
maximizing the heterogeneity inside each cluster. The algorithm works on the
principle of stepwise building of clusters by finding the points with the
maximal distance from the cluster center. The obtained results are validated
statistically using Analysis of Variance tests by comparing the samples
obtained to check if they are representative of each other. The obtained
results generated from running the Wobbly Center algorithm on benchmark
datasets when compared against other sampling algorithms indicate the
superiority of the Wobbly Center Algorithm.

new task proposed for SemEval-2016 Task6, involving predicting stance for a
dataset of tweets on the topics of abortion, atheism, climate change, feminism
and Hillary Clinton. Given the small size of the dataset, our team created our
own topic-specific training corpus by developing a set of high precision
hashtags for each topic that were used to query the twitter API, with the aim
of developing a large training corpus without additional human labeling of
tweets for stance. The hashtags selected for each topic were predicted to be
stance-bearing on their own. Experimental results demonstrate good performance
for our features for opinion-target pairs based on generalizing dependency
features using sentiment lexicons.

range of applications in areas like object recognition, city modelling, virtual

perform a 3D reconstruction, specialized hardwares were required. Such systems
were often very expensive and was only available for industrial or research
purpose. With the rise of the availability of high-quality low cost 3D sensors,
it is now possible to design inexpensive complete 3D scanning systems. The
objective of this work was to design an acquisition and processing system that
can perform 3D scanning and reconstruction of objects seamlessly. In addition,
the goal of this work also included making the 3D scanning process fully
automated by building and integrating a turntable alongside the software. This
means the user can perform a full 3D scan only by a press of a few buttons from
our dedicated graphical user interface. Three main steps were followed to go
from acquisition of point clouds to the finished reconstructed 3D model. First,
our system acquires point cloud data of a person/object using inexpensive
camera sensor. Second, align and convert the acquired point cloud data into a
watertight mesh of good quality. Third, export the reconstructed model to a 3D
printer to obtain a proper 3D print of the model.

the infrared (IR) regime by means of an invariant minimum speed in the
spacetime and its effects on the time when an atomic clock given by a certain
radioactive single-atom (e.g.: isotope $Na^{25}$) is a thermometer for a
ultracold gas like the dipolar gas $Na^{23}K^{40}$. So, according to a Deformed
Special Relativity (DSR) so-called Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR), where
there emerges an invariant minimum speed $V$ in the subatomic world, one
expects that the proper time of such a clock moving close to $V$ in thermal
equilibrium with the ultracold gas is dilated with respect to the improper time
given in lab, i.e., the proper time at ultracold systems elapses faster than
the improper one for an observer in lab, thus leading to the so-called {\it
proper time dilation} so that the atomic decay rate of a ultracold radioactive
sample (e.g: $Na^{25}$) becomes larger than the decay rate of the same sample
at room temperature. This means a suppression of the half-life time of a
radioactive sample thermalized with a ultracold cloud of dipolar gas to be
investigated by NASA in the Cold Atom Lab (CAL).

assumption that interactions are more likely to occur between individuals with

inferred hierarchy, and it can be used to perform inference tasks such as
predicting the existence or direction of edges. The ranking is obtained by
solving a linear system of equations, which is sparse if the network is; thus
the resulting algorithm is extremely efficient and scalable. We illustrate
these findings by analyzing real and synthetic data, including datasets from
animal behavior, faculty hiring, social support networks, and sports
tournaments. We show that our method often outperforms a variety of others, in
both speed and accuracy, in recovering the underlying ranks and predicting edge
