flow in a finite dimensional Hilbert space, focusing on the so-called delayed
loss of stability of stationary solutions. We find a class of time-dependent
energy functionals and initial conditions for which we can explicitly calculate
the first discontinuity time $t^*$ of the limit. For our class of functionals,
$t^*$ coincides with the blow-up time of the solutions of the linearized system
around the equilibrium, and is in particular strictly greater than the time
$t_c$ where strict local minimality with respect to the driving energy gets
lost. Moreover, we show that, in a right neighborhood of $t^*$, rescaled
solutions of the singularly perturbed problem converge to heteroclinic
solutions of the gradient flow. Our results complement the previous ones by
Zanini, where the situation we consider was excluded by assuming the so-called
transversality conditions, and the limit evolution consisted of strict local
minimizers of the energy up to a negligible set of times.

able to define a distance ex nihilo which could be applicable to all music

these issues. This paper introduces a method to build transposition-invariant
distances on symbolic musical sequences which are learned from data. It is a
hybrid distance which combines learned feature representations of musical

effective tool in identifying and understanding energetic particles. The early
surprise in solar energetic particles (SEPs) was 1000-fold enhancements in
3He/4He from resonant wave-particle interactions in the small ""impulsive"" SEP
events that emit electron beams that produce type III radio bursts. Further
studies found enhancements in Fe/O, then extreme enhancements in abundances
that increase with mass-to-charge ratio A/Q by a factor of 1000 from He to Pb
arising in magnetic reconnection on open field lines in solar jets. In
contrast, in the largest SEP events, the ""gradual"" events, acceleration occurs
at shock waves driven out from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). Averaging many events provides a measure of solar coronal abundances,
but A/Q-dependent scattering during transport causes variations with time; thus
if Fe scatters less than O, Fe/O is enhanced early and depleted later. To
complicate matters, shock waves often reaccelerate impulsive suprathermal ions
above active regions that have spawned many impulsive events. Since both
impulsive and gradual SEP events have abundance enhancements that vary as
powers of A/Q, we can use abundances to deduce Q-values and 1 - 3 MK source
plasma temperatures during acceleration. Comparing coronal abundances from SEPs
and from the slow solar wind as a function of the first ionization potential
(FIP) of the elements, remaining differences are for the elements C, P, and S.
The theory of the fractionation of ions by Alfv\'en waves shows that C, P, and
S are suppressed because of wave resonances during chromospheric transport on
closed magnetic loops but not on open magnetic fields that supply the solar
wind. Shock waves can accelerate ions from closed coronal loops that easily
escape as SEPs, while the solar wind must emerge on open fields.

developed a unique database that integrates intersection crash and inventory

coefficient of variation as a standardized measure of relative dispersion, LBVs
are calculated for 116 intersections in Ann Arbor. To quantify relationships
between intersection-specific volatilities and crash frequencies, rigorous

controlling for exposure related factors, the results provide evidence of
statistically significant (5% level) positive association between

the full potential of 2D techniques has yet to be fully exploited. Secondary
morphological features in nearby disk galaxies, such as bars, lenses, rings,
disk breaks, and spiral arms, are seldom accounted for in 2D image
decompositions, even though some image-fitting codes, such as GALFIT, are
capable of handling them. We present detailed, 2D multi-model and

Traditional 1D decomposition is also presented for comparison. In detailed case

input surface brightness models, we identify morphological features that
significantly impact bulge measurements. We show that nuclear and inner
lenses/rings and disk breaks must be properly taken into account to obtain
accurate bulge parameters, whereas outer lenses/rings and spiral arms have a
negligible effect. We provide an optimal strategy to measure bulge parameters
of typical disk galaxies, as well as prescriptions to estimate realistic

resonance within a model which accounts both for the finite range of
interactions and the presence of background scattering. The latter may be due
to direct interactions in an open channel or a second overlapping Feshbach
resonance. It is found that background scattering gives rise to substantial
changes in the trimer spectrum as a function of the detuning away from a
Feshbach resonance, in particular in the regime where the background channel
supports Efimov states on its own. Compared to the situation with negligible
background scattering, the regime where van der Waals universality applies is
shifted to larger values of the resonance strength if the background scattering
length is positive. For negative background scattering lengths, in turn, van
der Waals universality extends to even small values of the resonance strength
parameter, consistent with experimental results on Efimov states in $^{39}$K.
Within a simple model, we show that short-range three-body forces do not affect
van der Waals universality significantly. Repulsive three-body forces may,
however, explain the observed variation between around $-8$ and $-10$ of the
ratio between the scattering length where the first Efimov trimer appears and
the van der Waals length.

their optical luminosity derives from energy released near the hot white dwarf
which is reprocessed through the ejected material. Recent studies with the
Fermi Large Area Telescope have shown that many classical novae are accompanied
by gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray emission. This emission likely originates from
strong shocks, providing new insights into the properties of nova outflows and
allowing them to be used as laboratories to study the unknown efficiency of
particle acceleration in shocks. Here we report gamma-ray and optical
observations of the Milky Way nova ASASSN-16ma, which is among the brightest
novae ever detected in gamma-rays. The gamma-ray and optical light curves show
a remarkable correlation, implying that the majority of the optical light comes
from reprocessed emission from shocks rather than the white dwarf. The ratio of
gamma-ray to optical flux in ASASSN-16ma directly constrains the acceleration
efficiency of non-thermal particles to be ~0.005, favouring hadronic models for
the gamma-ray emission. The need to accelerate particles up to energies
exceeding 100 gigaelectronvolts provides compelling evidence for magnetic field
amplification in the shocks.

state space $X$ that applies some desired conditional distribution $P$ to
initial states to produce final states. This problem arises often in the
thermodynamics of computation and nonequilibrium statistical physics more
generally (e.g., when designing processes to implement some desired
computation, feedback controller, or Maxwell demon). It was previously known
that some conditional distributions cannot be implemented using any master
equation that involves just the states in $X$. However, here we show that any
conditional distribution $P$ can in fact be implemented---if additional
""hidden"" states not in $X$ are available. Moreover, we show that it is always
possible to implement $P$ in a thermodynamically reversible manner. We then
investigate a novel cost of the physical resources needed to implement a given
distribution $P$: the minimal number of hidden states needed to do so. We
calculate this cost exactly for the special case where $P$ represents a
single-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in
terms of the nonnegative rank of $P$. These results show that having access to
one extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states,
is sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a
thermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed
form of the master equation. (Such constraints can greatly increase the minimal
needed number of hidden states.) Our results also imply that for certain $P$
that can be implemented without hidden states, having hidden states permits an
implementation that generates less heat.

Upon exciting the metal with an infrared laser pulse, a spin Seebeck current
$j_\textrm{s}$ arises on the same ~100fs time scale on which the metal
electrons thermalize. This observation highlights that efficient spin transfer
critically relies on carrier multiplication and is driven by conduction
electrons scattering off the metal-insulator interface. Analytical modeling
shows that the electrons' dynamics are almost instantaneously imprinted onto
$j_\textrm{s}$ because their spins have a correlation time of only ~4fs and
deflect the ferrimagnetic moments without inertia. Applications in material
characterization, interface probing, spin-noise spectroscopy and terahertz spin

emphasizing that Fe3+ ions are located in crystal positions with a strong

spectra were fitted assuming that the electric hyperfine interactions are
modulated when the Fe3+ spin (S) rotates with respect to the EFG axis and
emergence of spatial anisotropy of the hyperfine field Hhf = S\~AI at 57Fe

hyperfine coupling tensor (\~A). The large anharmonicity parameter, m ~ 0.94,
of the spiral spin structure results from easy-axis anisotropy in the plane of
the iron spin rotation. The temperature evolution of the hyperfine field Hhf(T)

spin-exchange and charge-exchange reactions are controlled in an ultracold

single hyperfine spin-state. Spin-exchange collisions between atoms and ion
subsequently polarize the ion spin. Electron transfer is only allowed for
(RbSr)$^+$ colliding in the singlet manifold. Initializing the atoms in various

molecular manifold and therefore also the reaction rate. We experimentally show
that by preparing the atoms in different spin states one can vary the

(BSs) and make a cell selection decision. Due to the importance of beamforming
gain in millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO cellular networks, the
directional cell search delay performance is investigated. A cellular network
with fixed BS and user locations is considered, so that strong temporal
correlations exist for the SINR experienced at each BS and user. For Poisson
cellular networks with Rayleigh fading channels, a closed-form expression for
the spatially averaged mean cell search delay of all users is derived. This
mean cell search delay for a noise-limited network (e.g., mmWave network) is
proved to be infinite whenever the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path loss exponent
is larger than 2. For interference-limited networks, a phase transition for the
mean cell search delay is shown to exist in terms of the number of BS
antennas/beams $M$: the mean cell search delay is infinite when $M$ is smaller
than a threshold and finite otherwise. Beam-sweeping is also demonstrated to be
effective in decreasing the cell search delay, especially for the cell edge
users.

in a growing number of applications as it enhances RF transceivers with
cognitive abilities and enables parameter tuning of traditional RF chains. In
power and cost limited applications, e.g., for sensor nodes in the Internet of
Things, wideband RF feature extraction with conventional, Nyquist-rate
analog-to-digital converters is infeasible. However, the structure of many RF
features (such as signal sparsity) enables the use of compressive sensing (CS)
techniques that acquire such signals at sub-Nyquist rates. While such CS-based
analog-to-information (A2I) converters have the potential to enable low-cost
and energy-efficient wideband RF sensing, they suffer from a variety of
real-world limitations, such as noise folding, low sensitivity, aliasing, and
limited flexibility.
  This paper proposes a novel CS-based A2I architecture called non-uniform
wavelet sampling (NUWS). Our solution extracts a carefully-selected subset of
wavelet coefficients directly in the RF domain, which mitigates the main issues
of existing A2I converter architectures. For multi-band RF signals, we propose
a specialized variant called non-uniform wavelet bandpass sampling (NUWBS),
which further improves sensitivity and reduces hardware complexity by
leveraging the multi-band signal structure. We use simulations to demonstrate
that NUWBS approaches the theoretical performance limits of $\ell_1$-norm-based
sparse signal recovery. We investigate hardware-design aspects and show ASIC
measurement results for the wavelet generation stage, which highlight the
efficacy of NUWBS for a broad range of RF feature extraction tasks in cost- and

filtering, distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle

architecture that fundamentally removes such vulnerabilities by disassociating
the relationship between IP prefixes and destination networks, and by allowing
any end-to-end communication session to have dynamic, short-lived, and
pseudo-random IP addresses drawn from a range of IP prefixes rather than one.
The concept is seemingly impossible to realize in todays Internet. We
demonstrate how this is doable today with three different strategies using
software defined networking (SDN), and how this can be done at scale to
transform the Internet addressing and routing paradigms with the novel concept
of a distributed software defined Internet exchange (SDX). The solution works
with both IPv4 and IPv6, whereas the latter provides higher degrees of IP
addressing freedom. Prototypes based on OpenvSwitches (OVS) have been
implemented for experimentation across the PEERING BGP testbed. The SDX

relativistic MHD turbulence in isothermal plasmas, and analyzed the ratio of
fast to Alfv\'en mode energy. We found that the increase of the fast mode with
the background $\sigma$-parameter can be observed even in isothermal plasma,
showing that such a phenomena is universal in trans-Alfv\'enic turbulence in
Poynting-dominated plasmas. To study the detailed energy conversion process, we
also performed a series of simulations of decaying turbulence injecting pure
Alfv\'en, fast, and slow modes, respectively, and investigated the development
of the mode conversion from the each mode. We also found that the mode
conversion between Alfv\'en and fast modes is nearly insensitive to the
background temperature. Finally, we report a result of a simulation with
initially fast mode dominated turbulence. It developed into a temporally
strong-coupling regime, which is a strong evidence for the existence of our
suggesting strong-coupling regime of fast and Alfv\'en modes. Our result
suggests that the strong turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasma is very
different from that in the non-relativistic plasma. It will also give an
important guidance to studies of particle acceleration and non-thermal photon

magneto-optical trap serving as a source for cold strontium atoms. We analyze
the dependence of the source's properties on various parameters, in particular
the intensity of a pushing beam accelerating the atoms out of the source. An
atomic flux exceeding $10^9\,\mathrm{atoms/s}$ at a rather moderate oven
temperature of $500\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ is achieved. The longitudinal velocity
of the atomic beam can be tuned over several tens of m/s by adjusting the power
of the pushing laser beam. The beam divergence is around $60$ mrad, determined
by the transverse velocity distribution of the cold atoms. The slow atom source
is used to load a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap realizing loading
rates up to $10^9\,\mathrm{atoms/s}$ without indication of saturation of the
loading rate for increasing oven temperature. The compact setup avoids
undesired effects found in alternative sources like, e.g., Zeeman slowers, such
as vacuum contamination and black-body radiation due to the hot strontium oven.

atmospheres to `reconstruct' chemically homogeneous star clusters that have
long since dispersed. The GALAH spectroscopic survey --which aims to observe
one million stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope -- allows us to measure
up to 30 elements or dimensions in the stellar chemical abundance space, many
of which are not independent. How to find clustering reliably in a noisy
high-dimensional space is a difficult problem that remains largely unsolved.
Here we explore t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) -- which
identifies an optimal mapping of a high-dimensional space into fewer dimensions
-- whilst conserving the original clustering information. Typically, the
projection is made to a 2D space to aid recognition of clusters by eye. We show
that this method is a reliable tool for chemical tagging because it can: (i)
resolve clustering in chemical space alone, (ii) recover known open and
globular clusters with high efficiency and low contamination, and (iii) relate
field stars to known clusters. t-SNE also provides a useful visualization of a
high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the method on a dataset of 13 abundances
measured in the spectra of 187,000 stars by the GALAH survey. We recover 7 of
the 9 observed clusters (6 globular and 3 open clusters) in chemical space with
minimal contamination from field stars and low numbers of outliers. With
chemical tagging, we also identify two Pleiades supercluster members (which we
confirm kinematically), one as far as 6$^\circ$ -- one tidal radius away from
the cluster centre.

transformations between pairs of images to be registered. Different from most
existing deep learning based image registration methods that learn spatial
transformations from training data with known corresponding spatial
transformations, our method directly estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of images by maximizing an image-wise similarity metric between fixed and
deformed moving images, similar to conventional image registration algorithms.
At the same time, our method also learns FCNs for encoding the spatial
transformations at the same spatial resolution of images to be registered,
rather than learning coarse-grained spatial transformation information. The
image registration is implemented in a multi-resolution image registration
framework to jointly optimize and learn spatial transformations and FCNs at
different resolutions with deep self-supervision through typical feedforward
and backpropagation computation. Since our method simultaneously optimizes and
learns spatial transformations for the image registration, our method can be
directly used to register a pair of images, and the registration of a set of
images is also a training procedure for FCNs so that the trained FCNs can be
directly adopted to register new images by feedforward computation of the
learned FCNs without any optimization. The proposed method has been evaluated
for registering 3D structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) images and obtained
better performance than state-of-the-art image registration algorithms.

ring radius measurement is obtained from the caustic crossing time: This is
supplemented by secondary constraints such as precise parallax measurements
and/or measures of the lens luminosity using high angular resolution
observations. We resolved the source+lens star from sub-arcsecond blends in H
band using adaptive optics (AO) observations with NIRC2 mounted on Keck II
telescope. We identify additional flux, coincident with the source to within
160 mas. We estimate the potential contributions to this blended light
(chance-aligned star, additional companion to the lens or to the source) and
find that 85 % of of the NIR flux is due to the lens star at H_L=16.63 +- 0.06
and K_L=16.46 +- 0.06. We combined the parallax constraint and the AO
constraint to derive the physical parameters of the system. The lensing system

turbulence usually produces a direct energy cascade, while solenoidal planar
turbulence transports energy to large scales by an inverse cascade. Here, we
consider turbulence at finite Mach numbers when the interaction between
acoustic waves and vortices is substantial. We employ solenoidal pumping at
intermediate scales and show how both direct and inverse energy cascades are
formed starting from the pumping scale. We show that there is an inverse
cascade of kinetic energy up to a scale $\ell$, where a typical velocity
reaches the speed of sound; this creates shock waves, which provide for a
compensating direct cascade. When the system size is less than $\ell$, the
steady state contains a system-size pair of long-living condensate vortices
connected by a system of shocks. Thus turbulence in fluid layers processes
energy via a loop: Most energy first goes to large scales via vortices and is
then transported by waves to small-scale dissipation.

evidences of topological changes at A and L point of the Brillouin zone

the c/a ratio shows a plateau suggesting a transformation from an anisotropic
2D layer to a quasi 3D crystal network. First principles calculations suggest
that the 2D to quasi 3D evolution without any structural phase transitions is
mainly due to the increased interlayer Te-Te interactions (bridging) via the
charge density overlap. In addition to the pressure dependent isostructural
phase transitions, our data also evidences the occurrence of a first order
structural phase transition from the trigonal (P-3m1) phase at higher

sponge-like interpenetrating polar and apolar networks in ionic liquids

lengthening aliphatic chains in tetraalkylphosphonium cations leads to polar
domains consisting of chloride anions and central polar groups in cations being
partially or totally segregated in ionic liquid matrices due to a progressive
expansion of apolar domains in between. Prominent polarity alternation peaks
and adjacency correlation peaks are observed at low and high $q$ range in total
X-ray scattering structural functions, respectively, and their peak positions
gradually shift to lower q values with lengthening aliphatic chains in

intermediate q range exhibit complicated tendencies due to the complete
cancellations of peaks and anti-peaks in partial structural functions for ionic
subcomponents. The particular microstructures and liquid morphologies in

distinct dynamics characterized by translational diffusion coefficients, van

We found that resonant and/or bound states appear in both the charm and bottom

this reason, it plays an important role to produce these states. In the charm
sector, we need the five-quark potential in addition to the pion exchange
potential in producing bound and resonant states, whereas, in the bottom
sector, the pion exchange interaction is strong enough to produce states. Thus,
from this investigation, it emerges that the hidden-bottom pentaquarks are more
likely to form than their hidden-charm counterparts; for this reason, we
suggest that the experimentalists should look for states in the bottom sector.

spatial directions and the results analyzed at different scales. We show that
the $R$--$Q$ plane does not capture the changes undergone by the flow as the
filter width increases, and that the enstrophy/enstrophy-production and
strain/strain-production planes represent better choices. We also show that the
conditional mean trajectories may differ significantly from the instantaneous
behavior of the flow since they are the result of an averaging process where
the mean is 3-5 times smaller than the corresponding standard deviation. The
orbital periods in the $R$--$Q$ plane are shown to be independent of the
intensity of the events, and of the same order of magnitude than those in the
enstrophy/enstrophy-production and strain/strain-production planes. Our final
goal is to test whether the dynamics of the flow are self-similar in the
inertial range, and the answer turns out to be no. The mean shear is found to
be responsible for the absence of self-similarity and progressively controls
the dynamics of the eddies observed as the filter width increases. However, a
self-similar behavior emerges when the calculations are repeated for the
fluctuating velocity gradient tensor. Finally, the turbulent cascade in terms

to the first row of the exponent matrix too. All non-isomorphic QC-LDPC codes
with girth 10 and $n=5,6$ whose numbers are more than those presented in the
literature are provided. For $n=7,8$ we decrease the lifting degrees from 159

degree is achieved.
  For multiple-edge category, for the first time a lower bound on the lifting
degree for both regular and irregular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 is achieved.
We also demonstrate that the achieved lower bounds on multiple-edge
$(4,n)$-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 are tight and the resultant codes
have shorter length compared to their counterparts in single-edge codes.
Additionally, difference matrices help to reduce the conditions of considering
6-cycles from seven states to five states. We obtain multiple-edge
$(4,n)$-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 8 and $n=4,6,8$ with the shortest
length.

separate phase graphs that exchange during evolution periods. There are two
variants: EPG-X(BM) for systems governed by the Bloch-McConnell equations; and
EPG-X(MT) for the pulsed MT formalism. For the MT case the ""bound"" protons have
no transverse components so their phase graph consists only longitudinal
states. EPG-X was used to model steady-state gradient echo imaging, MT effects
in multislice Turbo Spin Echo imaging, multiecho CPMG for multicomponent T2
relaxometry and transient variable flip angle gradient echo imaging of the type
used for MR Fingerprinting. Experimental data were also collected for the final
case. Steady-state predictions from EPG-X closely match directly derived
steady-state solutions which differ substantially from classic ""single pool""
EPG predictions. EPG-X(MT) predicts similar MT related levels of signal
attenuation in white matter as have been reported elsewhere in the literature.
Modelling of CPMG echo trains with EPG-X(BM) suggests that exchange processes
can lead to an underestimate of the fraction of short T2 species. Modelling of
transient gradient echo sequences with EPG-X(MT) suggests that measurable MT
effects result from variable saturation of bound protons, particularly after
inversion pulses. In conclusion, EPG-X can be used for modelling of the
transient signal response of systems exhibiting chemical exchange or MT. This
may be particularly beneficial for relaxometry approaches that rely on
characterising transient rather than steady-state sequences.

mass accretion rate and formation time vary with orientation and distance from
the saddle, demonstrating that assembly bias is indeed influenced by the tides
imposed by the cosmic web. Starved, early forming haloes of smaller mass lie
preferentially along the main axis of filaments, while more massive and younger
haloes are found closer to the nodes. Distinct gradients for distinct tracers
such as typical mass and accretion rate occur because the saddle condition is
anisotropic, and because the statistics of these observables depend on both the
conditional means and their covariances. The theory is extended to other
critical points of the potential field. The response of the mass function to
variations of the matter density field (the so-called large scale bias) is
computed, and its trend with accretion rate is shown to invert along the
filament. The signature of this model should correspond at low redshift to an
excess of reddened galactic hosts at fixed mass along preferred directions, as
recently reported in spectroscopic and photometric surveys and in
hydrodynamical simulations. The anisotropy of the cosmic web emerges therefore

the observation of exotic proximity effects in various systems, including

proximity effect is enhanced in transparent weak links where coherent Andreev
reflection is possible. Also, it is a common knowledge that the proximity
effect is, by definition, is a localized phenomenon that can only be active in
each S/N interface region. However, here we show that a three-dimensional (3D)
macroscale proximity effect is realized in few-micrometer-thick MgO/Mg2Si/MgB2
nanocomposite layers with atomically smooth and clean heterointerfaces. We
found from scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
microscopy measurements that a normal region of more than 100x100 square
micrometers totally undergoes transition into a bulk-like superconducting state
although the normal host originally contains less than ~10 vol % of
superconducting MgB2 nanograins in a dispersed manner. In the proximity-induced
superconducting region, vortex formation and annihilation processes as well as
vortex-free Meissner regions were observed with respect to applied fields in a
similar manner as Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Furthermore,
we found that the induced superconducting layers exhibit an anisotropic
magnetization behavior, in consistent with the formation of the large-scale
superconducting coherence. This unusually extended proximity effect suggests
that disorder-induced interaction and coupling of Andreev bound states, which
are coherent superposition of time reversed electron hole pairs, is realized in
the nanocomposite. Thus, the present results not only expand the limit of the
proximity effect to bulk scales, but also provides a new route to obtain a

estimates the camera's pose relative to the navigation system. The approach
involves imaging and manually labelling a calibration pattern with distinctly
identifiable points, triangulating these points from camera and navigation
system data and reprojecting them in order to compute a likelihood, which is
maximised to estimate the 6D camera pose. Additionally, a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to estimate the uncertainty of the offset.
Tested on two different platforms, the method was able to estimate the pose to
within 0.06 m / 1.05$^{\circ}$ and 0.18 m / 2.39$^{\circ}$. We also propose
several approaches to displaying and interpreting the 6D results in a human
readable way.

decompositions for superprocesses whose underlying processes are general
symmetric Hunt processes. Second, we use these decompositions to obtain weak
and strong law of large numbers for supercritical superprocesses where the
spatial motion is a symmetric Hunt process on a locally compact metric space
$E$ and the branching mechanism takes the form
$$\psi_{\beta}(x,\lambda)=-\beta(x)\lambda+\alpha(x)\lambda^{2}+\int_{(0,{\infty})}(e^{-\lambda

that an associated Schr\""{o}dinger operator has a spectral gap. Our results
cover many interesting examples of superprocesses, including super
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and super stable-like process. The strong law of
large numbers for supercritical superprocesses are obtained under the
assumption that the strong law of large numbers for an associated supercritical
branching Markov process holds along a discrete sequence of times, extending an
earlier result of Eckhoff, Kyprianou and Winkel [Ann. Probab.,43(5),
2594--2659, 2015] for superdiffusions to a large class of superprocesses. The
key for such a result is due to the skeleton decomposition of superprocess,
which represents a superprocess as an immigration process along a supercritical
branching Markov process.

Neural network models of autoassociative, distributed memory
allow storage and retrieval of many items (vectors) where the number of stored
items can exceed the vector dimension (the number of neurons in the network).
This opens the possibility of a sublinear time search (in the number of stored
items) for approximate nearest neighbors among vectors of high dimension. The
purpose of this paper is to review models of autoassociative, distributed
memory that can be naturally implemented by neural networks (mainly with local
learning rules and iterative dynamics based on information locally available to
neurons). Scope. The survey is focused mainly on the networks of Hopfield,
Willshaw and Potts, that have connections between pairs of neurons and operate
on sparse binary vectors. We discuss not only autoassociative memory, but also
the generalization properties of these networks. We also consider neural
networks with higher-order connections and networks with a bipartite graph
structure for non-binary data with linear constraints. Conclusions. In
conclusion we discuss the relations to similarity search, advantages and
drawbacks of these techniques, and topics for further research. An interesting
and still not completely resolved question is whether neural autoassociative
memories can search for approximate nearest neighbors faster than other index
structures for similarity search, in particular for the case of very high
dimensional vectors.

scatter of half light radii Re70 for both populations, but a typical Re70 <~ 1
kpc for the BAT hosts that is only half that of comparison galaxies of same
far-infrared luminosity. The result mostly reflects a more compact distribution
of star formation (and hence gas) in the AGN hosts, but compact AGN heated dust
may contribute in some extremely AGN-dominated systems. Our findings are in
support of an AGN-host coevolution where accretion onto the central black hole
and star formation are fed from the same gas reservoir, with more efficient
black hole feeding if that reservoir is more concentrated. The significant
scatter in the far-infrared sizes emphasizes that we are mostly probing spatial
scales much larger than those of actual accretion, and that rapid accretion
variations can smear the distinction between the AGN and comparison categories.
Large samples are hence needed to detect structural differences that favour
feeding of the black hole. No size difference AGN host vs. comparison galaxies
is observed at higher far-infrared luminosities log(LFIR)>10.5 (star formation

discovered with Kepler K2. Our successful observation strategy was carefully
tailored to mitigate the effect of stellar variability. We modelled the new
radial velocity data together with the K2 transit photometry and a new
ground-based partial transit of HD 106315c to derive system parameters. We
estimate the mass of HD 106315b to be 12.6 $\pm$ 3.2 $M_{\oplus}$ and the
density to be $4.7 \pm 1.7\, g\,cm^{-3}$, while for HD 106315c we estimate a
mass of 15.2 $\pm$ 3.7 $M_{\oplus}$ and a density of $1.01 \pm 0.29\,
$g\,cm$^{-3}$. Hence, despite planet c having a radius almost twice as large as
planet b, their masses are consistent with one another. We conclude that HD
106315c has a thick hydrogen-helium gaseous envelope. A detailed investigation
of HD 106315b using a planetary interior model constrains the core mass
fraction to be 5-29\%, and the water mass fraction to be 10-50\%. An
alternative, not considered by our model, is that HD 106315b is composed of a
large rocky core with a thick H-He envelope. Transmission spectroscopy of these
planets will give insight into their atmospheric compositions and also help
constrain their core compositions.

results on linear block codes, namely Hamming bound and Varshamov bound. We
also study the impact of the decoding method used at GC nodes. To incorporate
both bounded-distance (BD) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding at GC nodes
into our analysis without resorting on multi-edge type of degree distributions
(DDs), we propose the probabilistic peeling decoding (P-PD) algorithm, which
models the decoding step at every GC node as an instance of a Bernoulli random

over the BEC can be efficiently predicted using standard techniques for LDPC
codes such as density evolution (DE) or the differential equation method.
Furthermore, for a class of GLDPC ensembles, we demonstrate that the simulated
P-PD performance accurately predicts the actual performance of the GLPDC code
under ML decoding at GC nodes. We illustrate our analysis for GLDPC code
ensembles with regular and irregular DDs. In all cases, we show that a large
fraction of GC nodes is required to reduce the original gap to capacity, but
the optimal fraction is strictly smaller than one. We then consider techniques
to further reduce the gap to capacity by means of random puncturing, and the
inclusion of a certain fraction of generalized variable nodes in the graph.

pushed the research effort in Android malware analysis in the last years. An
important task of malware analysis is the classification of malware samples
into known families. Static malware analysis is known to fall short against
techniques that change static characteristics of the malware (e.g. code
obfuscation), while dynamic analysis has proven effective against such
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, the most notable work on Android
malware family classification purely based on dynamic analysis is DroidScribe.
With respect to DroidScribe, our approach is easier to reproduce. Our
methodology only employs publicly available tools, does not require any
modification to the emulated environment or Android OS, and can collect data
from physical devices. The latter is a key factor, since modern mobile malware
can detect the emulated environment and hide their malicious behavior. Our
approach relies on resource consumption metrics available from the proc file
system. Features are extracted through detrended fluctuation analysis and
correlation. Finally, a SVM is employed to classify malware into families. We
provide an experimental evaluation on malware samples from the Drebin dataset,
where we obtain a classification accuracy of 82%, proving that our methodology
achieves an accuracy comparable to that of DroidScribe. Furthermore, we make
the software we developed publicly available, to ease the reproducibility of
our results.

In each cycle, a robot takes a snapshot of the current configuration of the

generation low radio frequency instruments such as the Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA) have opened up opportunities for using novel techniques for
characterizing the nature of solar emission at these frequencies. Here we use
this opportunity to look for evidence for the presence of weak non-thermal
emissions in the 100-240 MHz band, at levels weaker than have usually been
probed. The presence of such features is believed to be a necessary consequence
of nanoflare-based coronal and chromospheric heating theories. We separate the
calibrated MWA solar dynamic spectra into a slowly varying and an impulsive,
and hence non-thermal, component. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixtures
modeling can be used to robustly model the latter and we estimate the flux
density distribution as well as the prevalence of impulsive non-thermal
emission in the frequency-time plane. Evidence for presence of non-thermal
emission at levels down to $\sim$0.2 SFU (1 SFU = 10$^4$ Jy) is reported,
making them the weakest reported emissions of this nature. Our work shows the
fractional occupancy of the non-thermal impulsive emission to lie in the
17--45\% range during a period of medium solar activity. We also find that the
flux density radiated in the impulsive non-thermal emission is very similar in
strength to that of the slowly varying component, dominated by the thermal
bremsstrahlung. Such significant prevalence and strength of the weak impulsive
non-thermal emission has not been appreciated earlier.

is said to be connected when its two end discs overlap with each other.
Depending on the difference of the phase angles of these discs a bond may be
termed as dead or live. While a dead bond can never be connected, a live bond
is connected at least once in a complete time period. Two different time scales
can be associated with such a system, leading to two transition points. Namely,
a percolation transition occurs at $R_{0c} =0.908$ when a spanning cluster of
connected bonds emerges in the system. Here, information propagates across the
system instantly, i.e., with infinite speed. Secondly, there exists another
transition point $R_0^* = 0.5907$ where the giant cluster of live bonds spans
the lattice. In this case the information takes finite time to propagate across
the system through the dynamical evolution of finite size clusters. This
passage time diverges as $R_0 \to R_0^*$ from above. Both the transitions
exhibit the critical behavior of ordinary percolation transition. The entire
scenario is robust with respect to the distribution of frequencies of the
individual discs. This study may be relevant in the context of wireless sensor

and systems biology. To get insights into these matters, we analyzed chemical
reaction networks with different topologies and degrees of complexity,

fluctuations at the steady state, as measured by the sum of the Fano factors of
the number of molecules of all species, is directly related to the topology of
the network. For systems with zero deficiency, this sum is constant and equal
to the rank of the network. For higher deficiencies, we observed an increase or
decrease of the fluctuation levels according to the values of the reaction
fluxes that link internal species, multiplied by the associated stoichiometry.
We showed that the noise is reduced when the fluxes all flow towards the
species of higher complexity, whereas it is amplified when the fluxes are

properties for halos at the low mass end of the mass function, it is
interesting to examine if there are differences in how these low mass halos are
accreted. The accretion events are defined as the moment a halo becomes a
substructure, namely when it crosses its host's virial radius. We quantify the
cosmic web at each point by the shear tensor and examine where, with respect to
its eigenvectors, such accretion events occur in cold ($\Lambda$CDM) and warm
(1keV sterile neutrino WDM) dark matter cosmological models. We find that the
CDM and WDM subhalos are preferentially accreted along the principal axis of
the shear tensor corresponding to the direction of weakest collapse. The
beaming strength is modulated by the host and subhalo masses and by the
redshift at which the accretion event occurs. Although strongest for the most
massive hosts and subhalos at high redshift, the preferential infall is found
to be always aligned with the axis of weakest collapse, thus we say that it has
universal nature. We compare the strength of beaming in the WDM cosmology with
the one found in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. While the main findings remain the
same, the accretion in the WDM model for the most massive host halos appears
more beamed than in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology across all the redshifts.

based on Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions that allows us to properly take into

two-dimensional spectral submanifolds (SSMs) in autonomous nonlinear mechanical

nonlinear continuations of modal subspaces of the linearized system, are
constructed up to arbitrary orders of accuracy, using the parameterization
method. An advantage of this approach is that the construction of the SSMs does
not break down when the SSM folds over its underlying spectral subspace. A
further advantage is an automated a posteriori error estimation feature that
enables a systematic increase in the orders of the SSM computation until the
required accuracy is reached. We find that the present algorithm provides a
major speed-up, relative to numerical continuation methods, in the computation
of backbone curves, especially in higher-dimensional problems. We illustrate
the accuracy and speed of the automated SSM algorithm on lower- and

density absorbers. We find no dependence of the DLA bias on column density or
redshift. The measured bias value corresponds to a host halo mass $\sim

With this design, the IAN model can well represent a target and its collocative

passive eavesdropper is studied under receiver energy harvesting constraints.
To stay operational in the network, the legitimate receivers demand energy
alongside information, which is fulfilled by power transmission and exploiting
a power splitting (PS) receiver. By simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT), the amount of leakage to the eavesdropper increases, which in
turn reduces the secrecy rates. For this setup, lower-bounds for secure
communication rate are derived without imposing any limitation at the
eavesdropper processing. These lower-bounds are then compared with the rates
achieved by assuming the worst-case linear eavesdropper processing. We show
that in certain special cases the worst-case eavesdropper does not enlarge the
achievable secure rate region in comparison to the unconstrained eavesdropper
case. It turns out that in order to achieve the Pareto boundary of the secrecy
rate region, smart tuning of the transmit power and receiver PS coefficient is
required. Hence, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize these parameters
jointly in polynomial-time. The secrecy rate region characterization is
formulated as a weighted max-min optimization problem. This problem turns out
to be a non-convex problem due to the non-convex constrained set. This set is
replaced by a convex subset that in consequence leads to an achievable
suboptimal solution which is improved iteratively. By solving the problem
efficiently, we obtain the amount of rate loss for providing secrecy, meanwhile
satisfying the energy demands.

transverse magnetoresistances are measured by rotating the sample in magnetic
fields up to 11 T, along three orthogonal planes (xy-, yz- and xz-rotation
planes, where the z-axis is orthogonal to the sample plane). The total
magnetoresistance has contributions arising from both the SMR and ordinary
magnetoresistance. The onset of the SMR signal occurs between 1 and 3 T and no
saturation is visible up to 11 T. The three-dimensional angular dependence of
the SMR can be explained by a model considering the reversible field-induced
redistribution of magnetostrictive antiferromagnetic S- and T-domains in the
NiO(001), stemming from the competition between the Zeeman energy and the
elastic clamping effect of the non-magnetic MgO substrate. From the observed
SMR ratio, we estimate the spin mixing conductance at the NiO/Pt interface to
be greater than $2\times10^{14}$ ${\Omega}^{-1}$ $m^{-2}$. Our results

deterministic outcomes simultaneously -- is a well known property of quantum
mechanics. This feature can be utilized in many contexts, ranging from Bell
inequalities to device dependent QKD protocols. Typically, in these
applications the measurements are chosen from a predetermined set based on a
classical random variable. One can naturally ask, whether the non-determinism
of the outcomes is due to intrinsic hiding property of quantum mechanics, or
rather by the fact that classical, incoherent information entered the system
via the choice of the measurement. Authors of [NJP 19, 023038 (2017)] examined
this question for a specific case of two mutually unbiased measurements on
systems of different dimensions. They have somewhat surprisingly shown that in
case of qubits, if the measurements are chosen coherently with the use of a
controlled unitary, outcomes of both measurements can be guessed
deterministically. Here we extend their analysis and show that specifically for
qubits, measurement result for any set of measurements with any a-priori
probability distribution can be faithfully guessed by a suitable state
preparation and measurement. We also show that up to a small set of specific
cases, this is not possible for higher dimensions. This result manifests a deep
difference in properties of qubits and higher dimensional systems and suggests
that these systems might offer higher security in specific cryptographic
protocols. More fundamentally, the results show that the impossibility of
predicting a result of a measurement is not caused solely by a loss of
coherence between the choice of the measurement and the guessing procedure.

makes the motivic story more complicated and still not well understood. For
example, classically the $p$-local sphere spectrum $S^0_{(p)} $ admits an
essentially unique non-nilpotent self-map, which is not the case motivically,
since Morel showed that the first Hopf map $\eta \colon S^{1,1} \to S^{0,0}$ is
non-nilpotent. In the same way that the non-nilpotent self-map $2 = v_0 \in
\pi_{\ast,\ast}(S^{0,0})$ starts the usual chromatic story of
$v_n$-periodicity, there is a similar theory starting with the non-nilpotent
element $\eta \in \pi_{\ast,\ast}(S^{0,0})$, which Andrews-Miller denoted by
$\eta = w_0$. In this paper we investigate the beginning of the motivic story
of $w_n$-periodicity when the base scheme is $\mathbf{Spec} \! \ \mathbb{C}$.
In particular, we construct motivic fields $K(w_n)$ designed to detect such
$w_n$-periodic phenomena, in the same way that $K(n)$ detects $v_n$-periodic
phenomena. In the hope of detecting motivic nilpotence, we also construct a
more global motivic spectrum $wBP$ with homotopy groups $\pi_{\ast,\ast}(wBP)

The
effect of binarity on stellar evolution is poorly constrained. In particular,
the role of tides and mass transfer on surface chemical abundances is not
constrained observationally. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect
of binarity on the stellar properties and surface abundances of massive
binaries. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of six Galactic massive binaries.
The spectra of individual components are obtained from a spectral disentangling
method and are subsequently analyzed by means of atmosphere models. The stellar
parameters and CNO surface abundances are determined. Most systems are made of
main-sequence stars. Three systems are detached, two are in contact and no
information is available for the sixth system. For eleven out of the twelve
stars studied the surface abundances are only mildly affected by stellar
evolution and mixing. They are not different from those of single stars, within
the uncertainties. The secondary of XZ~Cep is strongly chemically enriched.
Considering previous determinations of surface abundance in massive binary
systems suggests that the effect of tides on chemical mixing is limited,
whereas mass transfer and removal of outer layers of the mass donor leads to
the appearance of chemically processed material at the surface, although this
is not systematic. The evolutionary masses of the components of our six systems
are on average 16.5% higher than the dynamical masses. Some systems seem to
have reached synchronization, while others may still be in a transitory phase.

Coulomb interaction that manifests in tightly bound excitons. Due to the
complex electronic band structure exhibiting several spin-split valleys in the

inaccessibly by light due to the required spin-flip and/or momentum transfer.
The relative position of these dark states with respect to the optically
accessible bright excitons has a crucial impact on the emission efficiency of
these materials and thus on their technological potential. Based on the
solution of the Wannier equation, we present the excitonic landscape of the
most studied TMD materials including the spectral position of momentum- and
spin-forbidden excitonic states. We show that the knowledge of the electronic
dispersion does not allow to conclude about the nature of the material's band
gap, since excitonic effects can give rise to significant changes. Furthermore,
we reveal that an exponentially reduced photoluminescence yield does not

large-scale database of embeddings from the Portuguese Twitter stream. We start
by experimenting with a relatively small sample and focusing on three
challenges: volume of training data, vocabulary size and intrinsic evaluation
metrics. Using a single GPU, we were able to scale up vocabulary size from 2048
words embedded and 500K training examples to 32768 words over 10M training
examples while keeping a stable validation loss and approximately linear trend
on training time per epoch. We also observed that using less than 50\% of the
available training examples for each vocabulary size might result in
overfitting. Results on intrinsic evaluation show promising performance for a
vocabulary size of 32768 words. Nevertheless, intrinsic evaluation metrics
suffer from over-sensitivity to their corresponding cosine similarity
thresholds, indicating that a wider range of metrics need to be developed to
track progress.

chains is a longstanding open problem and has been solved so far only in a
certain asymptotic regime, namely by Friesecke and Pego for the KdV limit, in
which the waves propagate with near sonic speed, have large wave length, and
carry low energy. In this paper we derive a similar result in a complementary
asymptotic regime related to fast and strongly localized waves with high
energy. In particular, we show that the spectrum of the linearized FPUT
operator contains asymptotically no unstable eigenvalues except for the neutral
ones that stem from the shift symmetry and the spatial discreteness. This
ensures that high-energy waves are linearly stable in some orbital sense, and
the corresponding nonlinear stability is granted by the general, non-asymptotic
part of the seminal Friesecke-Pego result and the extension by Mizumachi.
  Our analytical work splits into two principal parts. First we refine
two-scale techniques that relate high-energy wave to a nonlinear asymptotic
shape ODE and provide accurate approximation formulas. In this way we establish
the existence, local uniqueness, smooth parameter dependence, and exponential
localization of fast lattice waves for a wide class of interaction potentials
with algebraic singularity. Afterwards we study the crucial eigenvalue problem
in exponentially weighted spaces, so that there is no unstable essential
spectrum. Our key argument is that all proper eigenfunctions can asymptotically
be linked to the unique bounded and normalized solution of the linearized shape
ODE, and this finally enables us to disprove the existence of unstable
eigenfunctions in the symplectic complement of the neutral ones.

out that an essential difference is that as well as involving physical
causation, causation in biological systems has a logical nature at each level
of the hierarchy of emergence, from the biomolecular level up. The key link
between physics and life enabling this to happen is provided by biomolecules,
such as voltage gated ion channels, which enable branching logic to emerge from
the underlying physics and hence enable logically based cell processes to take
place in general, and in neurons in particular. These molecules can only have
come into being via the contextually dependent processes of natural selection,
which selects them for their biological function. A further major difference is
between life in general and intelligent life. We characterise intelligent
organisms as being engaged in deductive causation, which enables them to
transcend the physical limitations of their bodies through the power of
abstract thought, prediction, and planning. Ultimately this is enabled by the
biomolecules that underlie the propagation of action potentials in neuronal
axons in the brain.

problems. Computational challenges exist when trying to invert large linear
systems, where limited computing resources mean that only part of the system
can be kept in computer memory at any one time. We are here motivated by
tomographic inversion problems that often lead to linear inverse problems. In
state of the art x-ray systems, even a standard scan can produce 4 million
individual measurements and the reconstruction of x-ray attenuation profiles
typically requires the estimation of a million attenuation coefficients. To
deal with the large data sets encountered in real applications and to utilise
modern graphics processing unit (GPU) based computing architectures,
combinations of iterative reconstruction algorithms and parallel computing
schemes are increasingly applied. Although both row and column action methods
have been proposed to utilise parallel computing architectures, individual
computations in current methods need to know either the entire set of
observations or the entire set of estimated x-ray absorptions, which can be
prohibitive in many realistic big data applications. We present a fully
parallelizable computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction algorithm that
works with arbitrary partial subsets of the data and the reconstructed volume.
We further develop a non-homogeneously randomised selection criteria which
guarantees that sub-matrices of the system matrix are selected more frequently
if they are dense, thus maximising information flow through the algorithm. A
grouped version of the algorithm is also proposed to further improve
convergence speed and performance. Algorithm performance is verified
experimentally.

probability on the successful content delivery (SCD), and present the minimum
required base station density for avoiding the access overload in an arbitrary
small cell and backhaul overload in an arbitrary macrocell. The massive MIMO
backhaul achievable rate without downlink channel estimation is derived to
calculate the backhaul time, and the latency is also evaluated in such
networks. The analytical results confirm that hit probability needs to be
appropriately selected, in order to achieve SCD. The interplay between cache
size and SCD is explicitly quantified. It is theoretically demonstrated that
when non-cached contents are requested, the average delay of the non-cached
content delivery could be comparable to the cached content delivery with the
help of massive MIMO aided self-backhaul, if the average access rate of cached
content delivery is lower than that of self-backhauled content delivery.

photometry from INTEGRAL/OMC and ASAS. We also used X-ray observations from
INTEGRAL/JEM-X, and IBIS to generate the light curves and combined them with
Swift/XRT to extract the X-ray spectra. In addition, we have compiled archival
observations and measurements from the literature to complement these data.
Comparing the evolution of the optical continuum emission with the Halpha line
variability, we have identified three different patterns of optical
variability: Global increases and decreases of the optical brightness (observed
from 1982 to 1994 and from 2009 to 2017) that can be explained by the
dissipation and replenishment of the circumstellar disc, superorbital
variations with a period of Psuperorb~590 days (observed in 2002-2009) which
seems to be related with the circumstellar disc, and optical outbursts
(observed in 1998-1999 and 2002-2005) that we interpret as mass ejections. We
have discovered the presence of a retrograde one-armed density wave, which
appeared in 2016 and is still present in the circumstellar disc. We have

show an increase of DIB EW with increasing AV. However, the rate of increase is
much flatter than expected from the EW-AV quasi-proportionality established for
this DIB in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. Based on a simplified

respectively their greatest lower bound and least upper bound when the terms
are quasi-ordered by subsumption up to variable renaming (i.e., $t_1\preceq
t_2$ iff $t_1 = t_2\sigma$ for some variable substitution $\sigma$). When term
signatures are such that distinct functor symbols may be related with a fuzzy
equivalence (called a similarity), these operations can be formally extended to
tolerate mismatches on functor names and/or arity or argument order. We
reformulate and extend previous work with a declarative approach defining
unification and generalization as sets of axioms and rules forming a complete
constraint-normalization proof system. These include the Reynolds-Plotkin
term-generalization procedures, Maria Sessa's ""weak"" unification with partially
fuzzy signatures and its corresponding generalization, as well as novel
extensions of such operations to fully fuzzy signatures (i.e., similar functors
with possibly different arities). One advantage of this approach is that it
requires no modification of the conventional data structures for terms and
substitutions. This and the fact that these declarative specifications are
efficiently executable conditional Horn-clauses offers great practical
potential for fuzzy information-handling applications.

embedded layers of high permeability in a matrix of lower permeability using a
basic model of Darcy flow in embedded cracks. The cracks are allowed to cut
through the mesh in arbitrary fashion and we take the flow in the crack into
account by superposition. The fact that we use continuous elements leads to
suboptimal convergence due to the loss of regularity across the crack. We
therefore refine the mesh in the vicinity of the crack in order to recover
optimal order convergence in terms of the global mesh parameter. The proper
degree of refinement is determined based on an a priori error estimate and can
thus be performed before the actual finite element computation is started.
Numerical examples showing this effect and confirming the theoretical results
are provided. The approach is easy to implement and beneficial for rapid
assessment of the effect of crack orientation and may for example be used in an
optimization loop.

reproduction number $R_0$, which is the expected number of secondary cases a
typical infected primary case infects during its infectious period in a large
mostly susceptible population. In order for this quantity to be meaningful, the
initial expected growth of the number of infectious individuals in the
large-population limit should be exponential.
  We investigate to what extent this assumption is valid by performing repeated
simulations of epidemics on selected empirical networks, viewing each epidemic
as a random process in discrete time. The initial phase of each epidemic is
analyzed by fitting the number of infected people at each time step to a
generalised growth model, allowing for estimating the shape of the growth. For
reference, similar investigations are done on some elementary graphs such as
integer lattices in different dimensions and configuration model graphs, for
which the early epidemic behaviour is known.
  We find that for the empirical networks tested in this paper, exponential
growth characterizes the early stages of the epidemic, except when the network
is restricted by a strong low-dimensional spacial constraint, such as is the
case for the two-dimensional square lattice. However, on finite integer
lattices of sufficiently high dimension, the early development of epidemics
shows exponential growth.

general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles
and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other
large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in
the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added
and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to
account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.
Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself
to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with
continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these
complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an
hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This
initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'

production rates were calculated from each of the 885 images using our standard
time-resolved model that accounts for the whole water photodissociation chain,
exothermic velocities and collisional escape of H atoms. For most of these
comets there were enough observations over a broad enough range of heliocentric
distances to calculate power-law fits to the variation of production rate with
heliocentric distances for pre- and post-perihelion portions of the orbits.
Comet C/2014 Q1 (PanSTARRS), with a perihelion distance of only ~0.3 AU, showed
the most unusual variation of water production rate with heliocentric distance
and the resulting active area variation, indicating that when the comet was
within 0.7 AU its activity was dominated by the continuous release of icy
grains and chunks, greatly increasing the active sublimation area by more than

imaged in the Atlantis Chaos region on Mars by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer
on March 2nd 2005. We use the radiative transfer model MITRA to study the dust
properties at solar wavelengths between 0.5 {\mu}m and 2.5 {\mu}m and infer the
connection between the local storm dynamics and the topography. We retrieve
maps of effective grain radius (reff), optical depth at 9.3 {\mu}m ({\tau}9.3)
and top altitude (ta) of the dust layer. Our results show that large particles
(reff = 1.6 {\mu}m) are gathered in the centre of the storm (lat=33.5{\deg} S;
lon=183.5 W{\deg}), where the optical depth is maximum ({\tau}9.3 > 7.0) and
the top altitude exceeds 18 km. Outside the storm, we obtain {\tau}9.3 < 0.2,
in agreement with the estimates derived from global climate models (GCM). We
speculate that a low thermal inertia region at the western border of Atlantis
Chaos is a possible source of the dust storm. Moreover, we find evidence that
topography plays a role in confining the local storm in Atlantis Chaos. The
vertical wind component from the GCM does not provide any hint for the
triggering of dust lifting. On the other hand, the combination of the
horizontal and vertical wind profiles suggests that the dust, once lifted, is
pushed eastward and then downward and gets confined within the north-east ridge
of Atlantis Chaos. (continues in article)

$F$-central division algebra of odd index and let $\theta$ be the Galois
involution attached to $E/F$. Set $H=GL(m,D)$, $G=GL(m,D\otimes_F E)$, and let
$P=MU$ be a standard parabolic subgroup of $G$. Let $w$ be a Weyl involution
stabilizing $M$ and $M^{\theta_w}$ be the subgroup of $M$ fixed by the
involution $\theta_w:m\mapsto \theta(wmw)$. We denote by $X(M)^{w,-}$ the
complex torus of $w$-anti-invariant unramified characters of $M$. Following the
global methods of Jacquet, Lapid and Rogawski, we associate to a finite length
representation $\sigma$ of $M$ and to a linear form $L\in
Hom_{M^{\theta_w}}(\sigma,\mathbb{C})$ a family of $H$-invariant linear forms
called intertwining periods on $Ind_P^G(\chi \sigma)$ for $\chi \in
X(M)^{w,-}$, which is meromorphic in the variable $\chi$. Then we give
sufficient conditions for some of these intertwining periods, namely the open
intertwining periods studied by Blanc and Delorme, to have singularities. By a
local/global method, we also compute in terms of Asai gamma factors the
proportionality constants involved in their functional equations with respect
to certain intertwining operators. As a consequence, we classify distinguished
unitary and ladder representations of $G$, extending respectively results the
author and Gurevich for $D=F$, which both relied at some crucial step on the
theory of Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives. We make use of one of a recent
result of Beuzart-Plessis which in the case of the group $G$ asserts that the
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence preserves distinction. Such a result is for
essentially square-integrable representations, but our method in fact allows us
to use it only for cuspidal representations of $G$.

a promising approach for boosting the capacity of wireless local area networks
(WLANs). If properly integrated into legacy IEEE 802.11 standards, mmW
communications can offer substantial gains by offloading traffic from congested
sub-6 GHz unlicensed bands to the 60 GHz mmW frequency band. In this paper, a
novel medium access control (MAC) is proposed to dynamically manage the WLAN
traffic over the unlicensed mmW and sub-6 GHz bands. The proposed protocol
leverages the capability of advanced multi-band wireless stations (STAs) to
perform fast session transfers (FST) to the mmW band, while considering the
intermittent channel at the 60 GHz band and the level of congestion observed
over the sub-6 GHz bands. The performance of the proposed scheme is
analytically studied via a new Markov chain model and the probability of
transmissions over the mmW and sub-6 GHz bands, as well as the aggregated
saturation throughput are derived. In addition, analytical results are
validated by simulation results. Simulation results show that the proposed
integrated mmW-sub 6 GHz MAC protocol yields significant performance gains, in
terms of maximizing the saturation throughput and minimizing the delay
experienced by the STAs. The results also shed light on the tradeoffs between
the achievable gains and the overhead introduced by the FST procedure.

particular, we cross-correlate the weak lensing (WL) source galaxies from the
Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) sample with redMaGiC galaxies (luminous red
galaxies with secure photometric redshifts) to estimate the redshift
distribution of the former sample. The recovered redshift distributions are
used to calibrate the photometric redshift bias of standard photo-$z$ methods
applied to the same source galaxy sample. We apply the method to three
photo-$z$ codes run in our simulated data: Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ),
Directional Neighborhood Fitting (DNF), and Random Forest-based photo-$z$ (RF).
We characterize the systematic uncertainties of our calibration procedure, and
find that these systematic uncertainties dominate our error budget. The
dominant systematics are due to our assumption of unevolving bias and
clustering across each redshift bin, and to differences between the shapes of
the redshift distributions derived by clustering vs photo-$z$'s. The systematic
uncertainty in the mean redshift bias of the source galaxy sample is $\Delta z
\lesssim 0.02$, though the precise value depends on the redshift bin under
consideration. We discuss possible ways to mitigate the impact of our dominant
systematics in future analyses.

take into account the con- straints at each task step are critical, since they
allow to both (1) Identify grasps that likely require simple arm motions
through the whole task and (2) To discard grasps that, although feasible to
achieve at earlier steps, might not be executable at later stages due to goal
task constraints. In this paper, we study how to use our previously proposed
manipulation metric for tasks in which 2 steps are required (pick-and-place and
pouring tasks). Even for such simple tasks, it was not clear how to use the
results of applying our metric (or any metric for that matter) to rank all the
candidate grasps: Should only the start state be considered, or only the goal,
or a combination of both? In order to find an answer, we evaluated the (best)
grasps selected by our metric under each of these 3 considerations. Our main
conclusion was that for tasks in which the goal state is more constrained
(pick-and-place), using a combination of the metric measured at the start and
goal states renders better performance when compared with choosing any other
candidate grasp, whereas in tasks in which the goal constraints are less
rigidly defined, the metric measured at the start state should be mainly
considered. We present quantitative results in simulation and validate our
approach's practicality with experimental results in our physical robot

interest in the time discretization of evolution equations. The methods were
originally devised for the numerical solution of stiff differential equations.
Meanwhile, they constitute a well-established class of exponential integrators.
The popularity of Lawson methods is in some contrast to the fact that they may
have a bad convergence behaviour, since they do not satisfy any of the stiff
order conditions. The aim of this paper is to explain this discrepancy. It is
shown that non-stiff order conditions together with appropriate regularity
assumptions imply high-order convergence of Lawson methods. Note, however, that
the term regularity here includes the behaviour of the solution at the
boundary. For instance, Lawson methods will behave well in the case of periodic
boundary conditions, but they will show a dramatic order reduction for, e.g.,
Dirichlet boundary conditions. The precise regularity assumptions required for
high-order convergence are worked out in this paper and related to the
corresponding assumptions for splitting schemes. In contrast to previous work,
the analysis is based on expansions of the exact and the numerical solution
along the flow of the homogeneous problem. Numerical examples for the

is wasteful and typically requires the number of particles to grow

implicit models - those from which we can sample, but can not evaluate their
density. These models apply some parametric function, such as a deep network,
to a base measure, and are learned end-to-end using stochastic optimization.
One strategy of devising a loss function is through the statistics of two
sample tests - if we can fool a statistical test, the learned distribution
should be a good model of the true data. However, not all tests can easily fit
into this framework, as they might not be differentiable with respect to the
data points, and hence with respect to the parameters of the implicit model.
Motivated by this problem, in this paper we show how two such classical tests,
the Friedman-Rafsky and k-nearest neighbour tests, can be effectively smoothed
using ideas from undirected graphical models - the matrix tree theorem and
cardinality potentials. Moreover, as we show experimentally, smoothing can
significantly increase the power of the test, which might of of independent
interest. Finally, we apply our method to learn implicit models.

MPs based on an intrinsically wide color spread on the RGB, in particular due
to a relatively small fraction of stars significantly bluer than the main RGB
locus. These stars should correspond to so-called first generation stars, which
we estimate to be roughly 15\% of the total. However, we find these

temperature, charge neutral, in beta-equilibrium, and populated by the baryon
octet, electrons, and muons. In order to study the effects of different degrees
of stiffness in the equation of state, we explore the parameter space of the

maintain connectivity of vertices occupied by its own agents in a visibility

  arXiv:1701.05125",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most promising approaches to overcome the uncertainty and dynamic
channel variations of millimeter wave (mmW) communications is to deploy
dual-mode base stations that integrate both mmW and microwave ($\mu$W)
frequencies. In particular, if properly designed, such dual-mode base stations
can enhance mobility and handover in highly mobile wireless environments. In
this paper, a novel approach for analyzing and managing mobility in joint
$\mu$W-mmW networks is proposed. The proposed approach leverages device-level
caching along with the capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize
handover failures and provide seamless mobility. First, fundamental results on
the caching capabilities, including caching probability and cache duration, are
derived for the proposed dual-mode network scenario. Second, the average
achievable rate of caching is derived for mobile users. Then, the impact of
caching on the number of handovers (HOs) and the average handover failure (HOF)
is analyzed. The derived analytical results suggest that content caching will
reduce the HOF and enhance the mobility management in heterogeneous wireless
networks with mmW capabilities. Numerical results corroborate the analytical
derivations and show that the proposed solution provides significant reductions
in the average HOF, reaching up to 45%, for mobile users moving with relatively
high speeds.

evolutionary models of individual tumours from genome sequencing data. Most
methods can analyze multiple samples collected either through bulk multi-region
sequencing experiments or the sequencing of individual cancer cells. However,
rarely the same method can support both data types.
  Results. We introduce TRaIT, a computational framework to infer mutational
graphs that model the accumulation of multiple types of somatic alterations
driving tumour evolution. Compared to other tools, TRaIT supports multi-region
and single-cell sequencing data within the same statistical framework, and
delivers expressive models that capture many complex evolutionary phenomena.
TRaIT improves accuracy, robustness to data-specific errors and computational
complexity compared to competing methods.
  Conclusions. We show that the application of TRaIT to single-cell and
multi-region cancer datasets can produce accurate and reliable models of
single-tumour evolution, quantify the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity and
generate new testable experimental hypotheses.

distance depends not only on the solar wind dynamic pressure and the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), both of which play a crucial role in
determining it's shape, but also on the nature of the processes involved in the
interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The stand-off
distance of the earth's MP and bow shock (BS) also define the extent of
terrestrial magnetic fields into near-earth space on the sunward side and have
important consequences for space weather. However, asymmetries due to the
direction of the IMF are hard to account for, making it nearly impossible to
favour any specific model over the other in estimating the extent of the MP or
BS. Thus, both numerical and empirical models have been used and compared to
estimate the BS and MP stand-off distances as well as the MP shape, in the
period Jan. 1975-Dec. 2016, covering solar cycles 21-24. The computed MP and BS
stand-off distances have been found to be increasing steadily over the past two
decades, since ~1995, spanning solar cycles 23 and 24. The increasing trend is
consistent with earlier reported studies of a long term and steady decline in
solar polar magnetic fields and solar wind micro-turbulence levels. The present
study, thus, highlights the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to the
long term global changes in both solar and solar wind activity, through a
detailed study of the extent and shape of the terrestrial MP and BS over the

selective laser melting (SLM) is arguably the most versatile in terms of its

However, the complexity of the SLM process, and the need for predictive
relation of powder and process parameters to the part properties, demands
further development of computational and experimental methods. This review
addresses the fundamental physical phenomena of SLM, with a special emphasis on
the associated thermal behavior. Simulation and experimental methods are
discussed according to three primary categories. First, macroscopic approaches
aim to answer questions at the component level and consider for example the
determination of residual stresses or dimensional distortion effects prevalent
in SLM. Second, mesoscopic approaches focus on the detection of defects such as
excessive surface roughness, residual porosity or inclusions that occur at the
mesoscopic length scale of individual powder particles. Third, microscopic
approaches investigate the metallurgical microstructure evolution resulting
from the high temperature gradients and extreme heating and cooling rates
induced by the SLM process. Consideration of physical phenomena on all of these
three length scales is mandatory to establish the understanding needed to
realize high part quality in many applications, and to fully exploit the
potential of SLM and related metal AM processes.

revolve around two fundamental but incorrect doctrines: (1) the doctrine of
stagnation (inappropriately labelled also as Malthusian stagnation, because
Malthus never claimed that his positive checks would cause a long-lasting and
wide-spread stagnation) and (2) the doctrine of explosion described also as a
takeoff, sprint, spike or by other similar attributes. These doctrines and
other related postulates are contradicted even by precisely the same data,
which are used in the economic research and by the research results published
in a prestigious scientific journal as early as in 1960. The generally accepted
explanations are not based on a rigorous analysis of data but on impressions
created by the easily misleading features of hyperbolic distributions. Two
leading theories: the Demographic Transitions Theory (or Model) and the Unified
Growth Theory are fundamentally incorrect. Descriptions of the past
socio-economic conditions are not questioned. They might have been harsh,
difficult and primitive but they are not reflected in the growth trajectories.
They did not create stagnation in the economic growth and in the growth of
population. Likewise, impacts of the Industrial Revolution on many aspects of
life are not questioned. It is only demonstrated that this event had absolutely
no impact on shaping growth trajectories. A general law of growth is formulated
and used to explain the mechanism of growth of human population and of economic
growth. The growth was predominantly hyperbolic. Such a growth is described by
exceptionally simple mathematical function and the explanation of the mechanism
of growth turns out to be also simple.
