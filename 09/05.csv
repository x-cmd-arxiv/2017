that is applicable to stiff ordinary differential equations and nonlinear
evolution equations with time-irregular coefficients. In the finite-dimensional
case, we consider Carath\'eodory type functions satisfying a one-sided
Lipschitz condition. After investigating the well-posedness and the stability
properties of the randomized scheme, we prove the convergence to the exact
solution with a rate of $0.5$ in the root-mean-square norm assuming only that
the coefficient function is square integrable with respect to the temporal
parameter.
  These results are then extended to the numerical solution of
infinite-dimensional evolution equations under monotonicity and Lipschitz
conditions. Here we consider a combination of the randomized backward Euler
scheme with a Galerkin finite element method. We obtain error estimates that
correspond to the regularity of the exact solution. The practicability of the
randomized scheme is also illustrated through several numerical experiments.

a recent quasi-particle description of hot QCD equation of state where the
medium effects have been encoded in effective gluon and quark/anti-quark
momentum distributions that posses non-trivial energy dispersions. The
anisotropic distribution functions are obtained in a straightforward the way by
stretching or squeezing the isotropic ones along one of the directions. The
gluon self-energy is computed using these distribution functions in a
linearized transport equation with Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collisional
kernel. Further, the tensor decomposition of gluon self-energy leads to the
structure functions which eventually controls the dispersion relations and the
collective mode structure of the medium. It has been seen that both the medium
effects and collisions induce appreciable modifications to the collective modes

processes, the experiments continually strive to increase the expected signal
yields. In the case of the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC, the luminosity
is raised by increasing the number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions,
so-called pile-up. This increases the expected yields of signal and background
processes alike. The signal is embedded in a large background of processes that
mimic that of signal events. It is therefore imperative for the experiments to
develop new triggering methods to effectively distinguish the interesting
events from the background. We present a comparison of two methods for
filtering detector hits to be used for triggering on particle tracks: one based
on a pattern matching technique using Associative Memory (AM) chips and the
other based on the Hough transform. Their efficiency and hit rejection are
evaluated for proton-proton collisions with varying amounts of pile-up using a
simulation of a generic silicon tracking detector. It is found that, while both
methods are feasible options for an efficient track trigger, the AM based
pattern matching produces a lower number of hit combinations with respect to
the Hough transform whilst keeping more of the true signal hits. We also
present the effect on the two methods when increasing the amount of support
material in the detector and introducing inefficiencies by deactivating
detector modules. The increased support material has negligible effects on the
efficiency for both methods, while dropping 5% (10%) of the available modules
decreases the efficiency to about 95% (87%) for both methods, irrespectively of
the amount of pile-up.

SDSS imaging to CALIFA Integral Field Spectroscopy datacubes for a sample of
219 galaxies. This analysis reveals an enhancement of the central SFR and
specific SFR (sSFR $=$ SFR/$M_{\star}$) in barred galaxies. Along the Main
Sequence, we find more massive galaxies in total have undergone efficient
suppression (quenching) of their star formation, in agreement with many
studies. We discover that more massive disks have had their star formation
quenched as well. We evaluate which mechanisms might be responsible for this
quenching process. The presence of type-2 AGNs plays a role at damping the sSFR
in bulges and less efficiently in disks. Also, the decrease in the sSFR of the
disk component becomes more noticeable for stellar masses around 10$^{10.5}$
M$_{\odot}$; for bulges, it is already present at $\sim$10$^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$.
The analysis of the line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) for
the bulge component and of the corresponding Faber-Jackson relation shows that
AGNs tend to have slightly higher $\sigma$ values than star-forming galaxies
for the same mass. Finally, the impact of environment is evaluated by means of
the projected galaxy density, $\Sigma$$_{5}$. We find that the SFR of both
bulges and disks decreases in intermediate-to-high density environments. This
work reflects the potential of combining IFS data with 2D multi-component
decompositions to shed light on the processes that regulate the SFR.

potential of exploiting the richness in both physical interactions and
substrate geometries to create new types of crystallographic defects, which
have strong connections with the design of crystalline materials.

of the stellar component of a galaxy disc formed in the APOSTLE cosmological
hydrody- namical simulations. Some of these gradients resemble those in the
Milky Way, where they have sometimes been interpreted as due to internal
evolution, such as scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration
driven by spiral patterns, or orbital reso- nances with a bar. Secular
processes play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral
or bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual
enrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into
stars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by
the feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and
equilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous
disc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little
after birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at
the time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity
dispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than
the importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would
result from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical
gradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.
Such radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of
the parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular
evolutionary processes.

new domains with far fewer labeled examples by a process called fine-tuning.
This has the advantage that representations learned in the large source domain
can be exploited on smaller target domains. However, networks designed to be
optimal for the source task are often prohibitively large for the target task.
In this work we address the compression of networks after domain transfer.
  We focus on compression algorithms based on low-rank matrix decomposition.
Existing methods base compression solely on learned network weights and ignore
the statistics of network activations. We show that domain transfer leads to
large shifts in network activations and that it is desirable to take this into
account when compressing. We demonstrate that considering activation statistics
when compressing weights leads to a rank-constrained regression problem with a
closed-form solution. Because our method takes into account the target domain,
it can more optimally remove the redundancy in the weights. Experiments show
that our Domain Adaptive Low Rank (DALR) method significantly outperforms
existing low-rank compression techniques. With our approach, the fc6 layer of
VGG19 can be compressed more than 4x more than using truncated SVD alone --
with only a minor or no loss in accuracy. When applied to domain-transferred
networks it allows for compression down to only 5-20% of the original number of
parameters with only a minor drop in performance.

have an effect on other units. This assumption is violated in interference
problems, where new types of spillover causal effects arise, and causal
inference becomes much more difficult. In addition, interference introduces a
unique complication where variables may transmit treatment influences to each
other, which is a relationship that has some features of a causal one, but is
symmetric. In settings where a natural causal ordering on variables is not
available, addressing this complication using statistical inference methods
based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) leads to conceptual difficulties. In
this paper, we develop a new approach to decomposing the spillover effect into
unit-specific components that extends the DAG based treatment decomposition
approach to mediation of Robins and Richardson. We give conditions for these
components of the spillover effect to be identified in a natural type of causal
model that permits stable symmetric relations among outcomes induced by a
process in equilibrium. We discuss statistical inference for identified
components of the spillover effect, including a maximum likelihood estimator,
and a doubly robust estimator for the special case of two interacting outcomes.

We obtain an outer bound (achievability) for any caching ratio by
memory-sharing between these corner points. Thus, the outer bound is also a

the X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei. To use it properly, the bin
size of the light curves should be as short as possible, provided the average
counts in the light curve bins are larger than $\sim 200$. We apply the FFP
method to the 2013, simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the
Seyfert galaxy MCG$-$6-30-15, in the 0.3-40 keV range. The FFPs above $\sim
1.6$ keV are well-described by a straight line. This result rules out spectral
slope variations and the hypothesis of absorption driven variability. Our
results are fully consistent with a power-law component varying in
normalization only, with a spectral slope of $\sim 2$, plus a variable,
relativistic reflection arising from the inner accretion disc around a rotating
black hole. We also detect spectral components which remain constant over $\sim
4.5$ days (at least). At energies above $\sim 1.5$ keV, the stable component is
consistent with reflection from distant, neutral material. The constant
component at low energies is consistent with a blackbody spectrum of $kT_{\rm
BB} \sim 100$ eV. The fluxes of these components are $\sim 10-20\%$ of the
average continuum flux (in the respective bands). They should always be
included in the models that are used to fit the spectrum of the source. The
FFPs below 1.6 keV are non-linear, which could be due to the variable warm
absorber in this source.

large set of medium-size simulations is used to test the sink particle

the most metal-rich cluster (${\rm [Fe/H]}\simeq0.4$) known in the Milky Way.
By performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including spiral arms
and a bar, we found that it is plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin
disc or in the bulge, and later displaced by radial migration to its current
orbit. We apply different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct $N$-body

through different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8 Gyr journey
moving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive, $M_0 \geq

initial mass in the stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this

analyze other characteristics of the potential. We apply our framework to
evaluate the diameters of flat regions suitable for slow-roll inflation, which
unifies, corrects and extends several forms of ""axion alignment"" previously

dense cores for $\gtrsim$ 0.5 Myr including the effects of turbulence,
radiation transfer, and both radiation and outflow feedback from forming
protostars. We show that outflows drive and maintain turbulence in the core
environment even with strong initial fields. The star-formation efficiency
decreases with increasing field strength, and the final efficiencies are
$15-40$\%. The Stage 0 lifetime, during which the protostellar mass is less
than the dense envelope, increases proportionally with the initial magnetic
field strength and ranges from $\sim 0.1-0.4$ Myr. The average accretion rate
is well-represented by a tapered turbulent core model, which is a function of
the final protostellar mass and is independent of the magnetic field strength.
By tagging material launched in the outflow, we demonstrate that the outflow
entrains about $3$ times the actual launched gas mass, a ratio that remains
roughly constant in time regardless of the initial magnetic field strength.
However, turbulent driving increases for stronger fields since momentum is more
efficiently imparted to non-outflow material. The protostellar outflow momentum
is highest during the first 0.1 Myr and declines thereafter by a factor of
$\gtrsim 10$ as the accretion rate diminishes.

a significance improvement varying between 2 and 8. This is in addition to any

sensitive to isoscalar pairing. Pairing correlations are also key in
neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. We find a simple relation
between the centroid energy and width of the $^{48}$Ca DGT giant resonance and
%the value of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix element. More
generally, we observe a very good linear correlation between the DGT transition
to the ground state of the final nucleus and the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay matrix
element. The correlation, which originates on the dominant short-range
character of both transitions, extends to heavier systems including several
$\beta\beta$ emitters, and also holds in energy-density functional results. Our
findings suggest that DGT experiments can be a very valuable tool to obtain
information on the value of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements.

accounting for the extinction curve shape, a log-normal distribution of

measure an extinction curve with $R_{475} = A_{475}/(A_{475}-A_{814})$ = 2.65

of published Milky Way $R_{V}$ = 3.1 ($R_{475} = 1.83$) and SMC Bar $R_{V}$ =

to inflation, but within a quantum field theory of both geometry and matter,
quantum fluctuations of a homogeneous background geometry become the seeds of
cosmological inhomogeneities. We find approximately scale-invariant initial

applied to Kochen-Specker (KS) type scenarios that goes beyond the

noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities in this generalized framework by
applying the assumption of (Spekkens) noncontextuality to both preparations and
measurements. The resulting framework goes beyond the CSW framework, both
conceptually and technically. On the conceptual level: 1) we relax the
assumption of outcome determinism inherent to the Kochen-Specker theorem but
retain measurement noncontextuality, besides introducing preparation
noncontextuality, 2) we do not require the exclusivity principle as a
fundamental constraint on measurement events, and 3) as a result, we do not
need to presume that measurement events of interest are ""sharp"", where the
notion of sharpness implies the exclusivity principle. On the technical level:
1) we introduce a source events hypergraph and define a new operational
quantity ${\rm Corr}$ appearing in our inequalities, 2) we define a new
hypergraph invariant -- the weighted max-predictability -- that is necessary
for our analysis and appears in our inequalities, and 3) our noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities quantify tradeoff relations between three
operational quantities -- ${\rm Corr}$, $R$, and $p_0$ -- only one of which
(namely, $R$) corresponds to the Bell-Kochen-Specker functionals appearing in
the CSW framework; when ${\rm Corr}=1$, the inequalities formally reduce to CSW
type bounds on $R$. Along the way, we also consider in detail the scope of our
framework vis-\`a-vis the CSW framework, particularly the role of Specker's
principle in the CSW framework and its absence in ours.

thought to reflect the demise of the dynamo that operated in its liquid core.
The dynamo was probably powered by planetary cooling and so its termination is
intimately tied to the thermochemical evolution and present-day physical state
of the Martian core. Bottom-up growth of a solid inner core, the
crystallization regime for Earth's core, has been found to produce a long-lived
dynamo leading to the suggestion that the Martian core remains entirely liquid
to this day. Motivated by the experimentally-determined increase in the Fe-S
liquidus temperature with decreasing pressure at Martian core conditions, we
investigate whether Mars' core could crystallize from the top down. We focus on
the ""iron snow"" regime, where newly-formed solid consists of pure Fe and is
therefore heavier than the liquid. We derive global energy and entropy
equations that describe the long-timescale thermal and magnetic history of the
core from a general theory for two-phase, two-component liquid mixtures,
assuming that the snow zone is in phase equilibrium and that all solid falls
out of the layer and remelts at each timestep. Formation of snow zones occurs
for a wide range of interior and thermal properties and depends critically on
the initial sulfur concentration, x0. Release of gravitational energy and
latent heat during growth of the snow zone do not generate sufficient entropy
to restart the dynamo unless the snow zone occupies at least 400 km of the
core. Snow zones can be 1.5-2 Gyrs old, though thermal stratification of the
uppermost core, not included in our model, likely delays onset. Models that
match the available magnetic and geodetic constraints have x0~10% and snow
zones that occupy approximately the top 100 km of the present-day Martian core.

the MHD flow are a good candidate to convert the Poynting flux into the kinetic

the jet is unstable to helical perturbations of its body. However, the growth
rate of these modes is suppressed when the poloidal component of the magnetic
field has a vanishing gradient, which may be the actual case for a realistic
configuration. Here we show that, if the magnetised plasma is confined into a
limited region by the pressure of some external medium, the velocity shear at
the contact surface excites unstable modes which can affect a significant
fraction of the jet's body. We find that when the Lorentz factor of the jet is
$\Gamma\sim10$ ($\Gamma\sim 100$), these perturbations typically develop after
propagating along the jet for tens (hundreds) of jet's radii. Surface modes may
therefore play an important role in converting the energy of the jet from the
Poynting flux to the kinetic energy of the plasma, particularly in AGN. The
scaling of the dispersion relation with (i) the angular velocity of the field

allows for concatenating them in time using one frequency band/channel. This
results in a zero-sidelobe region around the mainlobe and an adjacent region of

in the zero-sidelobe region on either side of the mainlobe, while
quasi-orthogonality of the two chips keeps the adjacent region of
cross-correlations small. Such codes are constructed using discrete

$\Delta_{rad}$ has a large reflection symmetry group $Z_2^{\oplus

relations for solving nonlinear and linear operator equations in Hilbert
spaces. First, the concepts of Hadamard and Nashed are recalled which are
appropriate for linear operator equations. For nonlinear operator equations,
stable respective unstable solvability is considered, and the properties of
local well-posedness and ill-posedness are investigated. Those two concepts
consider stability in image space and solution space, respectively, and both
seem to be appropriate concepts for nonlinear operators which are not onto
and/or not, locally or globally, injective. Several example situations for
nonlinear problems are considered, including the prominent autoconvolution
problems and other quadratic equations in Hilbert spaces.
  It turns out that for linear operator equations, well-posedness and
ill-posedness are global properties valid for all possible solutions,
respectively. The special role of the nullspace is pointed out in this case.
  Finally, non-injectivity also causes differences in the saturation behavior
of Tikhonov and Lavrentiev regularization of linear ill-posed equations. This
is examined at the end of this study.

parameters for each class above that measure how close an arbitrary channel is

classical capacity in terms of functions of the approximation parameters, as
well as an outer bound on the dynamic capacity region of a quantum channel.
Since these parameters are defined in terms of the diamond distance, the upper

exhibit the usefulness of our method with two example channels: a convex
mixture of amplitude damping and depolarizing noise, and a composition of
amplitude damping and dephasing noise. For both channels, our bounds perform
well in certain regimes of the noise parameters in comparison to a recently
derived SDP upper bound on the classical capacity. Along the way, we define the
notion of a generalized channel divergence (which includes the diamond distance

the goal of estimating simplex-constraint sparse vectors from compressed
measurements. To this end, we recast the problem of MMSE estimation (w.r.t. a
pre-defined uniform input distribution) as the problem of computing the
centroid of some polytope that results from the intersection of the simplex and
an affine subspace determined by the measurements. Owing to the specific
structure, it is shown that the centroid can be computed analytically by
extending a recent result that facilitates the volume computation of polytopes
via Laplace transformations. A main insight of this paper is that the desired
volume and centroid computations can be performed by a classical deep neural
network comprising threshold functions, rectified linear (ReLU) and rectified
polynomial (ReP) activation functions. The proposed construction of a deep
neural network for sparse recovery is completely analytic so that
time-consuming training procedures are not necessary. Furthermore, we show that
the number of layers in our construction is equal to the number of measurements
which might enable novel low-latency sparse recovery algorithms for a larger
class of signals than that assumed in this paper. To assess the applicability
of the proposed uniform input distribution, we showcase the recovery
performance on samples that are soft-classification vectors generated by two
standard datasets. As both volume and centroid computation are known to be
computationally hard, the network width grows exponentially in the worst-case.
It can be, however, decreased by inducing sparse connectivity in the neural
network via a well-suited basis of the affine subspace. Finally, the presented
analytical construction may serve as a viable initialization to be further
optimized and trained using particular input datasets at hand.

harmonic amplitudes have been measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm

results are reported in terms of multiparticle correlation observables dubbed
Symmetric Cumulants. These observables are robust against biases originating
from nonflow effects. The centrality dependence of correlations between the
higher order harmonics (the quadrangular $v_4$ and pentagonal $v_5$ flow) and
the lower order harmonics (the elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ flow) is
presented. The transverse momentum dependences of correlations between $v_3$
and $v_2$ and between $v_4$ and $v_2$ are also reported. The results are
compared to calculations from viscous hydrodynamics and A Multi-Phase Transport
({AMPT}) model calculations. The comparisons to viscous hydrodynamic models
demonstrate that the different order harmonic correlations respond differently
to the initial conditions and the temperature dependence of the ratio of shear
viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$). A small average value of $\eta/s$ is
favored independent of the specific choice of initial conditions in the models.
The calculations with the AMPT initial conditions yield results closest to the
measurements. Correlations between the magnitudes of $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$
show moderate $p_{\rm T}$ dependence in mid-central collisions. This might be
an indication of possible viscous corrections to the equilibrium distribution
at hadronic freeze-out, which might help to understand the possible
contribution of bulk viscosity in the hadronic phase of the system. Together
with existing measurements of individual flow harmonics, the presented results
provide further constraints on the initial conditions and the transport
properties of the system produced in heavy-ion collisions.

with the upshot that generic equations in a C-class can be solved without

being first integrals, all results exhibiting C-classes that we are aware of
are based on the fact that a canonical Cartan geometry associated to the
equations in the class descends to the space of solutions. For sufficiently low
orders, these geometries belong to the class of parabolic geometries and the
results follow from the general characterization of geometries descending to a
twistor space.
  In this article we answer the question of whether a canonical Cartan geometry
descends to the space of solutions in the case of scalar ODEs of order at least
four and of systems of ODEs of order at least three. As in the lower order
cases, this is characterized by the vanishing of the generalized Wilczynski
invariants, which are defined via the linearization at a solution. The
canonical Cartan geometries (which are not parabolic geometries) are a slight
variation of those available in the literature based on a recent general
construction. All the verifications needed to apply this construction for the
classes of ODEs we study are carried out in the article, which thus also
provides a complete alternative proof for the existence of canonical Cartan
connections associated to higher order (systems of) ODEs.

imaging and particle tracking at the boundary opposite the impactor, we
observed that a visible structure and particle flow at the boundary occur with
a delay after impact. We show the delay time is about the same time as the the
strong stress response, confirming that the strong stress response results from
deformation of the dynamically jammed structure once it spans between the
impactor and a solid boundary. A characterization of this strong stress
response is reported in a companion paper (arXiv:1407.0719). We also elaborate
on the structure of the dynamically jammed region once it spans from the
impactor to a solid boundary. We observed particle flow in the outer part of
the dynamically jammed region at the bottom boundary, with a net transverse
displacement of up to about 5\% of the impactor displacement, indicating shear
at the boundary. Direct imaging of the surface of the outer part of the
dynamically jammed region reveals a change in surface structure that appears
the same as the result of dilation in other cornstarch suspensions. Imaging
also reveals cracks, like a brittle solid. These observations suggest the
dynamically jammed structure can temporarily support stress according to an
effective modulus, like a soil or dense granular material, along a network of
frictional contacts between the impactor and solid boundary.

transfer presumption between light an mechanics, the full optomechanical

techniques. Furthermore, with only a small number of measurements, our method
can be used to witness nonclassical features of mechanical systems without

galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction
decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction
exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number

psychosociological parameter values, thereby positioning biotechnology as a
proximate threat to human civilization. For an ensemble of civilizations having
some median calculated survival time, the model predicts that, after 80 times

Optimal design problems for an abstracted network are more amenable to
efficient optimization algorithms. From the implementation point of view,
maintaining such networks are usually more favorable and cost effective due to
their reduced communication requirements across a network. Therefore,
approximating a given dense linear consensus network by a suitable abstract

determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton for
many different kinds of analyses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). xFitter
version 2.0.0 has recently been released, and offers an expanded set of tools
and options. It incorporates experimental data from a wide range of experiments
including fixed-target, Tevatron, HERA, and LHC. xFitter can analyze this data
up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in perturbation theory with a
variety of theoretical calculations including numerous methodological options
for carrying out PDF fits and plotting tools which help visualize the results.
While primarily based on the collinear factorization foundation, xFitter also
provides facilities for fits of dipole models and transverse-momentum dependent
(TMD) PDFs. The package can be used to study the impact of new precise
measurements from hadron colliders, and also assess the impact of future
colliders. This paper provides a brief overview of xFitter with emphasis of the
new version 2.0.0 features.

Fredman, Sedgewick, Sleator, and Tarjan. It is remarkable both for its
simplicity and for its excellent performance in practice. The ""magic"" of
pairing heaps lies in the restructuring that happens after the deletion of the
smallest item. The resulting collection of trees is consolidated in two rounds:
a left-to-right pairing round, followed by a right-to-left accumulation round.
Fredman et al. showed, via an elegant correspondence to splay trees, that in a
pairing heap of size $n$ all operations take $O(\log{n})$ amortized time. They
also proposed an arguably more natural variant, where both pairing and
accumulation are performed in a combined left-to-right round (called the
forward variant of pairing heaps). The analogy to splaying breaks down in this
case, and the analysis of the forward variant was left open.
  In this paper we show that inserting an item and deleting the minimum in a
forward-variant pairing heap both take amortized time $O(\log{n} \cdot
4^{\sqrt{\log{n}}} )$. This is the first improvement over the $O(\sqrt{n})$
bound showed by Fredman et al. three decades ago. Our analysis relies on a new
potential function that tracks parent-child rank-differences in the heap.

equation governing the propagation of pulses in optical fibers including the
effects of second, third and fourth order dispersion. The stability of this
soliton-like solution with sech2 shape is proven by the sign-definiteness of
the operator and an integral of the Sobolev type. The main criteria governing
the existence of such stable localized pulses propagating in optical fibers are
also formulated. A unique feature of these soliton-like optical pulses
propagating in a fiber with higher order dispersion is that their parameters
satisfy efficient scaling relations. The main soliton solution term given by
perturbation theory is also presented when absorption or gain is included in
the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We anticipate that this type of stable
localized pulses could find practical applications in communications,
slow-light devices and ultrafast lasers.

Taking advantage of the recursive characterization of Droms groups, the proof
consists in separately showing that the solvability of SIP passes through free

most of RAAGs are not Howson, and many (e.g. F_2 x F_2) even have unsolvable

nature. The interaction suppresses quantum coherence and forces the system
towards a steady state. Such dissipative processes are captured by the
paradigmatic spin-boson model, describing a two-state particle, the ""spin"",
interacting with an environment formed by harmonic oscillators. A fundamental
question to date is to what extent intense coherent driving impacts a strongly
dissipative system. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically a
superconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment and
subjected to a coherent drive. This setup realizes the driven Ohmic spin-boson
model. We show that the drive reinforces environmental suppression of quantum
coherence, and that a coherent-to-incoherent transition can be achieved by
tuning the drive amplitude. An out-of-equilibrium detailed balance relation is
demonstrated. These results advance fundamental understanding of open quantum
systems and bear potential for the design of entangled light-matter states.

and Weyl semimetals, we analyze the possibility of analogous fields in
two-dimensional nodal superconductors. We consider the prototypical case of a
d-wave superconductor, a representative of the cuprate family, and find that
the presence of weak strain leads to pseudo-magnetic fields and Landau
quantization of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the low-energy sector. A similar
effect is induced by the presence of generic, weak doping gradients. In
contrast to genuine magnetic fields in superconductors, the strain- and doping
gradient-induced pseudo-magnetic fields couple in a way that preserves
time-reversal symmetry and is not subject to the screening associated with the
Meissner effect. These effects can be probed by tuning weak applied
supercurrents which lead to shifts in the energies of the Landau levels and
hence to quantum oscillations in thermodynamic and transport quantities.

parallax less than 0.1. For the majority of the stars, the best 2D dust
emission-based reddening maps show considerable differences between the
reddening to infinity and the one calculated to the stellar distance using the
barometric law of the dust distribution. This proves that the majority of the
TGAS stars are embedded in to the Galactic dust layer and a proper 3D treatment
of the reddening/extinction is required to reliably calculate their de-reddened
colors and absolute magnitudes. The sources with the 3D estimates of reddening
are tested in their ability to put the stars among the PARSEC and MIST
theoretical isochrones in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram based on the precise
{\it Gaia}, {\it Tycho-2}, 2MASS and {\it WISE} photometry. Only the
reddening/extinction estimates by Arenou et al. (1992), Gontcharov (2012), and
Gontcharov (2017), being appropriate for nearby stars within 280~pc, provide
both the minimal number of outliers bluer than any reasonable isochrone and the

to determine explicitly new families of self-dual potentials for every model.

relativistic corrections to the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (tSZ)
spectrum, which allow to measure the temperature of the intracluster medium. We
remove Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds with a matched filtering
technique, which is validated using simulations with realistic mock data sets.
The extracted spectra show the tSZ signal at high significance and reveal an
additional far-infrared (FIR) excess, which we attribute to thermal emission
from the galaxy clusters themselves. This excess FIR emission from clusters is
accounted for in our spectral model. We are able to measure the tSZ
relativistic corrections at $2.2\sigma$ by constraining the mean temperature of
our cluster sample to $4.4^{+2.1}_{-2.0} \, \mathrm{keV}$. We repeat the same
analysis on a subsample containing only the 100 hottest clusters, for which we
measure the mean temperature to be $6.0^{+3.8}_{-2.9} \, \mathrm{keV}$,
corresponding to $2.0\sigma$. The temperature of the emitting dust grains in
our FIR model is constrained to $\simeq 20 \, \mathrm{K}$, consistent with
previous studies. Control for systematic biases is done by fitting mock
clusters, from which we also show that using the non-relativistic spectrum for
SZ signal extraction will lead to a bias in the integrated Compton parameter
$Y$, which can be up to 14% for the most massive clusters. We conclude by
providing an outlook for the upcoming CCAT-prime telescope, which will improve

time provides a causal, frame-independent, method for computing hadron
spectroscopy and dynamical observables. de Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan (dAFF)
have made an important observation that a mass scale can appear in the
equations of motion without affecting the conformal invariance of the action if
one adds a term to the Hamiltonian proportional to the dilatation operator or
the special conformal operator. If one applies the dAFF procedure to the QCD
light-front Hamiltonian, it leads to a color confining potential $\kappa^4
\zeta^2$ for mesons, where $\zeta^2$ is the LF radial variable conjugate to the
$q \bar q$ invariant mass squared. The same result, including spin terms, is
obtained using light-front holography if one modifies the AdS$_5$ action by the
dilaton $e^{\kappa^2 z^2}$ in the fifth dimension $z$. When one generalizes
this procedure using superconformal algebra, the resulting light-front
eigensolutions provide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and
tetraquarks, including remarkable supersymmetric relations between the masses
of mesons and baryons and a universal Regge slope. The pion $q \bar q$
eigenstate has zero mass at $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations also can be
extended to heavy-light quark mesons and baryons. AdS/QCD also predicts the
analytic form of the nonperturbative running coupling in agreement with the
effective charge measured from measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass
scale underlying hadron masses can be connected to the mass parameter in the
QCD running coupling. The result is an effective coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$
defined at all momenta. One also obtains empirically viable predictions for
spacelike and timelike hadronic form factors, structure functions, distribution
amplitudes, and transverse momentum distributions.

for various natural language processing tasks such as, relational search,
noun-modifier classification and analogy detection. A popular approach to
represent the relations between a pair of words is to extract the patterns in
which the words co-occur with from a corpus, and assign each word-pair a vector
of pattern frequencies. Despite the simplicity of this approach, it suffers
from data sparseness, information scalability and linguistic creativity as the
model is unable to handle previously unseen word pairs in a corpus. In
contrast, a compositional approach for representing relations between words
overcomes these issues by using the attributes of each individual word to
indirectly compose a representation for the common relations that hold between
the two words. This study aims to compare different operations for creating
relation representations from word-level representations. We investigate the
performance of the compositional methods by measuring the relational
similarities using several benchmark datasets for word analogy. Moreover, we
evaluate the different relation representations in a knowledge base completion

boundary layer (BL) that have a duration $\sim 1000$ orbital periods at the
inner radius of the accretion disk. We find the surprising result that angular
momentum piles up in the boundary layer, which results in a rapidly rotating
belt of accreted material at the surface of the star. The angular momentum
stored in this belt increases monotonically in time, which implies that angular
momentum transport mechanisms in the BL are inefficient and do not couple the
accretion disk to the star. This is in spite of the fact that magnetic fields
are advected into the BL from the disk and supersonic shear instabilities in
the BL excite acoustic waves. In our simulations, these waves only carry a
small fraction ($\sim 10 \%$) of the angular momentum required for steady state
accretion. Using analytical theory and 2D viscous simulations in the $R-\phi$
plane, we derive an analytical criterion for belt formation to occur in the BL
in terms of the ratio of the viscosity in the accretion disk to the viscosity
in the BL. Our MHD simulations have a dimensionless viscosity ($\alpha$) in the

of those words. Consequently, numerous prior work on word embedding learning
have used co-occurrences between two words as the training signal for learning
word embeddings. However, in natural language texts it is common for multiple
words to be related and co-occurring in the same context. We extend the notion
of co-occurrences to cover $k(\geq\!\!2)$-way co-occurrences among a set of
$k$-words. Specifically, we prove a theoretical relationship between the joint
probability of $k(\geq\!\!2)$ words, and the sum of $\ell_2$ norms of their
embeddings. Next, we propose a learning objective motivated by our theoretical
result that utilises $k$-way co-occurrences for learning word embeddings. Our
experimental results show that the derived theoretical relationship does indeed
hold empirically, and despite data sparsity, for some smaller $k$ values,
$k$-way embeddings perform comparably or better than $2$-way embeddings in a

proposed by incorporating the unscented Kalman filter into the NMPC problem,

additive noise from disturbances forward in time. The feasibility is maintained
through probabilistic constraints based on the Gaussian approximations of the

and mobility (assumed proportional to the square of Fermi velocity) which
explains well the magnitude and temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity.
We find that the hole mobility is about $7$ times larger than the electron
mobility. In addition, we find that the electron mobility decreases
significantly with increasing temperature, suggesting electron-phonon
scattering strongly limits the room temperature mobility.

counterparts due to the fact that leveraging multiple independent and
complementary information from multi-view feature spaces outperforms the single

agreement over their local manifold structures by seeking
eigenvalue-eigenvector decompositions. However, as we observed, such classical
paradigm still suffers from (1) overlooking the flexible local manifold
structure, caused by (2) enforcing the low-rank data correlation agreement
among all views; worse still, (3) LRR is not intuitively flexible to capture
the latent data clustering structures. In this paper, we present the structured
LRR by factorizing into the latent low-dimensional data-cluster
representations, which characterize the data clustering structure for each
view. Upon such representation, (b) the laplacian regularizer is imposed to be
capable of preserving the flexible local manifold structure for each view. (c)
We present an iterative multi-view agreement strategy by minimizing the
divergence objective among all factorized latent data-cluster representations
during each iteration of optimization process, where such latent representation
from each view serves to regulate those from other views, such intuitive
process iteratively coordinates all views to be agreeable. (d) We remark that
such data-cluster representation can flexibly encode the data clustering
structure from any view with adaptive input cluster number. To this end, (e) a
novel non-convex objective function is proposed via the efficient alternating
minimization strategy. The complexity analysis are also presented. The
extensive experiments conducted against the real-world multi-view datasets

views. Other types of fraud exist that involve multiple UI states and are
performed dynamically while users interact with the app. Such dynamic

state transition graphs and collects their associated runtime network traffics,
which are then leveraged to check against a set of heuristic-based rules for
identifying ad fraudulent behaviours. We show empirically that FraudDroid
detects ad frauds with a high precision (93%) and recall (92%). Experimental
results further show that FraudDroid is capable of detecting ad frauds across
the spectrum of fraud types. By analysing 12,000 ad-supported Android apps,
FraudDroid identified 335 cases of fraud associated with 20 ad networks that

estimated parameters of the erupting prominence from a model of radio

simultaneously induce a large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction

the drastic increase of the iDMI value with the rising tW. The maximum iDMI of

algorithms substantially reduces the computation cost of the original PGD for
the $\ell^{0}$ sparse approximation problem, and the resultant sub-optimal
solution still enjoys provable suboptimality, namely, the sub-optimal solution
to the reduced problem still has bounded gap to the globally optimal solution

data into clusters or classes according to the pairwise similarity between the
data, and the pairwise similarity is crucial for their performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel discriminative similarity learning framework which
learns discriminative similarity for either data clustering or semi-supervised
learning. The proposed framework learns classifier from each hypothetical
labeling, and searches for the optimal labeling by minimizing the
generalization error of the learned classifiers associated with the
hypothetical labeling. Kernel classifier is employed in our framework. By
generalization analysis via Rademacher complexity, the generalization error
bound for the kernel classifier learned from hypothetical labeling is expressed
as the sum of pairwise similarity between the data from different classes,
parameterized by the weights of the kernel classifier. Such pairwise similarity
serves as the discriminative similarity for the purpose of clustering and
semi-supervised learning, and discriminative similarity with similar form can
also be induced by the integrated squared error bound for kernel density
classification. Based on the discriminative similarity induced by the kernel
classifier, we propose new clustering and semi-supervised learning methods.

target, and encapsulates both the energy content and the beam quality. High
brightness lasers requires that both parameters be maximised, yet standard
laser cavities do not allow this. For example, in solid-state lasers multimode
beams have a high energy content but low beam quality, while Gaussian modes
have a small mode volume and hence low energy extraction, but in a good quality
mode. Here we over- come this fundamental limitation and demonstrate an optimal
approach to realising high brightness lasers. We employ intra- cavity beam
shaping to produce a Gaussian mode that carries all the energy of the multimode

This work will have a significant influence on the design of future high

type of recreational motion planning problem, similar to Sokoban, that involve
moving a `robot' on a square grid with $1 \times 1$ obstacles. The obstacles
cannot be traversed by the robot, but some can be pushed and pulled by the
robot into adjacent squares. Thin walls prevent movement between two adjacent
squares. This work follows in a long line of algorithms and complexity work on

action (e.g., push or pull) can be inverted by another valid action (e.g., pull
or push).

vision and network analytics. A widely used method for hypergraph partitioning
relies on minimizing a normalized sum of the costs of partitioning hyperedges
across clusters. Algorithmic solutions based on this approach assume that
different partitions of a hyperedge incur the same cost. However, this
assumption fails to leverage the fact that different subsets of vertices within
the same hyperedge may have different structural importance. We hence propose a
new hypergraph clustering technique, termed inhomogeneous hypergraph
partitioning, which assigns different costs to different hyperedge cuts. We
prove that inhomogeneous partitioning produces a quadratic approximation to the
optimal solution if the inhomogeneous costs satisfy submodularity constraints.
Moreover, we demonstrate that inhomogenous partitioning offers significant

editing. However, existing techniques typically combine all the example
deformation modes, which can lead to overfitting, i.e. using a overly
complicated model to explain the user-specified deformation. This leads to
implausible or unstable deformation results, including unexpected global
changes outside the region of interest. To address this fundamental limitation,
we propose a sparse blending method that automatically selects a smaller number
of deformation modes to compactly describe the desired deformation. This along
with a suitably chosen deformation basis including spatially localized
deformation modes leads to significant advantages, including more meaningful,
reliable, and efficient deformations because fewer and localized deformation
modes are applied. To cope with large rotations, we develop a simple but
effective representation based on polar decomposition of deformation gradients,
which resolves the ambiguity of large global rotations using an
as-consistent-as-possible global optimization. This simple representation has a
closed form solution for derivatives, making it efficient for sparse localized
representation and thus ensuring interactive performance. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven mesh deformation
methods, for both quality of results and efficiency.

the effects are investigated during 80 x-ray flares in the period 2013-2017.
For the investigation nine mid-latitude SuperDARN radars of the northern
hemisphere and Ekaterinburg coherent decameter radar of ISTP SB RAS are used.
All the radars work in the same 8-20MHz frequency band and have similar
hardware and software. During the analysis the temporal dynamics of noise from
each of the radar direction and for each flare is investigated separately. As a
result, on the basis of about 13000 daily measurements we found a strong
anticorrelation between noise power and x-ray flare intensity, that allows to
use short-wave sky noise to diagnose the ionospheric effects of x-ray solar
flares. It is shown that in 88.3\% of cases an attenuation of daytime decameter
radio noise is observed during solar flare, correlating with the temporal
dynamics of the solar flare. The intensity of decameter noise anticorrelates
well (the Pearson correlation coefficient better than -0.5) with the shape of
the X-ray flare in the daytime (for solar elevation angle $>0$) in 33\% of
cases, the average Pearson correlation over the daytime is about -0.34. Median
regression coefficient between GOES 0.1-0.8nm x-ray intensity and daytime
sky-noise attenuation is about $-4.4\cdot10^{4}\ [dB\cdot m^{2}/Wt]$. Thus, it
has been shown that measurements of the decameter sky noise level at
midlatitude decameter radars can be used to study the ionospheric absorption of
high-frequency waves in the lower ionosphere during x-ray solar flares. This
can be explained by the assumption that the most part of decameter sky noise
detected by the radars can be interpreted as produced by ground sources at
distances of the first propagation hop (\textasciitilde{} 3000 km).

effectively exploit this redundancy in a dense LiDAR mapping problem. In this
paper, we present a new approach for dense LiDAR mapping using probabilistic

This is achieved by a proposed probabilistic surfel fusion along with a
geometry considered data association. The proposed surfel data association
method considers surface resolution as well as high measurement uncertainty
along its beam direction which enables the mapping system to be able to control
surface resolution without introducing spatial digitization. The proposed
fusion method successfully suppresses the map noise level by considering
measurement noise caused by laser beam incident angle and depth distance in a
Bayesian filtering framework. Experimental results with simulated and real data
for the dense surfel mapping prove the ability of the proposed method to
accurately find the canonical form of the environment without further
post-processing.

valence state to the twisted kink. Fermion density is spread out over the whole
space due to the massless pion field. The result can be pictured as a composite
of a twisted kink (carrying energy, but no fermion number) and a partial
winding of the chiral spiral (carrying fermion number, but no energy). This
solves at the same time the puzzle of missing baryons with fermion number
$N_f<N$ in the massless NJL$_2$ model.

been conjectured. However, the abundance of dark matter halos outside our

a wide range of virial parameters and magnetic field strengths. Comparing the
outcomes of our simulations to observations, we find that simulations remaining
close to virial balance throughout their history produce star formation
efficiencies and initial mass function (IMF) peaks that are stable in time and
in reasonable agreement with observations. Our results indicate that
small-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide a
feedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency. This is true
regardless of whether the balance is maintained by input of energy from large
scale forcing or by strong magnetic fields that inhibit collapse. In contrast,
simulations that leave virial balance and undergo runaway collapse form stars
too efficiently and produce an IMF that becomes increasingly top-heavy with
time. In all cases we find that the competition between magnetic flux advection
toward the protostar and outward advection due to magnetic interchange
instabilities, and the competition between turbulent amplification and
reconnection close to newly-formed protostars renders the local magnetic field
structure insensitive to the strength of the large-scale field, ensuring that
radiation is always more important than magnetic support in setting the
fragmentation scale and thus the IMF peak mass. The statistics of multiple
stellar systems are similarly insensitive to variations in the initial
conditions and generally agree with observations within the range of
statistical uncertainty.

Cooperative Positioning (ICP) algorithm that exploits the Vehicle-to-Vehicle
(V2V) connectivity in an innovative manner, avoiding the use of explicit V2V
measurements such as ranging. In the ICP approach, vehicles jointly localize
non-cooperative physical features (such as people, traffic lights or inactive
cars) in the surrounding areas, and use them as common noisy reference points
to refine their location estimates. Information on sensed features are fused
through V2V links by a consensus procedure, nested within a message passing
algorithm, to enhance the vehicle localization accuracy. As positioning does
not rely on explicit ranging information between vehicles, the proposed ICP
method is amenable to implementation with off-the-shelf vehicular communication
hardware. The localization algorithm is validated in different traffic
scenarios, including a crossroad area with heterogeneous conditions in terms of
feature density and V2V connectivity, as well as a real urban area by using
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) for traffic data generation. Performance
results show that the proposed ICP method can significantly improve the vehicle
location accuracy compared to the stand-alone GNSS, especially in harsh
environments, such as in urban canyons, where the GNSS signal is highly

gas to freeze-out onto dust grains forming ice mantles, which influences the
chemical composition of a cloud. The aim of this paper is to understand in
detail the depletion (and desorption) of CO on (from) interstellar dust grains.
Experimental simulations were performed under two different (astrophysically
relevant) conditions. In parallel, Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were used to
mimic the experimental conditions. In our experiments, CO molecules accrete
onto water ice at temperatures below 27 K, with a deposition rate that does not
depend on the substrate temperature. During the warm-up phase, the desorption
processes do exhibit subtle differences indicating the presence of weakly bound
CO molecules, therefore highlighting a low diffusion efficiency. IR
measurements following the ice thickness during the TPD confirm that diffusion
occurs at temperatures close to the desorption. Applied to astrophysical
conditions, in a pre-stellar core, the binding energies of CO molecules,
ranging between 300 K and 850 K, depend on the conditions at which CO has been
deposited. Because of this wide range of binding energies, the depletion of CO
as a function of AV is much less important than initially thought. The weakly
bound molecules, easily released into the gas phase through evaporation, change
the balance between accretion and desorption, which result in a larger
abundance of CO at high extinctions. In addition, weakly bound CO molecules are
also be more mobile, and this could increase the reactivity within interstellar
ices.

near jamming, allowing to get exact predictions in high dimensions for more
complex systems. Our method enables to define an effective potential (or TAP
free energy), namely a coarse-grained functional depending on the contact
forces and the effective gaps between the particles. The derivation is
performed up to the third order, with a particular emphasis on the role of
third order corrections to the TAP free energy. These corrections, irrelevant
in a mean-field framework in the thermodynamic limit, might instead play a
fundamental role when considering finite-size effects. We also study the
typical behavior of the forces and we show that two kinds of corrections can
occur. The first contribution arises since the system is analyzed at a finite
distance from jamming, while the second one is due to finite-size corrections.
In our analysis, third order contributions vanish in the jamming limit, both
for the potential and the generalized forces, in agreement with the argument
proposed by Wyart and coworkers invoking isostaticity. Finally, we analyze the
scalings emerging close to the jamming line, which define a crossover regime

developed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in view of the Run2 data taking
period at the Large Hadron Collider. The improvements of the algorithms used in
2015 and 2016 data analyses with respect to previous data taking periods are
discussed, as well as the ongoing developments in view of the next years of
data taking. The measurements of the performance of the algorithms on data as
well as the dedicated techniques for the identification of heavy flavor jets in
events with boosted topologies are also presented. Finally, the effectiveness
of heavy flavor jet identification in the complex environment expected during
the high luminosity LHC phase is discussed.

constraint on the effective actions fixes the covariant effective actions at
each order of $\alpha'$ up to field redefinitions and up to an overall factor.
Inspired by these results, we speculate that the $D$-dimensional effective
actions at any order of $\alpha'$ must be consistent with the standard Buscher
rules provided that one uses covariant field redefinitions in the corresponding
reduced $(D-1)$-dimensional effective actions. This constraint may be used to
find effective actions at all higher orders of $\alpha'$.

challenging, can pave way for novel applications in multimedia. We propose
SketchParse, the first deep-network architecture for fully automatic parsing of
freehand object sketches. SketchParse is configured as a two-level fully
convolutional network. The first level contains shared layers common to all
object categories. The second level contains a number of expert sub-networks.
Each expert specializes in parsing sketches from object categories which
contain structurally similar parts. Effectively, the two-level configuration
enables our architecture to scale up efficiently as additional categories are
added. We introduce a router layer which (i) relays sketch features from shared
layers to the correct expert (ii) eliminates the need to manually specify
object category during inference. To bypass laborious part-level annotation, we
sketchify photos from semantic object-part image datasets and use them for
training. Our architecture also incorporates object pose prediction as a novel
auxiliary task which boosts overall performance while providing supplementary
information regarding the sketch. We demonstrate SketchParse's abilities (i) on
two challenging large-scale sketch datasets (ii) in parsing unseen,
semantically related object categories (iii) in improving fine-grained
sketch-based image retrieval. As a novel application, we also outline how
SketchParse's output can be used to generate caption-style descriptions for
hand-drawn sketches.

to the independent propagation of photoinduced holons and doublons. The
spectral weight just below the Mott gap increases with decreasing the on-site
Coulomb interaction $U$. We find that the next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb
interaction $V_1$ enhances this $U$ dependence, indicating the presence of
biexcitonic contributions formed by two holon-doublon pairs. Photo-pumping in
hole-doped systems also induces spectral weights below remnant Mott-gap
excitations, being consistent with recent experiments. The induced weights are
less sensitive to $V_1$ and may be related to the formation of a biexcitonic
state in the presence of hole carriers.

linear combinations of independent, latent, single-output Gaussian processes
(GPs). This resulted in cross-covariance functions with limited parametric
interpretation, thus conflicting with the ability of single-output GPs to
understand lengthscales, frequencies and magnitudes to name a few. On the
contrary, current approaches to MOGP are able to better interpret the
relationship between different channels by directly modelling the
cross-covariances as a spectral mixture kernel with a phase shift. We extend
this rationale and propose a parametric family of complex-valued cross-spectral
densities and then build on Cram\'er's Theorem (the multivariate version of
Bochner's Theorem) to provide a principled approach to design multivariate
covariance functions. The so-constructed kernels are able to model delays among
channels in addition to phase differences and are thus more expressive than
previous methods, while also providing full parametric interpretation of the
relationship across channels. The proposed method is first validated on
synthetic data and then compared to existing MOGP methods on two real-world
examples.

One of motivating applications is time-series classification, where features
reflecting some local closeness measure between a time series and a pattern
sequence called shapelet are useful. Despite the empirical success of such
approaches using local features, the generalization ability of resulting
hypotheses is not fully understood and previous work relies on a bunch of
heuristics. In this paper, we formulate a class of hypotheses using local
features, where the richness of features is controlled by kernels. We derive
generalization bounds of sparse ensembles over the class which is exponentially
better than a standard analysis in terms of the number of possible local
features. The resulting optimization problem is well suited to the boosting
approach and the weak learning problem is formulated as a DC program, for which
practical algorithms exist. In preliminary experiments on time-series data
sets, our method achieves competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art
algorithms with small parameter-tuning cost.

similarity computation is a key ingredient. Although novel methods are
continuously introduced, little has been done to evaluate these methods
together with large-scale query log analysis. Consequently, how far have these
methods brought us in answering real-user queries is unclear. Given baseline
methods that compute cross-media similarity using relatively simple text/image
matching, how much progress have advanced models made is also unclear. This
paper takes a pragmatic approach to answering the two questions. Queries are
automatically categorized according to the proposed query visualness measure,
and later connected to the evaluation of multiple cross-media similarity models
on three test sets. Such a connection reveals that the success of the
state-of-the-art is mainly attributed to their good performance on
visual-oriented queries, while these queries account for only a small part of
real-user queries. To quantify the current progress, we propose a simple
text2image method, representing a novel test query by a set of images selected
from large-scale query log. Consequently, computing cross-media similarity
between the test query and a given image boils down to comparing the visual
similarity between the given image and the selected images. Image retrieval
experiments on the challenging Clickture dataset show that the proposed
text2image compares favorably to recent deep learning based alternatives.

distributed \emph{first order} methods for minimization of a sum of nodes'
local convex costs over a generic, connected network. With the idling
mechanism, each node $i$, at each iteration $k$, is active -- updates its
solution estimate and exchanges messages with its network neighborhood -- with
probability $p_k$, and it stays idle with probability $1-p_k$, while the
activations are independent both across nodes and across iterations. In this
paper, we demonstrate that the idling mechanism can be successfully
incorporated in \emph{distributed second order methods} also. Specifically, we
apply the idling mechanism to the recently proposed Distributed Quasi Newton
method (DQN). We first show theoretically that, when $p_k$ grows to one across
iterations in a controlled manner, DQN with idling exhibits very similar
theoretical convergence and convergence rates properties as the standard DQN
method, thus achieving the same order of convergence rate (R-linear) as the
standard DQN, but with significantly cheaper updates. Simulation examples
confirm the benefits of incorporating the idling mechanism, demonstrate the
method's flexibility with respect to the choice of the $p_k$'s, and compare the

sharing knowledge in a way similar to the concept of using a book. The recorded
information in the form of a book is the main means by which humans learn
knowledge. Nevertheless, the conventional deep RL methods have mainly focused
either on experiential learning where the agent learns through interactions
with the environment from the start or on imitation learning that tries to
mimic the teacher. Contrary to these, our proposed book learning shares key
information among different agents in a book-like manner by delving into the
following two characteristic features: (1) By defining the linguistic function,
input states can be clustered semantically into a relatively small number of
core clusters, which are forwarded to other RL agents in a prescribed manner.
(2) By defining state priorities and the contents for recording, core
experiences can be selected and stored in a small container. We call this
container as `BOOK'. Our method learns hundreds to thousand times faster than
the conventional methods by learning only a handful of core cluster
information, which shows that deep RL agents can effectively learn through the
shared knowledge from other agents.

power function around zero and by a step function elsewhere. For this type of

where network functions are virtualized and decoupled from proprietary

Network Functions (VNFs) as a service chain to process traffic demands. Traffic
fluctuations in Large-scale DataCenters (LDCs) could result in overload and
underload phenomena in service chains. In this paper, we propose a distributed
approach based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to jointly
load balance the traffic and horizontally scale up and down VNFs in LDCs with
minimum deployment and forwarding costs. Initially we formulate the targeted
optimization problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which
is NP-complete. Secondly, we relax it into two Linear Programming (LP) models
to cope with over and underloaded service chains. In the case of small or
medium size datacenters, LP models could be run in a central fashion with a low
time complexity. However, in LDCs, increasing the number of LP variables
results in additional time consumption in the central algorithm. To mitigate
this, our study proposes a distributed approach based on ADMM. The
effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is validated in different scenarios.

communication industries. With a widely growing adoption rate, SIP is an
application layer signaling protocol, standardized by the IETF, for creating,
modifying, and terminating VoIP sessions. Generally speaking, SIP routes a call
request to its destination by using SIP proxies. With the increasing use of
SIP, traditional configurations pose certain drawbacks, such as ineffective
routing, un-optimized management of proxy resources (including CPU and memory),
and overload conditions. This paper presents OpenSIP to upgrade the SIP network
framework with emerging technologies, such as SDN and NFV. SDN provides for
management that decouples the data and control planes along with a
software-based centralized control that results in effective routing and
resource management. Moreover, NFV assists SDN by virtualizing various network
devices and functions. However, current SDN elements limit the inspected fields
to layer 2-4 headers, whereas SIP routing information resides in the layer-7
header. A benefit of OpenSIP is that it enforces policies on SIP networking
that are agnostic to higher layers with the aid of a Deep Packet Inspection
(DPI) engine. Among the benefits of OpenSIP is programmability, cost reduction,
unified management, routing, as well as efficient load balancing. The present
study implements OpenSIP on a real testbed which includes Open vSwitch and the
Floodlight controller. The results show that the proposed architecture has a
low overhead and satisfactory performance and, in addition, can take advantage
of a flexible scale-out design during application deployment.

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into a symmetric formation of regular polygon
shape surrounding a mobile target. The proposed controller works for
time-varying information exchange topologies among agents and preserves a
network connectivity while steering UAVs into a formation. The proposed
nonlinear controller is highly generalized and offers flexibility in achieving
the control objective due to the freedom of choosing controller parameters from
a range of values. By the virtue of additional tuning parameters, i.e.
fractional powers on proportional and derivative difference terms, the
nonlinear controller procures a family of UAV trajectories satisfying the same
control objective. An appropriate adjustment of the parameters facilitates in
generating smooth UAV trajectories without causing abrupt position jumps. The
convergence of the closed-loop system is analyzed and established using the
Lyapunov approach. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed controller which outperforms an existing formation controller by
driving a team of UAVs elegantly in a target-centric formation. We also present
a nonlinear observer to estimate vehicle velocities with the availability of
position coordinates and heading angles. Simulation results show that the

assume that either the source or the destination is equipped with a large-scale

antenna. To prevent the untrusted relay from intercepting the source message,
the destination sends an intended jamming noise to the relay, which is referred
to as destination-based cooperative jamming (DBCJ). Given this system model,
novel closed-form expressions are presented in the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the secrecy outage
probability (SOP). We further improve the secrecy performance of the system by
optimizing the associated hardware design. The results reveal that by
beneficially distributing the tolerable hardware imperfections across the
transmission and reception radio-frequency (RF) front ends of each node, the
system's secrecy rate may be improved. The engineering insight is that equally
sharing the total imperfections at the relay between the transmitter and the
receiver provides the best secrecy performance. Numerical results illustrate
that the proposed OPA together with the most appropriate hardware design
significantly increases the secrecy rate.

several advantages, including sensitivity to the sky over a very wide

loops on a surface $M$. A stabilization of $\alpha$ is a surgery that results
in attaching a handle to $M$ along disks avoiding $\alpha$, and the inverse
operation is a destabilization of $\alpha$. We consider virtual $n$-strings up
to virtual homotopy, i.e., sequences of stabilizations, destabilizations, and
homotopies of $\alpha$.
  Recently, Cahn proved that any virtual $1$-string can be virtually homotoped
to a genus-minimal and crossing-minimal representative by monotonically
decreasing both genus and the number of self-intersections. We generalize her
result to the case of connected non-parallel $n$-strings.
  Cahn also proved that any two crossing-irreducible representatives of a
virtual $1$-string are related by Type 3 moves, stabilizations, and
destabilizations. Kadokami claimed that this held for virtual $n$-strings in

Kadokami's statement holds for connected non-parallel $n$-strings and exhibit a

proposed to enhance the physical layer security of a cooperative network, where
a multiple antennas source communicates with a single-antenna destination in
presence of untrusted relays and passive eavesdroppers (Eves). The objective is
to protect the data confidentially while concurrently relying on the untrusted
relays as potential Eves to improve both the security and reliability of the
network. To realize this objective, we consider cooperative jamming performed
by the destination while JRP scheme is implemented. With the aim of maximizing
the instantaneous secrecy rate, we derive a new closed-form solution for the
optimal power allocation and propose a simple relay selection criterion under
two scenarios of non-colluding Eves (NCE) and colluding Eves (CE). For the
proposed scheme, a new closed-form expression is derived for the ergodic
secrecy rate (ESR) and the secrecy outage probability as security metrics, and
a new closed-form expression is presented for the average symbol error rate
(SER) as a reliability measure over Rayleigh fading channels. We further
explicitly characterize the high signal-to-noise ratio slope and power offset
of the ESR to highlight the impacts of system parameters on the ESR. In
addition, we examine the diversity order of the proposed scheme to reveal the
achievable secrecy performance advantage. Finally, the secrecy and reliability
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the optimized network are provided.
Numerical results highlight that the ESR performance of the proposed JRP scheme
for NCE and CE cases is increased with respect to the number of untrustworthy
relays.

derivatives resp. differences were successfully applied for image restoration.
There are several ways to incorporate the derivatives of first and second order
into the prior, for example additive coupling or using infimal convolution
(IC), as well as the more general model of total generalized variation (TGV).
The later two methods give also decompositions of the restored images into
image components with distinct ""smoothness"" properties which are useful in
applications.
  This paper is the first attempt to generalize these models to manifold-valued
images. We propose both extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. The extrinsic
approach is based on embedding the manifold into an Euclidean space of higher
dimension. Models following this approach can be formulated within the
Euclidean space with a constraint restricting them to the manifold. Then
alternating direction methods of multipliers can be employed for finding
minima. However, the components within the infimal convolution or total
generalized variation decomposition live in the embedding space rather than on
the manifold which makes their interpretation difficult. Therefore we also
investigate two intrinsic approaches. For manifolds which are Lie groups we
propose three priors which exploit the group operation, an additive one,
another with IC coupling and a third TGV like one. For computing the minimizers
of the intrinsic models we apply gradient descent algorithms. For general
Riemannian manifolds we further define a model for infimal convolution based on
the recently developed second order differences.
  We demonstrate by numerical examples that our approaches works well for the
circle, the 2-sphere, the rotation group, and the manifold of positive definite
matrices with the affine invariant metric.

Then, the comparison between the Hubble diagrams may be used as a way for
distinguishing between different cosmological scenarios. But that is not always
the case because there is no guarantee that two different models always have
different Hubble diagrams. It may be possible for two physically-inequivalent
models to have the same Hubble diagrams. In that case, the Hubble diagram
cannot be used to differentiate between two models and it is necessary to find
another way to distinguish between them. Therefore, the question of whether two
different scenarios are distinguishable by using the Hubble diagrams is an
important question which would not have an obvious answer. The Jordan and
Einstein frames of $f(R)$ theories of gravity are inequivalent, provided that
the metricity condition holds in both frames. In the present paper it is argued
that if the time-variation of particle masses in the Einstein frame is taken
into consideration, the Hubble diagram derived practically from type Ia
supernova surveys does not enable us to differentiate between these two frames.
Nevertheless, we show that by waiting long enough to measure the change in
Hubble diagram it is possible to differentiate between two frames. In other
words, the Hubble diagram cannot be employed alone to differentiate between two
frames but comparison between the rates of changes in Hubble diagrams can
provide a way to do so.

observed line surface brightness ratios of the OH$^+$ and ArH$^+$ transitions
seen in the SPIRE FTS frequency range can only be explained with both a high
cosmic ray ionization rate and a reduced ArH$^+$ dissociative recombination
rate compared to that used by previous authors, although consistent with
experimental upper limits. We find that the ArH$^+$/OH$^+$ line strengths and
the observed H$_2$ vibration-rotation emission can be reproduced by model
filaments with $n_{\rm{H}} = 2 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $\zeta = 10^7 \zeta_0$
and visual extinctions within the range found for dusty globules in the Crab
Nebula, although far-infrared emission from [O I] and [C II] is higher than the
observational constraints. Models with $n_{\rm{H}} = 1900$ cm$^{-3}$
underpredict the H$_2$ surface brightness, but agree with the ArH$^+$ and
OH$^+$ surface brightnesses and predict [O I] and [C II] line ratios consistent
with observations. These models predict HeH$^+$ rotational emission above
detection thresholds, but consideration of the formation timescale suggests
that the abundance of this molecule in the Crab Nebula should be lower than the

exactly for the flow and the locomotion speed of a spherical swimmer located in
a spherically symmetric system of two Newtonian fluids whose boundary moves

decay, and the impact of both the viscosity ratio and the degree of confinement
on the locomotion speed of the model swimmer. The spatial decay of the flow
retains the same power-law decay as for locomotion in a single fluid but with a
decreased magnitude. Independently of the assumption chosen to characterise the
impact of confinement on the actuation applied by the swimmer, its locomotion
speed always decreases with an increase in the degree of confinement. Our
modelling results suggest that a low-viscosity region of at least six times the

exploit the energy hidden in pressure, we present some new
$\varepsilon$-regularity criteria for suitable weak solutions of the 3D
Navier-Stokes equations at one scale: for any $p,q\in [1,\infty]$ satisfying
$1\leq 2/q+3/p <2$, there exists an absolute positive constant $\varepsilon$
such that $u\in L^{\infty}(Q(1/2))$ if
  $$\|u\|_{L^{p,q}(Q(1))}+\|\Pi\|_{L^{1 }(Q(1))}<\varepsilon.$$ This is an
improvement of corresponding results recently proved by Guevara and Phuc in [7,
Calc. Var. 56:68, 2017]. As an application of these $\varepsilon$-regularity
criteria, we improve the known upper box dimension of the possible interior
singular set of suitable weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes system from
$975/758(\approx1.286)$ [28] to $2400/1903 (\approx1.261)$.

version 2.1 of the Google cluster trace that shows short-term (1 second) task
CPU usage. Contrary to the assumptions taken by many theoretical studies, we
demonstrate that the empirical distributions do not follow any single
distribution. However, high percentiles of the total processor usage (summed
over at least 10 tasks) can be reasonably estimated by the Gaussian
distribution. We use this result for a probabilistic fit test, called the
Gaussian Percentile Approximation (GPA), for standard bin-packing algorithms.
To check whether a new task will fit into a machine, GPA checks whether the
resulting distribution's percentile corresponding to the requested service
level objective, SLO is still below the machine's capacity. In our simulation
experiments, GPA resulted in colocations exceeding the machines' capacity with
a frequency similar to the requested SLO.

concentrated on the shaping of circumstellar matter, with some significant new
results, like the observations of wide jets launched from binary systems. In
the meeting The Impact of Binaries on Stellar Evolution (ESO Garching, July
3-7, 2017), both in the opening and the summary talks the speakers mentioned
that ""Textbooks need most likely to be rewritten"". I made my point that some
new chapters were already written, although researchers do not read them but
rather keep referring to the `old textbooks'. For example, too many speakers
and authors keep referring only to the single degenerate and double degenerate
scenarios for the progenitors of SNe Ia. Researchers must refer also to the
`new textbook chapter' on the core degenerate (CD) scenario. Other examples
involve the role of jets. Jets lead to a new evolutionary phase, that of the
grazing envelope evolution (GEE), that should be considered alongside the older
ones, e.g., the common envelope evolution, Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and wind
mass loss and accretion. I discuss how the GEE can solve some puzzling binary
systems. We should also consider the role of jets as an extra energy source to
remove the common envelope and in powering intermediate luminosity optical
transients (ILOTs). One strong advantage of jets is that in many cases they
operate through a negative feedback mechanism, hence preventing the need for a
fine tuning. The operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) connects also
binary evolution to explosion of massive stars as core collapse supernovae.

generally, as state and control paths are contingent on uncertainties, we

Functional Theory. Three examples (A = Ag, Li and K) are studied with a
sequence of different approximate exchange-correlation functionals. Starting
from a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), an extension to include van
der Waals interactions and a recently proposed meta-GGA are considered. Then
local Coulomb interactions for the Mn $3d$ electrons are more explicitly
considered with the DFT+$U$ approach. Finally selected results from a hybrid
functional approach provide a reference. Results for the binding energy of the
A species in the parent oxide highlight the role of van der Waals interactions.
Relatively accurate results for insertion energies can be achieved with a low
$U$ and a high $U$ approach. In the low $U$ case, the materials are described
as band metals with a high symmetry, tetragonal crystal structure. In the high
$U$ case, the electrons donated by A result in formation of local Mn$^{3+}$
centers and corresponding Jahn-Teller distortions characterized by a local
order parameter. The resulting degree of monoclinic distortion depends on
charge ordering and magnetic interactions in the phase formed. The reference
hybrid functional results show charge localization and ordering. Comparison to
low temperature experiments of related compounds suggests that charge
localization is the physically correct result for the hollandite group oxides

opacity source in the atmosphere of cool white dwarfs. It results in a
significant flux depletion in the near-IR and IR parts of their spectra.
Because of the extreme conditions of helium-rich atmospheres (where the density
can be as high as a few g/cm$^3$), this opacity source is expected to undergo
strong pressure distortion and the currently used opacities have not been
validated at such extreme conditions. To check the distortion of the CIA
opacity we applied state-of-the-art ab initio methods of computational quantum
chemistry to simulate the CIA opacity at high densities. The results show that
the CIA profiles are significantly distorted above densities of $0.1\,{\rm
g/cm}^3$ in a way that is not captured by the existing models. The
roto-translational band is enhanced and shifted to higher frequencies as an
effect of the decrease of the interatomic separation of the H$_2$ molecule. The
vibrational band is blueward shifted and split into $Q_R$ and $Q_P$ branches,
separated by a pronounced interference dip. Its intensity is also substantially
reduced. The distortions result in a shift of the maximum of the absorption
from $2.3\,\mu{\rm m}$ to $3-7 \mu{\rm m}$, which could potentially explain the
spectra of some very cool, helium-rich white dwarfs.

  Image Understanding (Under Review)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following the increasingly popular trend of social interaction analysis in
egocentric vision, this manuscript presents a comprehensive study for automatic
social pattern characterization of a wearable photo-camera user, by relying on
the visual analysis of egocentric photo-streams. The proposed framework
consists of three major steps. The first step is to detect social interactions
of the user where the impact of several social signals on the task is explored.
The detected social events are inspected in the second step for categorization
into different social meetings. These two steps act at event-level where each
potential social event is modeled as a multi-dimensional time-series, whose
dimensions correspond to a set of relevant features for each task, and LSTM is
employed to classify the time-series. The last step of the framework is to
characterize social patterns, which is essentially to infer the diversity and
frequency of the social relations of the user through discovery of recurrences
of the same people across the whole set of social events of the user.
Experimental evaluation over a dataset acquired by 9 users demonstrates
promising results on the task of social pattern characterization from
egocentric photo-streams.

can be a deciding factor for beam stability. We demonstrate that the coherent
tune shifts due to reactive impedances can enhance the space-charge induced
damping and change the stability thresholds (here, a reactive impedance implies
the imaginary part of the impedance of both signs). For example, high damping
rates at strong space-charge, or damping of the $k=0$ mode, can be possible. It
is shown and explained, how the negative reactive impedances (causing negative
coherent tune shifts similarly to the effect of space-charge) can enhance the
Landau damping, while the positive coherent tune shifts have an opposite
effect. It is shown that the damping rate is a function of the coherent mode
position in the incoherent spectrum, in accordance with the concept of the
interaction of a collective mode with resonant particles. We present an
analytical model, which allows for quantitative predictions of damping
thresholds for different head-tail modes, for arbitrary space-charge and
coherent tune-shift conditions, as it is verified using particle tracking
simulations.

(SGD) often incurs steady progression phases, interrupted by catastrophic
episodes in which loss and gradient norm explode. A possible mitigation of such
events is to slow down the learning process. This paper presents a novel
approach to control the SGD learning rate, that uses two statistical tests. The
first one, aimed at fast learning, compares the momentum of the normalized
gradient vectors to that of random unit vectors and accordingly gracefully
increases or decreases the learning rate. The second one is a change point
detection test, aimed at the detection of catastrophic learning episodes; upon
its triggering the learning rate is instantly halved. Both abilities of
speeding up and slowing down the learning rate allows the proposed approach,
called SALeRA, to learn as fast as possible but not faster. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that SALeRA performs well in practice, and compares
favorably to the state of the art.

occurs in a two-step process, with the formation of filaments preceding that of
prestellar cores and stars. Here, we apply the gravo-turbulent fragmentation
theory of Hennebelle & Chabrier 08, 09, 13 to a filamentary environment, taking
into account magnetic support. We discuss the induced geometrical effect on the
cores, with a transition from 3D geometry at small scales to 1D at large ones.
The model predicts the fragmentation behavior of a filament for a given mass
per unit length (MpL) and level of magnetization. This CMF for individual
filaments is then convolved with the distribution of filaments to obtain the
final system CMF. The model yields two major results: (i) the filamentary
geometry naturally induces a hierarchical fragmentation process, first into
groups of cores, separated by a length equal to a few filament Jeans lengths,
i.e. a few times the filament width. These groups then fragment into individual
cores. (ii) Non-magnetized filaments with high MpL are found to fragment
excessively, at odd with observations. This is resolved by taking into account
the magnetic field treated simply as additional pressure support). The present
theory suggests two complementary modes of star formation: while small
(spherical or filamentary) structures will collapse directly into prestellar
cores, according to the standard Hennebelle-Chabrier theory, the large
(filamentary) ones, the dominant population according to observations, will
follow the afore-described two-step process.

scheme is presented. Through a nearest neighbor approach, the test efficiently
adapts also to non-smooth distributions due to strongly nonlinear dependencies.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the test reliably simulates the null
distribution even for small sample sizes and with high-dimensional conditioning
sets. The test is better calibrated than kernel-based tests utilizing an
analytical approximation of the null distribution, especially for non-smooth
densities, and reaches the same or higher power levels. Combining the local
permutation scheme with the kernel tests leads to better calibration, but
suffers in power. For smaller sample sizes and lower dimensions, the test is
faster than random fourier feature-based kernel tests if the permutation scheme
is (embarrassingly) parallelized, but the runtime increases more sharply with
sample size and dimensionality. Thus, more theoretical research to analytically
approximate the null distribution and speed up the estimation for larger sample

J1553.1+5437 we have found PSR J1552+5437, the first MSP to be discovered

isolated MSP with a 2.43 ms spin period and a dispersion measure of 22.9 pc
cm$^{-3}$. The pulsar has a very steep radio spectral index ($\alpha < -$2.8
$\pm$ 0.4). We obtain a phase-connected timing solution combining the 0.74
years of radio observations with $\gamma$-ray photon arrival times covering 7.5
years of Fermi observations. We find that the radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse
profiles of PSR J1552+5437 appear to be nearly aligned. The very steep spectrum
of PSR J1552+5437, along with other recent discoveries, hints at a population
of radio MSPs that have been missed in surveys using higher observing
frequencies. Detecting such steep spectrum sources is important for mapping the
population of MSPs down to the shortest spin periods, understanding their
emission in comparison to slow pulsars, and quantifying the prospects for
future surveys with low-frequency radio telescopes like SKA-Low and its

pulsar which is now the fastest-spinning neutron star known in the Galactic

LOFAR at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz, well below the 300 MHz to 3
GHz frequencies typically used in pulsar searches. The discovery is part of an
ongoing LOFAR survey targeting unassociated Fermi Large Area Telescope
$\gamma$-ray sources. PSR J0952$-$0607 is in a 6.42-hr orbit around a very
low-mass companion ($M_\mathrm{c}\gtrsim0.02$ M$_\odot$) and we identify a
strongly variable optical source, modulated at the orbital period of the
pulsar, as the binary companion. The light curve of the companion varies by 1.6
mag from $r^\prime=22.2$ at maximum to $r^\prime>23.8$, indicating that it is
irradiated by the pulsar wind. Swift observations place a 3-$\sigma$ upper
limit on the $0.3-10$ keV X-ray luminosity of $L_X < 1.1 \times 10^{31}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ (using the 0.97 kpc distance inferred from the dispersion measure).
Though no eclipses of the radio pulsar are observed, the properties of the
system classify it as a black widow binary. The radio pulsed spectrum of PSR
J0952$-$0607, as determined through flux density measurements at 150 and 350
MHz, is extremely steep with $\alpha\sim-3$ (where $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$).
We discuss the growing evidence that the fastest-spinning radio pulsars have
exceptionally steep radio spectra, as well as the prospects for finding more
sources like PSR J0952$-$0607.

morphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN

which physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk
models were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures
via the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts
for the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found
to be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in
the upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU
for T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally
show brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars
with high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,
generally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main
formation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*
molecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The
model results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the
observed location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced
naturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk
structure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN
emission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of
the disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration,
and could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting. In contrast with
C2H or c-C3H2, the CN flux is not very sensitive to carbon and oxygen
depletion.

new objective function and a new search algorithm to optimize said objective.
These two aspects of alignment are orthogonal, and confounding them makes it
difficult to evaluate them separately. A more systematic approach is needed. To
this end, we bring these two orthogonal issues into sharp focus in two
companion papers. In Part 1 (this paper) we show that simulated annealing, as
implemented by SANA, far outperforms all other existing search algorithms
across a wide range of objectives. Part 2 (our companion paper) then uses SANA
to compare over a dozen objectives in terms of the biology they recover,
demonstrating that some objective functions recover useful biological
information while others do not. We propose that further work should focus on
improving objective functions, with SANA the obvious choice as the search

properties, play a non-trivial role in general relativity, even in the current
context. Finding non-trivial solutions to the Einstein field equations requires
some reduction of the problem, which usually is done by exploiting symmetries
or other properties. Exact solutions of the Einsteins field equations
describing an unhindered gravitational collapse are studied which generally
predict an ultimate singular end-state. In the vicinity of such a spacetime
singularity, the energy densities, spacetime curvatures, and all other physical
quantities blow up. Despite exhaustive attempts over decades, the famous
conjecture that the formation of a singularity during stellar collapse
necessarily accompanies the formation of an event horizon, thereby covering the
central singularity, still remains without a proof. Moreover, there are
examples of stellar collapse models with reasonable matter contribution in
which an event horizon does not form at all, giving rise to a naked singularity
from which both matter and radiation can fall in and come out. These examples
suggest that the so-called cosmic censorship conjecture may not be a general
rule. Therefore one must embark upon analysis of realistic theoretical models
of gravitational collapse and gradually generalizing previous efforts.

obtain the distribution of the substance along the nodes. Two regimes of
functioning of the channels are studied: stationary regime and non-stationary
regime. The distribution of the substance along the nodes of the channel for
the case of stationary regime is a generalization of the Waring distribution
(for channel with infinite number of nodes) or generalization of the truncated
Waring distribution (for channel with finite number of nodes). In the
non-stationary regime of functioning of the channel one observes an exponential
increase or exponential decrease of the amount of substance in the nodes.
Despite this the asymptotic distribution of the substance among the nodes of
the channel in this regime is stationary. The developed theory is applied for a
study of the distrribution of migrants in countries that form migration
channels.

$M$-, and $L$-integrals between two straight dislocations as they have recently
been derived by Agiasofitou and Lazar [Int. J. Eng. Sci. 114 (2017) 16-40].
Special attention is focused on the $M$-integral. The $M$-integral of a single
dislocation in anisotropic elasticity is also derived. The obtained results
reveal the physical interpretation of the $M$-integral (per unit length) of a
single dislocation as the total energy of the dislocation which is the sum of
the self-energy (per unit length) of the dislocation and the dislocation core
energy (per unit length). The latter can be identified with the work produced
by the Peach-Koehler force. It is shown that the dislocation core energy (per
unit length) is twice the corresponding pre-logarithmic energy factor. This
result is valid in isotropic as well as in anisotropic elasticity. The only
difference lies on the pre-logarithmic energy factor which is more complex in
anisotropic elasticity due to the anisotropic energy coefficient tensor which
captures the anisotropy of the material.

received wide attentions due to its good performances. However, when directly
applied to the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the recognition rate
is too low. This is because ELM does not use the spatial information which is
very important for HSI classification. In view of this, this paper proposes a
new framework for spectral-spatial classification of HSI by combining ELM with
loopy belief propagation (LBP). The original ELM is linear, and the nonlinear
ELMs (or Kernel ELMs) are the improvement of linear ELM (LELM). However, based
on lots of experiments and analysis, we found out that the LELM is a better
choice than nonlinear ELM for spectral-spatial classification of HSI.
Furthermore, we exploit the marginal probability distribution that uses the
whole information in the HSI and learn such distribution using the LBP. The
proposed method not only maintain the fast speed of ELM, but also greatly
improves the accuracy of classification. The experimental results in the
well-known HSI data sets, Indian Pines and Pavia University, demonstrate the
good performances of the proposed method.

effectiveness of each method. The effectiveness was quantified as both the time
it took to register the crime as well as the number of relevant unique crime
scene details that were collected. The results show the structured method to be
significantly more efficient than traditional text-based crime reports (p <

this work also discusses more qualitative pros and cons with the novel method,
as well as various data analysis methods that could be used on the registered

agencies in two ways. First, related to increased quality and more elaborate
crime reports. Secondly, related to significant time-savings, which according
to a rough estimate is expect to lie in the range 11-30 full-time positions per
year for Swedish law enforcement agencies, particularly for volume crime
categories. Those resources could instead be used for unburden the workload for
our law enforcement officers, and to some extent free resources that could be

to specify the context in a dedicated specification language, and hold the
